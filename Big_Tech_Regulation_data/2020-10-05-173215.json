Klarna, Europe's biggest fintech start-up, said that since March enquiries from retailers who may want to partner with it jumped by 20per cent on average globally. With 7.9 million U.S. subscribers, Sweden's Klarna has since signed up outdoor gearmaker The North Face, Disney's streaming service and cosmetics retailer Sephora. Most of the growth has been in higher-margin discretionary spend categories such as fashion and fitness gear, said Puneet Dikshit, a McKinsey partner in New York, who expects the sector to generate US$7 billion to US$8 billion in volumes this year in the United States, growing by more than 150per cent annually.

While Afterpay, with bad loans totalling 1per cent of its loan book as of March, changed its requirements so that customers had to pay a quarter of their loan upfront, co-founder Nick Molnar said rejection rates were roughly in line with the start of the year. Molnar said an overwhelming majority of Afterpay customers, whose average transaction value is AUS$150, pay back on time, while loans on new purchases are denied to those who do not. Although some brokerages expect Afterpay to turn a profit by 2022, rising costs to finance expansion and credit losses that eat into receivables are likely to mean BNPLs, which operate on thin margins, remain unprofitable for some time. Klarna saw credit losses more than double in the first three months of the year to about 0.7per cent of underlying sales as it expanded in Europe and the United States, where regulation of the sector is almost non-existent. Only California has said BNPL firms need a license, and fined some for lending without one. In Australia, where the industry first took off on the back of easy funding, the corporate regulator is set to release a follow-up report this year to one it issued in 2018 raising concerns about users becoming overextended and calling for BNPLs to be regulated in line with other credit services. Companies, investors and analysts agree that young people with stimulus money in their wallets are driving sales and BNPL shoppers that Reuters spoke to were all under 35 and bought household items, as well as skin care products and clothes. \"The vast majority of our customers have income levels of under US$75,000, so I would say the majority probably have a stimulus check,\" said Charlie Youakim, CEO of Sezzle, one of the smaller firms. The younger demographic is harder to assess because they lack credit history, meaning most companies use algorithms to run real-time eligibility checks and assess risk of default. \"Our internal engine assesses risk taking various parameters into consideration which also will include consumer payment history, what is being purchased and is combined with varying third-party data sources and authentication solutions,\" Klarna spokeswoman Aoife Houlihan said. Sydney-based Zip, with bad debts of just over 2per cent of receivables, said it assesses shoppers' public information and credit scores. Around one in 100 customers is late with payments each month, spokesman Matthew Abbott said, adding that Zip recently tightened eligibility rules, leading to higher rejection rates.

Browsing online during lockdown, Jessica Friend spotted a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses she liked, but the price tag made the 30-year-old Ohio resident think twice.  What persuaded her to click \u2018buy\u2019, Friend said, was the short-term credit offered by Afterpay, which split the $260 payment into four interest-free instalments.  Afterpay is among a handful of alternative credit firms which offer small loans, mostly to online shoppers, and make their money by charging merchants a 4%-6% commission.  These buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) firms have benefited from a shift to online shopping during the coronavirus crisis in countries including the United States, where state aid has also boosted retail sales.  \u201cI\u2019m more inclined to use them because they make it easier to afford to get the things I want all at once ... and when I want to splurge on something,\u201d Friend said of the loans.  Some investors are now betting shoppers will stay away from stores as coronavirus cases rise again in several countries around the world, boosting business for BNPL firms. | But swelling subscriber numbers may also increase bad loans, mainly among first-time users who are more likely to default.  And as job losses rise and government aid ebbs, the business model will face its first real test in a recession.  \u201cMuch still hinges on any virus second waves and government wherewithal to keep boosting demand,\u201d said Andrew Mitchell of Ophir Asset Management which owns shares in Melbourne-based Afterpay, whose market value has risen to $12.55 billion from over $100 million four years ago.  While a move to online shopping was underway before the pandemic, the shift has accelerated under lockdown and Afterpay signed up more than a million new active U.S. customers between March and early May, taking its overall base there to 9 million.  Meanwhile, retailers desperate to move merchandise have also become more receptive to partnerships with BNPL firms, which unlike credit cards or mortgages, make loans instantly.  Klarna, Europe\u2019s biggest fintech start-up, said that since March enquiries from retailers who may want to partner with it jumped by 20% on average globally.  With 7.9 million U.S. subscribers, Sweden\u2019s Klarna has since signed up outdoor gearmaker The North Face, Disney\u2019s streaming service and cosmetics retailer Sephora.  Most of the growth has been in higher-margin discretionary spend categories such as fashion and fitness gear, said Puneet Dikshit, a McKinsey partner in New York, who expects the sector to generate $7 billion to $8 billion in volumes this year in the United States, growing by more than 150% annually.  Although fears of credit losses sparked a sector-wide sell-off in March, the entry of big tech investors and rising subscriber numbers have since supported a sharp recovery, with stocks now at record highs. | \u2018TURN OFF THE TAPS\u2019  The pandemic forced most companies to tighten their risk settings, which they say may push up loan rejection rates, although Afterpay, Klarna, Zip and Sezzle declined to provide specific numbers.  \u201cBNPL operators can turn off the taps and quickly throttle down growth if repayment risks increase,\u201d Mitchell said.

What persuaded her to click 'buy', Friend said, was the short-term ...</p><p>BENGALURU/MADRID (July 6): Browsing online during lockdown, Jessica Friend spotted a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses she liked, but the price tag made the 30-year-old Ohio resident think twice.    What persuaded her to click 'buy', Friend said, was the short-term credit offered by Afterpay, which split the US$260 payment into four interest-free instalments.    Afterpay is among a handful of alternative credit firms which offer small loans, mostly to online shoppers, and make their money by charging merchants a 4%-6% commission.    These buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) firms have benefited from a shift to online shopping during the coronavirus crisis in countries including the United States, where state aid has also boosted retail sales.    \"I'm more inclined to use them because they make it easier to afford to get the things I want all at once ... and when I want to splurge on something,\" Friend said of the loans.    Some investors are now betting shoppers will stay away from stores as coronavirus cases rise again in several countries around the world, boosting business for BNPL firms.    But swelling subscriber numbers may also increase bad loans, mainly among first-time users who are more likely to default.    And as job losses rise and government aid ebbs, the business model will face its first real test in a recession.    \"Much still hinges on any virus second waves and government wherewithal to keep boosting demand,\" said Andrew Mitchell of Ophir Asset Management which owns shares in Melbourne-based Afterpay, whose market value has risen to $12.55 billion from over $100 million four years ago.    While a move to online shopping was underway before the pandemic, the shift has accelerated under lockdown and Afterpay signed up more than a million new active U.S. customers between March and early May, taking its overall base there to 9 million.    Meanwhile retailers desperate to move merchandise have also become more receptive to partnerships with BNPL firms, which unlike credit cards or mortgages, make loans instantly.    Klarna, Europe's biggest fintech start-up, said that since March enquiries from retailers who may want to partner with it jumped by 20% on average globally.    With 7.9 million U.S. subscribers, Sweden's Klarna has since signed up outdoor gearmaker The North Face, Disney's streaming service and cosmetics retailer Sephora.    Most of the growth has been in higher-margin discretionary spend categories such as fashion and fitness gear, said Puneet Dikshit, a McKinsey partner in New York, who expects the sector to generate US$7 billion to US$8 billion in volumes this year in the United States, growing by more than 150% annually.    Although fears of credit losses sparked a sector-wide sell-off in March, the entry of big tech investors and rising subscriber numbers have since supported a sharp recovery, with stocks now at record highs.   'Turn off the taps'   The pandemic forced most companies to tighten their risk settings, which they say may push up loan rejection rates, although Afterpay, Klarna, Zip and Sezzle declined to provide specific numbers.    \"BNPL operators can turn off the taps and quickly throttle down growth if repayment risks increase,\" Mitchell said.    While Afterpay, with bad loans totalling 1% of its loan book as of March, changed its requirements so that customers had to pay a quarter of their loan upfront, co-founder Nick Molnar said rejection rates were roughly in line with the start of the year.    Molnar said an overwhelming majority of Afterpay customers, whose average transaction value is A$150, pay back on time, while loans on new purchases are denied to those who do not.    Although some brokerages expect Afterpay to turn a profit by 2022, rising costs to finance expansion and credit losses that eat into receivables are likely to mean BNPLs, which operate on thin margins, remain unprofitable for some time.    Klarna saw credit losses more than double in the first three months of the year to about 0.7% of underlying sales as it expanded in Europe and the United States, where regulation of the sector is almost non-existent.    Only California has said BNPL firms need a license, and fined some for lending without one.    In Australia, where the industry first took off on the back of easy funding, the corporate regulator is set to release a follow-up report this year to one it issued in 2018 raising concerns about users becoming overextended and calling for BNPLs to be regulated in line with other credit services.    Companies, investors and analysts agree that young people with stimulus money in their wallets are driving sales and BNPL shoppers that Reuters spoke to were all under 35 and bought household items, as well as skin care products and clothes.    \"The vast majority of our customers have income levels of under US$75,000, so I would say the majority probably have a stimulus check,\" said Charlie Youakim, CEO of Sezzle, one of the smaller firms.    The younger demographic is harder to assess because they lack credit history, meaning most companies use algorithms to run real-time eligibility checks and assess risk of default.    \"Our internal engine assesses risk taking various parameters into consideration which also will include consumer payment history, what is being purchased and is combined with varying third-party data sources and authentication solutions,\" Klarna spokeswoman Aoife Houlihan said.    Sydney-based Zip, with bad debts of just over 2% of receivables, said it assesses shoppers' public information and credit scores.    Around one in 100 customers is late with payments each month, spokesman Matthew Abbott said, adding that Zip recently tightened eligibility rules, leading to higher rejection rates.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42529564336</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6096-58Y1-F07F-83NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1002\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Edge Markets</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 6, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0005T58</classCode><className>SEPHORA SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002F32</classCode><className>MCKINSEY &amp;

The two sectors that fit that are technology, even though it has wobbled lately, and financials.\" The Case for Techs ...nancials  As Subramanian tells Barron's:\"Technology still offers secular[7] and cyclical[8] growth. It is the only sector with net cash[9] on corporate balance sheets[10], and it has become an interesting dividend-growth[11] story.\" </p><p>Nonetheless, she recognizes that there are several risks: it's \"a supercrowded sector and has had a great run;\" it's surpassedfinancials as the sector with the most regulatory risk; and it's a globalized industry that is threatened by trade wars[12].Regarding financial stocks, she notes that their earnings volatility[13] has dropped markedly in recent years. From being the most volatile stocks in 2007, they now are the fourth-safest sector today, in her estimation. She adds that these companies have done much to improve their business models, yet this has gone unrecognized by many investors. This echoes earlier observations by longtime bank analyst Dick Bove, who sees banks entering a golden era, partly due to their adoption of advanced technology.(For more, see also: 4 Reasons Bank Stocks Will Rise Longterm: Bove[14].) Valuation and Performance  Through the close on April 9, the S...00 was downby 2.3% year-to-date, whilethe Nasdaq 100 was up by 1.2%. The S...00 Information Technology Sector Index (S5INFT) has risenby 1.6% YTD, whilethe S...00 Financials Index (SPF) has fallenby2.3%,per S...ow Jones Indices[15]. Subramanian and BofAMerrill Lynch forecast strong gains for the market through the rest of 2018. (For more, see also: Buy Stocks On BIg Sell-Offs, Says Citigroup[16].) Stocks to Watch  Subramanian did not recommend specific stocks in her conversation with Barron's. However, an article in The Wall Street Journal[17]makes the case that Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL[18]) is a bargain at a forward P/E ratio of about 25, given that revenue and earnings are projected to grow at an annualized paceof about 15% to 20% during the next three years. More than 86% of its revenue comes from advertising, mainly related to search queries, in which Google is by far the dominant player. Meanwhile, advertising spending continues to move from older media to the internet, the Journal adds.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has been touting high growth stocks as a market-beating investment strategy. Among the tech stocks in theirbasket are Alphabet, semiconductor maker Micron Technology Inc. (MU[19]), and information technologyconsulting firm DXC Technology Co.(DXC[20]). The latter two stand out for especially low forward P/E ratios of 6 and 12, respectively, and lowPEG ratios[21] of 0.22 each, per Goldman's calculations as of March 15. Goldman projected 25% earnings growth for Alphabet in this report, and estimated its forward P/E as 28, for a PEG ratio of 1.12.Among financials, regional bank holdingcompany Comerica Inc. (CMA[22]), and discount brokers E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC[23]) and Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW[24]) also make Goldman's high growth list. Their respective forward P/E ratios were 15, 17and 23, while their PEG ratios were 0.52, 0.77and 0.85, per the same Goldman report. (For more, see also: 12 Growth Stocks That Will Win Long Term: Goldman[25].) 'Riskiest Bets in Today's Market'  Counterintuitively, Subramanianwarns that supposedly defensive[26], high dividend yield stocks are the riskiest bets in today's market. She tells Barron's,\"Low volatility funds are hugely overweight utilities, telecomand real estate investment trusts[27].\" The problems with these stocks, in her opinion: \"These are three of the most levered[28]sectors in the S...00. Payout ratios[29] are close to 100%, so there is no room to increase dividends, and these companies have almost zero global diversification.\"Also, she adds: \"Ifyou are buying a stock for safety, why does anyonecareabout price volatility? They should care more about earnings.\" She notes that thesethreesectors are among those withthe highest earnings volatility in the S...00, and she expects them to be \"the biggest potential casualties in a bear market[30].\" By contrast, she says that industrial, consumer cyclical, technologyand financial stocks all tend to have \"much less volatile earnings.\" 'High Secular Growth, Limited Earnings'  Subramaniantells Barron's that BofAMerrill Lynch is underweight[31] inconsumer discretionary stocks, whichhave surpassed technology stocks as the most crowded sector. This is largely the result, she says, ofinvestors attemptingto cut their risk by reducing their tech holdings. She observes, however, that \"internet and catalog companies such as Amazon.com [Inc. (AMZN[32])] and Netflix [Inc.

Verizon Wireless, which lands the first-to-market 5G mobile stakes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The No. 1 carrier said it will launch its 5G Ultra Wideband Network in select sections of two cities on April 11: Chicago and Minneapolis. The unlimited data service, built upon Verizon's expansive millimeter wave spectrum holdings, will be available to postpaid customers with unlimited data plans for an additional $10/ month following a complimentary three-month period.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Initially, the ultra-high-speed network can only be accessed via a new 5G modular attachment for Motorola's current Moto Z3 smartphone. The magnetic mod will retail regularly for $350, but can be pre-ordered for $50 for a limited time starting now. Customers can also receive a free Moto Z3 by activating a new line.</p><p>Verizon said it plans to extend the service to more than 30 U.S. cities this year, but will kick things off this month in The Loop section of Chicago and in Downtown Minneapolis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Senate Bill Limits Kids' Data Collection On Tech Devices</emphasis></p><p>The Federal Trade Commission will allow Internet-connected devices, including children's toys and personal assistants, to record and store the voice of a child under 13 without seeking parental permission so long as it is only for the replacement of written words with voice commands in performing search and other functions on those Internet-connected devices and then destroyed ASAP.</p><p>Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), author of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), has joined with Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) to introduce an update to the law that would expand its protections and put new labeling mandates on consumer electronics.</p><p>The bill would prohibit the collection of personal and location information from anyone under 13 without parental consent and from anyone under 16 without the user's consent. It would also create an \"eraser button,\" so parents could delete online info about their kids, as well as a Digital Marketing Bill of Rights for Minors that further limits data collection.</p><p>It would also ban targeted advertising to children, revise COPPA's \"actual knowledge\" standard to a \"constructive knowledge\"; require companies to explain what info they are collecting and how it is used and/or disclosed; require \"robust\" cybersecurity standards for any Internet-connected devices targeted to kids or minors, and require manufacturers of those devices to \"prominently display\" on their packaging a \"privacy dashboard\" outlining how sensitive info is \"collected, transmitted, retained, used, and protected.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Warren Outlines Plan To Cut Amazon, Google, Facebook Down To Size</emphasis></p><p>Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren has made it official. If she is elected, she will try to break up Facebook, Amazon and Google, including by imposing \"utility-style\" regulation and adopting a form of edge net neutrality.</p><p>\"[M]y administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition - including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google,\" Warren wrote in outlining her plans to go after Big Tech.</p><p>Her plan is to designate large tech companies as \"Platform Utilities\" and \"broken apart from any participant on that platform.\" For example, she said \"Amazon Marketplace, Google's ad exchange and Google Search would be platform utilities under this law. Therefore, Amazon Marketplace and Basics, and Google's ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart. Google Search would have to be spun off as well.\"</p><p>\"Nearly half of all e-commerce goes through Amazon. More than 70 percent of all Internet traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Google or Facebook,\" Warren wrote. \"Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.</p><p>\"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.

It also greatly limited most forms of legal immigration for workers to the US, because, after all, there's an election issue he needs to flog, regardless of near-universal opposition[2] from the business community. The restrictions will only apply to new applicants; legal migrants already in the US would not be affected. Yet.The new restrictions would apply to a wide range of work visas, most notably the H1-B visa program that allows hiring skilled employees, largely in technology fields. It would also freeze H-4 visas, which go to spouses of foreign workers, and L visas, which allow companies to transfer international employees, often executives, to work in their US operations. </p><p>In addition, the order would suspend most H2-B visas for seasonal workers, like landscapers and restaurant workers, and J visas for \"cultural exchange\" workers like camp counselors and au pairs. Exceptions would be allowed for seasonal agricultural workers, as well as for medical workers who are directly involved in care and research related to COVID-19. We're betting that once Trump realizes he's just banned seasonal workers from his own hotels and resorts, he'll find a national-security reason to exempt them, too. As the New York Times notes,[3] the restrictions on legal immigrant workers are a longtime dream of Trump's immigration sturmbannf\u00fchrer Stephen Miller, who was calling for a purge of foreign workers even before the coronavirus pandemic. The piece notes that Trump and Miller had originally wanted to end virtually all immigration, full stop, back in April, because what a convenient excuse, but \"bowed to pressure from the business community to avoid imposing limits on the worker visas,\" at least until now. Most business interests, from big tech companies to the far-rightwing US Chamber of Commerce, said the visa restrictions would be far more likely to slow the economic recovery from the coronavirus shutdown than to boost American jobs. Chamber President Thomas Donohue told [4]the Washington Post,\"Putting up a 'not welcome' sign for engineers, executives, IT experts, doctors, nurses and other workers won't help our country, it will hold us back,\" said Chamber President Thomas Donohue. \"Restrictive changes to our nation's immigration system will push investment and economic activity abroad, slow growth, and reduce job creation.\" We are particularly in love with Reuters this morning, for its framing[5] of comments by an unnamed \"senior administration official\" who briefed reporters in a conference call yesterday, claiming the visa restrictions would create 525,000 job openings for American workers: The official, who did not explain how the administration arrived at that figure, said the move was geared at \"getting Americans back to work as quickly as possible.\" The Reuters piece also notes the official said freezing green cards \"freed up roughly 50,000 jobs for Americans, but did not provide details.\" That's good skeptical reporting, thank you very much. The whole premise that restricting foreign workers will create half a million jobs for Americans is deeply flawed, which is to say, pure bullshit, as actual experts on labor and immigration pointed out to Reuters: Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, estimated that the new ruling would block 219,000 foreign workers through the rest of the year. [...] \"The administration is making the assumption that these companies did not already look at the U.S. labor market, which most of them do before they get involved in a complicated process of trying to bring in foreign workers.\"Mitch Wexler, a managing partner at law firm Fragomen, said the order would hurt his social media and wireless communications clients and other tech companies.Employers \"wouldn't pay a lot of money to file these applications and hire lawyers like me if they could hire an American for these positions,\" he said.But don't worry, with the work visas gone, the firms will have no choice but to hire whatever Americans they can scrape up, unless of course they can't. A study released last fall[6] found restricting H1-B visas didn't lead to more hiring of US workers. Instead, the restrictions meant companies just moved more operations to their non-US locations, so they could hire the workers they wanted. Foreign affiliate employment increased as a direct response to increasingly stringent restrictions on H-1B visas. This effect is driven on the extensive and intensive side; firms were more likely to open new foreign affiliates abroad in response, and employment increased at existing foreign affiliates. The effect is strongest among R&amp;#38;D-intensive firms in industries where services could more easily be offshored. Hooray for Donald Trump's plan to save the American economy by shooting it in the foot and driving more jobs out of the country! Reuters points out[7] that the \"immediate effects\" of the new restrictions may be limited, since most US visa offices at embassies and consulates around the world are still closed because of coronavirus concerns. In addition to hurting the economy with these new restrictions, the Washington Post reports[8], the administration is also rolling out another measure aimed at increasing pain for people who fled persecution and violence in their home countries. As with Reuters, bonus points to WaPo for pointing out just how insane that is: Trump administration officials also said Monday that they would issue new regulations denying work authorization to asylum seekers with pending claims for one year, arguing that the humanitarian program is being exploited by migrants seeking better work opportunities in the United States. Administration officials have not said how asylum applicants will be expected to support themselves financially while they await a court decision. Well if if we make asylum-seekers unable to support themselves, they'll clearly be drags on the economy, so maybe we can just deport them as undesirables! Yet another creative solution from the Trump administration where as ever, the cruelty is the point.[9] [Reuters [10]/ NYT [11]/ WaPo [12]/ Forbes[13]]Yr Wonkette is supported entirely by reader donations.

But this year I have a goal: to move away from WhatsApp and use Telegram instead. As one of the largest messaging networks in the world, WhatsApp - with over 1.5-billion users - has become a convenient way to contact and communicate with just about anyone. But it is owned by Facebook, which has proved it is not able to store personal information without exploiting it, selling it, data-mining it. So why should I trust it with my personal messaging?</p><p>For a year I've resisted doing anything about it, because WhatsApp is the path of least resistance for messaging. Everyone is on it. It's convenient. And it's very good software, with some handy features, especially for group communication. It's like smoking. Everyone knows it's bad for you, but it took decades of lung cancer and other illnesses to finally convince the world that cigarettes are evil. WhatsApp is the cigarette of the internet. We have to give it up.</p><p>Why am I being so paranoid? Because Facebook has shown that it doesn't hold our data sacred and it is willing to share it with its advertisers to ultimately monetise us.</p><p>WhatsApp's remaining co-founder, Brian Acton, left Facebook last year - forgoing $850m in earnings - and immediately afterwards adverts began appearing in the Stories section.</p><p>Despite assurances that it wouldn't combine phone numbers from WhatsApp, Facebook did that. WhatsApp was ordered by French privacy watchdog CNIL in December 2017 to stop sharing data with Facebook, while in 2016 German and UK regulators ordered Facebook to stop collecting WhatsApp data. In 2017 the European Commission fined Facebook \u20ac110m for &amp; providing incorrect or misleading information&amp; by claiming it was unable to delink Facebook and WhatsApp profiles when it could.</p><p>In December Facebook was sued by the attorney-general of the District of Columbia in the US for the Cambridge Analytica saga, and it's unlikely there won't be enormous consequences for its breaking of a 2011 agreement with regulator FTC to inform users of future data breaches.</p><p>A leopard can't change its spots. Like a big cat predator, Facebook is at the top of the food chain, not just as the largest social network but in terms of advertising and communication reach. Late last year yet another damning New York Times expos\u00e9 revealed how Facebook gave unbelievable access to the big tech firms to help grow the social network. &amp; Facebook also allowed Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada to read, write and delete users' private messages,&amp; it reported, despite them saying they never asked for such access.</p><p>Walt Mossberg, the doyen of tech journalists, publicly abandoned Facebook &amp; because my own values and the policies and actions of Facebook have diverged to the point where I'm no longer comfortable here&amp; The two best alternatives to WhatsApp are Telegram and Signal. I'll be writing about them next week.</p><p>Shapshak is editor-in-chief and publisher of Stuff magazine (stuff.co.za)</p><p>WhatsApp's owner, Facebook, is, like a big cat predator, unable to change its spots</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLFM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLFM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V6W-XWV1-JCB2-W16J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"537\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

Before he could vacate his grand office overlooking the courtyard, the outgoing Bank of England governor had to address a crisis threatening to eclipse the one a decade earlier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The previous day, one of the world's most important bond markets, US treasuries, had seized up, and stock markets suffered their biggest one-day fall since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Investors were selling everything, even usually rock-solid US government bonds, in a dash for cash as the realisation dawned of the economic damage that might be wreaked by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Inside the Bank, alarm bells were ringing over the UK government bond market - gilts. \"By Friday 13th we were hearing 'You'll be next' warnings from anxious funds,\" said Andrew Hauser, who runs the Bank's market operations.</p><p>By the time Andrew Bailey officially started work the following Monday as the Bank's new governor, the US Federal Reserve had made a stunning Sunday night intervention, cutting interest rates and pledging to buy $500bn (about \u00a3400bn) of bonds.</p><p>This was just one effort by policymakers to stem the panic that gripped global markets in late February, eventually forcing Boris Johnson to shut down the UK economy on March 23.</p><p>It has been three months like no other inside the Bank of England and the Treasury, where officials have fought to keep markets alive and stave off what is expected to be the worst economic collapse in three centuries.</p><p>When Rishi Sunak, just weeks into his new role as chancellor, delivered his first budget on March 11, he promised the government was \"doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure\". The following days tested that pledge, while the coming months and years will demonstrate to what extent the policies adopted by the Treasury and the Bank will cushion the blow to the economy. The emergency measures devised have not been seen before in peace or war - and their job is far from done.</p><p>So extreme is the position that the governor is now considering whether Britain needs to be able to use negative interest rates - an extraordinary situation, where saving is discouraged - after unleashing a \u00a3300bn stimulus through additional bond-buying in the quantitative easing (QE) programme first unveiled in the 2008 crisis. The chancellor is thought to be working on a fiscal stimulus to kick-start the economy.</p><p>Reflecting the changing shape of UK plc under the lockdown, easyJet and cruise operator Carnival have dropped out of the FTSE 100, along with aircraft parts-maker Meggitt and British Gas owner Centrica.</p><p>They have been replaced by repair company Homeserve, B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher and cyber-security specialist Avast. Almost half the constituents of the FTSE 100 have axed dividends, with a total of \u00a331.8bn sacrificed to conserve cash.</p><p>As the biggest struggled, Britain's 5.8 million small firms felt the most immediate pain. As Bank policymakers scrambled to underpin financial markets three months ago, Sunak sought ways to help entrepreneurs and founders.</p><p>It started with a message of hope. The chancellor addressed the daily Downing Street briefing on March 17 and promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the economy, pledging support through loan guarantees worth \u00a3330bn for \"any business\" in need of cash.</p><p>By the end of that week, he had gone further, unveiling his job retention scheme to cover 80% of the wages of staff temporarily laid off. More than 11 million workers - a third of the workforce - have now been supported.</p><p>\"In some ways, what we've seen is maybe what policymakers wished they had done in 2009, or during the European sovereign debt crisis,\" said Andrew Sheets, a strategist at Morgan Stanley.</p><p>\"During both of those, there was hesitation, some [concern about] moral hazard, a lot of concern about rising government debt levels. Because the nature of this crisis is so different . . . it has allowed central banks and governments to act with a level of aggressiveness that would have been much harder with a different type of crisis.\"</p><p>This time there is an added challenge: officials are relying on phone and video calls to make decisions. The Bank conducts about 12,000 every day. When it announced its first emergency rate cut on budget day, March 11, many Bank staff were operating remotely. Later measures, including a second rate cut to a historic 0.1% low and an extra \u00a3200bn of bond-buying QE, were made with almost all staff working from home.</p><p>Bailey, 61, has been one of few occupants of the Bank building, where last week it sanctioned another \u00a3100bn round of QE, taking the total programme to an eye-watering \u00a3745bn.</p><p>Hauser has provided an account of the behind-the-scenes co-operation with other central banks. On the evening of March 9 - after a day when oil prices plunged 30% - the Bank received an email from the Fed wanting to ease the pressure on the dollar.</p><p>The US central bank asked to revamp swap lines put in place during the financial crisis to make it easier for dollars to be made available around the world. On Friday, the Bank of England said the arrangement was being relaxed - a sign of easing tensions in the markets.</p><p>The Bank is also a regulator. Sam Woods, a Bank deputy governor, became embroiled in a virtual battle with the high street banks about their plans to pay dividends. He fired off letters to bosses spelling out the need to conserve the \u00a37.6bn earmarked, and the banks took heed.</p><p>The banks were being relied on to lend billions to cash-strapped businesses through new government-backed lending packages. Those emergency schemes, including the Bank's commercial credit facility for large companies, have now provided more than \u00a354bn of finance to struggling businesses.</p><p>The Treasury schemes have not been without controversy. Some decisions were delayed by infighting between Whitehall departments. Other decisions - such as initially not offering fully state-backed loans, despite evidence that they were working in other countries - ran into ideological opposition. Delays are likely to have sounded the death knell for thousands of businesses.</p><p>There is also a feeling that it took some time for ministers to realise the economic consequences of the lockdown.</p><p>The flagship coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) was based on a framework designed after the 2008-9 financial crisis, which was discussed in January as an emergency measure if a hard Brexit caused a recession.</p><p>Until February, a government source said, \"Brexit was taking priority and was seen as more of an issue\".</p><p>Final terms for the CBILS loans, which are 80% guaranteed by the government, were not agreed until 4am on March 23, the day it was launched, according to a source. When applications opened, the banks were overwhelmed with requests.</p><p>Critics point to a lack of empathy for small companies in the top ranks of government. No senior cabinet minister has run a small business. Philip Hammond, then chancellor, and Jeremy Hunt, a former health secretary, both successful business owners, were swept aside after Johnson's election victory last year.</p><p>Even so, Sunak has been praised for the furlough scheme, which was announced the weekend before lockdown took effect. By then, a decade-long stock market bull run had come to a screeching halt. Market moves on Wall Street were dramatic, and bond markets moved as much in 10 days as they had in 14 months during the banking crisis.</p><p>\"Normal life ended on Friday, February 21,\" said Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Merian Global Investors. \"That weekend was when it became crystal clear that Italy was having a major issue and it wasn't a localised Asian situation.\"</p><p>Cue four weeks of mayhem. Yet the FTSE 100's low of 4,994 was on March 23. It was the Fed - announcing unlimited QE and the buying of corporate bonds (a first) - that shifted global markets. Equity investors, at least, are now looking ahead. \"Markets are pricing in a recovery,\" said Russ Mould of wealth manager AJ Bell.</p><p>The stimulus injected by central banks and governments to tackle what the OECD believes will be a $7 trillion dent to global growth is now $20 trillion, said Mould. And it keeps coming - for now.</p><p>                   LONG-TERM WINNERS FROM LOCKDOWN                   AO World                   </p><p>The electrical goods retailer has benefited from bored Britons looking to enhance their homes. The shares have almost tripled since the lockdown started, closing on Friday at 148p to make the company, founded by former salesman John Roberts after a \u00a31 pub bet and floated six years ago, worth more than \u00a3700m.</p><p>Bread-makers, gaming kit and TV sets have been among its best-selling items. In early March, there was also a run on freezers as consumers stocked up on frozen food ahead of feared shortages.</p><p>Roberts, 46, said the pandemic has pushed purchasers who had been reluctant to buy electrical goods online towards internet shopping.\"I believe that we've seen five years accelerate into only five weeks,\" he said last month.</p><p>                   Astra Zeneca                   </p><p>The pharmaceuticals giant was, for a time, Britain's most valuable company. Its shares, boosted by strong first-quarter results in April, were sent into overdrive after the news that it was helping to develop a coronavirus vaccine ready as early as September.</p><p>Chief executive Pascal Soriot, 61, has put in place manufacturing capacity to produce up to two billion doses of the vaccine, which is being developed with Oxford University.</p><p>Three supply chains will distribute the vaccine, should it be approved - one for Europe, one for America and one for Asia and lower-income countries. Soriot has said Britain will be first in line.</p><p>It is quite a turnaround for the Frenchman, who rejected a takeover bid worth \u00a355 a share from American rival Pfizer in 2014. For years, the shares languished below that mark, but they closed on Friday at \u00a384.89 to give a valuation of \u00a3111bn.</p><p>                   Big tech                   </p><p>Giant tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google owner Alphabet were pervasive before the coronavirus. If anything, the lockdown has made them even more central to the lives of billions of people around the world.</p><p>Facebook, which owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has said that messaging activity increased by 50% in countries enduring the strictest lockdowns.</p><p>Amazon announced in April that it had hired 100,000 staff in less than a month to keep up with increased orders.</p><p>The next few months should see the tech giants consolidate their power. All have billions of dollars in cash on their balance sheets and are expected to buy smaller rivals, while also hoovering up talented developers at start-ups who find themselves out of work.</p><p>The crisis has also meant a delay to American watchdog investigations into Alphabet and Facebook.</p><p>                   Video game developers                   </p><p>With cinemas out of action and no live music or sport, gaming has been one of the few areas of entertainment to feel only limited disruption from the coronavirus. One survey even found that gaming - in moderation - could have a positive effect on lockdown-induced anxiety.</p><p>Activision Blizzard, which makes the Call of Duty series, said more than 60 million people had played the game's latest release, Warzone, since its March launch. Last month, it increased its full-year sales target.</p><p>Electronic Arts, which makes the Fifa football games, also said user numbers had increased during the pandemic.</p><p>Team17, the games studio behind the Worms franchise, run by Debbie Bestwick, last week said it had had an \"excellent start\" to the first half of its financial year.</p><p>Shares in Cambridge-based Frontier Developments, which makes titles including Jurassic World Evolution, have increased by more than 80% since March 23.</p><p>                   Zoom                   </p><p>The videoconferencing app has become one of the defining features of lockdown. According to data provider Apptopia, Zoom was downloaded 2.1 million times on March 23, the day Britain's economy was closed, compared with 56,000 times a day two months earlier. Other tech companies that improve communication for families and work colleagues, such as Slack and Houseparty, have also seen huge increases in users - but Zoom led the way.</p><p>Founded by Chinese-born billionaire Eric Yuan, Zoom floated last year with a share price of $36. It finished last week at $241, with a valuation of $67.9bn. Despite an FBI warning over security concerns, Zoom's share price has more than tripled this year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-63796155</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605X-7JP1-F021-607R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2098\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 21, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002F2B</classCode><className>BANK OF ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC000C55J</classCode><className>BRITISH GAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000260W</classCode><className>CENTRICA PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS221210 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS221112 FOSSIL FUEL ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS211120 CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC1311 CRUDE PETROLEUM &amp;

If Ambani succeeds in pulling off such a deal, it would mark another victory for the billionaire, who in recent months has secured $20 billion of investment in his digital unit from marquee names including Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. The mere possibility of an Amazon investment reveals not only Ambani's market clout but also how India's business climate is changing as Prime Minister Narendra Modi cranks up nationalist rhetoric while the nation hurtles toward the first annual economic contraction in 40 years. Having seen multiple regulatory roadblocks thrown in their way, a tie-up with a powerful Indian ally has never looked more crucial for the world's biggest internet companies. And no business person carries more heft in India -- known for its complicated bureaucracy and red tape -- than Ambani.</p><p><br/><br/>\"I suspect the government somewhere is signaling that it's better for multinational companies to come in with some Indian partner,\" said Arun Kumar, an economist and the Malcolm Adiseshiah Chair at the Institute of Social Sciences. \"So Amazon might decide it's better to cooperate with Reliance than compete against it.\"<br/><br/>The 63-year-old Indian tycoon has identified technology and retail as future growth areas in a pivot away from the energy businesses he inherited from his father, who died in 2002. Retail is the next frontier for Ambani, whose ambitions include creating a home-grown e-commerce giant like China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.<br/><br/>Silicon Valley's ambitions in the country represent a threat to Ambani's ability to achieve such dominance in his home market, but winning their cooperation, with all the know-how and global reach it brings, could help him achieve it faster. That aligns with the emphasis Modi has been placing on developing India's local economy.<br/><br/>In one 33-minute address to the nation recently, Modi used the word 'self-reliance' 17 times. \"The corona crisis has taught us the value of local manufacturing, local markets and local supply chains,\" Modi went on to say. \"Local is not only our need it is also our responsibility. Time has taught us that we will simply have to make 'local' our life's mantra.\"<br/><br/>Even so, India is increasingly important to Silicon Valley because it's a one billion-plus person market that's still largely untapped. China is dominated by homegrown e-commerce players and largely shuts out global tech companies, while established markets in the West offer limited growth opportunities.<br/><br/>Though Amazon is already India's largest e-commerce player, it's ability to compete with domestic firms was hamstrung by an abrupt rule change in 2018 that limited foreign players to operating as e-Bay style marketplaces, rather than selling their own stock.<br/><br/>Not long after, Ambani announced that his own sprawling conglomerate, Reliance Industries, would make an entry into e-commerce, leveraging its control of both India's largest mobile carrier and biggest network of brick and- mortar stores.<br/><br/>In response, Amazon tried to bolster its presence on the ground with an investment in India's second-biggest physical retailer, cash-strapped Future Group. But the rules restricting foreign ownership in that sector meant its investment was too little to halt Future Group's slide into financial distress.<br/><br/>Last month, it was Ambani who was waiting to snap up the majority of the company's operations for $3.4 billion. Faced with a regulatory disadvantage and a competitor only seeming to grow stronger, it's not hard to see why Amazon might be tempted to make a peace offering now.\"Reliance has brick and mortar, logistics, warehousing, and now online build out with its recent deals,\" said Chakri Lokapriya, chief investment officer at TCG Asset Management in Mumbai. \"It will take years of operational infrastructure for Amazon or other multinational companies to recreate that, and hence Reliance Industries is the preferred partner choice for their entry into India.\"<br/><br/>Facebook may have made a similar calculation. The company plans to turn its wildly popular WhatsApp messaging platform into a nationwide payment system that has been stuck in Indian regulatory limbo for more than two years now.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Reliance is pushing ahead with its own payment system, with its almost 400 million mobile subscribers as a built-in user base. But since their deal, Facebook and Reliance have announced that WhatsApp will at least be the main platform for Ambani's online grocery store, his flagship e-commerce offering, ensuring the social networking giant has a toehold in the Indian e-commerce market it covets.<br/><br/>Google, meanwhile, has announced plans to roll out a low-cost phone with Ambani which will run on its Android operating system. Previously Ambani had been selling his own low-cost phones, which ran on a different operating system. Google, like Facebook, may have decided it was better to work with Ambani than against him. Amazon may wind up doing the same. \"Business in India is taking the monopolistic approach,\" said Mathew Antony, managing partner of Aditya Consulting, a boutique legal advisory firm in Mumbai.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NRTLNE-0054447645</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NRTLNE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VC-18F1-JB5M-W24G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373705</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"903\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Northlines, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Northlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 14, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0003NV7</classCode><className>RELIANCE INDUSTRIES LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS324110 PETROLEUM REFINERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS313110 FIBER, YARN &amp;

Wien, Vice Chairman together with Joe Zidle, Chief Investment Strategist in the Private Wealth Solutions group at Blackstone, today issued their list of Ten Surprises for 2020. This is the 35th year Byron has given his views on a number of economic, financial market and political surprises for the coming year. Byron defines a \"surprise\" as an event that the average investor would only assign a one out of three chance of taking place but which Byron believes is \"probable,\" having a better than 50% likelihood of happening. Byron started the tradition in 1986 when he was the Chief U.S. Investment Strategist at Morgan Stanley. Byron joined Blackstone in September 2009 as a senior advisor to both the firm and its clients in analyzing economic, political, market and social trends. In 2018, Joe Zidle joined Byron Wien in the development of the Ten Surprises.</p><p><br/><br/>Byron and Joe's Ten Surprises for 2020 are as follows:<br/><br/>1. The economy disappoints the consensus forecast, but a recession is avoided. Federal Reserve Chair Powell lowers the Fed funds rate to 1%. Without a comprehensive trade deal in hand, President Trump exercises every executive authority he has to stimulate growth and ward off recession. He cuts payroll taxes to put more money in the hands of consumers.<br/><br/>2. Concepts of inequality and climate change become important election themes, but centrist ideas prevail. The House of Representatives sends articles of impeachment to the Senate, but Donald Trump is not convicted or removed from office. Enough information is revealed in the proceedings to cause some of his supporters, as well as many independents, to throw their support to liberal candidates in 2020 state races. The Democrats take the Senate in November.<br/><br/>3. There is no comprehensive Phase Two trade deal that limits China's ability to acquire intellectual property. National interests result in the balkanization of technology. The development of separate standards for 5G and other tech hardware proves to be bad news for the future of world economies. The move toward \"decoupling\" gains traction in negotiations with China. US economic co-dependence with China erodes. Both China and the US keep their hands off Hong Kong and let the protest settle down by itself.<br/><br/>4. The prospect of a self-driving car is pushed further into the future. A series of accidents with experimental vehicles causes a major manufacturer or technology company to issue a statement that they're no longer developing self-driving technology.<br/><br/>5. Emboldened by the pain of economic sanctions, Iran capitalizes on a lack of American leadership abroad by stepping up acts of hostility against Israel and Saudi Arabia. The straits of Hormuz are closed and the price of oil (West Texas Intermediate) soars to over $ 70/barrel.<br/><br/>6. Even though some observers believe valuations are stretched, a surge in investor enthusiasm pushes the Standard and Poor's 500 above 3500 at some point during the year. Earnings only increase 5%, and SP 500 multiples remain elevated because monetary policy is easy and investors become more comfortable that intermediate interest rates will rise slowly. Volatility increases and there are several market corrections greater than 5% throughout the year.<br/><br/>7. Big tech companies face growing political scrutiny and social blowback. Once the market leaders, certain FAANG stocks underperform and the equal-weighted SP 500 outperforms. There are popular plans proposed to break up the largest social media platforms and increase regulation and government oversight. This has greater success than prior government efforts against Apple, Microsoft and IBM, because it has widespread support from the American people. A millennial in New York City puts their phone down and makes eye contact with another human and finds it non-threatening and refreshing.<br/><br/>8. Having secured a workable Brexit deal, the United Kingdom turns out to be the winner in its divorce from the European Union. The equity market rises and the pound rallies. The U.K. benefits from a long transition period and growth exceeds 2% as foreign direct investment resumes now that the outlook is clarified. The EU economy remains soft, and European markets other than the UK underperform the US and Asia.<br/><br/>9. The bond bubble starts to leak, but negative rates continue abroad. Even though the U.S. economy is slowing, the 10-year Treasury yield approaches 2.5% and the yield curve steepens. Japan and China pull away from the Treasury auctions. Rather than economic fundamentals or inflation, supply and demand drive yields higher.<br/><br/>10. The problems with Boeing's 737 Max are fixed and deliveries begin. The plane becomes a fixture around the world, enabling airlines to operate more efficiently and increase profits. The stocks become market leaders.<br/><br/>\"Also Rans\"<br/><br/>Every year there are always a few Surprises that do not make the Ten, because we either do not think they are as relevant as those on the basic list or we are not comfortable with the idea that they are \"probable.\"<br/><br/>11. Fears of an economic crisis in India ameliorate. The emerging markets continue to have uneven performance but India recovers from decelerating growth. The Modi government continues business friendly growth reforms, the economy grows at 6% and the market rises 20%.<br/><br/>12. Artificial intelligence begins to be viewed as a paper tiger. The AI jobs apocalypse fails to materialize, much like the Y2K bug failed to undermine the US economy 20 years earlier. Manufacturing jobs have already been automated and it proves harder to eliminate service jobs by using computer-based applications.<br/><br/>13. Economic problems in Russia intensify even though the price of oil rises. As a result, social unrest begins to spread. Putin's cozy relationship with his circle of oligarchs becomes an issue and his influence as a world leader diminishes. He becomes closer to China to maintain his stature on the world stage. In spite of serious differences, China and Russia appear prepared to face off against Europe and the United States.<br/><br/>14. Populism and inward-thinking continue to spread globally, particularly in emerging markets. Anarchy and disharmony spread throughout the world, creating turbulence in financial markets everywhere. Investors turn away from emerging market local currency debt, forcing spreads higher.<br/><br/>15. North Korea agrees to suspend its nuclear development program after another meeting with President Trump, but does not give up its existing stockpile. Kim Jong-un halts work on a long-range missile capable of reaching the United States. North Korea continues to be a threat, but not an imminent danger.<br/><br/>About Blackstone<br/><br/>Blackstone is one of the world's leading investment firms.

Wien, Vice Chairman together with Joe Zidle, Chief Investment Strategist in the Private Wealth Solutions group at Blackstone, today issued their list of Ten Surprises for 2020. This is the 35th year Byron has given his views on a number of economic, financial market and political surprises for the coming year. Byron defines a \"surprise\" as an event that the average investor would only assign a one out of three chance of taking place but which Byron believes is \"probable,\" having a better than 50% likelihood of happening. Byron started the tradition in 1986 when he was the Chief U.S. Investment Strategist at Morgan Stanley. Byron joined Blackstone in September 2009 as a senior advisor to both the firm and its clients in analyzing economic, political, market and social trends. In 2018, Joe Zidle joined Byron Wien in the development of the Ten Surprises.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Byron and Joe's Ten Surprises for 2020 are as follows:</p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"184\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"168\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"272\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">The economy disappoints the consensus forecast, but a recession is avoided. Federal Reserve Chair Powell lowers the Fed funds rate to 1%. Without a comprehensive trade deal in hand, President Trump exercises every executive authority he has to stimulate growth and ward off recession. He cuts payroll taxes to put more money in the hands of consumers.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">Concepts of inequality and climate change become important election themes, but centrist ideas prevail. The House of Representatives sends articles of impeachment to the Senate, but Donald Trump is not convicted or removed from office. Enough information is revealed in the proceedings to cause some of his supporters, as well as many independents, to throw their support to liberal candidates in 2020 state races. The Democrats take the Senate in November.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">3.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">There is no comprehensive Phase Two trade deal that limits China's ability to acquire intellectual property. National interests result in the balkanization of technology. The development of separate standards for 5G and other tech hardware proves to be bad news for the future of world economies. The move toward \"decoupling\" gains traction in negotiations with China. US economic co-dependence with China erodes. Both China and the US keep their hands off Hong Kong and let the protest settle down by itself.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">4.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">The prospect of a self-driving car is pushed further into the future. A series of accidents with experimental vehicles causes a major manufacturer or technology company to issue a statement that they're no longer developing self-driving technology.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">5.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">Emboldened by the pain of economic sanctions, Iran capitalizes on a lack of American leadership abroad by stepping up acts of hostility against Israel and Saudi Arabia. The straits of Hormuz are closed and the price of oil (West Texas Intermediate) soars to over $70/barrel.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">6.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">Even though some observers believe valuations are stretched, a surge in investor enthusiasm pushes the Standard and Poor's 500 above 3500 at some point during the year. Earnings only increase 5%, and S&amp;P 500 multiples remain elevated because monetary policy is easy and investors become more comfortable that intermediate interest rates will rise slowly. Volatility increases and there are several market corrections greater than 5% throughout the year.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">7.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">Big tech companies face growing political scrutiny and social blowback. Once the market leaders, certain FAANG stocks underperform and the equal-weighted S&amp;P 500 outperforms. There are popular plans proposed to break up the largest social media platforms and increase regulation and government oversight. This has greater success than prior government efforts against Apple, Microsoft and IBM, because it has widespread support from the American people. A millennial in New York City puts their phone down and makes eye contact with another human and finds it non-threatening and refreshing.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">8.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">Having secured a workable Brexit deal, the United Kingdom turns out to be the winner in its divorce from the European Union. The equity market rises and the pound rallies. The U.K. benefits from a long transition period and growth exceeds 2% as foreign direct investment resumes now that the outlook is clarified. The EU economy remains soft, and European markets other than the UK underperform the US and Asia.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">9.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">The bond bubble starts to leak, but negative rates continue abroad. Even though the U.S. economy is slowing, the 10-year Treasury yield approaches 2.5% and the yield curve steepens. Japan and China pull away from the Treasury auctions. Rather than economic fundamentals or inflation, supply and demand drive yields higher.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">10.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">The problems with Boeing's 737 Max are fixed and deliveries begin. The plane becomes a fixture around the world, enabling airlines to operate more efficiently and increase profits. The stocks become market leaders.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>\"Also Rans\"</p><p>Every year there are always a few Surprises that do not make the Ten, because we either do not think they are as relevant as those on the basic list or we are not comfortable with the idea that they are \"probable.\"</p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"184\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"168\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"272\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\">11.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Fears of an economic crisis in India ameliorate. The emerging markets continue to have uneven performance but India recovers from decelerating growth. The Modi government continues business friendly growth reforms, the economy grows at 6% and the market rises 20%.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">12.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">Artificial intelligence begins to be viewed as a paper tiger. The AI jobs apocalypse fails to materialize, much like the Y2K bug failed to undermine the US economy 20 years earlier. Manufacturing jobs have already been automated and it proves harder to eliminate service jobs by using computer-based applications.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">13.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">Economic problems in Russia intensify even though the price of oil rises. As a result, social unrest begins to spread. Putin's cozy relationship with his circle of oligarchs becomes an issue and his influence as a world leader diminishes. He becomes closer to China to maintain his stature on the world stage. In spite of serious differences, China and Russia appear prepared to face off against Europe and the United States.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">14.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">Populism and inward-thinking continue to spread globally, particularly in emerging markets. Anarchy and disharmony spread throughout the world, creating turbulence in financial markets everywhere. Investors turn away from emerging market local currency debt, forcing spreads higher.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">15.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">North Korea agrees to suspend its nuclear development program after another meeting with President Trump, but does not give up its existing stockpile. Kim Jong-un halts work on a long-range missile capable of reaching the United States. North Korea continues to be a threat, but not an imminent danger.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>About Blackstone</p><p>Blackstone is one of the world's leading investment firms.

Wien, Vice Chairman together with Joe Zidle, Chief Investment Strategist in the Private Wealth Solutions group at Blackstone, today issued their list of Ten Surprises for 2020. This is the 35th year Byron has given his views on a number of economic, financial market and political surprises for the coming year. Byron defines a \"surprise\" as an event that the average investor would only assign a one out of three chance of taking place but which Byron believes is \"probable,\" having a better than 50% likelihood of happening. Byron started the tradition in 1986 when he was the Chief U.S. Investment Strategist at Morgan Stanley. Byron joined Blackstone in September 2009 as a senior advisor to both the firm and its clients in analyzing economic, political, market and social trends. In 2018, Joe Zidle joined Byron Wien in the development of the Ten Surprises.</p><p><br/><br/>Byron and Joe's Ten Surprises for 2020 are as follows:<br/><br/>1. The economy disappoints the consensus forecast, but a recession is avoided. Federal Reserve Chair Powell lowers the Fed funds rate to 1%. Without a comprehensive trade deal in hand, President Trump exercises every executive authority he has to stimulate growth and ward off recession. He cuts payroll taxes to put more money in the hands of consumers.<br/><br/>2. Concepts of inequality and climate change become important election themes, but centrist ideas prevail. The House of Representatives sends articles of impeachment to the Senate, but Donald Trump is not convicted or removed from office. Enough information is revealed in the proceedings to cause some of his supporters, as well as many independents, to throw their support to liberal candidates in 2020 state races. The Democrats take the Senate in November.<br/><br/>3. There is no comprehensive Phase Two trade deal that limits China's ability to acquire intellectual property. National interests result in the balkanization of technology. The development of separate standards for 5G and other tech hardware proves to be bad news for the future of world economies. The move toward \"decoupling\" gains traction in negotiations with China. US economic co-dependence with China erodes. Both China and the US keep their hands off Hong Kong and let the protest settle down by itself.<br/><br/>4. The prospect of a self-driving car is pushed further into the future. A series of accidents with experimental vehicles causes a major manufacturer or technology company to issue a statement that they're no longer developing self-driving technology.<br/><br/>5. Emboldened by the pain of economic sanctions, Iran capitalizes on a lack of American leadership abroad by stepping up acts of hostility against Israel and Saudi Arabia. The straits of Hormuz are closed and the price of oil (West Texas Intermediate) soars to over $ 70/barrel.<br/><br/>6. Even though some observers believe valuations are stretched, a surge in investor enthusiasm pushes the Standard and Poor's 500 above 3500 at some point during the year. Earnings only increase 5%, and SP 500 multiples remain elevated because monetary policy is easy and investors become more comfortable that intermediate interest rates will rise slowly. Volatility increases and there are several market corrections greater than 5% throughout the year.<br/><br/>7. Big tech companies face growing political scrutiny and social blowback. Once the market leaders, certain FAANG stocks underperform and the equal-weighted SP 500 outperforms. There are popular plans proposed to break up the largest social media platforms and increase regulation and government oversight. This has greater success than prior government efforts against Apple, Microsoft and IBM, because it has widespread support from the American people. A millennial in New York City puts their phone down and makes eye contact with another human and finds it non-threatening and refreshing.<br/><br/>8. Having secured a workable Brexit deal, the United Kingdom turns out to be the winner in its divorce from the European Union. The equity market rises and the pound rallies. The U.K. benefits from a long transition period and growth exceeds 2% as foreign direct investment resumes now that the outlook is clarified. The EU economy remains soft, and European markets other than the UK underperform the US and Asia.<br/><br/>9. The bond bubble starts to leak, but negative rates continue abroad. Even though the U.S. economy is slowing, the 10-year Treasury yield approaches 2.5% and the yield curve steepens. Japan and China pull away from the Treasury auctions. Rather than economic fundamentals or inflation, supply and demand drive yields higher.<br/><br/>10. The problems with Boeing's 737 Max are fixed and deliveries begin. The plane becomes a fixture around the world, enabling airlines to operate more efficiently and increase profits. The stocks become market leaders.<br/><br/>\"Also Rans\"<br/><br/>Every year there are always a few Surprises that do not make the Ten, because we either do not think they are as relevant as those on the basic list or we are not comfortable with the idea that they are \"probable.\"<br/><br/>11. Fears of an economic crisis in India ameliorate. The emerging markets continue to have uneven performance but India recovers from decelerating growth. The Modi government continues business friendly growth reforms, the economy grows at 6% and the market rises 20%.<br/><br/>12. Artificial intelligence begins to be viewed as a paper tiger. The AI jobs apocalypse fails to materialize, much like the Y2K bug failed to undermine the US economy 20 years earlier. Manufacturing jobs have already been automated and it proves harder to eliminate service jobs by using computer-based applications.<br/><br/>13. Economic problems in Russia intensify even though the price of oil rises. As a result, social unrest begins to spread. Putin's cozy relationship with his circle of oligarchs becomes an issue and his influence as a world leader diminishes. He becomes closer to China to maintain his stature on the world stage. In spite of serious differences, China and Russia appear prepared to face off against Europe and the United States.<br/><br/>14. Populism and inward-thinking continue to spread globally, particularly in emerging markets. Anarchy and disharmony spread throughout the world, creating turbulence in financial markets everywhere. Investors turn away from emerging market local currency debt, forcing spreads higher.<br/><br/>15. North Korea agrees to suspend its nuclear development program after another meeting with President Trump, but does not give up its existing stockpile. Kim Jong-un halts work on a long-range missile capable of reaching the United States. North Korea continues to be a threat, but not an imminent danger.<br/><br/>About Blackstone<br/><br/>Blackstone is one of the world's leading investment firms.

Blackstone Vice Chairman Byron Wien has issued his traiditional list of Ten Surprises for 2020[3] (together with Joe Zidle, Chief Investment Strategist in the Private Wealth Solutions group at Blackstone).   This is the 35th year Byron has given his views on a number of economic, financial market and political surprises for the coming year. Byron defines a 'surprise' as an event that the average investor would only assign a one out of three chance of taking place but which Byron believes is 'probable,' having a better than 50% likelihood of happening.  Byron and Joe's Ten Surprises for 2020 are as follows:  1.The economy disappoints the consensus forecast, but a recession is avoided. Federal Reserve Chair Powell lowers the Fed funds rate to 1%. Without a comprehensive trade deal in hand, President Trump exercises every executive authority he has to stimulate growth and ward off recession. </p><p>He cuts payroll taxes to put more money in the hands of consumers.  2. Concepts of inequality and climate change become important election themes, but centrist ideas prevail. The House of Representatives sends articles of impeachment to the Senate, but Donald Trump is not convicted or removed from office. Enough information is revealed in the proceedings to cause some of his supporters, as well as many independents, to throw their support to liberal candidates in 2020 state races. The Democrats take the Senate in November.  3. There is no comprehensive Phase Two trade deal that limits China's ability to acquire intellectual property. National interests result in the balkanization of technology. The development of separate standards for 5G and other tech hardware proves to be bad news for the future of world economies. The move toward 'decoupling' gains traction in negotiations with China. US economic co-dependence with China erodes. Both China and the US keep their hands off Hong Kong and let the protest settle down by itself.  4. The prospect of a self-driving car is pushed further into the future. A series of accidents with experimental vehicles causes a major manufacturer or technology company to issue a statement that they're no longer developing self-driving technology.  5. Emboldened by the pain of economic sanctions, Iran capitalizes on a lack of American leadership abroad by stepping up acts of hostility against Israel and Saudi Arabia. The straits of Hormuz are closed and the price of oil (West Texas Intermediate) soars to over $70/barrel.  6. Even though some observers believe valuations are stretched, a surge in investor enthusiasm pushes the Standard and Poor's 500 above 3500 at some point during the year. Earnings only increase 5%, and S...00 multiples remain elevated because monetary policy is easy and investors become more comfortable that intermediate interest rates will rise slowly. Volatility increases and there are several market corrections greater than 5% throughout the year.  7. Big tech companies face growing political scrutiny and social blowback. Once the market leaders, certain FAANG stocks underperform and the equal-weighted S...00 outperforms. There are popular plans proposed to break up the largest social media platforms and increase regulation and government oversight. This has greater success than prior government efforts against Apple, Microsoft and IBM, because it has widespread support from the American people. A millennial in New York City puts their phone down and makes eye contact with another human and finds it non-threatening and refreshing.  8. Having secured a workable Brexit deal, the United Kingdom turns out to be the winner in its divorce from the European Union. The equity market rises and the pound rallies. The U.K. benefits from a long transition period and growth exceeds 2% as foreign direct investment resumes now that the outlook is clarified. The EU economy remains soft, and European markets other than the UK underperform the US and Asia.  9. The bond bubble starts to leak, but negative rates continue abroad. Even though the U.S. economy is slowing, the 10-year Treasury yield approaches 2.5% and the yield curve steepens. Japan and China pull away from the Treasury auctions. Rather than economic fundamentals or inflation, supply and demand drive yields higher.  10. The problems with Boeing's 737 Max are fixed and deliveries begin. The plane becomes a fixture around the world, enabling airlines to operate more efficiently and increase profits. The stocks become market leaders.  'Also Rans'  Every year there are always a few Surprises that do not make the Ten, because we either do not think they are as relevant as those on the basic list or we are not comfortable with the idea that they are 'probable.'  11.Fears of an economic crisis in India ameliorate. The emerging markets continue to have uneven performance but India recovers from decelerating growth. The Modi government continues business friendly growth reforms, the economy grows at 6% and the market rises 20%.  12. Artificial intelligence begins to be viewed as a paper tiger. The AI jobs apocalypse fails to materialize, much like the Y2K bug failed to undermine the US economy 20 years earlier. Manufacturing jobs have already been automated and it proves harder to eliminate service jobs by using computer-based applications.  13. Economic problems in Russia intensify even though the price of oil rises. As a result, social unrest begins to spread. Putin's cozy relationship with his circle of oligarchs becomes an issue and his influence as a world leader diminishes. He becomes closer to China to maintain his stature on the world stage. In spite of serious differences, China and Russia appear prepared to face off against Europe and the United States.  14. Populism and inward-thinking continue to spread globally, particularly in emerging markets. Anarchy and disharmony spread throughout the world, creating turbulence in financial markets everywhere. Investors turn away from emerging market local currency debt, forcing spreads higher.  15. North Korea agrees to suspend its nuclear development program after another meeting with President Trump, but does not give up its existing stockpile. Kim Jong-un halts work on a long-range missile capable of reaching the United States. North Korea continues to be a threat, but not an imminent danger.  * * *  How did Wien do last year?  The weakening world economy encourages the Federal Reserve to stop raising the federal funds rate during the year. Inflation remains subdued and the 10-year Treasury yield stays below 3.5%. The yield curve remains positive. - TRUE  Partly because of no further rate increases by the Federal Reserve and more attractive valuations as a result of the market decline at the end of 2018, the S...00 gains 15% for the year. Rallies and corrections occur but improved earnings enable equities to move higher in a reasonably benign interest rate environment. - TRUE  Traditional drivers of GDP growth, capital spending and housing, make only modest gains in 2019. The expansion continues, however, because of consumer and government spending. A recession before 2021 seems unlikely. - TRUE  The better tone in the financial markets discourages precious metal investors. Gold drops to $1,000 as the equity markets in the United States and elsewhere improve. - FALSE  The profit outlook for emerging markets brightens and investor interest intensifies because the price earnings ratio is attractive compared to developed markets and historical levels. Continuous expansion of the middle class in the emerging markets provides the consumer buying thrust for earnings growth. China leads and the Shanghai composite rises 25%. The Brazil equity market also comes to life under the country's new conservative leadership. - TRUE  March 29 comes and goes and there is no Brexit deal. Parliament fails to approve one and Theresa May, arguing that a change in leadership won't help the situation, remains in office. A second referendum is held and the U.K. votes to remain. - TRUE  The dollar stabilizes at year-end 2018 levels and stays there throughout the year. Because of concern about the economy, the Federal Reserve stops shrinking its balance sheet, which is interpreted negatively by currency traders. The flow of foreign capital into United States assets slows because of a softer monetary policy and a lack of need for new capital for business expansion. - TRUE  The Mueller investigation results in indictments against members of the Trump Organization closest to the president but the evidence doesn't support any direct action against Trump himself. Nevertheless, an exodus of Trump's most trusted advisors results in a crisis in confidence that the administration has the people and the process to accomplish important goals. - FALSE  Congress, however, with a Democratic majority, gets more done than expected, particularly on trade policy. Progress is made in preserving important parts of the Affordable Care Act and immigration policy. A federal infrastructure program to be implemented in 2020 is announced. - FALSE  Growth stocks continue to provide leadership in the U.S. equity market. Technology and biotech do well as a result of continued strong earnings. Value stocks other than energy-related businesses disappoint because of the slowing economy. - TRUE  7 out of 10 true is not a bad batting average.

Was it when the multinational started monetising the information collected on its users? Or when it decided to avoid paying taxes? Surely it can't have been as late as 2009, when it gave the US National Security Agency direct access to its worldwide network.</p><p>I suppose the answer will depend in part on our view of info capitalism generally. But I doubt there can be anyone left who doesn't cock at least one eyebrow when they encounter, or remember, this corporate imperative.</p><p>To this extent American writer Jonathan Tap-lin is pushing at an open door when he asserts that the giant tech companies are, in fact, evil indeed, if by \"evil\" we mean driven by profit, not people, and indifferent to the greater good.</p><p>His spirited book Move Fast and Break Things takes its title from another imperative, from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and captures the nihilistic ethos that characterises info capitalism. The bright young things of Silicon Valley like to paint themselves as blue-sky thinkers. But for Taplin they stand in a long tradition of predatory capitalism and are no less savage in pursuit of their interests than the British East India Company.</p><p>Taplin's aim is to locate these companies in the history of monopoly capitalism and to show how a \"cadre of libertarian ubermenschen\" effectively hijacked the utopian promise of the internet in its early days. To this end he takes us on a whirlwind tour of neoliberalism's exponents and architects - Milton Friedman, Ayn Rand, the brothers Koch - and a rogues gallery of digital robber barons, including Peter Thiel (Paypal), Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Kim Dotcom (Megaupload), and Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin.</p><p>He is especially attuned to (and dismissive of) the countercultural posturings of these billionaires, not least because he is a veteran of 1960s counterculture: a manager-producer for several artists, including Bob Dylan, George Harrison and rock group the Band. Indeed it was his work with the Band that set him on a collision course with Big Tech, that group having suffered a sharp fall in revenue as a result of the file-sharing platform Napster.</p><p>For Taplin, people such as Napster's Sean Parker (that's Justin Timberlake in the 2010 David Fincher-Aaron Sorkin film The Social Network) are men of \"passing artistic desire\" now \"chained to a world of suits and bureaucratic concerns\". They are artistes manque, and utterly ruthless.</p><p>Big Tech's core business model, Taplin argues, is best described as \"surveillance marketing\": companies collect information on their \"customers\" and sell it on to the big end of town.</p><p>In the process they effectively steal from the people - musicians and so on - who created the content used to ensnare the public. Interested only in the bottom line, they take advantage of a lack of industry regulation - the weakening of antitrust laws in particular - to cement their market position. They are the rent-seekers par excellence: price makers, not price takers, who augment their power through tax avoidance (\"transfer pricing\") and regulatory capture.</p><p>All of this is set out well, and if Taplin's analysis is a bit obvious at times, it is elevated above the mundane by his experience in the music industry and his fury at those who would profit from it while condemning musicians to increasing precarity.</p><p>But for me the book runs into trouble when it comes to Taplin's solutions to this problem, most of which seem to be predicated on the idea that, given the proper regulations, the market in digital commodities can be made to function to the benefit of all.</p><p>It is in the nature of those commodities, however, that they can be stored and reproduced for free, or as close to free as makes no difference, and it is that which makes them so disruptive. In other words, Taplin fails to appreciate the extent to which the rent-seeking behaviour of the giant tech multinationals is driven by necessity. He wants a \"moral framework for the digital economy\", but it may turn out that a \"digital economy\", or at least a capitalist digital economy, is a contradiction in terms.</p><p>This is not to argue that Taplin is being unfair to the big tech companies. In my view they are every bit as ruthless and opportunistic as he suggests.</p><p>But a more radical approach would be to view such behaviour as the last hurrah of a capitalist system confronted with a technology that is implicitly post-capitalist, and that may be used in some future society to extend the possibilities of the artists Taplin so admires.</p><p>Not to want to get all techno-utopian about it but it seems to me that the problem Taplin identifies is pregnant with its own solution. Information wants to be free, in both senses of the word.</p><p>Taplin describes the musicians and artists who are fighting back against Big Tech as \"The Resistance\". But American author Adam Alter seeks to remind us that one of the weapons Big Tech has in its armoury is the \"irresistible\" nature of the tech itself. His book Irresistible is an essay on behavioural addiction and a survey of the techniques used to pull us in and keep us hooked. Since some estimates suggest internet addiction affects 40 per cent of the population, this is a matter of some urgency.</p><p>Contra the \"addictive personality\" thesis, Alter argues that addiction has as much to do with environment as it does with genetics and biology. Yes, personality is a factor in the prevalence of addictive behaviours, such that some people may be likelier than others to fall into drug-use or alcoholism. But even most drug addicts, Alter suggests, are addicted less to the drug itself than they are to the circumstances of its taking. It follows that addictions will be harder to beat when circumstances are harder to escape, and that the ubiquity of the internet is thus a cause, and not just a consequence, of internet addiction.</p><p>On to this can be mapped the six key ingredients of behavioural addiction, as Alter regards them: compelling goals, unpredictable feedback, incremental progress, increasing difficulty, unresolved tension and social connection. All role-playing games or social media platforms depend for their effectiveness on one or several of these ingredients, and the creators of these games and platforms understand this well. In Alter's view these internet designers are engineers of addictive experiences.</p><p>Though Irresistible contains lots of interesting material, it feels rather Pollyannaish at times. Alter has little to say, for example, about the principal pushers in this crack-house economy, and even suggests that their habit-forming technologies can be harnessed in the cause of \"social goods\".</p><p>Worried that people who work in call centres suffer dips in motivation (who knew?), he suggests companies \"gamify the workplace to motivate their employees\". Elsewhere he sings the praises of something called the Pavlok - a device that uses electric shocks to establish new behavioural patterns. It's almost as if the paraphernalia of behavioural psychology, with its levers and addled rats and pigeons, had spilled out into the human world.</p><p>Perhaps, then, Alter is insufficiently alive to the \"evil\" of the big tech companies. But he is an entertaining guide to the science, and his book contains lots of practical tips on how to limit our use of technology. If my pessimism survives his recommendations, it's partly because he does such a good job of explaining the dynamic of behavioural addiction and just how pervasive it is in this space.Richard King is an author and critic.

He most recently served as vice-president of global partnerships for more than eight years at Facebook. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I expect Blake Chandlee's mandate will be to focus on the international expansion of TikTok and build legitimacy for the brand outside China,\" said Paul Haswell, a partner who advises technology companies at international law firm Pinsent Masons. </p><p>Haswell also expected ByteDance to ramp up its international staff recruitment, following this strategic hire.  </p><p>\"Chandlee will need an international team, who will have the challenge of breaking through international barriers to rival [the expansion initiatives of] Facebook and Snapchat,\" he said. </p><p>The new executive appointment at TikTok, known as Douyin in mainland China, has come after the short-form video app's expansion efforts became ensnared in a slew of regulatory issues in various overseas markets. </p><p>TikTok, which has become one of the most heavily downloaded apps worldwide since it was launched in 2016, saw its rapid growth marred by recent problems with regulators in Indonesia, the United States and India. </p><p>The legal minefields TikTok must steer clear of outside China have put more pressure on ByteDance, as growth slows in its home market. The company, which also operates news app Jinri Toutiao, relies mostly on advertising generated from its core content business. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3008349/bytedance-faces-global-learning-curve-tiktok-runs-afoul-local\">ByteDance faces global learning curve as TikTok runs afoul of local regulators</url></p><p>\"Blake is a wonderful addition to the ByteDance family, bringing great experience in building strategic partnerships with successful creative and technology leaders in global markets,\" a ByteDance spokeswoman said in a statement on Monday. </p><p>Chandlee was not ByteDance's first recruit from Silicon Valley. In February, the company hired Vanessa Pappas, who was previously global head of creative insights at YouTube, to serve as TikTok's first general manager in the US. </p><p>Video-sharing platform TikTok - on which users can watch as well as create short videos with music, stickers and animation as special effects - has greatly extended ByteDance's reach and helped it raise more financing. The seven-year-old company secured an estimated US$76 billion valuation in its most recent fundraising round, vaulting it past Uber Technologies in the global unicorn rankings, after attracting backing from well-heeled investors led by SoftBank Group Corp, KKR &amp; Co and General Atlantic. </p><p>Chandlee wrote in a post, dated May 20, on his Facebook account that he joined TikTok to help the ByteDance team led by founder Zhang Yiming and senior vice-president Zhang Lidong \"scale the business outside of the domestic market in China\". </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-social/article/3001893/how-short-video-app-tiktok-became-first-chinese-made-app-take\">How short video app TikTok became the first Chinese-made app to take the world by storm</url></p><p>\"I have always enjoyed being a global citizen and think it is more important now than ever,\" Chandlee said. He credited the ByteDance team for being \"thoughtful, eager, curious, energetic and focused\", which he described as familiar \"attributes from the early days of any big tech company in Silicon Valley\". </p><p>Chandlee initially worked in sales from 2000 to 2002 at Catalina Marketing, a company focused on the retail industry, after obtaining his bachelor's degree in business management, marketing and related support services from Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, according to the executive's LinkedIn account. </p><p>Working at Yahoo from July 2003 to October 2007, Chandlee served as a vice-president who was brought to the UK to turn around the internet company's commercial operations there. </p><p>He joined Facebook in October 2007 to initially serve as vice-president of Europe-Middle East-Africa (Emea) operations. He was later appointed in a broader role as vice-president and commercial director for Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Emea in June 2010, before he headed global partnerships at the company from June 2011. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/innovation/article/3014216/queen-internet-mary-meeker-says-short-form-video-apps-now-drive\">'Queen of internet' Mary Meeker says short-form video apps now drive online usage in China</url></p><p>At TikTok, Chandlee is expected to help make the app's operations more local. \"Although ByteDance and its products are mainly driven by algorithms, its operation and commercialisation need to be localised,\" said Xie Pu, founder of tech website Techie Crab. </p><p>Total installations of TikTok are estimated to be 1.2 billion worldwide, according to mobile intelligence firm Sensor Tower. It predicted the app's gross revenue mark to surpass US$100 billion later this month. </p><p>TikTok's overseas success - tapping the universal desire of its users to sing and dance on short videos - stands out in China because even Tencent Holding's dominant messaging and social media platform WeChat has remained essentially a Chinese phenomenon. </p><p>The ByteDance short video app, however, has also had to deal with pressing privacy issues and calls to protect younger users - in line with the entire social media industry. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2019.

It is not only inefficient, it is ineffective. To govern is to confront issues of the day in the name of protecting and promoting the prosperity of one's constituents. And more specifically to American government: to protect the rights and freedoms afforded to citizens by the Constitution.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the time of our nation's founding, the systems put into place to achieve that mission were sufficient. Governmental processes were intended to be slow through a separation of powers. This was a safeguard against government becoming tyrannical, not to mention government didn't have to be fast when information only traveled as fast as the fastest horse. These days, however, information is instantaneous, and our government is constantly trying to catch up.</p><p>Big Tech - companies like Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook - are all trailblazers in their own right, and their inventions have benefited society. On the flip side, their rapid progress has outrun our slow-by-design government's ability to regulate them, giving them free reign to do whatever they want. These companies avoid taxes, invade privacy\u00a0and have been found to be complicit in election manipulation.</p><p>If our government cannot protect itself from Big Tech, how can we expect it to protect us? Worryingly, this is just one example where government policy and action is too little, too late.</p><p>Federal government shutdown sends Madisonians scrambling for innovative, community-based solutionsThe government shutdown didn't just affect government employees. It also affected squirrels. These particular squirrels belong to Hannah Carey, a Read...</p><p>In order for American government to live up to its intended purpose, it must become more efficient. Madison itself has been making great efforts to do this. Eric Upchurch, a representative of the City of Madison Task Force on Government Structure said, \"There is a major disconnect between the people and government,\" and many people don't have the \"time, resources or know-how to voice their opinion.\"</p><p>By trying to get people more involved in government, the city can better understand the wants and needs of citizens, and with that knowledge do a better job of governing.</p><p>Increasing public involvement won't just make government more representative - if done right, it will make it more effective. The public can already vote, call or write their representative, and even protest - but the public should have increased control over legislation.</p><p>Our legislative system is by nature combative - just like a football game, it's two teams trying to one-up another. But unlike a football game, the main goal is to work together to solve issues facing Americans, and to protect their rights.</p><p>Lawmakers need to take an Economics 101 class before recommending nonsensical amendmentsLike many others, I daydream about what former Gov. Scott Walker is doing with all his free time. But I Read...</p><p>Unless a culture of compromise replaces one of opposition, American politics will remain a fight between two parties who take turns forcing their views on the other half of the country. This only creates more polarization and makes compromise harder for no good reason.</p><p>Taking away the power of deciding what issues are discussed from politicians and giving that power to the public kills two birds with one stone. Politicians would spend less time bickering and more time focused on solving issues, and the public gets a government that is truly working \"for the people, by the people,\" as our Founding Fathers intended.</p><p>Over time, American government has drifted from that noble ideal. While the public won't have direct control over parts of legislation any time soon, that doesn't stop us from working towards a more representative democracy. To make American government great, people need to get involved and politicians must be willing to listen, instead of fighting each other.

This is exactly what happened to several unsuspecting Australians last month, when the website Insecam streamed their personal lives online.                     According to an ABC report , Insecam broadcasts live streams of dozens of Australian businesses and homes at any given time. Some cameras can be accessed because owners don\u2019t secure them. Some may be hacked into despite being \u201csecured\u201d.   When asked if they care about their personal information being shared online, most people say they do. A 2017 survey found 69% of Australians were more concerned about their online privacy than in 2012.   However, a much smaller percentage of people actually take the necessary actions to preserve their privacy. This is referred to as the \u201cprivacy paradox\u201d, a concept first studied about two decades ago.   To investigate this phenomenon further, we conducted a research project and found that, despite being concerned about privacy, participants were willing to sacrifice some of it in exchange for the convenience afforded by an internet-connected device.  Unpacking the privacy paradox      Any \u201csmart\u201d device connected to the internet is called an Internet of Things (IoT) device. These can be remotely monitored and controlled by the owners.   The projected growth of IoT devices is staggering. By 2025, they\u2019re expected to reach 75.44 billion \u2013 an increase of 146% from 2020.    The global IoT network is a collection of all the interconnected devices that can communicate online. This includes smart devices, appliances and wearable tech.   Shutterstock    Are device owners genuinely concerned about their privacy ? Recent worldwide anxiety about personal information shared through COVID-19 tracing apps seems to suggest so.   But as the privacy paradox highlights, users expressing privacy concerns often fail to act in accordance with them. They freely divulge personal information in exchange for services and convenience.   Explanations for the privacy paradox abound. Some suggest:   people find it difficult to associate a specific value to their privacy and therefore, the value of protecting it  people do not consider their personal information to be their own and thus might not appreciate the need to secure it  people completely lack awareness of their right to privacy or privacy issues and believe their desired goals (such as a personalised experience) outweigh the potential risks (such as big tech companies using their data for profiling).   The likely explanation for the privacy paradox is a mix of all these factors.  What if we proved your device harvests data?      To understand whether and how the privacy paradox applies to IoT devices, we conducted an experiment involving 46 Saudi Arabian participants. This is because in Saudi Arabia the use of IoT is exploding and the country does not have strong privacy regulations.   We gave participants a smart plug that let them switch a table lamp on or off using an app on their smartphone. We then showed them the device\u2019s privacy policy and measured participants\u2019 privacy concerns and trust in the device.   None of the participants read the privacy policy. They simply agreed to commence with the study.   After two hours, we presented evidence of how much of their data the IoT-connected plug was harvesting, then remeasured their privacy concerns and trust.   After the participants saw evidence of privacy violation, their privacy concerns increased and trust in the device decreased. However their behaviour did not align with their concern, as shown by the fact that:   15 participants continued to use the device regardless  13 continued to use it with their personal information removed  only three opted to block all outbound traffic to unusual IP addresses.   The rest preferred \u201clight-touch\u201d responses, such as complaining on social media, complaining to the device\u2019s manufacturer or falsifying their shared information.   After one month, we measured participants\u2019 attitudes a third time and discovered their privacy concerns and trust in the device had reverted to pre-experiment levels.  How to prevent complacency      Two decades since the first privacy paradox studies were conducted and despite a great deal of research , there is still a mismatch between people\u2019s stated privacy concerns and their protective behaviours. How can we improve this?    Every time you connect a new device to the internet, or opt-in to a new service, ask yourself: \u2018do I really need this?\u2019   Shutterstock    The first step is to simply be aware our judgement of IoT device risks and benefits may not be accurate. With that in mind, we should always take time to read the privacy policies of our devices.   Besides informing us of the risks, reading privacy policies can help us stop and think before connecting a new device to the internet. Ask yourself: \u201cis this really going to benefit me?\u201d   As citizen surveillance increases, it\u2019s not wise to mindlessly scroll through privacy policies, tick a box and move on.   Second, we should not assume our personal information is trivial and would not interest anyone. Time after time we have witnessed how our digital traces can be valuable to malicious individuals or large corporations.   And finally, always change the default password on any new IoT device to a stronger one . Write down this password and secure it, perhaps with other physical valuables, so you don\u2019t have to worry about forgetting it.

Comcast is heavily using such proactive network maintenance (some others call it proactive network management) and CableLabs CEO Phil McKinney sees PNM catching on among more cable operators, he said aboard his parked bus after parts of the Las Vegas Convention Center were partly closed during a power outage (see 1801100027).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Likewise, McKinney sees tech-related industries and networks using smart networks to find and fix software or hardware flaws before hacks happen. Since no one can identify every possible vulnerability before products go live, problems like the recently discovered security flaws in chips that run most cellphones and computers (see 1801050050) might be found in the future by such machine-learning methods, McKinney told us Wednesday.</p><p>It might take years before some other much-discussed developments take root among consumers and video programmers. Cable operators can handle delivering virtual reality and 4K products, but there isn't much programming nor demand now, said McKinney: VR and 4K are \"still pretty nichey\" now. \"It's kind of a chicken and egg problem,\" he said. \"We're probably another three years out before we start seeing some more serious traction\" for VR content, and it may be even longer before studios widely use storytelling where viewers can fully interact with what they're watching (see 1801040011), McKinney said.</p><p>\"There's no growth in the viewership\" of 4K catalogs, the CableLabs chief said. \"People watch it, but then they tune into their other channels, and because the upscalers are so good\" they may not need to watch native 4K to perceive content as having very high resolution, McKinney continued: \"There's no hockey stick\" growth curve for 4K, \"there's not going to be some big adoption.\" Though cable operators and broadcasters in Japan are working on 8K, McKinney sees some similar issues for that format. There aren't \"a lot of cameras out there to capture in 8K, so you have an even worse problem with content,\" he said: \"Nobody in [a] house has a big enough room where you can really see that benefit of 8K\" on a TV set.</p><p>Other new tech is being more widely deployed in cable networks, often aided by machine learning and algorithms that can use many experts' knowledge and big data from monitoring networks, McKinney said. PNM can send technicians out before subscribers report a problem and help customer service representatives pinpoint issues, he said: \"PNM is now pretty darn accurate\" and Comcast is doing it \"very widely.\" CableLabs is licensing, royalty-free, related intellectual property to vendors to include such methods in their network monitoring products that are in turn sold to MVPDs.</p><p>Comcast has widely rolled out PNM, using software and automation to perform functions that used to be done manually and utilizing software-defined networks (SDN), a spokesman said in a separate interview. \"This has been an ongoing process for us; it's kind of been happening for a while. A lot of it is software-deployed, and more is coming.\" Wireless carriers are also using things like SDN to automate their networks, including using software to control elements that used to be more hardware-based. Comcast also is using artificial intelligence to find issues on its network before they become bigger problems, what the representative called \"anomalous situations before they become major service issues.\"</p><p>Calling the recently surfaced security vulnerability \"a very obscure kind of attack\" and \"pretty esoteric,\" McKinney notes that in product design, \"we're going to make mistakes, we're going to make a hole that you don't know about.\" Intelligent networks can find weaknesses and shut down or throttle affected things like ports, as \"I can't solve 100 percent of the problem up front, I've got to think about it as machine learning,\" he said: \"You're not going to have 10,000 people sitting in a network operation center\" and manually \"putting fingers in the dike\" of security problems. \"The sheer number of attacks that the network is under is growing at such an unbelievable rate, you can't scale a human fix, you can't hire enough security experts,\" he said.</p><p>McKinney doesn't see need for a new tentpole-type cable gathering (see 1711290030) to replace what once was the National Show, the Cable Show and most recently INTX. Last year, his group and NCTA held the first, smaller The Near Future gathering (see 1704270040). Asked McKinney: \"Are the trade shows of the past what was really needed?\" Now, \"everybody knows each other\" and programming deals don't get struck at cable shows, he said. \"It takes a lot of time, a lot of money, to put those things on.\" He cited his organization's annual event in Colorado, cable events elsewhere including in Europe, and the Kaitz Dinner in New York as among events that are \"much more focused than the big mega-show.\"</p><p>CES Notebook</p><p>CTA President Gary Shapiro hosted the governors of three leading \"innovation\" states to discuss how they're creating a tech-friendly climate. Shapiro said it was the first time he remembers three governors on the same stage at CES. Rick Snyder, Republican governor of Michigan, said his state \"led the world\" on innovation through World War II, then lost its way. \"We were too successful,\" he said. \"You can't take things for granted. The world changed. We didn't.\" The state has cut taxes and regulations and focused on bringing in engineers and IT professionals and other skilled workers, Snyder said. \"We are the world's leader in mobility, in autonomous and connected vehicles,\" he said. Snyder said a world of autonomous vehicles will pose new challenges. \"What happens to truck drivers, delivery drivers?\" he asked. \"How do we train them for new careers?\" Montana farmers are using lasers, pinpoint applications and other connected technologies, said Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, a Democrat. There's \"scrappy innovation occurring in corners across our state,\" he said. A governor has to be prepared to say to local universities, \"I want a two-year program, I want to make sure that we're providing what our employers and what our innovators need,\" Bullock said. Also appearing with Shapiro was Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R).</p><p>Police and other first responders likely will have uses for the IoT, 5G and maybe even autonomous vehicles, said speakers on FirstNet panels at CES Thursday. \"We want to connect the in-car platform with the body-worn camera platform\" for livestreaming at times, said Chicago Police Department Chief-Technical Services Jonathan Lewin. \"We're not going to have the bandwidth, even with FirstNet, to be real-time streaming all the time.\" The two types of cameras can use wireless to connect, and can upload data, he noted, though \"it becomes a fairly significant cost issue to get there. We will. It just takes time.\" With self-driven automobiles, he said he sees \"great potential there both for improved officer safety and for improved public safety\" and personally thinks the police could use unstaffed autos. Applications like the ShotSpotter gunshot locating service can \"suffer from latency issues,\" but \"we'll take whatever speeds we can get,\" Lewin said. Other panelists agreed some public-safety applications could use 5G, too. AT&amp;T's partnership with FirstNet means the public safety network \"gets to take advantage\" of coming improvements on the carrier's network, said Matt Walsh, the company's director-IoT business development.</p><p>Net neutrality turmoil and increasing skepticism about tech company dominance are big challenges for an industry that largely has enjoyed strong consumer support and light scrutiny by Congress and regulators, said tech and civil society groups at a CES panel Wednesday on the internet economy. The 2016 election was a game changer in focusing attention on fake news and hate speech, forcing tech companies to make decisions on managing controversial content, said Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology. \"The government is asking the private sector to do things they couldn't do on their own,\" she said. Startup companies are particularly worried about the outcome of net neutrality rules, said Engine Policy Director Rachel Wolbers. While initially skeptical about why startups were so concerned about net neutrality before joining Engine, Wolbers said she \"quickly realized how important it is for them to have a level playing field.\" The 2015 net neutrality order provided that certainty by putting bright line rules around what ISPs can and can't do. \"We feel like now those rules have been taken away it will be harder for startups to compete,\" Wolbers said. Engine is concerned about legislation to curb online sex trafficking that's picking up steam in Congress and raises tricky issues especially for small websites, Wolbers said. The Senate hotlined the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (S-1693) Wednesday but Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who has long opposed the bill (See 1801030047), put a hold on it, Wolbers said. \"The House has a better approach\" with the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (HR-1865), which has 173 co-sponsors. \"We are hopeful that can be passed,\" she said. It's unclear whether the two measures could be reconciled since they take very different approaches, she said in response to our question on the future for the legislation. SESTA supporters planned a rally Thursday to draw attention to the bill, which has 64 co-sponsors, with Sen. Rob Portman, D-Ohio, leading the push to get the bill onto the Senate floor. Panelists also expressed concern about the increasing skepticism around big tech and calls to evaluate antitrust issues (see 1712150045). TechFreedom Executive Director Austin Carson urged caution on any new regulations or laws aimed specifically at a technology. \"If you're writing a technology-specific law, you're probably doing it wrong and it will be outdated very soon,\" he said, citing cybersecurity information sharing legislation as an example of where the market addressed problems during the seven years it took a bill to be passed (see 1512180052).</p><p>The \"unprecedented amount of rain\" that fell on Las Vegas Tuesday was the main culprit responsible for the two-hour power outage that blacked out the Las Vegas Convention Center's Central Hall at the midday peak of Day 2 at CES (see 1801100027), said Jeremy Handel, spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), which runs the LVCC. The flooding rains, coupled with \"the accompanying moisture in the air,\" caused \"condensation\" to form on the LVCC's \"electrical equipment which eventually led to the failure,\" said Handel. The National Weather Service reported that a record 1.33 inches of rain fell on Las Vegas Tuesday. Though Central Hall plays home at CES to the largest tech companies in the world, \"we have no evidence\" that the huge power draw from the exhibits on the show floor contributed to the blackout, said Handel. \"We have worked closely with CES, and our many other full-facility shows, to ensure that we have sufficient power for their more than 2.5 million square feet of exhibits,\" said Handel. LVCVA is working with the local power company, NV Energy, \"to evaluate the situation and determine next steps to prevent a similar occurrence in the future,\" he said. NV Energy representatives didn't comment Thursday, but sources friendly to the utility said it had no culpability for the outage. Twitter users kept weighing in on the blackout long after the lights came back on. \"Wonder how fast they locked all the stands down to keep the toys from disappearing in the dark?\" tweeted one. \"I have to say that today's blackout at #CES2018 is a lesson for all of us tech nerds,\" tweeted another. \"Without power, this connected future we envision isn't much, eh? Power is the air for tech.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RCX-4BF1-JC8G-82VD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2004\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 12, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

On that note, CableLabs is putting more of its brainpower behind better security with micronets.</p><p>\"Micronets takes the concept from what the enterprises do with network segmentation, but brews it down to the consumable,\" he said. \"Behind that, though, it brings some AI machine learning. So it actually takes devices that are misbehaving and segments them off into separate networks. CableLabs actually developed software for it, so we got some work that's going to be taking a couple of years yet.</p><p>\"But as those pieces become available, we will take that to open source for the industry so that all the members, and all of the member vendors can take advantage of that. We think security is probably one of those areas that doesn't get enough attention. We need to amend and we need to do more in that area.\"</p><p>After a preconference session on distributed access architecture (DAA) on Monday, which Dzuban said had a record number of 615 attendees, the DAA drumbeat continued during the opening session.</p><p>\"So this (DAA) architecture really needs to be defined by the community so we can launch it to scale,\" Dzuban said. \"That's our job.\"</p><p>Among other features, DAA will give the cable industry a better starting point for virtualized networks and software-defined networking.</p><p>\"Everybody knows software is becoming pervasive and is taking over every aspect,\" Werner said.\"And this is really taking that one step of pushing software that much closer on our network to the customer and giving us a software-defined network all the way to where it really matters on top of DOCSIS. It's just a network that's flexible and more powerful.\"</p><p>In the face of next year's broader rollout of 5G services, Powell said the cable industry didn't get enough credit for its broadband efforts, including the deployment of 1 Gigabit downstream speeds that are becoming pervasive.</p><p>\"You know who does love wired networks? The wireless guy,\" Powell said. \"There is no vision in America's network future that doesn't include a various serious component of fixed architecture, and that fixed architecture path could be led by this industry. We are the most significant infrastructure in this industry today in the United States of America, and to the world. It is our platform on which all innovation and hope for our economy is built upon and promised.</p><p>\"What we should learn from 5G is 5G is 25% technology and 75% marketing. They are storytellers, and they've been doing it for 25 years. What would have been bold three is ago is if we were out talking futuristically about having Gig out to America in a year and get the credit for it that we deserve in the narrative that we lead with.\"</p><p>Powell said the cable industry is sometimes too humble in its storytelling, and his comments drew applause from the conference attendees.</p><p>\"We are the national leader on infrastructure,\" he said. \"We should be the number one voice at the table. We should be the one articulating a future vision, putting consumers, communities, and homes, and governments in that vision, administrating that leadership through our actions. No industry that I'm aware of has been as reliably consistent in doing what it says it was going to do, deploying when it said it was going to deploy, than this one.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Powell on policy</emphasis></p><p>Powell also said that the FCC was governed by a statute that was archaic, perhaps referring to the Telecom Act of 1996.</p><p>\"Most of its provisions do not in any way reflect the reality of the marketplace, the nature of technology, or the technological predicates that underline its original drafting,\" he said. \"It is badly out of date. I think one of the most important things a new chairman could do is be filing off the rough edges of that statute as much as jurisdictionally possible in order to make it better reflect the reality of the marketplace.</p><p>\"I think the second thing you have to do, both through the execution of policy and the use of the bully pulpit, is there's no coherent policy framework that incorporates the big tech companies. We essentially act like they're one market and we're some entirely different market, when there really is a symbiotic relationship between the two, and for that flywheel to turn evenly, requires policy that coherently addresses both sides of that ecosystem and not isolated to one or the other.</p><p>Powell said it was unsustainable to have a world in which some technology was viewed as a completely unregulated, untouched space while incumbent infrastructure companies, by virtue of their legacy, are substantially regulated.</p><p>\"You should be a convener of those communities to try to establish bold and optimistic visions for the United States, that we, as a community working together, can be driving towards the betterment of the information age economy for the American consumer,\" he said. \"Right now, things are too divisive and competitive, as if it's a zero sum game, they're going to win, we're going to lose, our cord is going to get cut, they're going to prevail. That's the way everybody wants to talk about the horse races these days.</p><p>\"The reality is, we need every single ore in the water pulling in the same direction if this country hopes to be standing on the medal podium with the Chinese and everyone else when the history is written of this age.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRCTEL-126101</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRCTEL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJS-B971-DXM4-G4H9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">406691</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1118\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FierceTelecom</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 24, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTZBMDc1MUI2MjU2NDQxOTg5M0M1Q0I0MEUxNzE1Mzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTZGRjRGMTBDNjBFNDQ3NDk4Qjc1MUMwRTRDNDMyNjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

If you've been paying attention, you'll know that Comcast, AT...and Verizon's attack on net neutrality rules[1] was just the tip of a massive, dysfunctional iceberg. Those companies have also convinced the Trump administration to effectively neuter FCC authority over ISPs, and are in the process of trying to ban states from protecting consumers[2] from wrongdoing as well (you know, for freedom or whatever). With neither competition nor even tepid meaningful oversight in place, the kind of bad behavior we've long seen from Comcast appears poised to only get worse. </p><p>At the same time, top lobbyists for the telecom industry continue to insist it's Silicon Valley giants that are in need of massive regulation. You're to ignore, of course, that these calls are coming just as giants like Verizon, AT...and Comcast try to pivot more fully from broadband into online video and advertising, in direct competition with the companies' they're calling to have heavily regulated. Former FCC boss Mike Powell, now the cable industry's top lobbyist over at the NCTA, has been leading this charge for much of the last year or two[3]. Powell was back last week at an industry event insisting once again[4] that government needs to step in and start heavily regulating the companies Powell's clients are trying to compete with:\"I think there is a fundamental underappreciation in policy circles about the extraordinary power of the platforms and the data that rides on these companies and value of that information both as a competitive advantage as a platform and the potential dangers to consumers. 'That has always been a naive concept and one that I think government was entirely inattentive to for too long, only to wake up in 2018 to realize there are some consequences that are not necessarily affirmative.\"Powell's of course trying to play up Silicon Valley's admitted and obvious naivete as it pertains to aiding the amplification of propaganda and racist drivel. But at the same time, of course, he's happy to ignore all of the obvious problems caused by his own sector's growing competition issues[5], which Powell will be happy to tell you don't exist. In fact back in March Powell gave a very similar speech[6] during which he effectively accused Silicon Valley of most of the things the telecom sector has been doing for years:\"Our governmental authorities need to get a handle on what kind of market power and harm flow from companies that have an unassailable hold on large pools of big data, which serve as barriers to entry, allowing them to dominate industries throughout the economy. For years, big tech companies have been extinguishing competitive threats by buying or crushing promising new technologies just as they were emerging. They dominate their core business, and rarely have to foreclose competition by buying their peers. Competition policy must scrutinize more rigorously deals that allow dominant platforms to kill competitive technologies in the cradle.\"While it's obvious that Silicon Valley has plenty of problems that need addressing, listening to Powell's advice (read: Comcast's advice) on these subjects is like getting fire safety advice from a serial arsonist. But for whatever reason it's advice that's clearly resonating in the Trump administration, which pretty consistently has called for antitrust inquiries[7] into major Silicon Valley giants while neutering most meaningful consumer protections (from privacy to net neutrality) governing some of the most clearly anti-competitive and unpopular companies in all of American industry.Permalink[8] |

At the same time, large ISP lobbyists (and the regulators[1], politicians[2] and policy flacks[3] paid to love them) have insisted that it's Silicon Valley companies the public really need to worry about. As a result, ISPs like Comcast and AT...outinely insist that we need new regulations governing companies like Google and Facebook, but entrenched natural monopolies should be allowed to do pretty much whatever they'd like. This of course requires you ignore a few things. One, that the lack of competition in broadband makes the two sectors an apples to oranges comparison. </p><p>Customers frustrated by Facebook's bad behavior can vote with their wallets, something most Comcast customers can't do. You're also supposed to ignore the fact that large ISPs are simply trying to saddle Google and Facebook with additional regulation because they're increasingly trying to challenge them for advertising revenue[4] in the video and media space. This underlying narrative is constant, whether it's FCC boss Ajit Pai weirdly demonizing Netflix[5], to telecom-industry funded smear campaigns that try to suggest Google is a nasty freeloader that doesn't pay for bandwidth[6]. Speaking at a sector trade show in Ireland this week, former FCC boss turned top cable lobbyist Michael Powell dusted off this rhetoric and turned up the volume. He began by insisting the quest for a healthy and open internet was \"irrelevant\" because the real villains are Silicon Valley companies hungrily gobbling up \"mindshare\"[7]:\"Michael Powell, president of NCTA-The Internet ...levision Association, told the crowd at a Cable Congress Dublin event in Ireland Tuesday (March 6) that the network neutrality debate sucks up money, resources and \"mindshare,\" but is increasingly an irrelevant discussion. What isn't irrelevant, he suggested, is for governments in the U.S. and abroad to start looking at tech companies/edge providers like Facebook, their size and power, and the harm they can do to mental health by keeping consumers chasing the dopamine rush of \"likes\" and \"streaks\" as a way to glue them to devices.Right. So again, notice how some of the most despised and least competitive companies in America aren't a problem and should be free from regulation, but Facebook and Google (which again, consumers can choose not to use) require vast expansions in regulatory oversight. Powell, whose tenure at the FCC consisted of comically denying any competition issues whatsoever[8], repeatedly called out Apple, Facebook and Google as the worst sort of villains; villainy that somehow, magically, makes the whole net neutrality conversation moot:\"They have the size, power and influence of a nation state. Antitrust policy has barely begun to address how to check this power to protect consumers and healthy competition.\"...He called the net neutrality debate \"mindless trench warfare\" and said that, as in the First World War, Democratic and activist cries that the battle for an open internet was a war to end all wars would prove wrong. \"Net neutrality policy does not remotely address the issues companies and consumers are facing today and likely will face in the future,\" Powell said. \"Put simply, net neutrality is deeply rooted in engineering, consumer expectations, corporate business models and the norms of internet activity. It is firmly entrenched, and I don't believe the open internet experience will change, whatever the outcome of the current debate.\"So one, Comcast owns NBC and is considering a $31 billion acquisition of European satellite TV provider Sky[9], so it's not clear Powell's the guy to turn to when talking about media consolidation worries. Two, the idea that the \"open internet experience\" won't change if ISPs are successful in their current bid to gut FTC, FCC and state authority over natural monopolies[10] is simply comical. History is filled with endless examples of how a lack of competition or reasonable regulatory oversight of natural monopolies results in higher prices and worse service. In telecom this lack of competition is already profound, routinely exemplified by everything from privacy violations[11] to net neutrality infractions[12]. That's not to say that companies like Facebook and Google don't have their own universe of issues. Both were totally absent from the latest net neutrality fight[13] as they slowly but surely shift from innovation and disruption to turf protection. And there's countless conversations to be had regarding their privacy practices and the country's ugly little disinformation problem. But despised monopolists like Comcast calling for hyper-regulation of companies they're trying to compete with is pretty damn hard to take seriously. When Powell wasn't busy trying to insist that companies like Facebook were to blame for the nation's mental health issues, he was was hypocritically giving the audience lessons on anti-competitive behavior and a respect for consumer privacy:\"Our governmental authorities need to get a handle on what kind of market power and harm flow from companies that have an unassailable hold on large pools of big data, which serve as barriers to entry, allowing them to dominate industries throughout the economy,\" he said. \"For years, big tech companies have been extinguishing competitive threats by buying or crushing promising new technologies just as they were emerging,\" he said. \"They dominate their core business, and rarely have to foreclose competition by buying their peers. \"Competition policy must scrutinize more rigorously deals that allow dominant platforms to kill competitive technologies in the cradle,\" he added.If you've watched the companies Powell represents do business[14], that's pretty funny. As is Powell's claim that Silicon Valley giants have too much influence over government, a claim made just a few months after revolving door regulators sold out the public on net neutrality:\"We have reached a point where governments can no longer coddle and cater to tech companies,\" he said. \"They have become too large, too influential and too indispensable to live above regulatory scrutiny. As a start, we need to reject the 'do no evil' fairytale.\" These companies must be brought back down to earth and regulators must recognize them for what they are: profit-maximizing corporations that have a strong incentive and ability to pursue their own self-interest over the interests of society and consumers.\"Oh no! You mean just like Comcast, and Charter Spectrum? In the heads of many telecom executives, the quest for net neutrality (despite having massive support from the public) was all one mean cabal by Google designed to ruin their good time. But despite this breathless concern for consumer and market welfare, this hysteria serves only one real purpose: to saddle companies Comcast wants to challenge for advertising \"mindshare\" with numerous additional regulations, while leaving entrenched telecom monopolies free to run amok.Permalink[15] | Comments[16] | Email This Story[17] [ 1]: <url

The idea seems to be that customers would enjoy a whizzy Google banking interface, backed by an old-fashioned current account at Citi.</p><p>Given the history of the two institutions, and other recent attempts to mix West Coast tech with East Coast finance, it is tempting to conclude that this venture \u2014 codenamed Cache \u2014 will hit <url normalizedValue=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/11/14/1573764131000/Can-we-all-calm-down-about\u2013Apple-Card-s\u2013gender-bias-/\"> trouble</url>. But that would be too hasty. Silicon Valley has already cracked payments. It is only a matter of time before it overturns more complex banking functions. Citi-Google could be a beachhead.</p><p>From Citi\u2019s point of view, the risks fall into two broad categories. The first we might call \u201cLibra risk\u201d \u2014 the chance that regulators see a massively powerful oligopoly approaching the US financial system and reject the idea outright, as they have done with Facebook\u2019s proposed digital currency.</p><p>This phenomenon is not new: 20 years ago, Walmart tried to get into the retail banking business. After 10 years of trying, and waves of regulatory and political uproar, the retailer raised a white flag.</p><p>Google is therefore wise to outsource the regulated bits of the business to Citi, and avail itself of the New York-based bank\u2019s experience with regulators. But there may still be noise about Google extending its monopoly power to finance. The US Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 was, after all, designed to keep banking and non-banking businesses separate, for fear that a company would use its banking arm to push consumers towards its core business. That idea does not seem so far-fetched today.</p><p>But the regulatory pressure is likely to be heaviest on matters of privacy. Citi will have to hope that both consumers and regulators are prepared to accept Google\u2019s promises that personal information will be used only with consent. Many column inches will be devoted to urging scepticism over that pledge. But experience suggests that if the service is good, customers and US politicians will ultimately prove docile.</p><p>The second big threat is \u201cApple risk\u201d \u2014 a nod to the way the Cupertino-based company tends to capture much of the value from its joint ventures. Mobile carriers, for example, may have thought the new iPhone was a revenue and branding opportunity \u2014 but soon found out that their brands would be invisible to iPhone users, and that Apple would insist on pricing, subsidies and revenue-sharing arrangements that favoured it and its customers.Some analysts have argued that the benefits of Apple\u2019s partnership with Goldman Sachs in credit cards are similarly weighted towards the tech giant, as the card offers a relatively low interest rate and charges no fees.</p><p>Citi may be willing to take that risk because, compared to its megabank peers, it has a small physical footprint in the US \u2014 branches in just six big cities. Citi\u2019s $186bn of US retail deposits are just over one-quarter of Bank of America\u2019s, for example. Citi has been trying, with some success, to increase deposits nationwide by offering online accounts at rates above 2 per cent. Most of BofA\u2019s deposits are interest-free, or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marcus.com/us/en/savings/high-yield-savings\"> nearly so</url>.</p><p>All in, BofA pays 0.8 per cent for its deposit funding; Citi pays almost twice that. On a leveraged bank balance sheet, that is a huge difference, and it goes a long way towards explaining why it is Citi that ended up with Google.</p><p>The partnership may prove a cheaper way to gather deposits than the combination of channels Citi is trying now \u2014 even if Google, one way or another, takes a big cut. And Citi is not taking a shot in the dark here: in Asia, partnerships with tech companies are already a key part of its retail operations. In mainland China, the bank says, 90 per cent of its customers use WeChat to complete everyday banking and credit card transactions.</p><p>The details will matter, of course. But the Google partnership could be just what Citi needs, if both sides can quash concerns over privacy.</p><p>For many years, when asked whether big tech was a competitive threat, bank executives said that ultimately Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon would not want to get involved in a capital-intensive, hyper-regulated industry such as finance. As time passes this sounds less like a coherent argument and more like an expression of hope.</p><p>Fundamentally, a bank is a balance sheet, a data-processing system and a sales force. Silicon Valley companies may be content to leave the balance sheet, the most heavily regulated bit, to the banks. But they are coming for the other parts. If banks such as Citi \u2014 which can trace its roots to 1812 \u2014 are seeking to do deals with them, you can expect plenty more to follow.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:robert.armstrong@ft.com\">robert.armstrong@ft.com</email></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-ac22c4de078b11eaa984fbbacad9e7dd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XHF-MFR1-JB77-K1DK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><timeReceived>4:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 16, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

What that means, exactly, remains vague. The idea seems to be that customers would enjoy a whizzy Google banking interface, backed by an old-fashioned current account at Citi.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Given the history of the two institutions, and other recent attempts to mix West Coast tech with East Coast finance, it is tempting to conclude that this venture - codenamed Cache - will hit trouble. But that would be too hasty. Silicon Valley has already cracked payments. It is only a matter of time before it overturns more complex banking functions. Citi-Google could be a beachhead.</p><p>From Citi's point of view, the risks fall into two broad categories. The first we might call \"Libra risk\" - the chance that regulators see a massively powerful oligopoly approaching the US financial system and reject the idea outright, as they have done with Facebook's proposed digital currency.</p><p>This phenomenon is not new: 20 years ago, Walmart tried to get into the retail banking business. After 10 years of trying, and waves of regulatory and political uproar, the retailer raised a white flag.</p><p>Google is therefore wise to outsource the regulated bits of the business to Citi, and avail itself of the New York-based bank's experience with regulators. But there may still be noise about Google extending its monopoly power to finance. The US Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 was, after all, designed to keep banking and non-banking businesses separate, for fear that a company would use its banking arm to push consumers towards its core business. That idea does not seem so far-fetched today.</p><p>But the regulatory pressure is likely to be heaviest on matters of privacy. Citi will have to hope that both consumers and regulators are prepared to accept Google's promises that personal information will be used only with consent. Many column inches will be devoted to urging scepticism over that pledge. But experience suggests that if the service is good, customers and US politicians will ultimately prove docile.</p><p>The second big threat is \"Apple risk\" - a nod to the way the Cupertino-based company tends to capture much of the value from its joint ventures. Mobile carriers, for example, may have thought the new iPhone was a revenue and branding opportunity - but soon found out that their brands would be invisible to iPhone users, and that Apple would insist on pricing, subsidies and revenue-sharing arrangements that favoured it and its customers. Some analysts have argued that the benefits of Apple's partnership with Goldman Sachs in credit cards are similarly weighted towards the tech giant, as the card offers a relatively low interest rate and charges no fees.</p><p>Citi may be willing to take that risk because, compared to its megabank peers, it has a small physical footprint in the US - branches in just six big cities.</p><p>Citi's $186bn (\u00a3143bn) of US retail deposits are just over one-quarter of Bank of America's, for example. Citi has been trying, with some success, to increase deposits nationwide by offering online accounts at rates above 2 per cent. Most of BofA's deposits are interest-free, or nearly so. All in, BofA pays 0.8 per cent for its deposit funding; Citi pays almost twice that. On a leveraged bank balance sheet, that is a huge difference, and it goes a long way towards explaining why it is Citi that ended up with Google.</p><p>The partnership may prove a cheaper way to gather deposits than the combination of channels Citi is trying now - even if Google, one way or another, takes a big cut. And Citi is not taking a shot in the dark here: in Asia, partnerships with tech companies are already a key part of its retail operations. In mainland China, the bank says, 90 per cent of its customers use WeChat to complete everyday banking and credit card transactions.</p><p>The details will matter, of course.</p><p>But the Google partnership could be just what Citi needs, if both sides can quash concerns over privacy.</p><p>For many years, when asked whether big tech was a competitive threat, bank executives said that ultimately Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon would not want to get involved in a capital-intensive, hyper-regulated industry such as finance. As time passes this sounds less like a coherent argument and more like an expression of hope.</p><p>Fundamentally, a bank is a balance sheet, a data-processing system and a sales force. Silicon Valley companies may be content to leave the balance sheet, the most heavily regulated bit, to the banks. But they are coming for the other parts. If banks such as Citi - which can trace its roots to 1812 - are seeking to do deals with them, you can expect plenty more to follow.</p><p>ARTICLE REPUBLISHED FROM THE FINANCIAL TIMES</p><p>Silicon Valley has already cracked payments.

In the interim, San Francisco Bay area housing developer Alastair Mactaggart launchedCalifornians for Consumer Privacy and qualified the CaCPA for the November 2018 ballot. As drafted, CaCPA had a provision that would only permit amendment if approved by 70 percent of each house of the legislature (and only if the amendments were ' consistent with and further the intent of' the CaCPA). The legislature reached an agreement with Mactaggart to pass a version of the CaCPA so long as he withdrew the initiative and in a period of seven days the CaCPA went from inactive to being signed by the Governor on June 28th. As Santa Clara Law School Professor Eric Goldman noted1  The result is asweeping, lengthy (10,000 words!), insanely complicated, and poorly drafted privacy regulationthat will govern the world's fifth largest economy. </p><p>Needless to say, this rushed and non-inclusiveprocess created a law with many defects, ranging from typos and drafting errors to terrible policyideas. A subsequent technical corrections bill was signed by Governor Brown on September23,2018.(2) Who Does It Apply To?The requirements of the CaCPA extend to a business that(a) collects, transfers or sell personal information of a California consumer and (b) either: Has annual gross revenue in excess of $25 million; or Purchases, receives, sells or shares the personal information of 50,000 or more 'consumer, households or devices'; or Derives 50 percent or more of its annual revenues from selling consumers' personal information. An IAPP analysis found that the first prong alone would apply to over 500,000 businesses.2 One commentator raised concerns about the second prong of the test, fearing that the 50,000 'consumer, households or devices'threshold may ensnare most online retailers and even bloggers just by the passive collection of IP addresses.3 As Santa Clara Law Professor Eric Goldman noted in his recent letter to the legislature [2](which the Internet Law Center joined): The definition of 'business' likely reaches many smallbusinesses, including low-margin retail businessesthat store 137 unique credit cards a day and tinyad-supported websites/blogs that get only 137unique visitors per day. The law does not address whether non-California based activities are included in the threshold definition. In the same letter, Professor Goldman noted: Forexample, the $25M threshold equally applies to businesses that receive all revenues from Californiaresidents and businesses that receive only $1of revenue from California residents. If so, a business without any ties toCalifornia must comply with the CCPA (at substantial expense )the moment it accepts a single dollar from a California resident.(3) CaCPA Enumerated RightsCaCPA explains that California law 'has not kept pace' with the privacy implications surrounding the increased collection, use and protection of consumer information. 'California consumers should be able to exercise control over their personal information, and they want to be certain that there are safeguards against misuse of their personal information.' As a result, the legislation states that it is seeking to further Californians' Constitutional right to privacy by giving consumers an effective way to control their personal information, by ensuring the following rights: (1)The right of Californians to know what personal information is being collected about them. (2)The right of Californians to know whether their personal information is sold or disclosed and to whom. (3)The right of Californians to say no to the sale of personal information. (4)The right of Californians to access their personal information. (5)The right of Californians to equal service and price, even if they exercise their privacy rights.(4) What is 'Personal Information'CaCPA's obligations extend to 'personal information' of a California resident, which it defines broadly to include 'any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.' The Act provides a list of examples of data sources that are personal information including personally identifiable information, IP address, browsing information, biometric and geolocation data etc., but the definition also includes inferencesdrawn from these sources.(5) Privacy Policy DisclosuresPrior to collecting Californian's personal data, businesses must disclose in their privacy policy: 'the categories of personal information to be collected and the purposes for which the categories of personal information shall be used' (with any additional uses requiring notice to the consumer); lists of the of the categories of personal information it has collected, sold or disclosed; and a description of the consumer's rights under the Act including its right to opt-out, to request data deletion and how to request information on the data the business collected, disclosed or sold. Businesses also must provide a clear link on their homepage titled, 'Do Not Sell My Personal Information,' to a page that enables consumers to opt-out out of the sale of its personal information. See IAPP,CaCPA: What To Disclose and Where To Disclose It[3]. (6) Disclosure Requests and Opting Out Businesses must make 'two or more' methods for consumers, including a toll-free number and website, for consumers to exercise the disclosure rights under the Act. This includes requesting that a business that collects, transfers or sells their data to disclose to that consumer free of charge within forty-five days of a 'verified' request:the categories of personal information it has collected about that consumer; the sources from which the personal information is collected; the purpose for collecting or selling personal information; the categories of third parties with whom the business shares personal information; and the specific pieces of personal information it has collected about that consumer.The consumer information provided must be in a 'readily useable format' (i.e., data portability). The consumer may request that a business delete any personal information or opt-out of the further sale or transfer of such data (subject to exceptions such as if the data is needed to perform the service for the consumer). (7) Non-Discrimination CaCPA provides that businesses 'shall not discriminate against a consumer because the consumer exercised any of the consumer's rights under this title' by denying service or offering different services or prices based on the exercise of rights under the Act - except where it is 'reasonably related to the value provided to the consumer by the consumer's data.' How this is interpreted remains to be seen. Businesses, however, may offer financial incentives to consumers for the use of their data on an opt-in basis.(8) Consent for MinorsWhile CaCPA generally establishes an opt-out regime, that is not the case for consumers under the age of 16. Businesses may not sell the personal information of consumers under 17 years without the affirmative consent of the consumer if aged 13-16 or a parent or guardian if under 13.(9) PenaltiesEnforcement of the statute is generally by the California Attorney General who may recover up to $7,500 per intentional violation and $2,500 for an unintentional violation that is not cured within thirty (30) days of notice. CaCPA provides for a limited private right of action to a consumer 'whosenonencrypted or nonredacted personal information. . . is subject to an unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of the business' violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to protect the personal information.' An injured consumer may recover $750 per incident but must give prior notice and an opportunity to cure to the business before filing suit.(10) CaCPA Compliance As a Moving TargetCaCPA originally was to go into effect on January 1, 2020, although the law as amended gives the California Attorney General until July 2, 2020, to implement regulations on a variety of items - including procedures for processing consumer requests. The Attorney General may not begin any enforcement action until the earlier of (i) six months after the regulations have been published and (ii) July 1, 2020. As a result, businesses are being asked to comply with what is, in essence, a moving target. The Attorney General's office has started the process by having open meetings across the state in which participants may make or submit comments, but the Attorney General's office merely listens and does not comment.(11) The Battle over CaCPA Moves to WashingtonPassage of CaCPA also has stirred debate in other state capitals and in Washington. Big Tech has been meeting with the Trump administration[4] over a potential federal privacy bill that would likely preempt the California law. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a think tank supported by Google, Amazon and Facebookreleased a reportcalling for a 'Grand Bargain' on a federal privacy law[5] that it describes as a bold new privacy framework that expands and simplifies consumer data privacy rights, reduces compliance costs from existing state and federal regulations, and paves the way for more data-driven innovation. The 'grand bargain' would continue existing opt-out consent requirements, except for critical services collecting sensitive personal data. It rejects the notion of 'privacy by design' as well as data-minimization/data retention limitations and the right to be forgotten that is found in European law. In addition, it also rejects any private right of action to remedy violations. The 'grand bargain' was quickly criticized by privacy advocates. In 2003, Congress passed the CAN-SPAM Act less than 90-days after California attempted to ban spam and prior to the bill going into effect. Privacy, however, is a much more complex subject that would involve the jurisdiction of multiple committees in both houses making a quick consensus more difficult to achieve. In a three-part series for the IAPP[6], Robert Gellman outlines the challenges of passing a U.S. privacy law and concludes: It is apparent that there are many obstacles: substantive, procedural, and political. If everyone worked in good faith, it's conceivable that something acceptable could emerge in a few years. However, I don't think that there is enough consensus in the U.S. privacy world to have much hope right now. Maybe the dynamic will change as the EU moves to enforce the GDPR. Maybe not.(12) What Should You Do?Whether it is the EU's GDPR or CCPA, businesses need to be ready for a potential new era of privacy scrutiny and should: begin to map and inventory the data they collect and how it is used and shared (this includes assessing the need for such data consistent with GDPR data minimization), as this will be needed for disclosures for data collected/share in the prior twelve months once the law goes into effect; determine operationally what steps they would need to take to respond to information requests under CaCPA; consider creating separate websites for California users; contact your state representatives (link [7]to find out your California Assemblyman/Senator) and/or members of Congress[8].ResourcesSee notes below; Professor Solove's California Consumer Privacy Act resources page[9];Lydia de la Torre's comparison of GDPR and CACPA[10];and theAssembly Committee On Privacy And Consumer Protection's analysis of the CaCPA (immediately below)//<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scribd.com/embeds/386612047/content?start_page=1...w;_mode=...ess;_key=key-jcspfhSeSMI7R7GPPN4A\">www.scribd.com/embeds/386612047/content?start_page=1...w;_mode=...ess;_key=key-jcspfhSeSMI7R7GPPN4A</url>[11] View this document on Scribd[12]NOTES1 Goldman, Eric, An Introduction to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)[13] (July 9, 2018). 2 Rita Heimes ...m Pfeifle, New California Privacy Law to Affect More Than Half A Million US Companies[14],IAPP (July 2, 2018). 3Lothar Determann,Analysis: The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018[15],IAPP (July 2, 2018). Most companies operate websites and inevitably capture IP addresses. Notably, companies need to comply regardless of whether the website targeted businesses or individual customers in California given that the term 'consumer' is defined to mean any 'resident.' Even individual bloggers and relatively small businesses outside California may find it difficult to ensure that they do not receive personal information of more than 50,000 California resident visitors to their website annually, simply from having it be passively accessible from there, and, within California, most retailers, fitness studios, music venues and other businesses will meet this threshold.

Thanks to both of you for joining us again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION: Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: We can start with the 4 initiatives. So if you can maybe walk through how you've been tracking against those and maybe grade yourself on the implementation of each today. It's early but...</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Well, I know we talked about going back a couple of years, actually, even the Investor Day we sponsored a year ago in April, we talked about these 4 cornerstone initiatives. And one of them was invest in our loyalty and our hospitality programs. And on that one, we think we've done a really good job of increasing the weighting of Total Rewards on hospitality customers and generating a much faster growth rate on that business than we had before. Part of that was also getting our Total Rewards customers growing again, and that's investment loyalty part of that. And we beat our objective every year on that. It's a board objective for me, and so we've gotten it growing. And in fact, we're growing even the $100 segment, which is the hardest segment for us to grow. And this year, we're showing nice growth in that segment. But on the VIP end, over the last couple of years, if you take the 2 years together, it's more than double-digit growth. So feel good about our growth. Continuous Improvement culture, we talked about having that. And on that one, we definitely beat our own expectations. We've taken almost 11% out of our -- of FTEs in our workforce. We continue to show progress every single quarter. And then, when it comes to marketing efficiencies, we took $55 million out year-over-year in the first quarter. So that one's -- we've hit it. We've talked -- part of our -- was to reinvest in the infrastructure and that was the room renovation projects, right? So those have over-delivered without pace, I think, year-over-year. If you look at the RevPAR growth of The Strip compared to us, we've been usually over double. Even in the most recent quarter, people are projecting 1% to 3%, and we're projecting 4% to 6%. So that's only about 55% of the way on our journey on that one. And then trading a sales culture. This is something that we call our Suggest program. And again, we have goals and objectives for everything, and measurements. And for the last -- every year, the last 2 years since we've had it, we beat our -- all of our internal goals on that, and we're getting increases at every customer interface. We trained 47,000 people, frontline facing people, on 2 different levels of Suggest, we call the Suggest program. Even housekeepers are taught to ask guests, is there anything they can do or remind them of something in the facility. So we've trained everyone on that. Eric, do you want to add to that?</p><p>ERIC HESSION, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION: No. I think you said it well. Beyond that, we've also talked about growing beyond the same-store basis that we have. And we made 3 announcements earlier in the year about some asset-light transactions, a project in Dubai that's opening in the fourth quarter. The tribal casino, Buena Vista, that's going to open in the beginning of the second quarter. And then our Cabo project, which is about 2 years out. And so for a company that, for 3 years, had to improve our operations on a same-store basis, having that growth in the future is certainly something that management's looking forward to. And we're also preparing to close the Centaur transaction in early July. So from a growth of our footprint perspective, we're very excited to start on that path. We've laid out the projects well, we're just now starting to get the benefit of that in the second half of the year.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: So you mentioned the move to this more asset-light approach. How are you -- how are these being structured and how do you think that's a bigger opportunity, and how quickly could that ramp up?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Well, we've, I know, put out there that we make $5 million to $10 million roughly of EBIT on each one of these projects. And we've announced 3 right away. We have an organization that's in development. I call it the development organization that has grown, and we've structured the world out regionally. We have regional Vice Presidents, have invested in the sales organization. And then on M&amp;A and strategy, Eric has reporting to him a really good team that we've added to the team in order for us to be more nimble, more quick and looking at opportunities. And then once we get them, we have now even an integration team that is headed by a new guy I recruited, Brent Lessing, and anyways, that's -- but we're staffed, we think, and we're ready for these growth platforms that we've talked about.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: And other more broad topic that we've been addressing yesterday and a little bit today is actually sports betting. So with the change in PASPA, how do you think about that opportunity in positioning yourself?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Just the sound bite is that there's $150 billion of illegal sports betting today. We think that, that market could be much bigger than $150 billion, the handle, if, in fact, you had the right technology and the right education of people doing the technology like they do in the U.K. So we index about 1/6 of that business. So we think it's a big opportunity, and we think we're the most well positioned, because we have 36 facilities here in the U.S., we're licensed in 14 states. We have -- we're in a position in New Jersey to immediately take advantage of that state, which is likely to pass, obviously, in August or September of this year in the Mississippi. We think there's going to be 30 states. Everyone kind of has their own opinion of when that's going to occur, the first 12, first 8. But I think you're going to find it'll accelerate over the next couple of months, because once a couple of states do it, it has a tendency to make all the other states feel mad because they aren't. So I'm hoping that it accelerates. In terms of us, we believe we have bricks and mortar, obviously, where you can have a sports book and we can retrofit existing space very easily. We have a mobile and online team that we inherited from our Caesars interactive days. They're still here, 60% of that population's still here. They didn't go when we sold it, the Playtika business. So we've been getting ready for sports betting for a year. And so we feel like we're in a really good position and making sure we pick the right partners and be able to accelerate that growth if need be over the next couple of years.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: So you generally view that as a -- what would be a profitable business or is it more a driver?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Yes. No, I think it's profitable. I think if you think about it strategically, it's a business that's software. It's people -- the online business, the margins of companies like a William Hill or a GVC, it's a range between 20% and 30%. It's not really a bricks and mortar game. In terms of investing in the infrastructure, there's like a lot of retail, small little ones in U.K. I don't even know if you need those, if you think about the future of online betting and gaming. I know gaming is coming next, I hope. But just on the betting side, I'd say that the online applications today are so good that you're going to have a mixture and not very much, again, CapEx on us until I get that business. But yet it helps our existing infrastructure. It will drive volume to our facilities, we know that.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: Now, you mentioned you hope gaming comes next. Is online gaming a positive or is that a threat?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: We studied it in New Jersey really well. We've done so many studies on this. And we know it's positive. I mean, we don't think or guess, it is a positive. It would lift your revenue once it matures probably in your bricks and mortar 1% to 2%, which is a big number. These are big numbers, if we're going to lift overall gaming revenue 1% to 2% on a casino, that's meaningful.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: Now you had mentioned that the software game -- on a number of the calls recently, you've thrown out some of the big tech buzzwords like machine learning, AI. Can you elaborate more on what the biggest changes have been, especially because I think most investors already perceive you as having a pretty robust platform?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Yes. I think, Eric, I know, runs a lot of that and, Eric, why don't you give some examples of some great programs we've implemented or are implementing.</p><p>ERIC HESSION: Yes, sure. I think you're absolutely right, that we have a history of having lots of data. The difference in the last 4 or 5 years is that we've been able to aggregate that data and then there have been advances through third parties, like Google and Amazon and others that have provided tools that have allowed us to analyze that data in different ways that we weren't able to do, 3 years ago, let's say. We just finished a project to move all of our data -- customer data into a single record. So we're doing that with salesforce.com and that will allow us to do real-time -- have updated information real-time and be able to use that to better respond to the customers more quickly. What it will also allow us to do is to have that single point of record, so that we're able to analyze it through these big data techniques. One of the ones that I think is most exciting that we did recently is that when you think about our business model, we have a customer that we want to make a trip. And so we'll offer that customer a package of a room, food and beverage, entertainment of some value and then the customer accepts that and comes visit and decides how much they're going to pay for that, while they're on the trip. So we don't know how much they're going to spend. We have to try to predict what that amount is and that can wide -- vary widely. We're generally pretty good in aggregated predicting, but it's a very dispersed curve. And so the ability to be able to predict what that next trip is worth is very valuable to the marketers. And so we did a test internally where we used TensorFlow to try to predict what that next trip was going to be worth, and the TensorFlow model put back a prediction that was much better than what we were able to do previously internally. And so we're very excited about that. And then we took that a step further and we did similar to what Netflix did, where they sponsored a contest. And so we didn't spend $1 million, but we put a $250,000 prize and we camouflaged the data and asked them to try to beat our internal team score, on being able to predict the customer using an algorithm. And the good news is, when you do these contests, you actually get the code from all of the programmers from around the world. And so happily, they beat us, our internal team, as you'd expect, because they're professionals. And we then got to keep the code, and we got to look at it and we paid out the top 3 prizes, and took the best concepts from their 3 models and even beat the winner with a new model. And that's what we rolled out. And what it does is it dramatically improves our accuracy in predicting what that next trip is going to be worth. It's really interesting when you look at the feedback that you get from these models, because you can't -- it's unlike Excel, you can't drill back into what's driving it, you just kind of get an answer. And so it's a little -- you don't really know exactly how the machine's working, but it tells you this and you can test whether it's better than another approach and it's much better. So we started using that in the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter, and it really is going to help us improve our accuracy of the marketing dramatically. And there are a number of use cases that we've identified. We sponsored 6 of them earlier last year because they're very expensive to run, takes a lot of resources and time. But you can see that the value associated with each one of these, if they're successful, is very large.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: So I guess a related question on that. So you mentioned continuous improvement. You've already had pretty good success in terms of being more efficient with marketing. Are you seeing any change in the competitive dynamic? Is anybody else using something similar and does that impact the model?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Well, I think we've seen in every market that we test and then reduce, if you will, we see responses that are -- seem to be following suit. There seems to be a tendency to try to reduce some of the incentives that we provide, which is basically free gaming, for people to come in. I think everyone would say that, philosophically, we should create a different customer experience, and that's what drive customers to us, not give away product in order for them to come, right, because typically, that means they're going to switch the moment someone else comes up with a better incentive. So it doesn't make your customers very loyal, all right, by giving them just money to come back. So we think that we've seen a general responsiveness to it. We led in '15, we had a huge improvement in marketing, probably a couple -- almost a couple hundred million dollars. And we don't think there's -- at this point, we don't see an end to it. We keep peeling back the onion, finding that these layers that we do of offers, of 7 or 8 layers of offers on the same day to the same customer, we keep testing and saying, okay, what's optimal, is it 2 offers a day, is it 3, do we get incrementality when we do that? And every time we test, we seem to find opportunities. But we're also, as Eric talked about, looking to test by giving different things to increase revenue, not just try to be more efficient, but also increase the revenue based on different types of offers that have more meaning behaviorally to customers. We find that just giving money actually doesn't incent them, but giving them a prize where they win something, could be a little prize that cost us nothing, that induces much more better behavior about playing with us more than giving the real money awards to them. In fact, there's an AI project on that which determined the right behave -- the behavioral patterns of our customers and what really does incent them.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: Right. So maybe if we start looking at some of the individual markets. On Las Vegas, what's embedded in your RevPAR assumption for the year as you think about underlying market growth versus renovations versus conventioning calendar and then some of your other initiatives?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Okay, well, I'll take a stab and, Eric, please add in. I think that, in general, our room renovation projects are going to be about 50% of the way through. So, obviously, every time we renovate a room, we get $20 to $40 range kind of lift and it drops through primarily the bottom line. We have another couple of years where we're going to be doing 4,000 to 5,000 rooms a year, the next couple of years, and we'll be through. So I think that you look at 2021, and we'll have cycled through kind of this, what I call, outsized growth that's driven by lot of room renovation projects, plus we have always under-indexed, if you will, to a lot of the other operators like an MGM because they have much higher convention business, and that convention business drives, on average, $130 to $150 more per room night. The rates are usually generally higher, and they get a lot more incremental food and beverage, most of that's food and beverage at high margins. So as we build our convention center and get that up and operational, that will cycle in about the same time that the room renovation projects get back to their normal cycle, where we won't be so far behind like we were probably 5 years behind and we should be caught up. And I think that will help us as terms of earnings momentum. Eric, anything you want to add?</p><p>ERIC HESSION: I think the only thing I'd add is that our revenue management team is very accurate at predicting what our RevPAR is going to be 1 or 2 months out, within 1%, let's say. And so when we make our estimates, it's informed by their experience and their ability to predict, which is -- a couple of months is very accurate. Once you get out more towards the 6 months or so, it's still quite accurate and that's why we provide a slightly wider range. But we provided a 4% to 6% RevPAR growth range for this year. And that's informed by the amount of groups that we have on the books, which is basically all of them at this point. And it's also informed by the pace of the FIT customer that had improved towards the back half of that first quarter. So that information and assuming that, that trend continues, which generally, again, unless there's some major disruption, that trend does continue and that's why they're able to predict so well, that gives us the confidence that we'll achieve the 4% to 6% growth rate from a RevPAR perspective that we're predicting in the back half of the year. And when you compare that to the expectations that are out there for The Strip as a whole, it's also consistent with the prior couple of years where we've been outperforming by 300 basis points or so, largely on the back, as Mark said, of the room renovation process.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: So a follow-up to Mark. I think you referenced the bringing on convention. A number of your peers are also expanding either convention or meeting space. Is there such thing as too much of a good thing within convention and does that change how you would even have to target consumers? Is that a different customer than what you have been?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Well, I think, again, if you look at the Flamingo and the LINQ and Harrah's, right there in the back, they were -- these facilities were designed 75 years ago, 70 years ago. And so they had no meeting space or very little. So again, I don't remember the exact numbers, but I think we indexed like -- we're 1 quarter what the average other property hotel is at in terms of relationship to meeting room size and convention space per square foot. So we believe that because we have demand for our facilities and there are people that would hold meetings that are even Total Rewards customers, we don't have the issue of, let's say, expanding capacity. We'll fill it. We're positive and I've already booked it. However, at some point, you're right; I mean, there's going to be some increase in capacity, but we haven't -- the studies that have been done in Las Vegas, like the Las Vegas convention bureaus, they're doubling the size of the Las Vegas convention, and that's going to be over the next -- they've -- essentially, that capacity, I think, will be filled by the time they finish. And MGM, I know they're building out some more stuff. And I'm sure they've done their studies on it, but there will be increased demand because of the NFL, the hockey team, the music venue of MSG, the relationship that's going on close to The Venetian, that's all going to drive demand and yet, there's not that much capacity in terms of room product for another 4 years, 5 years. So all that bodes well for adding some convention space and meeting space. Now remember, we're building what I would call meeting space, not true convention space -- exhibit space. We're not talking about big exhibits. These are more medium-size meetings that companies have. And it's very efficient to hold your meeting here in Vegas and you get -- \"here in Vegas,\" sorry, we're not in Vegas right now. But if we were in Vegas, I'd say that. And it's also -- but when you're in, obviously, meeting attendance, meeting planners will tell you, attendance goes up when you hold it in Vegas. I don't know why that is, but it does. And so it's very productive to have your meetings in Vegas, all of you out there. You know that, it's very productive, because people will attend them. And so we think it's a good solution. Anything to add to that, Eric?</p><p>ERIC HESSION: Yes, the only other thing is that the capacity limiting factor we have is hotel rooms, not necessarily convention space. And the convention space when we rank it in terms of the priority relative to all of our gaming customers and all of the other segments, it's one of the top 3 segments that we have. So adding more convention space, what it'll do is displace the lower worth customers, particularly in the mid-week period where we have a lot of the FIT and the third-party business. And so even if the city continues to build convention space, it's still very high worth room nights because of the dynamic associated with the banquet spend and the ancillary spend that the conventioneers deposit.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Yes. We can -- when a normal exhibition takes place or a convention takes place, the entire Strip benefits in terms of room rates. So anything that brings 20,000 people or more, generates incremental revenue lift for the properties.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: So in Las Vegas, you already have some of the best-in-class margins. Where can that go over time? And is that -- when you try to do benchmarking versus peers, is that really apples-to-apples?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: I'm not sure I understand the question, maybe I just...</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: I'm trying to understand where margins in Las Vegas can go in terms of where the -- and how flow-through may...</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Well, we still think that we're under-indexed, I'll say roughly 20 bucks a night on room products. We have comparable products. But our pricing is not as high as our competitors at the same grade. And I think part of it is a hangover effect, not that The Hangover movie that was filmed at Caesars Palace has anything to do with my comment, but part of it's a hangover effect that we've had, because we've had 7 or 8 years kind of under-spending, if you will. And I think that as we continue to revive all the room product, we'll get a lift and continue to get a lift.</p><p>ERIC HESSION: Yes, just if you do simple math, the -- if your fastest-growing segment, which is the hotel, is also your highest margin vertical, then your margins are going to increase. So as long as RevPAR goes up in Las Vegas, our margins will expand. And so we're projecting this year to have expanded margins fairly significant, and we'd certainly expect to do that, and then next year looks like another good year with groups coming in solidly. So I wouldn't -- I would certainly expect margins to continue to go up. Our goal -- we challenge our operators to offset inflation every year. We give them that target in the bonus setting process and to the extent that we're able to do that and get improving revenues, then you really have great flow-through like we've been able to deliver the last 3 to 4 years.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: Great. On the capital allocation front, I guess, why pay down debt, repurchase, reinvest, think about a dividend, think about all those things? What's the thought process?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Eric, do you want to add?</p><p>ERIC HESSION: Do you mean in terms of the balance?</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: Yes.</p><p>ERIC HESSION: Yes. So we -- as Mark mentioned earlier, we have a little bit of a capital deficit in our hotel rooms, and we have a plan to put that in place and to catch up over the next 3 years. So in terms of cash usage, the first priority for us is to make sure that our assets are kept up in terms of their quality, that we're paying all of our other bills, we're paying our interest expense and our lease payment, and that we're catching up on this deferred CapEx. Then secondarily, we have some large projects out there, the convention center, the career development and if we're lucky enough to get our license extended in New Orleans, that would involve some capital. So once those are taken care of, then we have kind of discretionary cash flow. And that, over the next 5 years, is predicted to be very significant, regardless of what models you run. We have decreasing capital spend in the core and increasing EBITDA projections driven by a number of factors that we just discussed. So then you'd say, what do you do with that capital? We really have to take a balanced approach. We're relatively late in the cycle. So we've said that we want to reduce our leverage down to around 4.5x. a reasonable pace given today's information and where we are would have us achieving that. We could certainly accelerate that. If interest rates go up, we'd absolutely do that faster. If projects' availability and the returns of them go down, we'd certainly delever faster. The challenge is that the borrowing costs right now are very low and to allocate capital towards direct repayment of debt is challenging given these borrowing costs. But obviously, that can change based on the economy. Conversely, we believe that repurchasing our shares provides a very high IRR. We have allocated $500 million to do that, and the pace of that will be balanced based on those other factors that we just talked about. And similarly, there's a lot of M&amp;A activity out there, as I'm sure you see and as everybody's doing. The challenge is the prices have really come up, and that drives the returns down and that changes that dynamic in terms of the capital allocation. So what we're trying to do is to focus on our core business and make sure that we have sufficient capital to maintain and grow our core business, and then remain balanced and flexible with these other 3 categories of capital deployment.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: So on the consolidation front, you referenced that it seems like it's picked up a little bit. Are you finding that -- as much as valuations have come up, are more of the things that fit your criteria coming to market? And how does the acceleration, seems like in the REIT space, also dictate your view in terms of sources of capital?</p><p>ERIC HESSION: Yes. I think the short answer is that there are a lot of appealing assets out there. The challenge that we have is that we also have a scarcity of resources and we need to balance the pursuit of those acquisitions. Given our centralized cost structure, the use of the REIT and the Total Rewards, nearly any project would generate a positive return. So we're triaging those and ranking them against other alternatives. Right now, we're trying to integrate Centaur, which is very important because the synergies are high and we want to get those as quickly as we can. We're trying to open our Dubai project, we're getting ready to do Buena Vista, and so there's only a limited amount of resources. Now, the good news in gaming is if we were to do an acquisition, we probably would take 6 months for approval through the regulatory process, so you could do that, cycle it in. But what that also means is that we can't do too many projects at the same time, and we really need to prioritize. There are some projects that, absent other things that we would be working on, would be modestly accretive or slightly financially accretive to the company, but they probably don't make sense to pursue today because we can only really focus on big strategic initiatives because of the amount of activity that's out there.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: Great. We got about 5 more minutes. So if there's questions in the audience, happy to take them or continue up here. I can see one hand up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I was wondering if you could just discuss your consent solicitation and exchange offer that kind of outlined in the S-4 listing?</p><p>ERIC HESSION: Sure. So one of the messages that we've been trying to convey over the last year, 1.5 years, is the simplification of our capital structure. We want to make strides every quarter to try to do transactions that make it simpler. The convert adds a little bit of complexity to that. It also is treated as debt from a ratings agency perspective. It does incur about $60 million of interest expense. And so from our standpoint, we thought that getting rid of the convert, to the extent we're able to, through the tender offer, would be a positive action for the equity. We could do it in a couple of ways. One is through one-off transactions. We run into a few problems with that, such as the creeping tender rule if we're trying to get a significant portion of it. It's also then we run into an issue where we have a buy back in place and we're issuing shares at the same time, which we can't do. So we thought that the tender was the right approach. The S-4 is the initial step in that, where we submit the S-4, the SEC will review it, they might have comments or they might not. Once we finalize that and it goes effective, then during an open trading window, we would be able to launch the tender and the tender would last for 20 days, and we'd hopefully tender for the entire amount or as much of the convert as we could get, paying the premium in cash and converting the rest of the face value of the convert into shares.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: What's the time line? Or do you have a time line in mind?</p><p>ERIC HESSION: It depends a little bit on the SEC review. It could be as fast as 30 days, in which case, we would then technically be effective and we could launch the tender offer. The challenge is it has to be in an open window. So if I were to speculate, by the time the SEC reviews and approves, and we go effective, we'll likely be in a closed period due to the duration of the quarter. And so I think the real -- the earliest that we could reasonably expect to do this would be right after we report our second quarter earnings, which will be in kind of mid-August.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And, I guess, just given kind of where the share price is, how do you think the convert -- I mean, I guess, tendering would go?</p><p>ERIC HESSION: Well. So the share price, it's well in the money, the convert trade's around 180-or-so right now. The price of the convert is $7.30. And so what we're offering is to convert the face value of the notes into shares. So the number of shares would be known, and it's really just the premium that we'd be paying. And the premium that we're paying is a combination of the present value of the future interest payments plus the option premium associated with that and then plus some spread that would entice the convert holders to tender their shares. Usually, that's around 200 to 400 basis points. But overall, the amount of cash that we would expect to deploy for this would be between, say, $200 million to $250 million depending on the ultimate price of the stock.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: Another one upfront.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can you just talk about the ability to additional deals with a REIT and (inaudible)?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Yes, I think, earlier, we talked about it a little bit, that it's really a resource type thing. I think from our perspective, we don't want to be doing 2 integrations at the same time. And so we'd want to sequence the transactions. At this point, after the Buena Vista deal, there should be an opportunity to do additional acquisitions. And as we talked about earlier, the pricing that's out there in the environment, really, encourages the use of the REITs. So we'd look at it from a strategic standpoint and a timing standpoint, and evalue that -- evaluate that versus the other opportunities that we have.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: And maybe, Mark, can you update us on what speed -- you mentioned Korea, what's going on there; and then also, if you could discuss just capital allocation internationally?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Sure. On Korea, we're in the middle of project now. It's under construction, it's Incheon, Korea. We have a joint venture partner who's put in 50% into that entire project, a very big and good well-funded partner who we'll announce at some point. And that project is kind of historic for us. It's our first real footprint in Asia and does get, obviously, a big Chinese customer play there and that's some of the restrictions have been in place are starting to get lifted. We likely won't see it open until 2021, but it'll be -- it's a very nice facility, it's a Caesars Palace and it's on the China Sea. So we're looking forward for that and our people that are in international marketing, that full-time recruit, international customers are very excited by it. It really is helpful for us strategically. That is not going to -- we've been planning for that. So it doesn't impact, if you will, our leverage or anything else. This is something that's right in the flow of what we expect to do. Other international projects, as you know, are Dubai, but that is none of our money, if you will. It's already money spent and asset light; the same thing's true in Cabo. Now, on some of these deals, we go in to manage the facilities and put our Total Rewards programs in. We do have an option to put some equity in the game, a 10% kind of number if we feel it's a really good project. So those are things that we may do going forward. But in general, the opportunities are kind of for spending capital or more here. And we have a lot of development acreage on The Strip, like the convention center. That's all center Strip property, and we still have 70 acres to develop and I think there's some high return projects yet to go there. Anything you want to add to that?</p><p>ERIC HESSION: No, I think that'll do.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: And how would you rank the other potential opportunities? So if Brazil comes up or Japan?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P. FRISSORA</nameText></person>: Well, again, these -- the Japan project, we feel like we're right in the running there. We feel really good about where we stand with Japan, with the government there. And so that's again a project that's pretty long term. We're looking at 2025 before you get 1 revenue dollar, right? So -- and that's -- but it's a great project, and we think it's going to be well done, well thought through. Brazil, I mean, we thought that was -- that legislation was going to be passed a year ago, so who knows what's going to happen in Brazil. But we're ready. We have been there. We've had a team on the ground there for the better part of 2 years looking at it seriously. We feel like we've got some good inroads with the government there. So we're prepared. People are talking about Greece -- Athens, Greece, there might be a project there. We certainly have had people on the street there and looking at that. So I believe that there's a lot of international growth opportunities, maybe even in Canada and other places. So for us, we have more than enough opportunities to look at. Our big issue is prioritization and planning.</p><p>KEVIN COYNE: Great. Well, please join me in thanking Mark and Eric from Caesars. Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK P.

As Anne and I discussed on the  CAFE Insider  podcast , the hearing was disappointing in myriad ways. With a few notable exceptions, Barr\u2019s exchanges with members were not illuminating. Some of that was the fault of the Attorney General, but much of it could be laid at the feet of Democratic Representatives, many of whom asked vague questions, poor questions, or no questions at all.    One five-minute round, however, got to the heart of the matter. It shone a light on the unprecedented nature of Barr\u2019s personal interference in a case commenced by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and then professionally handled by career prosecutors in the Department of Justice: the sentencing recommendation to the judge in the criminal case of Trump\u2019s friend, Roger Stone.    With a tone of righteous indignation, Barr defended his last-minute order that the D.C. U.S. Attorney\u2019s office withdraw its sentencing brief, which recommended seven to nine years of imprisonment, and submit a new, lower recommendation of three to four years. As you have heard me say, reasonable people could differ on the proper sentencing range. In my own experience, 7-9 years for Stone\u2019s conduct seemed high, and as Barr triumphantly noted, the judge who had complete discretion to go higher or lower, imposed the more lenient sentence. But that misses the point. Of all the cases in all the land, why did the chief federal law enforcement officer intervene in this case, which involved not only a Presidential friend, but misconduct that was designed to protect that President? To judge the action and whether it was inappropriate or unethical or corrupt, it would be important to know if Barr had quietly in other, less well-known cases brought his exquisite sense of justice to bear. Perhaps in a narcotics case or a robbery case or an immigration case? That would take some of the stink off the intervention. Maybe we would be surprised.    Well into Tuesday\u2019s hearing, someone finally probed this issue. Congressman Eric Swalwell asked a simple and important question: \u201cMr. Barr, have you ever intervened, other than to help the president\u2019s friend get a reduced prison sentence, in any other case where a prosecutor had filed a sentencing recommendation with the court?\u201d    \u201cNot that I\u2019d recall,\u201d Barr replied. There it was, a striking admission that this was a unique case of the Attorney General reaching down into the trenches to replace a filing that displeased the President, as evidenced by an irate tweet, with a filing that would mollify the President. Whether or not there is an argument that the second recommendation was more fair (and there is), the move rightly looks to the average person as special treatment at the direction of a President with a personal and legal stake in the matter. An Attorney General who truly cared about fairness would have steered clear. At the barest minimum, his action carried the appearance of impropriety.    Such an appearance, for the President and others, used to matter.    Compare the foregoing to the infamous tarmac meeting between then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 27, 2016. Recall that by happenstance the AG and Clinton wound up at the same airport in Phoenix, while the investigation into Hilary Clinton\u2019s emails was still ongoing. That interaction caused an uproar and was weaponized as an ethical transgression to end all ethical transgressions by the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump.    I am somewhat biased in the matter because I know Loretta Lynch personally. She is a friend and former colleague, and there is no question in my mind that she would never have discussed any pending case, much less one of this sensitivity, with the former President. That is my sincere belief, based not only on my understanding of her character but also given the public nature of the interaction and her demonstrable discomfort with the entire encounter.    Still, it was a mistake. More on the part of Bill Clinton than Lynch, but it was a mistake nonetheless. In fact, the former Attorney General herself has called it a mistake and chided herself for it. The meeting was one of the subjects of a lengthy Inspector General report, and the testimony of Melanie Newman, one of Lynch\u2019s staffers, cited in the report is compelling:    \u201cNewman characterized Lynch as \u2018devastated\u2019 about the tarmac meeting. She stated: \u2018[Lynch] doesn\u2019t take mistakes lightly, and she felt like she had made\u2026an incredible\u2026mistake in judgment by saying yes instead of no, that he could come on the plane. But also, she\u2019s like the most polite, Southern person alive. I, I don\u2019t know in what circumstances she would have said no, or what would have happened if she had said no\u2026. I would have much preferred a story that the Attorney General turned a former President of the United States away on the tarmac, but\u2026she doesn\u2019t make mistakes, and she was not pleased with herself for making this kind of high-stakes mistake.\u2019\u201d    Lynch felt remorse and regret, rightly so. But not for doing anything wrong \u2013 rather, because of the  appearance  of it.    That incident, in fact, was top of mind when the President called me on March 11, 2017. In no universe would I have talked about a pending enforcement matter with Trump even if he asked, but I ultimately did not return the call because of the  appearance  of it. There was no law against us talking, no precise ethical rule against having a casual conversation, but I understood \u2013 in part because of Trump\u2019s own weaponization of the tarmac incident \u2013 that it would look awful. There would be a stench to it, and in the absence of a surreptitious recording of the conversation, it would be impossible to prove to everyone the discussion was innocent.    These considerations don\u2019t seem to matter to Bill Barr. He doesn\u2019t seem to care about what his conduct looks like. He doesn\u2019t seem to care that it looks corrupt, that he looks like the President\u2019s personal lawyer. And this is so not just in the Stone case. He didn\u2019t seem to care when it came to releasing a misleading summary of the Mueller Report, or when it came to his involvement in the clearing of the park outside the White House for Trump\u2019s photo op.    People make mistakes, like Loretta Lynch did. Barr, on the other hand, doubles down on what stinks to high heaven. That makes him especially dangerous for the remainder of his time in office.    My best,    Preet       Tech\u2019s Big Tobacco Moment?    by Sam Ozer-Staton    On Wednesday, congressional lawmakers took turns grilling the chief executives of the tech industry\u2019s four most powerful companies: Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The hearing  comes as the tech industry faces intense backlash from across the political spectrum. It also marks the conclusion of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s 13-month antitrust  investigation  into each of the four tech giants, the most sweeping congressional inquiry of its kind since Microsoft faced antitrust charges in the 1990\u2019s.    The hearing seesawed back and forth as members on opposite sides of the aisle tried to push different agendas \u2014 Democrats focusing on the companies\u2019 monopolistic behavior, and Republicans alleging anti-conservative bias.    In his opening statement, Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), chairman of the antitrust subcommittee, summarized the central argument that Democratic lawmakers made all afternoon: \u201cAny single action by one of these companies can affect hundreds of millions of us in profound and lasting ways. Simply put: They have too much power.\u201d    The tech CEOs fought back against that characterization, taking pains to emphasize their lack of marketplace dominance and, in some cases, invoking their personal stories. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, making his first-ever appearance before Congress, opened his testimony by describing his family\u2019s humble beginnings:    \u201cMy dad arrived in America alone. His parents felt he\u2019d be safer here. His mom imagined America would be cold, so she made him a jacket sewn entirely out of cleaning cloths, the only material they had on hand. We still have that jacket; it hangs in my parents\u2019 dining room.\u201d    The Democrats on the committee, whose staff conducted hundreds of hours of interviews and collected over 1.3 million documents as part of its investigation, attempted to puncture the CEOs carefully-crafted appeals for sympathy by highlighting their alleged anticompetitive behavior. Bezos in particular faced criticism for allegations that Amazon uses data from third-party sellers on its platform to develop its own products. In an exchange with Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), who represents the district where Amazon is headquartered, Bezos admitted that he could not categorically deny those accusations: \u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business, but I can\u2019t guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\u201d    Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, faced consistently aggressive questioning around the tactics his company uses to protect \u2014 and profit from \u2014 its search engine dominance. Rep. Cicilline accused Google of using its search engine to direct users to other sites and products owned by the company, forcing consumers to stay within what he called a \u201cwalled garden.\u201d Pichai responded by claiming that the search market is growing  more  competitive: \u201cPeople have more ways to search for information than ever before\u2014and increasingly this is happening outside the context of only a search engine. Often the answer is just a click or an app away.\u201d    Armed with newly-released  documents  unearthed by its investigation, the committee pressed Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg on the motivations behind the company\u2019s 2012 acquisition of Instagram. In an email Zuckerberg sent to Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer in February 2012, Zuckerberg asked about whether the company would benefit from acquiring smaller social media companies. \u201cThese businesses\u2026could be very disruptive to us,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGiven that we think our own valuation is fairly aggressive and that we\u2019re vulnerable in mobile, I\u2019m curious if we should consider going after one or two of them. What do you think?\u201d In a separate email sent later that year, just days before making the offer to buy Instagram, Zuckerberg wrote, \u201cInstagram could hurt us meaningfully.\u201d    Zuckerberg told committee members on Wednesday that Instagram\u2019s success was not preordained but the result of years of work after its acquisition. \u201cThe acquisition has done wildly well not just because of the founders\u2019 talent, but because we invested heavily in building up the infrastructure and promoting. And I think that this has been an American success story,\u201d Zuckerberg said.    Apple\u2019s Tim Cook received significantly fewer questions than any other tech CEO testifying before the committee. Apple, which relies more heavily on its hardware business and less on advertising revenue, still received criticism for its management of the App Store. Responding to allegations that Apple favors certain developers over others, Cook said that the App Store\u2019s guidelines \u201care transparent and applied equally to developers of all sizes and in all categories.\u201d    Republicans, for their part, primarily reserved their questioning for accusations of anti-conservative bias. Ranking Member Jim Jordan (R-OH) began his questioning by saying, \u201cI\u2019ll just cut to the chase, Big Tech\u2019s out to get conservatives.\u201d Republican members were wary of Democratic claims of monopolistic behavior, but they threatened to fight back against what they described as censorship of conservative voices on tech platforms. \u201cWe all think the free market is great. We think competition is great. We love the fact that these are American companies,\u201d Rep. Jordan said. \u201cBut what\u2019s not great is censoring people, censoring conservators and trying to impact elections. And if it doesn\u2019t end, there has to be consequences.\u201d    Heading into the 2020 election, the tech industry finds itself in the rare position of being a punching bag for both liberals and conservatives.  According  to Gigi Sohn, an expert on technology law and policy who was a senior adviser at the Federal Communications Commission and now serves as a fellow at Georgetown Law School, the hearing \u201chas the feeling of tech\u2019s Big Tobacco moment.\u201d  \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b  Is that a fair comparison?

Telecommunications was another taboo area for foreign companies, opening basic telecom and the value-added telecom services, the latter encompasses a broad range of tech services, will give foreign tech companies the precious opportunity to access the China market.</p><p>The zone will be China's closest yet to \"three zero\" (zero tariff, zero barrier, zero subsidy) trade policies that are becoming a trend internationally and came to the fore last year when advocated by Huang Qifan, executive vice president of the China Center for International Economic Exchange.</p><p>One challenge the zone may face, however, is internal competition - Shanghai has tried and mostly failed so far to develop intermediary trade in its Lingang New Area FTZ, and the country already has 18 FTZs, so Hainan will need to differentiate itself.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Monthly Caixin Indexes </emphasis></p><p>Manufacturing PMI</p><p>-Rose to 50.7 from<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-05-15/chinas-major-economic-indicators-continue-to-recover-but-unemployment-edges-up-101554357.html\"> 49.4 </url>in April</p><p>-The reading was the highest since January, before the Covid-19 outbreak took hold in the country, and adds to evidence the country's vast manufacturing sector is regaining momentum after<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-05-15/chinas-major-economic-indicators-continue-to-recover-but-unemployment-edges-up-101554357.html\"> economic data for April </url>- including fixed-asset investment, industrial output and retail sales - showed the slump in the first quarter is being reversed.</p><p>-Improvement in the headline number was driven by production, with the output subindex reading rising to its highest since January 2011.</p><p>-\"Sluggish exports remained a big drag on demand as the virus continued spreading overseas,\" noted our colleague Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.</p><p>Services PMI</p><p>-Jumped to 55 last month from<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-05-07/services-activity-declines-for-third-month-in-a-row-caixin-pmi-shows-101550745.html\"> 44.4 in April </url></p><p>-Measure for new business in the services sector reached its highest point in almost 10 years, returning to positive territory</p><p>-Major drag on services last month was sluggish external demand, as many countries had not lifted lockdowns imposed to counter the coronavirus pandemic.

The government work report raised the local government special purpose bond quota to 3.75 trillion yuan, a 1.6 trillion yuan increase year-on-year, and said to prioritize new infrastructure and new urbanization projects.</p><p>However, most of the investment in new infrastructure is meant to come from companies, which have responded enthusiastically: In April, Alibaba announced it would spend 200 billion yuan over the next three years on data centers and other facilities, and on May 26, Tencent said it would spend 500 billion over the next five years to lay out new infrastructure.</p><p>But despite the hype, new infrastructure investment remains small (roughly 10% of total infrastructure investment last year) and there are doubts about its ability to transform traditional industries, which drive much greater investment and consumption.</p><p>A number of Two Sessions representatives brought up such concerns. Much of the discussion revolved around 5G and security, which we'll save you from reading again (<url normalizedValue=\"http://weekly.caixin.com/2020-05-30/101560943.html?p0\"> here </url>in Chinese if you just can't get enough 5G content.)</p><p>But the main thrust of the conversation is that while policy and funding directions have been made clear, implementation has not. It's expensive to build it out, applications are few and far between, and the applications that do exist may not be a good fit for China's existing economic structure. (As the proud owner of a 5G phone, I can tell you the only difference from 4G phones is the price tag.)</p><p>Sun Pishu, chairman of Inspur and an NPC representative, told Caixin that while people talk about cloud computing and big data \"giving wings\" to SMEs, the SMEs themselves don't agree. Instead, they feel that industrial internet is part of the world of big companies, and thinking about entering that world or spending hundreds of thousands of yuan on a robot \"strikes fear into their hearts.\"</p><p>One solution to the issue, Sun noted, is for government and big tech companies to work together on providing high tech services as infrastructure. As we noted in our<url normalizedValue=\"https://mailchi.mp/0b48eb63a571/caixin-insight-may-270287\"> April 22 newsletter </url>, data is a production factor. Now, local governments are promoting data and computing centers built by BAT to provide SMEs with the ability to do smart industry. For now, China's data centers remain largely traditional and focused on storage rather than computing; to integrate them with industry China will need to spend more effort processing all that data and develop usable AI applications.</p><p>The NDRC also brought up regional data centers as a way to address regional discrepancies: data centers in Beijing and Shenzhen are sought after, but data centers in less developed areas find it hard to attract enough users. Building regional data centers that serve several provinces can help better allocate computing and storage capacity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Street Stalls as a Way to Prevent Economic Stall </emphasis></p><p>Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has vowed government support for street vendors as part of efforts to ease unemployment and revitalize small businesses following the country's coronavirus epidemic. Until recent years, the street vendors have been a major contributor to the informal part of the economy in Chinese cities. Local governments came under pressure to remove them as part of \"city civility\" ratings by the central government, as they were tasked with addressing food safety issues, urban beautification, and reducing pollution from outdoor grills.</p><p>The re-introduction of street vendors is a sign of how much pressure China's economy is facing, and how desperate the decision makers are when it comes to job creation this year. Given the significance of the \"top guarantee,\" employment, one can easily understand why the central government scratched street vendors from their local government assessment checklist.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Weathervane </emphasis></p><p>Qiushi, the flagship magazine of China's Communist Party, published a year-old<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.qstheory.cn/dukan/qs/2020-05/31/c_1126055020.htm\"> speech </url>(link in Chinese) by President Xi Jinping on Sunday in which he said China had already \"basically achieved the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all aspects.\" The speech, entitled \"On the problem of addressing shortcomings in building an all-round moderately prosperous society,\" paid particular attention to poverty alleviation and pollution control, two of Xi's three signature battles.</p><p>The goal of building a \"moderately prosperous society\" has been a key guiding concept for decades, first proposed by Deng Xiaoping at the beginning of reform and opening-up, and later broadened to a \"comprehensive\" moderate prosperity by Xi, incorporating environmental, social and other aspects beyond economic growth.</p><p>The primary quantitative target associated with the concept in recent years has been to double China's GDP from 2010 to 2020. The economic hit from Covid-19 has thrown the viability of reaching that target into question, however, as it would require roughly 5.3% to 5.6% growth for the year, a tall order after the first quarter saw China's first economic contraction since at least 1992, when record keeping began.</p><p>He Lifeng, chairman of the NDRC, commented during the Two Sessions that 3% growth in 2020 would bring the country's economy to 1.95 times the scale in 2010, and 5% growth would bring it to 1.99 times. He also added that doubling the GDP is only one of the 12 \"moderately prosperous society\" targets, and that most would be fulfilled by year end, with a handful \"basically fulfilled.\"</p><p>On this point, Xi was also quick to note that the goal does not necessarily imply that all regions will double their GDP or reach the national average level. He further emphasized that cadres should grasp the relationship between relative and absolute indicators, and quantitative vs. qualitative judgements of moderate prosperity.</p><p>While the speech was given 13 months ago, Qiushi's choice to publish it now is an important signal.</p><p>It is both a reminder to cadres to keep their eyes on the prize despite China dropping its GDP growth target, and an indicator of flexibility in the party's ability to determine if the goal has been met. The speech has been followed by official comments softening the target.</p><p>Yang Weimin, deputy director of the CPPCC economic committee, echoed He's comments at a Monday video conference hosted by a state-backed think tank, saying that the target had effectively already been met, and the \"key is to win people's recognition,\" the South China Morning post reported.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Contact analysts Gavin Cross </emphasis>(<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gavincross@caixin.com\">gavincross@caixin.com</email>)<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> and Zhang Qizhi </emphasis>(<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:qizhizhang@caixin.com\">qizhizhang@caixin.com</email>)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This weekly brief is provided by Caixin Global Intelligence, the strategic advisory arm of Caixin Global.

Nope. Solium Capital - which has developed online software platforms that integrate and manage the many different iterations of equity compensation plans around the world - is one of those 18-year, overnight success stories.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Based right here in Calgary. It's a company that has achieved critical mass through a combination of opportunistic acquisitions and organic growth, while sticking to what it knows how to do, rather than be a magpie and grab every bright, shiny object.</p><p>In fact, Solium is one of the few Calgary startups from the last tech boom of the late 1990s that is not only still around, but now boasts a global reach.</p><p>Not that it didn't have a few growing pains along the way. By his own admission, chief executive Marcos Lopez says Solium, founded by two stock brokers from Dominion Securities, went public too early - in 2001 with $94,000 in revenue.</p><p>By 2002, it was needing to be refinanced, restructured and repositioned.</p><p>Since then, Solium has become a global, Calgary-based enterprise software firm with one million people using its platform and with offices in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia.</p><p>It has signed on 46 of the TSX 60, and won mandates from companies the likes of Adidas, Shopify, Uber, Google, Barclays and Morgan Stanley; Heineken is a recent addition to its client roster.</p><p>What it does well is manage the complex issues associated with stock compensation plans for both private and publicly traded companies. These are the issues that always seem to come with indecipherable acronyms in multiple jurisdictions, in a variety of currencies, and in the middle of a maze of compliance and tax rules that differ from country to country.</p><p>In some respects, Solium hit its sweet spot as regulations and scrutiny on equity compensation plans have increased around the globe.</p><p>It does this through a combination of its sophisticated software platforms - Shareworks and Transcentive - and an old-fashioned commitment to customer service.</p><p>One of the secrets to its \"overnight\" success, Lopez says, is the fact it did get its start in Calgary.</p><p>\"Solium couldn't have started in Toronto. We wouldn't have gotten any traction,\" he says.</p><p>The Alberta Energy Company was Solium's first client and word has it Big Rock Brewery, also an early client, paid part of its bill in beer.</p><p>\"(The AEC) took a flyer on us ... but that is the magic of Calgary; it's in the DNA. AEC took that risk, so did CP Rail,\" Lopez says.</p><p>\"We evolved in the safe petri dish of Calgary. In many ways, it's a great Canada-bet-on-itself story.\"</p><p>And that petri dish had the perfect conditions that pushed Solium to expand its horizons and develop a product and skill set that can address complex issues arising for companies operating in multiple jurisdictions.</p><p>Not only is Solium Calgary's best kept secret, having been around as long as it has. Lopez is also in a unique position to offer a few observations on the skills needed to achieve that seemingly elusive goal of economic diversification.</p><p>\"It can't just be about cheap office space ... and the vacancy rate,\" he says. \"Companies that we want to attract here don't care about the cost of office space - they want skill sets.\"</p><p>Lopez says that while Calgary has tech talent, it's not the kind of place that builds tech products; his observation is that we're better at project management.</p><p>The product life cycle for technology is much different than what it is for the energy sector - and that means a different skill set.</p><p>Calgary also lacks what Lopez calls an \"anchor tenant\" - in this case, a big tech company that acts as a magnet and draws talent to wherever it is.</p><p>But Calgary did have that for a time - in the form of Nortel. When Nortel imploded, however, some talent stayed, but not enough. Unlike the demise of Dome Petroleum, which caused a starburst of its own as former employees went on to create billions of dollars in value in the energy sector, the end of Nortel didn't result in the creation of the same kind of critical mass in Calgary's sector.</p><p>For Solium, managing the stock-based elements of compensation systems is not exactly as sexy as being a visible disrupter. But as compensation plans have become increasingly complex, solutions offered through companies like Solium ensure they are managed properly.</p><p>But there aren't too many Soliums out there. So, while Lopez doesn't exactly see Solium as a disrupter, others might take issue with that.

Afterward, Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., told us Marcus would leave Capitol Hill understanding her committee is serious about blocking the project until concerns are resolved. \"We have oversight responsibility, and we're going to live up to our responsibility,\" she said.</p><p>Waters is circulating a draft bill, the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act, which would prohibit big tech companies from creating digital currencies or acting as financial institutions. \"It's pretty clear people are saying don't move ahead on this,\" Senate Banking Committee ranking member Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, told us. \"We want to look at [Waters' bill] and see where it goes.\"</p><p>Another draft bill, circulating from Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, would prohibit reserve-backed digital currencies like Libra, according to a document we obtained. \"It is obvious to me that a social media platform that has been screwing up serially over the last many years is not best positioned to execute,\" Schatz told reporters Tuesday. \"I don't get why Facebook gets some first mover advantage because they have capital laying around.\"</p><p>Just because lawmakers don't understand a proposal doesn't mean it should die in infancy, said House Financial Services Committee ranking member Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., during Wednesday's hearing. Entrepreneurs shouldn't have to ask the government for permission before they even think about innovating, he argued: \"But let's be honest. It's Facebook.\" Like Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, McHenry said digital currency offerings will evolve regardless of Facebook's involvement. He asked Waters to hold a hearing on Libra more than a month ago.</p><p>Waters' biggest concern is Libra's potentially competing with the dollar. \"I think the dollar is very important, and I just don't understand why they organized the headquarters in Switzerland. Why Switzerland?\" she said. There will be more hearings and more questions on the issue, she told us.</p><p>The purpose of organizing a global currency like Libra in Geneva is to have an international base, Marcus told the committee, echoing comments he made before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday. Libra will compete with other digital financial services like PayPal, he said.</p><p>Several Democrats asked Marcus for a moratorium. He wouldn't explicitly commit but said repeatedly the company won't offer Libra until all regulatory issues are addressed: \"We'll take the time to get this right.\" Rep. Carolyn Maloney, N.Y., one of the Democrats behind the moratorium, asked Marcus for a Libra pilot program limited to 1 million users and subject to Federal Reserve and SEC oversight. Marcus dodged that suggestion, as well. If Facebook won't commit to such a reasonable request, Congress should seriously consider blocking the project, Maloney said.</p><p>Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., questioned the need for Libra's expected 2020 launch date. She has concerns about Libra overtaking the dollar, as well as foreign adversaries using the digital currency to circumvent U.S. sanctions. Marcus noted Libra won't be the only digital currency available, but Facebook is at least engaging Congress.</p><p>Lawmakers have a \"healthy dose of skepticism\" for Facebook, said Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y. Marcus told Velazquez that Facebook won't launch the project until all Federal Reserve and regulatory concerns are satisfied. It's clear the company has made mistakes, and it's working hard to own and correct those mistakes, he said. Marcus conceded the Libra Association contacted Swiss financial regulators but hasn't contacted regional privacy regulators.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMK-MD81-DYRJ-01WN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"632\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Dealerships are subject to the rule because they provide customer financing.</p><p>Watching California</p><p>Regulatory activity involving data privacy and security in the U.S. is only going to accelerate, experts said, so it behooves dealers to take proactive steps to review and update their data practices.</p><p>\"I would expect that we're going to see continued pushes across the country, particularly in states that have any kind of [citizen] initiative process,\" said Monica Baumann, regulatory counsel with Scali Rasmussen in Sacramento, Calif., a law firm that represents auto dealers.</p><p>Legislators from New York to Nevada have taken up data privacy bills, though many of those stalled this year. Lawyers who track state data legislation say that may be a sign that lawmakers are taking a wait-and-see approach until California's law takes effect.</p><p>\"The fact that you didn't see a lot of states move [bills] this year doesn't mean they're not going to move,\" said Lindsey Tonsager, a partner at Covington &amp; Burling in San Francisco, who co-leads the firm's global privacy and cybersecurity practice group.</p><p>New York state Sen. Kevin Thomas, a Democrat from Nassau County, said he is gathering input to revise and reintroduce a bill to create the New York Privacy Act in 2020. \"There needs to be some oversight,\" he said.</p><p>The bill as written this year would have required a business that holds a consumer's personal information to act as a \"data fiduciary,\" operating in the best interest of the consumer even if that supersedes the business' duty to its owners and shareholders. Thomas called the provision a \"duty of loyalty\" to consumers.</p><p>Businesses \"need to balance both, and they can do it. Privacy isn't something,\" he said, that \"they're going to lose money over.\"</p><p>He added, \"Having adequate privacy [controls] will only allow them to sell a better product, and consumers will flock to them even more knowing that this company is taking more steps to protect the data that I'm giving them.\"</p><p>Delete the data?</p><p>In Massachusetts, a pending data privacy bill also would allow consumers to request that a business delete their data. Businesses that have more than $10 million in annual gross revenue or make at least half of their annual revenue from sharing customer data with third parties would be subject to the law, according to the draft legislation.</p><p>The bill raises concerns that dealerships wouldn't be able to access or share information to properly service a customer's vehicle, said Robert O'Koniewski, executive vice president of the Massachusetts State Automobile Dealers Association, which opposes the bill.</p><p>Once data is created, \"I just don't know how you rewind that clock back to give people a situation where data's not out there,\" he said.</p><p>Nevada's law, which took effect in October, prohibits the sale of a customer's data at the customer's request. But it exempts financial institutions subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as automakers and \"a person who repairs or services a motor vehicle\" who collects data related to a technology or service on the vehicle.</p><p>That's likely to exempt auto dealers, said Andy MacKay, executive director of the Nevada Franchised Auto Dealers Association. But that doesn't mean his members are off the hook.</p><p>MacKay said dealers in his state are more concerned about neighboring California's law, since many dealers count California residents as customers. The California Consumer Privacy Act defines a consumer as a California resident, and several lawyers say that definition could mean dealerships in other states are bound by the new rules - though it's still unclear to what extent.</p><p>Businesses required to comply with California's law are those that have more than $25 million in gross annual revenue; buy, sell or share personal data of at least 50,000 consumers, households or devices; and/or earn at least half of their annual revenue from the sale of consumer data.</p><p>\"If you really have any real line of business in California, you need to be prepared to comply with it,\" MacKay said he tells Nevada dealers.</p><p>What to do</p><p>Several compliance experts say the first step dealerships should take is to map out the data they collect, including the source of the information, where it's stored and with whom it's shared. That is applicable, experts say, to dealers in all states.</p><p>\"Unless you know those fundamentals, it's going to be very difficult to come into compliance, regardless of what the specifics of the law says,\" Tonsager said.</p><p>That process includes working with third-party vendors on securing data shared with dealers. Dealers should look at their vendor contracts to make sure that they include safeguards to protect consumers' information, and vet prospective vendors about their security practices, said Spurti Kanekar, who leads compliance for dealership technology company CarGurus Inc. She spoke to Automotive News at the company's Navigate automotive conference in October.</p><p>Additionally, dealers that might be subject to California's law should consider how they would allow a consumer to make a data-related request, such as via email or a Web form, and how they'll process the requests, said Phil Yannella, practice leader of the privacy and data security group at Ballard Spahr in Philadelphia.</p><p>\"Companies are really gearing up to create these infrastructures that are capable of handling a lot of [consumer] requests like that,\" he said, \"but no one knows if we're really going to see a lot of requests.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUTONW-4980856</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUTONW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR3-1B01-DYFH-V05R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6928</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1156\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Crain Communications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Automotive News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23747\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 94</volume><edition>Print Version</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 9, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000304S</classCode><className>COVINGTON &amp;

It's the latest in a trove of conservative literature trying to dance around the fact that high-tax, highly regulated, bureaucratic states can be economic powerhouses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The writers deal with the \"problem\" by burying reality under a pile of \"buts\" and \"howevers.\"</p><p> In recent years, California has indeed suffered from gridlocked government, punishing pension obligations and debt - plus the housing meltdown. It's been addressing these challenges.</p><p> And though one cannot vouch for the wisdom of every regulation, the state's environmental ethic is a big reason smart people put up with the warts.</p><p> But only Silicon Valley is doing well, The Economist says. Manufacturing stinks. \"IPhones are 'designed by Apple in California,'\" the article notes, \"but made in Shenzhen.\" Apple nonetheless employs 16,000 Californians in and around Cupertino and plans to expand that number to 24,000. The Apple workers reportedly earn an average of $125,000.</p><p> There's this fantasy that if our environmental regulations just went lax, America would have some renaissance in factory employment. Thing is, manufacturing output in this country has actually tripled in the last 60 years, Bloomberg Businessweek reports.</p><p>U.S. factories are simply being run with fewer, well-trained people operating computers. The low-skilled, low-wage, labor-intensive factory jobs are not coming back, and why should we want them?</p><p> The Economist seems vexed that Gov. Jerry Brown would sign a bill raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2016 - as though Wendy's could sell burgers in Bakersfield from a store in Nevada. By the way, in 1968, the national minimum wage was $10.77 in today's dollars.</p><p> Only Silicon Valley?! Check out The Wall Street Journal's new \"Billion-Dollar Startup Club.\" These are companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture capital firms.</p><p> Of the 37 billion-dollar startups, 26 are based in the U.S. - 22 of them in California. Of the four U.S. startups not located in California, three are in New York City - not exactly your low-tax haven and, at the moment, freezing cold. The other one is in Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p> Those who strike it rich will do tax planning, and that may include buying homes in low-tax places. But the big tech innovators are still building their companies where their brainiacs want to be. Kings of the creative class demand the stimulation found in great urban neighborhoods.</p><p> Two years ago, The Wall Street Journal published an emotional essay titled \"California Declares War on Suburbia.\" The writer was especially upset that the Association of Bay Area Governments had proposed limiting new housing beyond the San Francisco and San Jose \"urban fringe\" to 3 percent of the total. Most new building would be multifamily homes.</p><p> Boy, do they hate San Francisco. But the strict building rules have kept San Francisco - and its environs - a beautiful place. That's why tech people working in surrounding areas insist on making their nests in San Francisco when they could live cheaper, bigger and closer to work.</p><p> Universities are another magnet and incubator for new companies. They tend to spawn the liberal, active-government cultures in which innovation thrives. There's some irony that the premier tech center of Texas is progressive Austin, thanks in great part to the University of Texas, a creature of state government.</p><p> To the states with good education, an open-minded community and an attractive environment go the tech spoils.

This week in our roundup of political news: Previewing the first presidential debate, comparing the candidates' answers on breaking up big tech, and examining the latest 2020 housing plan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Get ready for the debate stage<url normalizedValue=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/senate-2016-california.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1\"/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Next week's debates are a huge opportunity for White House hopefuls trying to break out of a crowded pack. But how do you stand out when you have less than 10 minutes to speak - and nine other candidates jostling for their own moment in the spotlight?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's the conundrum facing the 20 presidential contenders who will take the stage in Miami on Wednesday and Thursday nights. We'll be especially focused on the second debate, which will feature California Sen. Kamala Harris and East Bay Rep. Eric Swalwell, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The candidates who want to break out have to drive a clear message and have a moment that captures the imagination of the press,\" said Brett O'Donnell, a debate coach who's coached five Republican presidential candidates. \"But you can't have a moment of weakness, because you get so little time.\"</p><p>One way to get attention is to go on the offensive. Several candidates seem likely to train their fire on Biden, who got widespread criticism Wednesday over <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/06/19/joe-biden-james-eastland-herman-talmadge-segregationists-civility/\">comments he made</url> touting his ability to work with former senators who supported segregation. Meanwhile, other moderate contenders have been itching to take the fight to Sanders over issues like Medicare-for-all and his embrace of the democratic socialist label.</p><p>It's not likely they'll call each other names, like then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican debates. But some campaigns are turning to that primary, which featured similarly jam-packed debate stages, for lessons.</p><p>In several forums, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina made waves with her crisp answers and tough responses to Trump, showing how memorable one-liners can help spark a rise in the polls - even if it's only temporary.</p><p>\"The standout moments I had weren't planned, weren't rehearsed,\" Fiorina said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsy.com/stories/carly-fiorina-s-advice-on-how-to-stand-out-in-packed-debates/\">in a video</url> for the website Newsy. She said she prepared extensively, studying the issues and potential questions, and then \"I let all of that go and I was just in the moment.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20150917__USGOP2016DebateTakeaways1.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1\"/>First national introduction</p><p>The stakes will be highest for the profusion of presidential wannabes hovering around one percent in the polls, many of whom will get their first real opportunity for a national audience. That includes Swalwell, who just barely qualified for the debate.</p><p>\"I see a big opportunity to stand on the same stage with the vice president and the last runner-up for our party's nomination and some of the other frontrunners,\" Swalwell told reporters in San Francisco last week. He said his most important preparation for the debate has been doing \"living-room town halls\" in Iowa and New Hampshire, answering every question thrown at him by early state voters.</p><p>Some of the little-known candidates will be using the limelight to make a case for pet issues. New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang, for example, has attracted a fervent online following with his advocacy for universal basic income, the idea of giving every American $1,000 a month in order to fight inequality and adapt to automation-related job losses. The debate could be most Americans' first introduction to that concept - and Yang has said he hopes his campaign will get a boost when viewers turn to Google to try to figure out \"who the Asian guy standing next to Joe Biden is.\"</p><p>\"You don't want to try and make too much of any one moment because voters can tell when you have some canned message that you just want to get out there,\" Yang said in an interview after a recent fundraiser at a house in the Lafayette hills with a jaw-dropping view. \"But I'm very eager to make the case to the American people that universal basic income is the future we need.\"</p><p>While next week's debate stage is set, the lineup is still unsettled for the debate face-offs in late July. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock picked up a third poll putting him at 1 percent Tuesday - leaving him tied with Swalwell for the final 20th spot, which is determined based on polling and donors.</p><p>Swalwell has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2019/06/16/the-trailer-how-to-run-for-president-without-losing-your-job/5d03d1c91ad2e52ca1223daa/\">suggested</url> that he's likely to drop out and run for re-election in his East Bay congressional seat if he doesn't qualify for the third debate in September - but theoretically, he could get the boot earlier if Bullock ends up with better polls than him ahead of the July forums. That puts a lot of pressure on the East Bay congressman to draw the spotlight next week.</p><p>\"I don't think I have to swing for the fences or be too 'extra' up there,\" Swalwell said. \"I just have to be myself.\"</p><p>Who's leading this week in...</p><p>Facebook ad spending (nationwide): Donald Trump has been outspending his Democratic rivals on Facebook ads for months. But the disparity grew larger this week, with the president spending more than 4 times more than the biggest Democratic spender, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.</p><p>Breaking up big tech companies like Facebook and Google has become one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/07/big-tech-democratic-presidential-race-2020-silicon-valley/\">biggest topics of debate</url> in the 2020 presidential race. Now we have a great way to compare the candidates' responses, thanks to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/big-tech-democratic-candidates.html\">a New York Times project</url> asking 21 candidates the same 18 questions, including one about whether they support slicing and dicing the tech giants.</p><p>What's striking is nearly all of those candidates - every major contender except former Vice President Joe Biden, who did not accept an interview request from the paper\u00a0- sound at least open to the idea. Several, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who proposed splitting the companies up earlier this year, and Sanders, support it, while Swalwell and Yang were two of the only clear no's. Many are somewhere in the middle, calling for stricter regulations without definitively endorsing a breakup. Here are some of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/big-tech-democratic-candidates.html\">the responses</url>:</p><p>Elizabeth Warren: Yes. \"You can be the umpire - that is, you can run the platform, the marketplace - or you can have a team in the game - that is, you can be one of the competing businesses. But you don't get to do both.\"</p><p>Bernie Sanders: \"The answer, in general, is yes... Public policy is so far behind the explosion of technology, that it is really one of the weaknesses of where we are right now as a country.\"</p><p>Kamala Harris: No direct answer. \"My first priority is going to be that we ensure that privacy is something that is intact.\"</p><p>Pete Buttigieg: \"I think the FTC needs to be empowered to prevent and in some cases reverse the mergers of some of these companies... The consolidation can very quickly turn into a kind of monopoly power that diminishes our freedom.\" (Buttigieg was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/14/pete-buttigieg-facebook-harvard-break-up-big-tech/\">Facebook's 287th user</url>.)</p><p>Beto O'Rourke: \"I don't know. I don't know whether it is appropriate for a candidate for the presidency, or for the president, him or herself, to be designating which companies should be broken up.\"</p><p>Cory Booker: \"I worry about any presidential candidate making broad brush determinations...

This week in our roundup of political news: Previewing the first presidential debate, comparing the candidates answers on breaking up big tech, and examining the latest 2020 housing plan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Get ready for the debate stage<url normalizedValue=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/senate-2016-california.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1\"/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Next weeks debates are a huge opportunity for White House hopefuls trying to break out of a crowded pack. But how do you stand out when you have less than 10 minutes to speak  and nine other candidates jostling for their own moment in the spotlight?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thats the conundrum facing the 20 presidential contenders who will take the stage in Miami on Wednesday and Thursday nights. Well be especially focused on the second debate, which will feature California Sen. Kamala Harris and East Bay Rep. Eric Swalwell, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The candidates who want to break out have to drive a clear message and have a moment that captures the imagination of the press, said Brett ODonnell, a debate coach whos coached five Republican presidential candidates. But you cant have a moment of weakness, because you get so little time.</p><p>One way to get attention is to go on the offensive. Several candidates seem likely to train their fire on Biden, who got widespread criticism Wednesday over <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/06/19/joe-biden-james-eastland-herman-talmadge-segregationists-civility/\">comments he made</url> touting his ability to work with former senators who supported segregation. Meanwhile, other moderate contenders have been itching to take the fight to Sanders over issues like Medicare-for-all and his embrace of the democratic socialist label.</p><p>Its not likely theyll call each other names, like then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican debates. But some campaigns are turning to that primary, which featured similarly jam-packed debate stages, for lessons.</p><p>In several forums, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina made waves with her crisp answers and tough responses to Trump, showing how memorable one-liners can help spark a rise in the polls  even if its only temporary.</p><p>The standout moments I had werent planned, werent rehearsed, Fiorina said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsy.com/stories/carly-fiorina-s-advice-on-how-to-stand-out-in-packed-debates/\">in a video</url> for the website Newsy. She said she prepared extensively, studying the issues and potential questions, and then I let all of that go and I was just in the moment.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20150917__USGOP2016DebateTakeaways1.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1\"/>First national introduction</p><p>The stakes will be highest for the profusion of presidential wannabes hovering around one percent in the polls, many of whom will get their first real opportunity for a national audience. That includes Swalwell, who just barely qualified for the debate.</p><p>I see a big opportunity to stand on the same stage with the vice president and the last runner-up for our partys nomination and some of the other frontrunners, Swalwell told reporters in San Francisco last week. He said his most important preparation for the debate has been doing living-room town halls in Iowa and New Hampshire, answering every question thrown at him by early state voters.</p><p>Some of the little-known candidates will be using the limelight to make a case for pet issues. New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang, for example, has attracted a fervent online following with his advocacy for universal basic income, the idea of giving every American $1,000 a month in order to fight inequality and adapt to automation-related job losses. The debate could be most Americans first introduction to that concept  and Yang has said he hopes his campaign will get a boost when viewers turn to Google to try to figure out who the Asian guy standing next to Joe Biden is.</p><p>You dont want to try and make too much of any one moment because voters can tell when you have some canned message that you just want to get out there, Yang said in an interview after a recent fundraiser at a house in the Lafayette hills with a jaw-dropping view. But Im very eager to make the case to the American people that universal basic income is the future we need.</p><p>While next weeks debate stage is set, the lineup is still unsettled for the debate face-offs in late July. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock picked up a third poll putting him at 1 percent Tuesday  leaving him tied with Swalwell for the final 20th spot, which is determined based on polling and donors.</p><p>Swalwell has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2019/06/16/the-trailer-how-to-run-for-president-without-losing-your-job/5d03d1c91ad2e52ca1223daa/\">suggested</url> that hes likely to drop out and run for re-election in his East Bay congressional seat if he doesnt qualify for the third debate in September  but theoretically, he could get the boot earlier if Bullock ends up with better polls than him ahead of the July forums. That puts a lot of pressure on the East Bay congressman to draw the spotlight next week.</p><p>I dont think I have to swing for the fences or be too extra up there, Swalwell said. I just have to be myself.</p><p>Who's leading this week in...</p><p>Facebook ad spending (nationwide): Donald Trump has been outspending his Democratic rivals on Facebook ads for months. But the disparity grew larger this week, with the president spending more than 4 times more than the biggest Democratic spender, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.</p><p>Breaking up big tech companies like Facebook and Google has become one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/07/big-tech-democratic-presidential-race-2020-silicon-valley/\">biggest topics of debate</url> in the 2020 presidential race.

Several, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who proposed splitting the companies up earlier this year, and Sanders, support it, while Swalwell and Yang were two of the only clear nos. Many are somewhere in the middle, calling for stricter regulations without definitively endorsing a breakup. Here are some of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/big-tech-democratic-candidates.html\">the responses</url>:</p><p>Elizabeth Warren: Yes. \"You can be the umpire - that is, you can run the platform, the marketplace - or you can have a team in the game - that is, you can be one of the competing businesses. But you don't get to do both.\"</p><p>Bernie Sanders: The answer, in general, is yes Public policy is so far behind the explosion of technology, that it is really one of the weaknesses of where we are right now as a country.\"</p><p>Kamala Harris: No direct answer. \"My first priority is going to be that we ensure that privacy is something that is intact.\"</p><p>Pete Buttigieg: I think the FTC needs to be empowered to prevent and in some cases reverse the mergers of some of these companies The consolidation can very quickly turn into a kind of monopoly power that diminishes our freedom.\" (Buttigieg was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/14/pete-buttigieg-facebook-harvard-break-up-big-tech/\">Facebooks 287th user</url>.)</p><p>Beto ORourke: \"I dont know.

The attorneys general of those two states didn't offer much of an explanation for declining to join the inquiry, which was announced Monday. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra[3] has talked tough on tech in the past and has established a reputation for taking on powerful figures, filing dozens of suits against the Trump administration[4]. But he's also accepted significant campaign contributions from Google, which is headquartered in his state. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[5] Only two state attorneys general aren't taking part in the multi-state antitrust investigation of Google[6] and one of them just happens to be the head of law enforcement in the company's home state. </p><p>Xavier Becerra and Steve Marshall, the attorneys general of California and Alabama, respectively, are the only two holdouts in the joint state investigation of the two tech companies. It's unclear why neither is taking part in the investigation, and neither offered much of an explanation. \"California remains deeply concerned and committed to fighting anticompetitive behavior,\" a representative of the California Attorney General's Office said in an emailed statement. \"Regarding this investigation or any other, to protect the integrity of potential and ongoing investigations, we cannot provide comment.\" Press representatives for Marshall, meanwhile, did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment. The attorneys general of the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 48 states announced Monday they are investigating Google's advertising practices and whether the search giant has harmed competitors. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is leading the joint inquiry. Read this: 50 state attorneys general have launched a formal probe into whether Google has engaged in anti-competitive practices in its ads business[7] Becerra and Marshall would seem to have little in common other than being attorneys general of their respective states and declining to take part in the joint investigation. Becerra is a Democrat in an urban, deep-blue state whose Silicon Valley region is the epicenter of the tech industry. Marshall, meanwhile, is a Republican in one of the reddest, most rural states in the nation.Becerra has faced off with Trump and talked tough on techBecerra has gotten a reputation for being willing to challenge powerful figures. Since he became attorney general in 2017, his office has sued the Trump administration at least 56 times[8], according to the San Francisco Chronicle, challenging it on everything from immigration policy to the environment. He's also talked tough on tech. Earlier this year, he called on his state's legislature to strengthen the California Consumer Privacy Act[9], which is due to take effect next year. Becerra pressed legislators to give consumers more rights to sue companies over breaches of their private information and violations of the act. At an event in San Francisco in March sponsored by The Washington Post, Becerra talked about needing to hold tech companies accountable[10] for their actions, and for states to take the lead in reining them in. \"Now, it's time to treat the industry as an adult,\" Becerra said at the event. \"You have to act like an adult and you have to understand there are consequences that adults face when they don't do things the right way.\" Google has been one of the top contributors to Becerra's recent campaigns. The company contributed $10,200 to his 2016 re-election campaign[11] as a member of the US House of Representatives, making it his eight largest contributor in that campaign cycle, according to OpenSecrets. The search giant contributed $7,300 to his campaign for attorney general last year[12], according to data from the California Secretary of State's office. Becerra's lack of participation in the Google investigation drew condemnation from the other side of the political aisle. \"Attorney General Becerra's refusal to join the bipartisan investigation into the tech giants is embarrassing,\" California Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham, a Republican, said in an emailed statement. \"California deserves to be at the table.\" The states' probe of Google is one of numerous antitrust investigations going on against the big tech companies either in the US or overseas. Facebook, Amazon, and Apple have also drawn scrutiny from competition regulators. Got a tip about Google or another tech company?

Marshall, meanwhile, is a Republican in one of the reddest, most rural states in the nation.</p><h>Becerra has faced off with Trump and talked tough on tech</h><p>Becerra has gotten a reputation for being willing to challenge powerful figures. Since he became attorney general in 2017, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/California-to-Trump-See-you-in-court-with-a-14342146.php\">his office has sued the Trump administration at least 56 times</url>, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, challenging it on everything from immigration policy to the environment.</p><p>He's also talked tough on tech. Earlier this year, he called on his state's legislature <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/californias-attorney-general-wants-empower-people-protect-their-privacy-sacramento\">to strengthen the California Consumer Privacy Act</url>, which is due to take effect next year. Becerra pressed legislators to give consumers more rights to sue companies over breaches of their private information and violations of the act.</p><p>At an event in San Francisco in March sponsored by The Washington Post, Becerra <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2019/03/28/the-technology-202-silicon-valley-isn-t-waiting-for-washington-to-address-privacy-disinformation/5c9c557c1b326b0f7f38f293/\">talked about needing to hold tech companies accountable</url> for their actions, and for states to take the lead in reining them in.</p><p>\"Now, it's time to treat the industry as an adult,\" Becerra said at the event. \"You have to act like an adult and you have to understand there are consequences that adults face when they don't do things the right way.\"</p><p>Google has been one of the top contributors to Becerra's recent campaigns. The company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/contributors?cid=N00009774&amp;cycle=2016\">contributed $10,200 to his 2016 re-election campaign</url> as a member of the US House of Representatives, making it his eight largest contributor in that campaign cycle, according to OpenSecrets.

But unlike nearly all other state attorneys general, he won\u2019t say whether he\u2019s investigating them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON \u2014 When numerous <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/technology/google-antitrust-investigation.html\">state attorneys general gathered last month</url> on the steps of the Supreme Court to announce an antitrust investigation into Google, one was conspicuously absent: Xavier Becerra, California\u2019s attorney general.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He was also missing from a list of state attorneys general publicly signing on to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/technology/google-antitrust-investigation.html\">joint antitrust investigation</url> into Facebook, released last week by New York.</p><p>Mr. Becerra\u2019s curious no-show from the public announcements has provided one of the more enduring questions about the scrutiny of the tech industry sweeping through Washington and state capitals. What is Mr. Becerra \u2014 whose state is home to most of the country\u2019s biggest tech companies, including Google and Facebook \u2014 up to?</p><p>His decision to skirt the question has led to questions about what one of the largest and most influential states is doing on the tech antitrust front. Mr. Becerra\u2019s office has more resources \u2014 money and people \u2014 than most state attorneys general, which would be needed to pursue a major legal case against one of the top tech companies. </p><p>It has led to criticism from political rivals and groups calling for aggressive action against the giant tech companies, as well as attention from local <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/technology/google-antitrust-investigation.html\">news</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/technology/google-antitrust-investigation.html\">organizations</url>. Yet Mr. Becerra, who has been vocal about problems with Silicon Valley in the past, has remained fastidious about saying little about any potential investigations. He has neither confirmed nor denied that his office is examining Google, Facebook or any other tech company.</p><p>\u201cNo one except California and the A.G.\u2019s office knows what, if anything, we\u2019re doing with regard to either of those two or any other company in the internet space,\u201d he said in an interview this week. He added that he was following his office\u2019s longstanding practice not to speak publicly about a possible investigation.</p><p>Earlier this month, Mr. Becerra<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/technology/google-antitrust-investigation.html\">responded to a question</url> about California not publicly endorsing the joint investigations by asking one of his own. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know we\u2019re not investigating?\u201d he said.</p><p>Mr. Becerra\u2019s spokeswoman, Sarah Lovenheim, said the office did not disclose what it was or was not investigating to protect the integrity of its work. \u201cIt\u2019s just our policy not to comment on any pending or potential investigations,\u201d she said in a statement.</p><p>Other attorneys general offices are not offering any insight, either. Fabien Levy, a spokesman for Letitia James, the New York attorney general, said that her office \u201ccannot comment on whether we have or have not had a conversation with another state about any of our investigations.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Becerra, a Democrat, spent more than 20 years in the House before being appointed California\u2019s attorney general and taking office in 2017. Since he left Washington, anti-tech fever has become an animating force in politics. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has made breaking up Big Tech a calling card of her presidential campaign. The House Judiciary Committee, where Mr. Becerra once served, is also running its own antitrust investigation into Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Mr. Becerra has been willing to take on the large tech companies in other contexts. His office is developing regulations around the California Consumer Privacy Act, an online privacy law that the internet industry has tried to weaken. The law gave consumers more rights over their data when the legislature passed it last year, but it is up to Mr. Becerra to propose the rules and enforce them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly technical matter; they got a lot right,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, a technologist who has been involved with supporting the California law.</p><p>His office has also been aggressive in other antitrust matters. In addition to challenging T-Mobile\u2019s merger with Sprint, it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/technology/google-antitrust-investigation.html\">announced</url> a tentative settlement this month in an antitrust lawsuit with Sutter Health, a Northern California hospital system. Mr. Becerra has also expressed concern that consumer data was being concentrated among a small number of online platforms.</p><p>On Oct. 1, eight groups who have advocated more aggressive scrutiny of companies like Facebook and Google wrote to Mr. Becerra asking to discuss their concerns with him. Sarah Miller, the deputy director of one group, the Open Markets Institute, said they wanted \u201cto offer to share our views, to hear his views and to help brief or provide educational support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour state is at the epicenter of this national conversation, giving you a unique and powerful position,\u201d the groups wrote. \u201cWe hope to build a constructive line of communication as these corporations continue to be under public and regulatory scrutiny.\u201d</p><p>The groups heard nothing until after Ms. Miller followed up 10 days later.

The tech sector accounted for about 19\"per cent of California's economy last year, according to CompTIA. While that has helped increase owners' property values and contributed to tax revenue, it has also helped the Bay Area become one of the country's least affordable regions as nearby Silicon Valley firms prosper. The median price for a single-family home in the area has nearly tripled to $US940,000 ($1,385,231) from $US327,000 since 2009, according to the California Association of Realtors.</p><p>Broader controversies over consumer-privacy breaches and the out-size power of some tech giants have prompted California politicians to act, even as federal regulators are just beginning to probe some of the nation's largest tech companies, including Facebook, Alphabet's Google, Apple - all based in northern California - and Seattle-based Amazon.com, to examine their market power and influence.</p><p>The state is set to debut a law next year giving privacy rights to consumers unprecedented in the US. Passed last year, the California Consumer Privacy Act broadens the definition of what consti-tutes as personal information and will give California residents the right to prohibit the sale of personal data to third parties and opt out of sharing it altogether. Corporate lobbyists are pushing several bills that would put in place certain exemptions.</p><p>The legislation has reverberated across the country. New Jersey, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Rhode Island and a handful of other states introduced similar privacy bills after the CCPA passed.</p><p>In April, Massachusetts Democratic Senator Edward Markey introduced a bill in the US Senate that borrows from the CCPA and General Data Protection Regulation, passed three years ago in Europe, which has been Big Tech's most aggressive international regulator.</p><p>California also boasts the strongest net neutrality law in the country and recently enacted a law requiring online bots - applications that do automated tasks over the internet - to reveal their \"artificial identity\". California is home to what is known as the gig-economy bill, officially titled Assembly Bill 5, that would affect Uber and Lyft drivers. That bill is working its way through the legislative process.</p><p>Uber and Lyft would face a direct threat to their business model if it passes. The companies are unprofitable even with labour costs at current levels.Spokesmen for Uber and Lyft said the companies are proposing changes to state labour laws that would give drivers more benefits without officially classifying them as employees, arguing that most drivers don't want to lose the flexibility they get as contractors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-d1544a7cbcac11e99e1c021ba39c19b90e9b03d62b1bfc57679351dcebdb4d68</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT2-5701-F0JP-W161-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"571\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 13, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The nation should watch us this election year and learn of its possible future.\u201d   Let\u2019s start with the fires. So far this year, they have torched more than five times as much land as the average of the previous 33 years, killing 25 people and forcing about 100,000 people from their homes. At one point, three of the largest fires in the state\u2019s history were burning simultaneously in a ring around the San Francisco Bay Area. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CAL FIRE, of the 10 largest fires since 1970, five broke out this year. Nine out of 10 have occurred since 2012.   No doubt high temperatures and unusual thunderstorms bear some of the responsibility for this year\u2019s terrifying wildfires on the West Coast. It is deeply misleading to claim, as some diehard deniers still do, that temperatures aren\u2019t rising and making wildfires more likely. But it is equally misleading to claim, as the New York Times did last week, that \u201cscientists say\u201d climate change \u201cis the primary cause of the conflagration.\u201d   In reality, as Stanford\u2019s Rebecca Miller, Christopher Field and Katharine J. Mach argue in a recent article in Nature Sustainability, this crisis has at least as much to do with disastrous land mismanagement as with climate change, and perhaps more. Anyone who thinks solar panels, Teslas and a $3.3 billion white elephant of a high-speed rail line will avoid comparable or worse fires next year (and the year after and the year after) doesn\u2019t understand what the scientists are really saying.   Most measures proposed by environmentalists to reduce carbon dioxide and other \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d emissions will pay off over 50 to 100 years, as the International Panel on Climate Change has long made clear. Even a best-case scenario of \u201cstringent mitigation\u201d (what the IPCC calls Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6) would not bring carbon dioxide emissions down to 1950 levels until around 2050. Nor would it lower global average temperatures; it would merely stop them rising.   And that\u2019s only if the whole world \u2014 including China and India \u2014 takes action. California\u2019s wildfire problem cannot be solved by the state\u2019s citizens \u201cgetting their act together on climate change,\u201d in Newsom\u2019s words. The problem needs immediately effective action \u2014 and that means a return to sane forest management, if such a return is still possible. For decades, Democratic leaders in California have presided over a policy of leaving dead trees to rot, instead of the old and rational system of prescribed or controlled burns, not least because environmental and clear air regulations, as well as problems of legal liability, made controlled burns harder and harder to do.   In prehistoric California, according to a recent analysis in ProPublica, between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each year. California\u2019s land managers burned about 30,000 acres a year on average between 1982 and 1998. Over the next 18 years, that number dropped to an annual 13,000 acres. The result has been a huge accumulation of highly flammable kindling.     Miller, Field and Mach concluded that a total area of around 20 million acres \u2014 roughly one-fifth of the state\u2019s territory \u2014 was in urgent need of \u201cfuel treatment,\u201d meaning prescribed burns, mechanical thinning and managed wildfire. It is hard to imagine anything remotely close to that happening under the current political dispensation. (The authors politely called for \u201cfundamental shifts in prescribed-burn policies, beyond those currently under consideration.\u201d) Or rather, it is going to happen, but at a time of Nature\u2019s choosing, with catastrophic consequences.   A case in point: For a year and a half, red tape slowed down a forest-thinning project in Berry Creek, Butte County. The project covered just 54 acres but, thanks to the burdensome provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, work had yet to start when the North Complex wildfire struck, devastating the town and killing 10 people.   I have some skin in this game. Four years ago, I moved from Harvard University to Stanford University. My family traded a solid, century-old professorial residence in Cambridge for a wooden house in a wooded area that to our wooden heads seemed most idyllic. A few weeks ago, our neighborhood was on the edge of the evacuation zone.   However, I have less skin in the game than Victor Davis Hanson. He lives on the fruit and nut farm near Selma, in the Central Valley, that his family has owned since the 1870s. The air quality index in Stanford rose above 170 on three days in the last month. In Selma last week it was 460. (Anything above 301 qualifies as \u201cemergency conditions.\u201d)   I write these words over 1,000 miles from our California home, but it\u2019s no good: in recent days the smoke has found us, too. Hotel parking lots full of vehicles with CA license plates confirm that we are not the only eastward migrants. It\u2019s like Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cGrapes of Wrath\u201d in reverse: Now that the Golden State is the Char-Grilled State, Californians have become the new Okies, though a good deal less impecunious.   Yet wildfires are only one of the reasons people are fleeing California. In addition, the wrongheaded environmental policies of the sages of Sacramento have so undermined the power grid (for example, by shutting down gas-fired power plants and refusing to count hydroelectric energy as renewable) that residents have been subjected to rolling blackouts this year. The same policies have largely killed off the oil and gas industry. Newsom &amp; Co. have failed to upgrade the water system to keep pace with the last half-century of population growth.   It\u2019s not that California politicians don\u2019t know how to spend money. Back in 2007, total state spending was $146 billion. Last year it was $215 billion. I know, I know: In real terms California\u2019s GDP increased by nearly a third in the same period. And I know: If it were an independent nation it would be the fifth-largest economy in the world, ahead of India\u2019s. But for how much longer will that be true?   California\u2019s taxes aren\u2019t the highest in the country \u2014 for the median household. But the tax system is one of the most progressive, with a 13.3% top tax rate on incomes above $1 million \u2014 and that\u2019s no longer deductible from the federal tax bill as it used to be. The top 1% of taxpayers (those earning more than $500,000) now account for half of personal income-tax revenue. And there\u2019s worse to come.   The latest brilliant ideas in Sacramento are to raise the top income rate up to 16.8% and to levy a wealth tax (0.4% on personal fortunes over $30 million) that you couldn\u2019t even avoid paying if you left the state. (The proposal envisages payment for up to 10 years after departure to a lower-tax state.) It is a strange place that seeks to repel the rich while making itself a magnet for illegal immigrants by establishing no fewer than 20 \u201csanctuary\u201d cities or counties.   And the results of all this progressive policy? A poverty boom. California now has 12% of the nation\u2019s population, but over 30% of its welfare recipients. By the official measure, based mainly on income and family size, California\u2019s 11.4% poverty rate in 2019 was close to the national average over the past three years. However, according to a new Census Bureau report, which takes housing and other costs into account, the real poverty rate in California is 17.2%, the highest of any state. (Newsom gets one thing right when he says, \u201cWe\u2019re living in the wealthiest as well as the poorest state in America.\u201d)   About a third of California\u2019s poverty can be attributed to housing and other living costs such as clothing and utilities. As everyone who resides there knows, there\u2019s a chronic housing shortage in the Bay Area (the median-priced home in San Francisco costs about $1.5 million), mainly because a plethora of regulations make the construction of affordable housing well-nigh impossible. In blithe disregard of all we know about rent controls \u2014 which discourage landlords from providing housing \u2014 that is, predictably, the solution the Democrats propose.   But that\u2019s not all. The state\u2019s public schools rank 37th in the country overall and have the highest pupil-teacher ratio. \u201cOnly half of California students meet English standards and fewer meet math standards, test scores show,\u201d was a headline in the Los Angeles Times last October. Health care and pension costs are unsustainable. Oh, and they messed up on Covid-19, despite imposing the nation\u2019s first shelter-in-place orders. Having prematurely claimed victory, California now leads New York in terms of cases, though not deaths.   Back in the 1960s, California was the world\u2019s fantasy destination. \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019,\u201d \u201cCalifornia Girls,\u201d \u201cGoing to California\u201d \u2014 you know the songs. But reputations have a way of outliving reality. Despite the economic miracle wrought in Silicon Valley, beginning with the genesis of the internet back in the 1970s, and despite the continuing strength of the state\u2019s universities, the dream in terms of quality of life has slowly died.   When I first visited San Francisco in 1981, it was still one of the loveliest cities I had ever beheld. Now its streets are so filthy \u2014 human feces and syringe needles are the principal hazards \u2014 that I avoid it. (I was going to say \u201clike the plague,\u201d but that\u2019s Lake Tahoe.)   Yet the Bay Area and its southern sister Los Angeles are only one of the two Californias. As Hanson argued 10 years ago, the Central Valley is another country, more \u201cCaribbean\u201d or Latin American, where \u201ccountless inland communities \u2026 have become near-apartheid societies, where Spanish is the first language, the schools are not at all diverse, and the federal and state governments are either the main employers or at least the chief sources of income.\u201d   The principal reason for California\u2019s decline is that the Golden State became a one-party state. The Republican candidate won California in every election but one (1964) between 1952 and 1988. But the Democrat has won California in every election since, with the Democratic vote share rising from 46% in 1992 to 62% in 2016.   Democrats now have 61 out of 80 seats in the California State Assembly. The last time Republicans had a majority (of one) was in 1994, but that was an anomaly. The Democrats have essentially controlled the State Senate since 1958, with rising majorities since the 1990s. Apart from 1994, the only other year since 1958 when they did not win a majority of seats in the Assembly was 1968.   When regular voting has no effect, people eventually vote with their feet. From 2007 until 2016, about five million people moved to California but six million moved out to other states. For years before that, the newcomers were poorer than the leavers. This net exodus is surging in 2020. And businesses (for example, Charles Schwab Corp.) are leaving too. Silicon Valley is going virtual, with many big tech companies thinking of making work from home permanent for at least some employees. (One tech chief executive told me last week that his engineers were pleading not to return to the office.)   People are getting out of the Bay Area as much and perhaps more than they are getting out of New York City. Texas is only one of the favored alternatives. Realtors in Montana are reporting record demand from West Coast refugees. The hotels are full, which is unheard of at this time of year. I also know a number of eminent Californians who are now Hawaiians.   The conservative writer and broadcaster Ben Shapiro, born in L.A., just announced that he is heading to Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cI love the state, grew up in the state, married in the state and have had children in the state,\u201d he told Laura Ingraham. But California was \u201cnot a great place to raise children and not a great place to build a company.\u201d Now we know the true meaning of Calexit. It\u2019s not secession. It\u2019s exodus.   I cannot blame the leavers. When I moved West in 2016, it was in the naive belief that California was Massachusetts without snow and Stanford was Harvard with September weather all year round. How wrong I was.   But am I leaving? Well, maybe there\u2019s no point. As Newsom\u2019s predecessor Jerry Brown put it last week: \u201cThere are going to be problems everywhere in the United States. This is the new normal. It\u2019s been predicted and it\u2019s happening \u2026 Tell me: Where are you going to go? What\u2019s your alternative?\u201d    Great question, but \u2014 as with Newsom\u2019s prophecy \u2014 wrongly framed. The big problem is not that climate change is coming to every state. It is, though most states will mitigate it better than California. The problem is that Democratic governance could be coming to the nation as a whole, starting on Jan. 20. And with the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, turning 78 two weeks after election day, it is not a little troubling to me that his vice-presidential pick is a Californian, just as so many of his plans to spend, tax and regulate have \u201cdesigned in California\u201d all over them.    Yes, folks, California is America fast forward. Can someone please hit pause?   This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

The nation should watch us this election year and learn of its possible future.\u201d   Let\u2019s start with the fires. So far this year, they have torched more than five times as much land as the average of the previous 33 years, killing 25 people and forcing about 100,000 people from their homes. At one point, three of the largest fires in the state\u2019s history were burning simultaneously in a ring around the San Francisco Bay Area. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CAL FIRE, of the 10 largest fires since 1970, five broke out this year. Nine out of 10 have occurred since 2012.   No doubt high temperatures and unusual thunderstorms bear some of the responsibility for this year\u2019s terrifying wildfires on the West Coast. It is deeply misleading to claim, as some diehard deniers still do, that temperatures aren\u2019t rising and making wildfires more likely. But it is equally misleading to claim, as the New York Times did last week, that \u201cscientists say\u201d climate change \u201cis the primary cause of the conflagration.\u201d   In reality, as Stanford\u2019s Rebecca Miller, Christopher Field and Katharine J. Mach argue in a recent article in Nature Sustainability, this crisis has at least as much to do with disastrous land mismanagement as with climate change, and perhaps more. Anyone who thinks solar panels, Teslas and a $3.3 billion white elephant of a high-speed rail line will avoid comparable or worse fires next year (and the year after and the year after) doesn\u2019t understand what the scientists are really saying.   Most measures proposed by environmentalists to reduce carbon dioxide and other \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d emissions will pay off over 50 to 100 years, as the International Panel on Climate Change has long made clear. Even a best-case scenario of \u201cstringent mitigation\u201d (what the IPCC calls Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6) would not bring carbon dioxide emissions down to 1950 levels until around 2050. Nor would it lower global average temperatures; it would merely stop them rising.   And that\u2019s only if the whole world \u2014 including China and India \u2014 takes action. California\u2019s wildfire problem cannot be solved by the state\u2019s citizens \u201cgetting their act together on climate change,\u201d in Newsom\u2019s words. The problem needs immediately effective action \u2014 and that means a return to sane forest management, if such a return is still possible. For decades, Democratic leaders in California have presided over a policy of leaving dead trees to rot, instead of the old and rational system of prescribed or controlled burns, not least because environmental and clear air regulations, as well as problems of legal liability, made controlled burns harder and harder to do.   In prehistoric California, according to a recent analysis in ProPublica, between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each year. California\u2019s land managers burned about 30,000 acres a year on average between 1982 and 1998. Over the next 18 years, that number dropped to an annual 13,000 acres. The result has been a huge accumulation of highly flammable kindling.     Miller, Field and Mach concluded that a total area of around 20 million acres \u2014 roughly one-fifth of the state\u2019s territory \u2014 was in urgent need of \u201cfuel treatment,\u201d meaning prescribed burns, mechanical thinning and managed wildfire. It is hard to imagine anything remotely close to that happening under the current political dispensation. (The authors politely called for \u201cfundamental shifts in prescribed-burn policies, beyond those currently under consideration.\u201d) Or rather, it is going to happen, but at a time of Nature\u2019s choosing, with catastrophic consequences.   A case in point: For a year and a half, red tape slowed down a forest-thinning project in Berry Creek, Butte County. The project covered just 54 acres but, thanks to the burdensome provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, work had yet to start when the North Complex wildfire struck, devastating the town and killing 10 people.   I have some skin in this game. Four years ago, I moved from Harvard University to Stanford University. My family traded a solid, century-old professorial residence in Cambridge for a wooden house in a wooded area that to our wooden heads seemed most idyllic. A few weeks ago, our neighborhood was on the edge of the evacuation zone.   However, I have less skin in the game than Victor Davis Hanson. He lives on the fruit and nut farm near Selma, in the Central Valley, that his family has owned since the 1870s. The air quality index in Stanford rose above 170 on three days in the last month. In Selma last week it was 460. (Anything above 301 qualifies as \u201cemergency conditions.\u201d)   I write these words over 1,000 miles from our California home, but it\u2019s no good: in recent days the smoke has found us, too. Hotel parking lots full of vehicles with CA license plates confirm that we are not the only eastward migrants. It\u2019s like Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cGrapes of Wrath\u201d in reverse: Now that the Golden State is the Char-Grilled State, Californians have become the new Okies, though a good deal less impecunious.   Yet wildfires are only one of the reasons people are fleeing California. In addition, the wrongheaded environmental policies of the sages of Sacramento have so undermined the power grid (for example, by shutting down gas-fired power plants and refusing to count hydroelectric energy as renewable) that residents have been subjected to rolling blackouts this year. The same policies have largely killed off the oil and gas industry. Newsom &amp; Co. have failed to upgrade the water system to keep pace with the last half-century of population growth.   It\u2019s not that California politicians don\u2019t know how to spend money. Back in 2007, total state spending was $146 billion. Last year it was $215 billion. I know, I know: In real terms California\u2019s GDP increased by nearly a third in the same period. And I know: If it were an independent nation it would be the fifth-largest economy in the world, ahead of India\u2019s. But for how much longer will that be true?   California\u2019s taxes aren\u2019t the highest in the country \u2014 for the median household. But the tax system is one of the most progressive, with a 13.3% top tax rate on incomes above $1 million \u2014 and that\u2019s no longer deductible from the federal tax bill as it used to be. The top 1% of taxpayers (those earning more than $500,000) now account for half of personal income-tax revenue. And there\u2019s worse to come.   The latest brilliant ideas in Sacramento are to raise the top income rate up to 16.8% and to levy a wealth tax (0.4% on personal fortunes over $30 million) that you couldn\u2019t even avoid paying if you left the state. (The proposal envisages payment for up to 10 years after departure to a lower-tax state.) It is a strange place that seeks to repel the rich while making itself a magnet for illegal immigrants by establishing no fewer than 20 \u201csanctuary\u201d cities or counties.   And the results of all this progressive policy? A poverty boom. California now has 12% of the nation\u2019s population, but over 30% of its welfare recipients. By the official measure, based mainly on income and family size, California\u2019s 11.4% poverty rate in 2019 was close to the national average over the past three years. However, according to a new Census Bureau report, which takes housing and other costs into account, the real poverty rate in California is 17.2%, the highest of any state. (Newsom gets one thing right when he says, \u201cWe\u2019re living in the wealthiest as well as the poorest state in America.\u201d)   About a third of California\u2019s poverty can be attributed to housing and other living costs such as clothing and utilities. As everyone who resides there knows, there\u2019s a chronic housing shortage in the Bay Area (the median-priced home in San Francisco costs about $1.5 million), mainly because a plethora of regulations make the construction of affordable housing well-nigh impossible. In blithe disregard of all we know about rent controls \u2014 which discourage landlords from providing housing \u2014 that is, predictably, the solution the Democrats propose.   But that\u2019s not all. The state\u2019s public schools rank 37th in the country overall and have the highest pupil-teacher ratio. \u201cOnly half of California students meet English standards and fewer meet math standards, test scores show,\u201d was a headline in the Los Angeles Times last October. Health care and pension costs are unsustainable. Oh, and they messed up on Covid-19, despite imposing the nation\u2019s first shelter-in-place orders. Having prematurely claimed victory, California now leads New York in terms of cases, though not deaths.   Back in the 1960s, California was the world\u2019s fantasy destination. \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019,\u201d \u201cCalifornia Girls,\u201d \u201cGoing to California\u201d \u2014 you know the songs. But reputations have a way of outliving reality. Despite the economic miracle wrought in Silicon Valley, beginning with the genesis of the internet back in the 1970s, and despite the continuing strength of the state\u2019s universities, the dream in terms of quality of life has slowly died.   When I first visited San Francisco in 1981, it was still one of the loveliest cities I had ever beheld. Now its streets are so filthy \u2014 human feces and syringe needles are the principal hazards \u2014 that I avoid it. (I was going to say \u201clike the plague,\u201d but that\u2019s Lake Tahoe.)   Yet the Bay Area and its southern sister Los Angeles are only one of the two Californias. As Hanson argued 10 years ago, the Central Valley is another country, more \u201cCaribbean\u201d or Latin American, where \u201ccountless inland communities \u2026 have become near-apartheid societies, where Spanish is the first language, the schools are not at all diverse, and the federal and state governments are either the main employers or at least the chief sources of income.\u201d   The principal reason for California\u2019s decline is that the Golden State became a one-party state. The Republican candidate won California in every election but one (1964) between 1952 and 1988. But the Democrat has won California in every election since, with the Democratic vote share rising from 46% in 1992 to 62% in 2016.   Democrats now have 61 out of 80 seats in the California State Assembly. The last time Republicans had a majority (of one) was in 1994, but that was an anomaly. The Democrats have essentially controlled the State Senate since 1958, with rising majorities since the 1990s. Apart from 1994, the only other year since 1958 when they did not win a majority of seats in the Assembly was 1968.   When regular voting has no effect, people eventually vote with their feet. From 2007 until 2016, about five million people moved to California but six million moved out to other states. For years before that, the newcomers were poorer than the leavers. This net exodus is surging in 2020. And businesses (for example, Charles Schwab Corp.) are leaving too. Silicon Valley is going virtual, with many big tech companies thinking of making work from home permanent for at least some employees. (One tech chief executive told me last week that his engineers were pleading not to return to the office.)   People are getting out of the Bay Area as much and perhaps more than they are getting out of New York City. Texas is only one of the favored alternatives. Realtors in Montana are reporting record demand from West Coast refugees. The hotels are full, which is unheard of at this time of year. I also know a number of eminent Californians who are now Hawaiians.   The conservative writer and broadcaster Ben Shapiro, born in L.A., just announced that he is heading to Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cI love the state, grew up in the state, married in the state and have had children in the state,\u201d he told Laura Ingraham. But California was \u201cnot a great place to raise children and not a great place to build a company.\u201d Now we know the true meaning of Calexit. It\u2019s not secession. It\u2019s exodus.   I cannot blame the leavers. When I moved West in 2016, it was in the naive belief that California was Massachusetts without snow and Stanford was Harvard with September weather all year round. How wrong I was.   But am I leaving? Well, maybe there\u2019s no point. As Newsom\u2019s predecessor Jerry Brown put it last week: \u201cThere are going to be problems everywhere in the United States. This is the new normal. It\u2019s been predicted and it\u2019s happening \u2026 Tell me: Where are you going to go? What\u2019s your alternative?\u201d    Great question, but \u2014 as with Newsom\u2019s prophecy \u2014 wrongly framed. The big problem is not that climate change is coming to every state. It is, though most states will mitigate it better than California. The problem is that Democratic governance could be coming to the nation as a whole, starting on Jan. 20. And with the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, turning 78 two weeks after election day, it is not a little troubling to me that his vice-presidential pick is a Californian, just as so many of his plans to spend, tax and regulate have \u201cdesigned in California\u201d all over them.    Yes, folks, California is America fast forward. Can someone please hit pause?   This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

The nation should watch us this election year and learn of its possible future.\u201d   Let\u2019s start with the fires. So far this year, they have torched more than five times as much land as the average of the previous 33 years, killing 25 people and forcing about 100,000 people from their homes. At one point, three of the largest fires in the state\u2019s history were burning simultaneously in a ring around the San Francisco Bay Area. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CAL FIRE, of the 10 largest fires since 1970, five broke out this year. Nine out of 10 have occurred since 2012.   No doubt high temperatures and unusual thunderstorms bear some of the responsibility for this year\u2019s terrifying wildfires on the West Coast. It is deeply misleading to claim, as some diehard deniers still do, that temperatures aren\u2019t rising and making wildfires more likely. But it is equally misleading to claim, as the New York Times did last week, that \u201cscientists say\u201d climate change \u201cis the primary cause of the conflagration.\u201d   In reality, as Stanford\u2019s Rebecca Miller, Christopher Field and Katharine J. Mach argue in a recent article in Nature Sustainability, this crisis has at least as much to do with disastrous land mismanagement as with climate change, and perhaps more. Anyone who thinks solar panels, Teslas and a $3.3 billion white elephant of a high-speed rail line will avoid comparable or worse fires next year (and the year after and the year after) doesn\u2019t understand what the scientists are really saying.   Most measures proposed by environmentalists to reduce carbon dioxide and other \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d emissions will pay off over 50 to 100 years, as the International Panel on Climate Change has long made clear. Even a best-case scenario of \u201cstringent mitigation\u201d (what the IPCC calls Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6) would not bring carbon dioxide emissions down to 1950 levels until around 2050. Nor would it lower global average temperatures; it would merely stop them rising.   And that\u2019s only if the whole world \u2014 including China and India \u2014 takes action. California\u2019s wildfire problem cannot be solved by the state\u2019s citizens \u201cgetting their act together on climate change,\u201d in Newsom\u2019s words. The problem needs immediately effective action \u2014 and that means a return to sane forest management, if such a return is still possible. For decades, Democratic leaders in California have presided over a policy of leaving dead trees to rot, instead of the old and rational system of prescribed or controlled burns, not least because environmental and clear air regulations, as well as problems of legal liability, made controlled burns harder and harder to do.   In prehistoric California, according to a recent analysis in ProPublica, between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each year. California\u2019s land managers burned about 30,000 acres a year on average between 1982 and 1998. Over the next 18 years, that number dropped to an annual 13,000 acres. The result has been a huge accumulation of highly flammable kindling.     Miller, Field and Mach concluded that a total area of around 20 million acres \u2014 roughly one-fifth of the state\u2019s territory \u2014 was in urgent need of \u201cfuel treatment,\u201d meaning prescribed burns, mechanical thinning and managed wildfire. It is hard to imagine anything remotely close to that happening under the current political dispensation. (The authors politely called for \u201cfundamental shifts in prescribed-burn policies, beyond those currently under consideration.\u201d) Or rather, it is going to happen, but at a time of Nature\u2019s choosing, with catastrophic consequences.   A case in point: For a year and a half, red tape slowed down a forest-thinning project in Berry Creek, Butte County. The project covered just 54 acres but, thanks to the burdensome provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, work had yet to start when the North Complex wildfire struck, devastating the town and killing 10 people.   I have some skin in this game. Four years ago, I moved from Harvard University to Stanford University. My family traded a solid, century-old professorial residence in Cambridge for a wooden house in a wooded area that to our wooden heads seemed most idyllic. A few weeks ago, our neighborhood was on the edge of the evacuation zone.   However, I have less skin in the game than Victor Davis Hanson. He lives on the fruit and nut farm near Selma, in the Central Valley, that his family has owned since the 1870s. The air quality index in Stanford rose above 170 on three days in the last month. In Selma last week it was 460. (Anything above 301 qualifies as \u201cemergency conditions.\u201d)   I write these words over 1,000 miles from our California home, but it\u2019s no good: in recent days the smoke has found us, too. Hotel parking lots full of vehicles with CA license plates confirm that we are not the only eastward migrants. It\u2019s like Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cGrapes of Wrath\u201d in reverse: Now that the Golden State is the Char-Grilled State, Californians have become the new Okies, though a good deal less impecunious.   Yet wildfires are only one of the reasons people are fleeing California. In addition, the wrongheaded environmental policies of the sages of Sacramento have so undermined the power grid (for example, by shutting down gas-fired power plants and refusing to count hydroelectric energy as renewable) that residents have been subjected to rolling blackouts this year. The same policies have largely killed off the oil and gas industry. Newsom &amp; Co. have failed to upgrade the water system to keep pace with the last half-century of population growth.   It\u2019s not that California politicians don\u2019t know how to spend money. Back in 2007, total state spending was $146 billion. Last year it was $215 billion. I know, I know: In real terms California\u2019s GDP increased by nearly a third in the same period. And I know: If it were an independent nation it would be the fifth-largest economy in the world, ahead of India\u2019s. But for how much longer will that be true?   California\u2019s taxes aren\u2019t the highest in the country \u2014 for the median household. But the tax system is one of the most progressive, with a 13.3% top tax rate on incomes above $1 million \u2014 and that\u2019s no longer deductible from the federal tax bill as it used to be. The top 1% of taxpayers (those earning more than $500,000) now account for half of personal income-tax revenue. And there\u2019s worse to come.   The latest brilliant ideas in Sacramento are to raise the top income rate up to 16.8% and to levy a wealth tax (0.4% on personal fortunes over $30 million) that you couldn\u2019t even avoid paying if you left the state. (The proposal envisages payment for up to 10 years after departure to a lower-tax state.) It is a strange place that seeks to repel the rich while making itself a magnet for illegal immigrants by establishing no fewer than 20 \u201csanctuary\u201d cities or counties.   And the results of all this progressive policy? A poverty boom. California now has 12% of the nation's population, but over 30% of its welfare recipients. By the official measure, based mainly on income and family size, California\u2019s 11.4% poverty rate in 2019 was close to the national average over the past three years. However, according to a new Census Bureau report, which takes housing and other costs into account, the real poverty rate in California is 17.2%, the highest of any state. (Newsom gets one thing right when he says, \u201cWe're living in the wealthiest as well as the poorest state in America.\u201d)   About a third of California\u2019s poverty can be attributed to housing and other living costs such as clothing and utilities. As everyone who resides there knows, there\u2019s a chronic housing shortage in the Bay Area (the median-priced home in San Francisco costs about $1.5 million), mainly because a plethora of regulations make the construction of affordable housing well-nigh impossible. In blithe disregard of all we know about rent controls \u2014 which discourage landlords from providing housing \u2014 that is, predictably, the solution the Democrats propose.   But that\u2019s not all. The state\u2019s public schools rank 37th in the country overall and have the highest pupil-teacher ratio. \u201cOnly half of California students meet English standards and fewer meet math standards, test scores show,\u201d was a headline in the Los Angeles Times last October. Health care and pension costs are unsustainable. Oh, and they messed up on Covid-19, despite imposing the nation\u2019s first shelter-in-place orders. Having prematurely claimed victory, California now leads New York in terms of cases, though not deaths.   Back in the 1960s, California was the world\u2019s fantasy destination. \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019,\u201d \u201cCalifornia Girls,\u201d \u201cGoing to California\u201d \u2014 you know the songs. But reputations have a way of outliving reality. Despite the economic miracle wrought in Silicon Valley, beginning with the genesis of the internet back in the 1970s, and despite the continuing strength of the state\u2019s universities, the dream in terms of quality of life has slowly died.   When I first visited San Francisco in 1981, it was still one of the loveliest cities I had ever beheld. Now its streets are so filthy \u2014 human feces and syringe needles are the principal hazards \u2014 that I avoid it. (I was going to say \u201clike the plague,\u201d but that\u2019s Lake Tahoe.)   Yet the Bay Area and its southern sister Los Angeles are only one of the two Californias. As Hanson argued 10 years ago, the Central Valley is another country, more \u201cCaribbean\u201d or Latin American, where \u201ccountless inland communities \u2026 have become near-apartheid societies, where Spanish is the first language, the schools are not at all diverse, and the federal and state governments are either the main employers or at least the chief sources of income.\u201d   The principal reason for California\u2019s decline is that the Golden State became a one-party state. The Republican candidate won California in every election but one (1964) between 1952 and 1988. But the Democrat has won California in every election since, with the Democratic vote share rising from 46% in 1992 to 62% in 2016.   Democrats now have 61 out of 80 seats in the California State Assembly. The last time Republicans had a majority (of one) was in 1994, but that was an anomaly. The Democrats have essentially controlled the State Senate since 1958, with rising majorities since the 1990s. Apart from 1994, the only other year since 1958 when they did not win a majority of seats in the Assembly was 1968.   When regular voting has no effect, people eventually vote with their feet. From 2007 until 2016, about five million people moved to California but six million moved out to other states. For years before that, the newcomers were poorer than the leavers. This net exodus is surging in 2020. And businesses (for example, Charles Schwab Corp.) are leaving too. Silicon Valley is going virtual, with many big tech companies thinking of making work from home permanent for at least some employees. (One tech chief executive told me last week that his engineers were pleading not to return to the office.)   People are getting out of the Bay Area as much and perhaps more than they are getting out of New York City. Texas is only one of the favored alternatives. Realtors in Montana are reporting record demand from West Coast refugees. The hotels are full, which is unheard of at this time of year. I also know a number of eminent Californians who are now Hawaiians.   The conservative writer and broadcaster Ben Shapiro, born in L.A., just announced that he is heading to Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cI love the state, grew up in the state, married in the state and have had children in the state,\u201d he told Laura Ingraham. But California was \u201cnot a great place to raise children and not a great place to build a company.\u201d Now we know the true meaning of Calexit. It\u2019s not secession. It\u2019s exodus.   I cannot blame the leavers. When I moved West in 2016, it was in the naive belief that California was Massachusetts without snow and Stanford was Harvard with September weather all year round. How wrong I was.   But am I leaving? Well, maybe there\u2019s no point. As Newsom\u2019s predecessor Jerry Brown put it last week: \u201cThere are going to be problems everywhere in the United States. This is the new normal. It\u2019s been predicted and it\u2019s happening \u2026 Tell me: Where are you going to go? What\u2019s your alternative?\u201d    Great question, but \u2014 as with Newsom\u2019s prophecy \u2014 wrongly framed. The big problem is not that climate change is coming to every state. It is, though most states will mitigate it better than California. The problem is that Democratic governance could be coming to the nation as a whole, starting on Jan. 20. And with the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, turning 78 two weeks after election day, it is not a little troubling to me that his vice-presidential pick is a Californian, just as so many of his plans to spend, tax and regulate have \u201cdesigned in California\u201d all over them.    Yes, folks, California is America fast forward. Can someone please hit pause?   This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

The most controversial and divisive issue in Los Angeles these days may be scooters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the last few months, some 36,000 shared electric scooters and bicycles have been allowed onto the city's streets, as part of a one-year pilot program to study how so-called micromobility vehicles can be used and regulated in L.A. In some neighborhoods, you can't travel a block without seeing a scooter parked on - or dumped on - the sidewalk, and customers have taken around 2 million rides since the beginning of the year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the city is split at the moment into two camps: scooter lovers, who say the rent-per-ride vehicles are a cheap, convenient way to travel short distances without getting into a car, thereby helping reduce tailpipe pollution and traffic congestion. And scooter haters, who say the vehicles are big, possibly dangerous toys being used irresponsibly and left cluttering the sidewalks when the joy ride is over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They're both right.</p><p>The scooter lovers are certainly correct that in this traffic-clogged, smoggy city, people need more travel alternatives to cars. Shared scooters and bikes are especially helpful as \"first-mile, last-mile\" vehicles to move people between their homes or jobs and transit stations. The growing number of scooter riders helps build the case for more protected lanes and redesigned roads that make the streets safer for bicyclists, scooter riders and walkers too.</p><p>But the skeptics raise legitimate gripes about the private companies that have, in some neighborhoods, inundated public spaces with scooters but failed to hold their customers accountable. So far, the companies have talked about educating riders and offering them incentives for good behavior, but problems persist. (During the first five months of the pilot project, the city received more than 3,000 complaints about scooters through its 311 app.) How much responsibility should scooter companies bear for the rude, irresponsible or downright dangerous behavior of their customers?</p><p>A lot. Scooter companies have essentially introduced a new type of vehicle to the transportation landscape. They have an obligation to make sure their customers know the rules of the road and adhere to the proper etiquette governing how to ride and park the vehicles.</p><p>After mostly welcoming scooters with open arms, Los Angeles officials are now considering following the lead of Chicago and some other cities and fining companies when rules or laws are broken. The city already requires companies to respond within two hours to complaints of broken, toppled or improperly parked scooters. If the companies are unresponsive over a long period, they eventually risk losing their permit to operate.</p><p>Now, new penalties are being proposed, ranging from $50 for failing to respond to a service request within two hours to $1,500 if a company's customers repeatedly and consistently park their scooters improperly. (Separately, the Los Angeles Police Department has begun ticketing riders for riding on the sidewalk, which isn't allowed.)</p><p>Ideally, the city won't need to levy steep penalties on companies. Scooters are still new, and some of the problems may resolve themselves if scooters become less of a novelty and more of a regular mode of transportation. Nevertheless, fines could help prod companies to be more proactive in managing their scooters and their customers, particularly if those companies choose to pass the fine along to offending riders, which would be another incentive for good behavior.</p><p>Scooters companies have one big incentive already for being good stewards of the public space - many cities have banned shared, dockless vehicles from operating within their jurisdictions. It's not hard to imagine that if residents complain enough about bad scooter behavior, Los Angeles will also consider a severe crackdown or even a ban. And other cities would likely follow.</p><p>That would be a shame. If scooters are ever going to be taken seriously as a transportation solution, then companies have to do a better job getting their customers to be responsible riders.</p><p>___</p><p>July 28</p><p>Mercury News &amp; East Bay Times on regulating the tech industry:</p><p>The day of reckoning for Big Tech is upon us.</p><p>Technology companies swung and missed at repeated opportunities over the past decade to work with the federal government on regulations to ensure consumer privacy and fair competition. They had a chance to address the issues and they failed.</p><p>So we move to the next, inevitable step: the federal government's announcement last week that it will conduct an antitrust investigation of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. Now the stakes are much higher. The industry's past foot-dragging means that it now faces a real threat that the feds could act unilaterally - and stifle innovation in the process.</p><p>It's a serious risk. Raise your hand if you think the folks at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission understand what drives the innovation economy. That's what we thought. Yet these are the people who will be drawing up the rules the tech industry will play by in the years ahead.</p><p>Let's hope they don't forget that innovation is at the heart of our economic growth. Our ability to remain a world power requires that we maintain a technological edge over China and our other global competitors.</p><p>That won't be easy. The Chinese government is investing $300 billion in an effort to dominate the fields of green energy, green vehicles, robotics, medicine and artificial intelligence. Its goal is to overcome the United States' technological advantage by 2025. Any serious disruption in the way the U.S. tech industry operates could have costly, unintended consequences on our ability to maintain our advantage.</p><p>Whatever the federal government does, it must maintain incentives for U.S. tech firms to keep spending on research and development, which is one of their primary tools to evolve and prepare for the future.</p><p>Tech leads U.S. companies in research and development spending. Amazon ($14.1 billion), Google ($10.15 billion), Apple ($7.65 billion) and Facebook ($4.76 billion) were among the top 10 investors in R&amp;D in 2018. They are using those billions as a strategic weapon to win what could accurately be described as the World War of Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>Time is of the essence. The digital landscape of 2030 is likely to be fundamentally different than it is today. After all, consider how fast it's changed in the past dozen years. As recently as 2007, MySpace dominated the social networking landscape, receiving more than 70% of all visits to social networks. Facebook, which was only three years old, was a distant second.</p><p>That same year, IBM created Watson, its artificial intelligence system. Apple released the iPhone, Airbnb was founded, and Twitter had just gone global. Google had yet to release its Android system and Amazon was still finding its way on the cloud computing scene.</p><p>Those companies launched a wave of innovation that helped the United States emerge from the 2008 financial crisis and create what has been the longest bull market in history. Unfortunately, Big Tech's dominance over those years has led to abuses that deserve greater federal regulation.</p><p>As a result, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission now needs to rein in Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. But, in the process, the feds must take extreme caution not to stifle innovation.</p><p>___</p><p>July 26</p><p>Southern California News Group on the state's diversion of mortgage settlement funds:</p><p>The California Supreme Court has finally put an end to the five-year-long shell game played by the state government with $331 million intended to help distressed homeowners during the recession-era mortgage crisis.</p><p>The justices refused to hear an appeal from Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration, filed after the latest in a series of court decisions that went against the state. In April, an appeals court in Sacramento ruled in favor of consumer-advocacy groups that have been fighting for years to stop the state's diversion of the funds.</p><p>The money came from the national settlement in 2012 of a lawsuit filed by 49 states, the District of Columbia and the federal government against the nation's five largest mortgage servicing companies - Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and the former GMAC, now known as Ally. The financial institutions agreed to pay more than $20 billion directly to affected homeowners and also to pay $2.5 billion to the states. California's share was $410 million.</p><p>Then-Attorney General Kamala Harris directed that the state's money from the settlement should be used for various services such as homeowner education and programs to stop financial fraud. Instead, then-Gov. Jerry Brown, facing budget pressures, spent the money to cover other state expenses, including using $292 million of the mortgage settlement funds to pay state debt on housing bonds that voters had approved as far back as 2002.</p><p>Groups representing distressed mortgage customers, including representatives of the Asian-American and Latino communities, filed suit in 2014 over the diversion of the funds, and courts repeatedly sided with them.</p><p>State officials could have accepted those rulings and paid back the money, but instead they doubled down on sketchy conduct. Gov. Brown and the Legislature made an after-the-fact attempt to legalize the state's rerouting of the settlement money with a hastily passed budget trailer bill, signed into law in September 2018.</p><p>The trailer bill, Senate Bill 861, stated that the California Department of Finance spent the $331 million from the mortgage settlement in a way that was \"consistent with legislative direction.\"</p><p>But signing it didn't make it so. \"The money was unlawfully diverted,\" the 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled in April.</p><p>With the recession-era budget problems in the rear-view mirror and surplus revenue rolling in to the state treasury, Gov. Newsom could have accepted the appeals court's decision and paid back the money. Instead he filed another appeal, this time to the California Supreme Court.</p><p>Last week, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal. Newsom now says he will begin work on repaying the $331 million back to the special fund that was intended to help California homeowners who were hard hit by the mortgage crisis.</p><p>In the final analysis, three years of state budget expenses were paid with funds that were intended to benefit distressed homeowners. Groups seeking to stop the diversion had to spend five years battling in court as the state tried every trick to keep the money. Homeowners who suffered during the mortgage crisis lost the benefit of five years of programs that might have helped them. And taxpayers had to foot the bill for the private law firm that represented the state after then-Attorney General Kamala Harris refused to defend the diversion of the settlement funds.</p><p>The mortgage crisis may be over, but in California, the financial losses continue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

What do voters in the US' most populous state want out of their Democratic nominee?Just as you would expect at this time of year, the sun is shining and the wind is blowing through the Mission District in east-central San Francisco. A historically Latino neighborhood, the area has become a poster child for gentrification: Today, this is where you'll find hipsters, yoga studios and expensive boutiques alongside traditional taquerias and community art and cultural institutions. </p><p>Liliana and her friend Carlos have set up shop just around the corner from an expensive Mexican restaurant. Their empanadas come straight from a tupperware container for the price of $3 (\u20ac2.70). When asked about politics, Liliana was unequivocal: \"We need change\" \u2014 but as a Mexican citizen, she is not allowed to vote.Liliana also admits she's not familiar with any of the candidates. Her daughter has US citizenship but \"when we get to spend time together, we just want to enjoy it and not think about politics.\" California's new roleIn the past, California held its primary elections in June, towards the end of a months-long Democratic primary race. That late in the game, the rest of the country had already made their decisions, leaving California to essentially rubber-stamp one of a few candidates. In 2017, though, that changed when the state moved its primary elections up to March. California, the most populous state in the US, will now play a key role in deciding who will wind up as the Democratic nominee.A third of the total delegates are up for grabs on one day, and 415 in California alone, the highest number of all the states. A candidate needs 1,991 delegates to secure the nomination in July. The votes on Super Tuesday will decide over 1,357 out of the total 3,979 delegates. Primary elections this Tuesday are also being held in Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Utah, Maine, Vermont, American Samoa. Democrats abroad are also voting.Read more: Super Tuesday - a 'how to' guide to the 2020 US primary electionsCalifornians are still getting used to their new role, said JoAnne Williams, who lives in the Mission District. After moving here from Harlem, New York, she said she was surprised by the lack of interest and civic engagement in San Francisco. \"It's a completely different culture, a completely different vibe, and it seems like folks are so in a bubble. I actually just had an internal debate with myself about whether to add a calendar invite for my team to at least make sure that everyone on my team was aware that we had a primary election on Tuesday.\"Williams works in the finance department of one of the big tech companies. She is planning on voting for Elizabeth Warren, she said. Among other things, Williams said she is impressed with Warren's track record to protect consumers from big banks.California is 'feeling the Bern'Warren is in third place and has earned only eight delegates so far. The Massachusetts senator is far behind front-runner Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, with 45 delegates, and Joe Biden, former vice president, with 15 delegates. Sanders, the self-proclaimed democratic socialist, is leading after early contests. Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, is only now officially entering the race. He could possibly steal a good number of votes from Sanders and Biden. Tulsi Gabbard, the congresswoman from Hawaii, will likely not earn any delegates, since candidates need more than 15% of votes to be considered.Read more: Bernie Sanders has a clear lead in artist endorsementsThe state of California leans Democratic, but outside of the liberal cities, there are plenty of conservatives. Orange County and the Central Valley are home to a high number of lower-middle and working-class Americans. Those who are registered as Democrats and are voting in the primary will most likely stick to the conservative candidates and could give Bloomberg \u2014 who is known to have supported plenty of Republicans in the past \u2014 a boost. Who can beat Trump?Bloomberg is definitely Harrison Tucker's first choice. Tucker works for a sustainable real estate developer and moved to San Francisco from North Carolina. He says his family and friends could be convinced to vote for a Democrat in the presidential election, if it's the right one.\"Nobody would vote for Warren or Sanders. They are anti-capitalist and want to increase regulations. People in North Carolina are worried these candidates would destroy the economy,\" Tucker said. Like many others, Tucker is not voting for the candidate who represents his values best \u2014 he is betting on the one who can beat Trump.Read more: Pete Buttigieg ends presidential campaignMegan, a young white woman, has a different strategy. She is canvassing for a local progressive candidate. Local offices are on the ballot on Tuesday as well. Megan lives in San Francisco now but is still registered as a voter in Orange County. \"My vote matters more over there,\" she said \u2014 and her vote is going to Bernie Sanders, no question. \"He cares about the environment the most,\" she said, \"and that's important.\"Elections are not everythingMaurice may be registered as a voter, but he said he's unfamiliar with primary elections and the candidates. He is sitting at the bar of Manny's, a popular cafe in the Mission. Manny's not only serves up good coffee and food \u2014 the owner also organizes political events and watch parties for the Democratic debates. Maurice is 25 years old and has been coming to Manny's quite a bit lately. The young African-American man just attended a discussion about California's voting system in the cafe's back room.Maurice had been planning on going to meet his friends, but he decided to come to Manny's instead. Elections are not something he has thought about a lot in the past, Maurice said. \"I'll see it on social media but other than that it's never a prominent topic people my age talk about. Nobody really cares to talk about it.\"Many of his friends simply have bigger problems than who is going to run for president, Maurice explained. They struggle to pay the bills, they use and sell drugs and have trouble finding good jobs. Over the last six months, nine of Maurice's friends have died from shootings, suicide, or overdoses.But for his part, Maurice wants to get involved in the political process. He signed up with some of the political groups that introduced their work today at the cafe. He is sick of corruption and hopes for a candidate that will fight for social justice.DW sends out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

No other concrete details on the matter have been provided by the Governor but the announcement marks his first major policy proposal that wasn't an integral part of his campaign trail. Governor Newsom was sworn into the highest state office some five weeks ago, having immediately signaled he's looking to build on the precedent established last year after California enacted the first state-level privacy legislature akin to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation following a prolonged legal battle[2] with Silicon Valley lobbyists. </p><p>California's latest initiative manifested in a broad range of legislative forms and Governor Newsom was seemingly careful to leave virtually all doors open during his announcement of yet another move aimed at curbing the influence of the Silicon Valley in the state that hosts it. One of the most obvious possibilities would be to require social media giants and other massive internet conglomerates reliant on harvesting user data to pay out annual dividends to consumers whose up-to-date information can be found in their databases. The actual sum would likely depend on a given company's yearly turnover and possibly even factor in its reliance on mined information, though the latter would presumably be based on a contentious formula regardless of how it's handled. Another possibility is for Sacramento to demand a single payment from big tech, though that's a significantly less likely scenario given how Governor Newsom appeared rather insistent on describing the plan as something meant to define a \"dividend.\" Facebook, Google, Apple, and Twitter are just some of the high-profile names headquartered in California that face the risk of having their operations complicated with the incoming legislation, though all of them seem to be treading carefully and have yet to issue a comment on the matter in any capacity. Regardless of the road the California government decides to take, technology juggernauts in the state are unlikely to benefit from what's now looming on the horizon. One of the richest and most liberal states by virtually every metric, California is still looking to pioneer digital legislation and pressure related industries to start conducting business in a more consumer-friendly manner or face harsh laws that are likely to follow more such similar-but-not-quite-identical rules in other states, sowing additional uncertainty into the stateside operations. Google and Facebook had a rough 2018 in terms of their public image, with both companies taking a hit over reports of their concerning handling of user privacy. Facebook was arguably affected harder due to the sheer scope of the Cambridge Analytica scandal but Google has endured plenty of gaffes of its own, some of which it actively concealed[3] while the world's largest social media network was making headlines over not doing enough to preserve the privacy of its users.

For example, some thought <url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/2Z5hjCC\">a recent column I did on Californias economic outperformance</url> was, politely put, misguided.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, whats a journalist to do when the states economy ranks highly on numerous scorecards? The personal finance website <url normalizedValue=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-the-best-economies/21697/#main-findings\">WalletHub just released its own math</url> about state-vs.-state economic muscle. And surprise! California ranked No. 4. That study followed       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/economy\">U.S. News &amp; World Reports scorecard</url> on state economies ranking California No. 4, too.</p><p>WalletHubs top three were Washington, Utah and Massachusetts while U.S. News had Colorado, Utah and Washington rated highest. (My recent rankings, based on job creation and wage growth, also had <url normalizedValue=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1F4JsY4XbwCCizRVN7JSyhFo66NOR0x7K&amp;usp=sharing\">California No. 4 behind Washington, Utah and North Dakota.</url>)</p><p>There were some similarities, too, at the bottom of these rankings. WalletHub graded Alaska worst, then Louisiana and Mississippi. U.S. News? West Virginia last, then Louisiana and Mississippi. (Me? Alaska, Wyoming and Connecticut.)</p><p>So how did California score so well? Lets look inside the grades.</p><p>WalletHub gave California a pair of No. 3 rankings for economic activity and innovation potential but a disappointing No. 35 for economic health that weighed unemployment, part-time workers, state debt levels, income and poverty. At U.S. News, California was top-rated for its business environment, No. 14 for growth and No. 26 for employment.</p><p>These lofty rankings reflect a remarkable California economic rebound thats uplifted the lives of many Californians. Yes, sadly, this monetary overachievement has not been a broad enough monetary salve for enough residents. I know the Golden State can do better.</p><p>That poor No. 35 grade on WalletHubs economic health benchmark and the middling No. 26 from U.S. News on jobs should be a wake-up call for folks debating how the state handles everything from regulation to government spending to taxation to its housing challenges.</p><p>Then theres Chief Executive magazines annual poll of bosses. It ranks California dead last for business friendliness every year. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/state-economy-ranking-q4-2018-2019-1\">Yes, its corporate sour grapes</url>, but we were No. 50 again for 2019!</p><p>However, Californias oft-noted shortfalls  and find me a place on the planet without room for improvement  doesnt mean positive trends should be ignored. Folks making decisions about the states future  from individual voters to big-shot policymakers  need to know whats right and whats wrong to make informed decisions.</p><p>Progress is being made on many economic fronts in California. By numerous measures, better than most states. And all that success isnt just a byproduct of managerial wizardry or the result of political will.</p><p>Lets remember all the worker bees toiling statewide  industrious Californians who helped their often overpaid bosses achieve outperformance. Please, take a moment for self-congratulations.
