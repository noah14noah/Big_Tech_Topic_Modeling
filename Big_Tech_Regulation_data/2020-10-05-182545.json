Contentious debates around \"regulation versus innovation.\" That's right! Regulating Big Tech is on the radar of governments globally, and opening salvos have been fired over smart speakers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is an overarching regulation meant to enhance data privacy and data protection rights for California residents; it goes into effect in January 2020. Related to the CCPA, Assembly Bill 1395 (AB-1395) seeks to regulate privacy provisions for \"connected devices with a voice recognition feature\"--i.e., smart speakers such as Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod and Google Home. The clock ran out on the legislative process for AB-1395 this year, but it is expected to be taken up again by the California legislature later in 2020.</p><p>Privacy concerns are to be expected with always-on devices that are passively listening to your most intimate conversations. But media reports of employees and contractors of Amazon and Apple listening to such voice recordings, even if they did so only to improve the products, have escalated such concerns. AB-1395, dubbed the \"anti-eavesdropping bill\" by its proponents, prohibits collection and storage of voice recordings without explicit consent from users.</p><p>But AB-1395 also raises interesting questions about the best way to regulate artificial intelligence/machine learning technologies that power smart speaker applications. If we have speech recognition apps on steroids today, that's because they have been trained using large speech datasets. Despite impressive performance gains in recent years, there is still much room for improvement when it comes to natural language understanding applications and speech recognition systems. A good way to bring about such improvement is to review recordings of interactions between users and speech apps and provide feedback to the system on hits and misses. This approach (called supervised learning) is used in a majority of the machine learning applications today. The crux? You'll need humans to comb through voice recordings if we want to keep improving speech apps.</p><p>Meanwhile, brandishing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), German authorities asked Google to halt processing voice recordings as they investigate further whether it's in compliance with GDPR. Separately, Google also scored an own goal when the product specifications for its Nest security device did not disclose that there was a microphone, only for that fact to be later called out by the media. In short, snafus all around. Of course, the tech vendors say all the right things, but it does make you wonder whether privacy concerns are indeed getting the attention they deserve.</p><p>AB-1395 may have bipartisan support, but it is not a law (yet). The spotlight it has shone on data collection and the privacy issues of smart speakers, however, has already had some positive impact. Amazon, Apple, and Google now give you the ability to delete your voice interaction history and enable a bit more control over data retention. Of course, this is just a start, and more needs to be done in terms of switching to explicit opt-in/user permissions for data collection, with the ability to opt out at any time, communicating clearly what happens to the data collected, who has access to it and for how long, where it is stored, and whether such data is shared with any third parties.</p><p>Privacy cannot be an afterthought; rather, it should be by design. In other words, commit to privacy not just in letter, but also in spirit. That would help engender consumer trust and also puts Big Tech on a firmer ground with regulators.</p><p>Imagine the endless possibilities of a voice-first world. Consider that Amazon recently announced a whole slew of new Echo devices for every corner of your home, for your car, and even as wearable devices; other companies will follow suit. A magical genie is on standby everywhere, just waiting to be summoned and enabling a \"your wish is my command.\" For the first time ever, voice looks to be a viable interface for interacting with and making sense of the world around us. But if we bungle regulation or privacy, it may be enough to delay or even halt progress.</p><p>By Kashyap Kompella</p><p>Kashyap Kompella is the CEO of rpa2ai Research, a global AI industry analyst firm and is the co-author of Practical Artificial Intelligence: An Enterprise Playbook.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-611171894</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 611171894</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y02-TD41-DYTM-94GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Information Today, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Speech Technology Magazine</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1088-5803</issn><volume>Vol. 24</volume><issueNumber>No. 4\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 22, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He's in town, joins us here in London. Cole, great to see you this morning. We just ran through a whole host of opinions from the Fed and lots to watch on the Fed story at the moment. The truth is though, that we don't really know very much about what President-elect Trump will do in terms of fiscal policy. We know a bit about what he intends, what he actually manages to get support for on Capitol Hill is another question.</p><p>COLE SMEAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SMEAD CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Correct. He has moved the bond market a major way from a sentiment standpoint. The -- the oddity is, the things that are likely to move inflation the most which would be the borrowing of money by U.S. households has not been going on. So if people are worried about fiscal policy, in the first couple days post reaction to election, there has not been a major move in housing stocks which would be the primary way that households borrow money, create a lot more money in the money supply, and it goes to work in the economy. So you know, there were certain industries, financials, obviously, health care that were -- have strong political fears, at the same time, what could go on the next five years regardless of Hillary or Donald, it -- it looks very good.</p><p>YOUSEF GAMAL EL-DIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Speaking of inflation, we're looking ahead to a tips auction in the U.S. Again, no-brainer to -- to buy into that, but that's also going to be a verdict as to whether the reflation train is on, right?</p><p>SMEAD: Sure. Well, people are talking about inflation, this idea of real growth is missing, OK? It -- a potent cocktail would not only be inflation that's actually present which is now a conversation, but real growth that kicks in as well. That cocktail could kill the bond market which just this initial move has been very tumultuous. (inaudible) as you point out, the spread between the German yield and the U.S. yield, it's wide. It's very unlikely the largest economy in the world will pay higher rates and others won't have to follow suit just like the regulations on banks, et cetera.</p><p>EDWARDS: So you think this -- you think this -- you think that the -- the -- I mean, that's why see the BOJ active in the markets today because -- because of the way that Donald Trump' election victory has moved bond markets not just in the U.S., but globally. So you don't think then that the infrastructure spending that we're hearing Donald Trump talk about in - - with scant details so far, but certainly, that's one theme. You don't think that's going to be enough to materially move U.S. growth?</p><p>SMEAD: No. In terms of expectations, it's moved some expectations, but actually moving the needle, our economy's way bigger tied to consumers. One other thing I'll mention. Think about -- you know, we got 35 percent corporate tax rates in the United States of America. Well, other places have 15. Did that stop U.S. companies from fining 15 percent tax rates? Not at all. So this arbitrage at what goes on in the U.S. versus outside the borders is always going to be the free market deciding what they want to do with their money in time.</p><p>GAMAL EL-DIN: We're waiting for more details on policy from Donald Trump and his incoming administration. How do investors position themselves to make sure that they come out on the right side of this trade.</p><p>SMEAD: Sure. Sure. Great question. Well, the two things that I've been excited about this year and were considered probably politically palatable in --in the -- prior to the election were tech, momentum growth, and secondly, the safety trade. In other words, if yields are going to stay down forever, why not lengthen your duration in bond surrogates and long- duration tech plays? Well, those things have woken up to a change in sentiment. Just in the last, you know, call it week, it's been a market change. So, you know, the big tech companies are down pretty nicely since the election, and secondly, the bond surrogates are getting pounded with the bond market at the same time. What's going to produce earnings growth and free cash flow growth is what investors might wake up to the next five years, and in the U.S. stock market, that could be a tumultuous thing because half the revenues come from abroad. So what goes on in our border might not be helpful to the index per se.</p><p>EDWARDS: So -- so from what you're saying then, and I know you're a big stock picking and it's been a tough time to be a stock picker because of some of these big global themes, but you think stock picking now is warranted because of the threats to the tech sectors, the -- the threats to some of those bond proxy trade.</p><p>SMEAD: Sure. It's just not a broad opportunity in U.S. equities. Let me give you an example. They call it 17 times earnings multiple on the on the S&amp;P 500. It's no outlandish, nowhere near 99 just to give , you know, European investors sense, but it -- it's more expensive than history. Small caps are more expensive and they have snapped a 10 plus percent in the week following the election, so I highlight that because, OK, do you want to pay 200 times earnings for the market cap in the S&amp;P 500 index, you can out all the home builders that we just talked about inside, all the publicly traded ones inside the market cap of Accenture, OK? So what if things go on in the U.S. economy that benefit certain industries because their economics are good not because of political reasons, and what if the index doesn't own enough?</p><p>EDWARDS: So which sectors are you buying then, with that in mind?</p><p>We --we own a lot of discretionary -- we continue to buy new names, it would be like Scripps Network Interactive, Home -- Home and Garden Television, Food Channel, Travel Channel, they're very millennial as subjects, but a lot of these millennials haven't bought houses yet, so very directly tied to advertisers. The financials look good, home mortgage originations. It's not about rates. Rates will help all financial institutions here, you know, in -- in the U.K. as well, but at the same time, it really comes out of who's going to be underwriting mortgages that unlocks the inflation, the growth, the incomes, et cetera.</p><p>GAMAL EL-DIN: You mentioned financials. There was a theme as well among investors the last week that Trumps going to tear up regulation, he's going to make it a lot easier for banks to make more money. Is that -- is that something that you -- you've penciled in as well?</p><p>SMEAD: Overnight, no. At the same time, you know, this is not a change in -- in U.S. politics in a way that's going to be catastrophic, it will just marginally go to businesses and say, \"Hey, what do you need to do to grow your business,\" because the economics was the most important equation in the U.S. election. That's what people want, so they're going to look for ways to allow business to go do -- do what they do. I'll give you a quick example. Fox Broadcasting two days after the election filed a suit with the SEC to be able to go above a 40 percent restriction in owning their affiliates across the United States, why? Because if Google can have 65 percent market share, why can't a broadcasting station own more than 40 percent of the national market? It's just -- it's but it's a difference in what was the political regime prior versus what's the political regime after.</p><p>EDWARDS: Cole, thank you very much for coming on (inaudible) this morning. Cole Smead, the managing director and portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management.

That cocktail could kill the bond market which just this  initial move has been very tumultuous.  (inaudible) as you point out, the  spread between the German yield and the U.S. yield, it's wide.  It's very  unlikely the largest economy in the world will pay higher rates and others  won't have to follow suit just like the regulations on banks, et cetera.</p><p> EDWARDS:  So you think this -- you think this -- you think that the -- the  -- I mean, that's why see the BOJ active in the markets today because --  because of the way that Donald Trump' election victory has moved bond  markets not just in the U.S., but globally.  So you don't think then that  the infrastructure spending that we're hearing Donald Trump talk about in - - with scant details so far, but certainly, that's one theme.  You don't  think that's going to be enough to materially move U.S. growth?</p><p> SMEAD:  No.  In terms of expectations, it's moved some expectations, but  actually moving the needle, our economy's way bigger tied to consumers.   One other thing I'll mention.  Think about -- you know, we got 35  percent  corporate tax rates in the United States of America.  Well, other places  have 15.  Did that stop U.S. companies from fining 15 percent tax rates?   Not at all.  So this arbitrage at what goes on in the U.S. versus outside  the borders is always going to be the free market deciding what they want  to do with their money in time.</p><p> GAMAL EL-DIN:  We're waiting for more details on policy from Donald Trump  and his incoming administration.  How do investors position themselves to  make sure that they come out on the right side of this trade.</p><p> SMEAD:  Sure.  Sure.  Great question.  Well, the two things that I've been  excited about this year and were considered probably politically palatable  in --in the -- prior to the election were tech, momentum growth, and  secondly, the safety trade.  In other words, if yields are going to stay  down forever, why not lengthen your duration in bond surrogates and long- duration tech plays?  Well, those things have woken up to a change in  sentiment.  Just in the last, you know, call it week, it's been a market  change.  So, you know, the big tech companies are down pretty nicely since  the election, and secondly, the bond surrogates are getting pounded with  the bond market at the same time.  What's going to produce earnings growth  and free cash flow growth is what investors might wake up to the next five  years, and in the U.S. stock market, that could be a tumultuous thing  because half the revenues come from abroad.  So what goes on in our border  might not be helpful to the index per se.</p><p> EDWARDS:  So -- so from what you're saying then, and I know you're a big  stock picking and it's been a tough time to be a stock picker because of  some of these big global themes, but you think stock picking now is  warranted because of the threats to the tech sectors, the -- the threats to  some of those bond proxy trade.</p><p> SMEAD:  Sure.  It's just not a broad opportunity in U.S. equities.  Let me  give you an example.  They call it 17 times earnings multiple on the on the  S&amp;P 500.  It's no outlandish, nowhere near 99 just to give , you know,  European investors sense, but it -- it's more expensive than history.   Small caps are more expensive and they have snapped a 10 plus percent in  the week following the election, so I highlight that because, OK, do you  want to pay 200 times earnings for the market cap in the S&amp;P 500 index, you  can out all the home builders that we just talked about inside, all the  publicly traded ones inside the market cap of Accenture, OK?  So what if  things go on in the U.S. economy that benefit certain industries because  their economics are good not because of political reasons, and what if the  index doesn't own enough?</p><p> EDWARDS:  So which sectors are you buying then, with that in mind?</p><p> We --we own a lot of discretionary -- we continue to buy new names, it  would be like Scripps Network Interactive, Home -- Home and Garden  Television, Food Channel, Travel Channel, they're very millennial as  subjects, but a lot of these millennials haven't bought houses yet, so very  directly tied to advertisers.  The financials look good, home mortgage  originations.  It's not about rates.  Rates will help all financial  institutions here, you know, in -- in the U.K. as well, but at the same  time, it really comes out of who's going to be underwriting mortgages that  unlocks the inflation, the growth, the incomes, et cetera.</p><p> GAMAL EL-DIN:  You mentioned financials.  There was a theme as well among  investors the last week that Trumps going to tear up regulation, he's going  to make it a lot easier for banks to make more money.  Is that -- is that  something that you -- you've penciled in as well?</p><p> SMEAD:  Overnight, no.  At the same time, you know, this is not a change in  -- in U.S. politics in a way that's going to be catastrophic, it will just  marginally go to businesses and say, \"Hey, what do you need to do to grow  your business,\" because the economics was the most important equation in  the U.S. election.  That's what people want, so they're going to look for  ways to allow business to go do -- do what they do.  I'll give you a quick  example.  Fox Broadcasting two days after the election filed a suit with  the SEC to be able to go above a 40 percent restriction in owning their  affiliates across the United States, why?  Because if Google can have 65  percent market share, why can't a broadcasting station own more than 40  percent of the national market?  It's just -- it's but it's a difference in  what was the political regime prior versus what's the political regime  after.</p><p> EDWARDS:  Cole, thank you very much for coming on (inaudible) this morning.

He's in town, joins us here in London. Cole, great to see you this morning. We just ran through a whole host of opinions from the Fed and lots to watch on the Fed story at the moment. The truth is though, that we don't really know very much about what President-elect Trump will do in terms of fiscal policy. We know a bit about what he intends, what he actually manages to get support for on Capitol Hill is another question.</p><p>COLE SMEAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SMEAD CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Correct. He has moved the bond market a major way from a sentiment standpoint. The -- the oddity is, the things that are likely to move inflation the most which would be the borrowing of money by U.S. households has not been going on. So if people are worried about fiscal policy, in the first couple days post reaction to election, there has not been a major move in housing stocks which would be the primary way that households borrow money, create a lot more money in the money supply, and it goes to work in the economy. So you know, there were certain industries, financials, obviously, health care that were -- have strong political fears, at the same time, what could go on the next five years regardless of Hillary or Donald, it -- it looks very good.</p><p>YOUSEF GAMAL EL-DIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Speaking of inflation, we're looking ahead to a tips auction in the U.S. Again, no-brainer to -- to buy into that, but that's also going to be a verdict as to whether the reflation train is on, right?</p><p>SMEAD: Sure. Well, people are talking about inflation, this idea of real growth is missing, OK? It -- a potent cocktail would not only be inflation that's actually present which is now a conversation, but real growth that kicks in as well. That cocktail could kill the bond market which just this initial move has been very tumultuous. (inaudible) as you point out, the spread between the German yield and the U.S. yield, it's wide.

He's  in town, joins us here in London.  Cole, great to see you this morning.  We  just ran through a whole host of opinions from the Fed and lots to watch on  the Fed story at the moment.  The truth is though, that we don't really  know very much about what President-elect Trump will do in terms of fiscal  policy.  We know a bit about what he intends, what he actually manages to  get support for on Capitol Hill is another question.</p><p>COLE SMEAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SMEAD CAPITAL  MANAGEMENT:  Correct.  He has moved the bond market a major way from a  sentiment standpoint.  The -- the oddity is, the things that are likely to  move inflation the most which would be the borrowing of money by U.S.  households has not been going on.  So if people are worried about fiscal  policy, in the first couple days post reaction to election, there has not  been a major move in housing stocks which would be the primary way that  households borrow money, create a lot more money in the money supply, and  it goes to work in the economy.  So you know, there were certain  industries, financials, obviously, health care that were -- have strong  political fears, at the same time, what could go on the next five years  regardless of Hillary or Donald, it -- it looks very good.</p><p>YOUSEF GAMAL EL-DIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Speaking of inflation, we're  looking ahead to a tips auction in the U.S.  Again, no-brainer to -- to buy  into that, but that's also going to be a verdict as to whether the  reflation train is on, right?</p><p>SMEAD:  Sure.  Well, people are talking about inflation, this idea of real  growth is missing, OK?  It -- a potent cocktail would not only be inflation  that's actually present which is now a conversation, but real growth that  kicks in as well.  That cocktail could kill the bond market which just this  initial move has been very tumultuous.  (inaudible) as you point out, the  spread between the German yield and the U.S. yield, it's wide.  It's very  unlikely the largest economy in the world will pay higher rates and others  won't have to follow suit just like the regulations on banks, et cetera.</p><p>EDWARDS:  So you think this -- you think this -- you think that the -- the  -- I mean, that's why see the BOJ active in the markets today because --  because of the way that Donald Trump' election victory has moved bond  markets not just in the U.S., but globally.  So you don't think then that  the infrastructure spending that we're hearing Donald Trump talk about in - - with scant details so far, but certainly, that's one theme.  You don't  think that's going to be enough to materially move U.S. growth?</p><p>SMEAD:  No.  In terms of expectations, it's moved some expectations, but  actually moving the needle, our economy's way bigger tied to consumers.   One other thing I'll mention.  Think about -- you know, we got 35  percent  corporate tax rates in the United States of America.  Well, other places  have 15.  Did that stop U.S. companies from fining 15 percent tax rates?   Not at all.  So this arbitrage at what goes on in the U.S. versus outside  the borders is always going to be the free market deciding what they want  to do with their money in time.</p><p>GAMAL EL-DIN:  We're waiting for more details on policy from Donald Trump  and his incoming administration.  How do investors position themselves to  make sure that they come out on the right side of this trade.</p><p>SMEAD:  Sure.  Sure.  Great question.  Well, the two things that I've been  excited about this year and were considered probably politically palatable  in --in the -- prior to the election were tech, momentum growth, and  secondly, the safety trade.  In other words, if yields are going to stay  down forever, why not lengthen your duration in bond surrogates and long- duration tech plays?  Well, those things have woken up to a change in  sentiment.  Just in the last, you know, call it week, it's been a market  change.  So, you know, the big tech companies are down pretty nicely since  the election, and secondly, the bond surrogates are getting pounded with  the bond market at the same time.  What's going to produce earnings growth  and free cash flow growth is what investors might wake up to the next five  years, and in the U.S. stock market, that could be a tumultuous thing  because half the revenues come from abroad.  So what goes on in our border  might not be helpful to the index per se.</p><p>EDWARDS:  So -- so from what you're saying then, and I know you're a big  stock picking and it's been a tough time to be a stock picker because of  some of these big global themes, but you think stock picking now is  warranted because of the threats to the tech sectors, the -- the threats to  some of those bond proxy trade.</p><p>SMEAD:  Sure.  It's just not a broad opportunity in U.S. equities.  Let me  give you an example.  They call it 17 times earnings multiple on the on the  S&amp;P 500.  It's no outlandish, nowhere near 99 just to give , you know,  European investors sense, but it -- it's more expensive than history.   Small caps are more expensive and they have snapped a 10 plus percent in  the week following the election, so I highlight that because, OK, do you  want to pay 200 times earnings for the market cap in the S&amp;P 500 index, you  can out all the home builders that we just talked about inside, all the  publicly traded ones inside the market cap of Accenture, OK?  So what if  things go on in the U.S. economy that benefit certain industries because  their economics are good not because of political reasons, and what if the  index doesn't own enough?</p><p>EDWARDS:  So which sectors are you buying then, with that in mind?</p><p>We --we own a lot of discretionary -- we continue to buy new names, it  would be like Scripps Network Interactive, Home -- Home and Garden  Television, Food Channel, Travel Channel, they're very millennial as  subjects, but a lot of these millennials haven't bought houses yet, so very  directly tied to advertisers.  The financials look good, home mortgage  originations.  It's not about rates.  Rates will help all financial  institutions here, you know, in -- in the U.K. as well, but at the same  time, it really comes out of who's going to be underwriting mortgages that  unlocks the inflation, the growth, the incomes, et cetera.</p><p>GAMAL EL-DIN:  You mentioned financials.  There was a theme as well among  investors the last week that Trumps going to tear up regulation, he's going  to make it a lot easier for banks to make more money.  Is that -- is that  something that you -- you've penciled in as well?</p><p>SMEAD:  Overnight, no.  At the same time, you know, this is not a change in  -- in U.S. politics in a way that's going to be catastrophic, it will just  marginally go to businesses and say, \"Hey, what do you need to do to grow  your business,\" because the economics was the most important equation in  the U.S. election.  That's what people want, so they're going to look for  ways to allow business to go do -- do what they do.  I'll give you a quick  example.  Fox Broadcasting two days after the election filed a suit with  the SEC to be able to go above a 40 percent restriction in owning their  affiliates across the United States, why?  Because if Google can have 65  percent market share, why can't a broadcasting station own more than 40  percent of the national market?  It's just -- it's but it's a difference in  what was the political regime prior versus what's the political regime  after.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Cole, thank you very much for coming on (inaudible) this morning.   Cole Smead, the managing director and portfolio manager at Smead Capital  Management.

I am Julia Chatterley. This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need-to-know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SMIC smacked. The Chinese chipmaker's stock falling on fears of U.S. sanctions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Softbank sinks amid claims the Japanese giant bet billions of dollars on technology options.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Brexit is back. The U.K. government threatening another no-deal, this time on E.U. trade talks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Monday. Let's make a move.</p><p>Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Great to be back with you, and we have a show filled with technologies of the future today, including reimagining a digital economy.</p><p>The world's first Minister of Artificial Intelligence is joining us. He comes from the UAE, and at a time when public trust in technology, specifically in vaccines, is wavering, to say the least. Someone who says the best way to get COVID-19 herd immunity is literally to pay people to take the vaccine.</p><p>Questions or comments, you can tweet me with those. My Twitter handle is at the bottom of the page as you can see.</p><p>In the meantime, it's Labor Day here in the United States, so stocks and bond markets are closed for the long weekend. A welcome respite, perhaps, after a dramatic stock sell-off late last week, fueled, as I mentioned briefly there by rumors of large-scale buying in the options market. That had pushed up measure of volatility, the so-called VIX Volatility Index or the fear gauge and pushed up stock prices for some of the biggest tech names and suddenly everybody got spooked.</p><p>Sounds a little bit fishy or a lot fishy? Yes. Well, the so-called NASDAQ whale may have been caught. All the details on that coming right up.</p><p>For now though, let me give you a look at what we're seeing in Europe. Market activity always relatively muted on U.S. Holidays, so you have to bear that in mind when you see some outsized moves, and it seems there's a reason in the U.K. specifically where Sterling is under pressure, spooked by ultimatums over Brexit, political posturing or a real risk again of the U.K. not achieving a trade deal with the E.U.?</p><p>Probably all of the above. We've got the latest on that for you. For now, though, to Asia where the relentless tit-for-tat battle between the U.S. and China continues. At the core of that once again, China's chip technology, and that's where we begin the drivers.</p><p>Shares of China's biggest chipmaker, SMIC plunging more than 20 percent in Hong Kong as the Trump administration considers restrictions on the company. The move would bar American companies from selling products and technology to the firm, the same sanction as the U.S. imposed on Huawei, and we all know how that's turned out.</p><p>Sherisse Pham is live in Hong Kong with more. Sherisse, you've assured us that it's SMIC, but you can give us the full definition of the company's name here. What specifically are the authorities looking for here and what might the restrictions look like?</p><p>SHERISSE PHAM, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, Julia, I can confirm that the acronym is pronounced SMIC, but it does stand for Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, which is China's largest chipmaker and shares, absolutely plunging in Hong Kong.</p><p>Secondary shares in Shanghai also dropping today after reports that the Department of Defense is reportedly by in talks with other U.S. agencies to add SMIC to the entity list.</p><p>This is a U.S. trade black list. It's the same list that Huawei was added to and it has really crippled Huawei's business -- global business -- over the last year or so.</p><p>So what could this mean for SMIC? Investors certainly rattled by the possibilities here, but what it signals, for sure, is that the U.S.-China tech war continues to escalate, that the two countries are moving even closer to decoupling because Washington is really striking at the heart of one of china's biggest global tech ambitions, which is to be self- sufficient in the semiconductor industry.</p><p>Semiconductors are computer chips and they power everything from computers to smartphones to televisions, to 5G networking equipment.</p><p>And so, if SMIC is added to this entity list, it would definitely deal a blow to China's ambitions to become self-sufficient in semiconductor manufacturing and it could also give some of SMIC's rivals a leg up, the same way that has happened with Huawei's rivals who have also seen a little bit of a boost after Huawei was added to the entity list and its smart phone business and its 5G network business suffered -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it is fascinating. Jeffries is saying here as much as 50 percent of SMIC's equipment comes from the United States, so it is the U.S. that would determine their technological progress.</p><p>But speaking of rivals here, very quickly, Samsung winning a $6.5 billion 5G Verizon deal. Talk us through this because this is a clear distinction between rivals Samsung and Huawei here. One's gain is another's loss, or vice-versa.</p><p>PHAM: Yes, absolutely. Samsung, of course is a South Korean technology giant. South Korea is a long-time ally of the United States. The United States and the Trump administration would certainly want to see the United States' main carrier network to be so-called clean networks and to carry chips that the Trump administration deems to be safe.</p><p>So namely those would be just coming from three companies. That would be Ericsson, Nokia and of course, Samsung. Now, Verizon already has some Samsung kit in its network already, so it makes sense for them to also upgrade some of that technology using Samsung kit as well for 5G.</p><p>But this is a huge win for Samsung and the combined news of getting this, I believe, it was a $6.6 billion contract from Verizon, plus this reported sanction against SMIC, all lifting Samsung shares in Seoul. They closed up, I think, 1.6 percent today and Samsung has already benefitted as well against the technology sanctions against Huawei, because Samsung smart phones are also selling a little bit better in global markets where Huawei has fallen off.</p><p>So like you say, one company's misfortunes definitely could be the fortune for another company, especially if that company is based in a country that is considered to be a U.S. ally.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I was going to say, not just companies, countries, too. Sherisse Pham in Hong Kong there for us. Great work. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>Now, just another sign of the ongoing tensions in Mainland China, foreign journalists working for U.S. outlets have been hit by surprise new restrictions. They've been handed temporary visas lasting around two months instead of the usual year-long ones and the new visas could be revoked at any time.</p><p>David Culver joins us now. David, not just a story you're reporting on, you're directly involved in this story because you're one of those journalists that now simply has a two-month visa.</p><p>DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's a strange place to be reporting on this and dealing with it personally, too, Julia. Yes, no question. I mean, that's how we watched this unfold. We knew that tensions between the U.S. and China were playing out amongst journalists as well.</p><p>As we've seen over the recent months, it has included expulsions, restrictions of visas and now, we're learning of new restrictions being imposed by the Chinese.</p><p>So, what I learned firsthand was, as I went in for my press card renewal, which here allows you then to get a 12-month visa, normally, we were told directly that we wouldn't be receiving that renewal. Not that they were denying it out right, but it was still in process and instead, they would give us two months.</p><p>They gave us the date November 6th as to when our resident permits or visas would then expire, and that's not just me or CNN, it's several other organizations, U.S. media outlets, including \"Wall Street Journal\" and Bloomberg.</p><p>Now, what that date signifies is the same date that the Trump administration has given to Chinese nationals working for state media within the U.S., and now initially back in May, they were given 90 days, then in August, those 90 days up were and they were essentially given another 90 days, not given a renewal, but essentially said we're going to review this, the U.S., that is, and determine whether or not they would give those Chinese nationals a new visa.</p><p>Well, that still is in process and the Chinese have said that this is essentially their way to match that. They said we know it's you living in uncertainty, referring to those of us who are journalists here because essentially, if the U.S. decides to kick out those journalists tomorrow in China, China says they could do the same with us.</p><p>So it's wanting to match and equate that same uncertainty on both sides. However, they go on to say, the Chinese, that is, that they believe that the U.S. is holding Chinese journalists as hostage in order to pressure China.</p><p>Of course, the U.S. has a very different take on this, Julia. They look at this not as Chinese journalists impacted, but as Chinese diplomats as one U.S. official said, because essentially they believe they're working not for journalistic outlets, but propaganda outlets. That's how they label state media.</p><p>So they're looking at this in different ways, which makes it really quite uncertain as to how they're going to come down on this and what that's going to mean for us.</p><p>I mean, ultimately, we look at the impact of reporting here firsthand and you can and I can go back to where we were in January talking about the outbreak of a then unknown illness, and we were able to track that early on.</p><p>And it wasn't just me, but the collective of journalists and my colleagues able to do that by being here on the ground in China. If that were to change, I think it's really a danger for journalism all around -- Julia.</p><p>[09:10:35]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, a danger for journalists, and danger for people, too, for not getting the information that we require, David.</p><p>CULVER: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Important the equivalence point that you mentioned though, too, and them saying directly to you it's not about your reporting, this is simply about what they perceive to be equal treatment of journalists in both countries by the respective governments.</p><p>David, great to have you with us. Thank you.</p><p>CULVER: That's right. That's what they stressed to us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Always so great to have you on. David Culver there. Thank you.</p><p>All right, the so-called NASDAQ whale has reportedly been caught. Softbank shares closing down seven percent in Tokyo after the FT and the \"Wall Street Journal\" reported it was the Japanese company that had partially driven the relentless recent rally in tech stocks with outsized bets in the options market.</p><p>Selina Wang joins me now. Selina, rather you than me. Can you explain what specifically was going on that fueled the tech stock rise and still created some panic?</p><p>SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Julia, that's exactly right. Softbank here is being called out as the NASDAQ whale that turbo charged this recent rally on Wall Street driven by massive bets in these tech stocks.</p><p>Now, according to \"The Financial Times,\" Softbank purchased roughly $4 billion worth of options tied to the underlying shares it had previously purchased in Big Tech names such as Microsoft, Netflix and Amazon.</p><p>Now at play here are call options. These are bullish contracts that give investors the option to purchase a stock at an agreed-upon price so it becomes profitable when that share price rises above that fixed level.</p><p>It seems so far that the strategy is working since reportedly, Softbank is sitting on some $4 billion worth of trading gains, but Julia, these are unrealized gains and this is a very risky strategy. If we see this market pullback continue, that could mean big losses for Softbank.</p><p>Prior to that sell-off late last week, the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ were pushing up against record highs. Softbank was also up about a third this year, but now, on Monday plunging more than seven percent as investors react to this new strategy that Softbank is pursuing.</p><p>And Julia, according to \"The Financial Times,\" this strategy has been deeply controversial, even within Softbank.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's quite fascinating, isn't it? But you know, when I look at this and what they've created in the Vision Fund and this idea that they were investing in early stage technology, this is Softbank Mark 3 and it's a hedge fund basically. The point where you're investing in options to try and boost your returns, you're a hedge fund.</p><p>WANG: This new strategy push into the options market is new territory. As you say, it really gives the perception that it is increasingly behaving as a hedge fund taking on these massively risky bets.</p><p>Now, founder, Masayoshi Son has been steadily expanding his investment empire. We've seen the conglomerate move away from telecommunications towards these private tech investments. They've made big bets on companies like WeWork and Uber, but that strategy has suffered majorly as a result of this global coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>And now, we've seen the broader to make bets in the public markets. In August, Softbank announced that it was going to create a new unit dedicated to public market investments.</p><p>Now, they're pushing that even further into the option markets, but it is really making investors uneasy. They're worried that there could be a dramatic unwind in which Softbank brings the broader market down with them.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, particularly when you're doing options in this apparent size. Selina Wang, great job. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, Brexit back in the news with the U.K. and E.U. hurling threats at each other.</p><p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly planning to pass legislation that would undermine some key aspects of the already agreed Brexit withdrawal deal.</p><p>CNN's Nic Robertson has all the details in London. It comes at a difficult time for the economy as well, Nic and faced with COVID. Are we suggesting here that the U.K. could exit the E.U. -- or exit the transition arrangement with no deal at all on trade?</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: The Prime Minister said that as far as the talks go at the moment, and they're going into the eighth round this week, that if there's nothing agreed by the 15th of October, so five weeks away, that's going to be okay with him.</p><p>There's no sense in pushing a timeline further out to get a deal. Let's make the best of it not having a deal. He said that will be okay for the U.K. because it will effectively leave, he says, on terms similar to those that Australia has at the moment.</p><p>That may be stretching people's understanding of what Australia actually has in terms of a deal with the E.U. at the moment, but what the Prime Minister is proposing here is a full back option that will be put into legislation called the Internal Markets Bill that will be published on Wednesday, so we don't know precisely what's in it.</p><p>But what we understand is that that would undermine some of the agreement that he already has with the European Union, the Brexit deal, the leaving deal.</p><p>[09:15:37]</p><p>ROBERTSON: The bit that's called the Northern Irish Protocols which handles goods and trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Now, obviously it's all the United Kingdom, but you have GB Mainland and you have Northern Ireland and there's a possibility that the E.U. rightly says and the Britain rightly accepts that goods that go to Northern Ireland could go across that border into the South of Ireland.</p><p>So the agreement was that there would be checks when goods were leaving the U.K., not on everything, not all the time, and there would be Customs Declarations either way.</p><p>So what the Prime Minister is doing now is saying potentially, he is going to throw that out of the window and the specter that that raises is, therefore, the implication that you may end up with a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to the south, which is an open border right now, which is what everyone wanted to try to avoid, which the Prime Minister says he wants to try to avoid.</p><p>He is raising the stakes. Is this him with a negotiating tactic ahead of the talks that begin this week? Is it partly to placate his own party? But there is big push back from Ireland, from Irish politicians and nationalist politicians in Ireland who are saying this is a dangerous game, we're not going to stand for it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, political posturing, laying the ground for a compromise at home later on. Who knows, Nic? But some kind of agreement has to be reached and so far, it's been pretty much deadlocked.</p><p>Nic Robertson, thank you for explaining, in London there for us. Thank you.</p><p>All right, these are the stories making headlines around the world. The U.S. Veterans Affairs Secretary denying reports that President Trump made disparaging remarks about American troops killed in combat.</p><p>Robert Wilkie also told CNN that the President's previous comments belittling prisoners of war was just politics. The President has been on defense since the Thursday report by \"The Atlantic\" alleged he referred to fallen soldiers as \"losers and suckers,\" quote.</p><p>Wildfires have burned more than 800,000 hectares of California, more than any other year on record. State officials are predicting more fires in the coming months if conditions persist.</p><p>Relentless heat is also not helping. Temperatures have reached 43 degrees Celsius in some parts of California on Sunday.</p><p>Typhoon Haishen is lashing South Korea with heavy rain and high winds as it moves up the peninsula. The storm made landfall early Monday after carving a trail of damage in Southwestern Japan. Four people there are missing. It's the second major storm to hit the region in less than a week. Wow. Look at those winds.</p><p>All right, still to come here on FIRST MOVE, a world first, the UAE, the only country in the world to have a Minister for Artificial Intelligence. The Minister will be joining us after the break to explain.</p><p>And a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down, but could bribing people to take a COVID-19 vaccine be the key to herd immunity? We'll speak to an expert who says it's the only way. Stay with us. We're back after this.</p><p>[09:21:35]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. From Amazon's Alexa to facial recognition on your phone, you need only look around to see how artificial intelligence is changing our world.</p><p>Well now, PricewaterhouseCoopers has put a number on just how much it is changing things. The consultancy says AI will boost the global economy by 14 percent by 2030.</p><p>The United Arab Emirates seems to be a pioneer in this new economy. It's the only country in the world to have appointed a specific minister in the government for artificial intelligence, and I am very excited to say, joining us now, His Excellency, Omar bin Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications of the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Minister, fantastic to have you on the show once again. Thank you for joining us. I don't think there's ever been a more important time to look at the digital economy, to look at how COVID-19 is changing and putting pressure on traditional industry versus the rise of the digital economy.</p><p>Explain what your role involves today and how you see it progressing.</p><p>OMAR BIN SULTAN AL OLAMA, MINISTER OF STATE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, DIGITAL ECONOMY AND REMOTE WORK APPLICATIONS, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: Thank you, Julia. It's an absolute pleasure being with you, and as like you said, the world is changing and it really does not take much for us to understand how different the world is today pre-COVID to what it used to be -- sorry, how different the world is today, post-COVID to how it used to be pre- COVID.</p><p>The world right now is a world that we are in need of technology to actually to connect, to work, for us to be productive and as well to transact. In the past, we had the choice of using technology or using traditional means, but we're seeing now that the shift is becoming universal and the shift that's also, I think for us to go back to business as usual.</p><p>The UAE, our government believes that we need to be proactive rather than reactive and if we do work properly on planning and deploying technology in a way that is responsible, we will have a better future created for generations to come.</p><p>So since my appointment in 2017, we have a model which has built for us a possibility for an artificial intelligence nation. We focused the first two years in improving the capabilities that we have in the UAE, creating training programs, allowing people in the UAE to understand what artificial intelligence is and be a part of its revolution.</p><p>So we created programs, for example, we call the AI Summer Camp to teach kids from different classes, and as well as university to code artificial intelligence, to work with the technology that we enable.</p><p>We also understand that the biggest challenge that we have in government is something that we call ignorance in the decision making process.</p><p>If a decision maker is supposed to make a decision on deploying AI, without understanding the challenges and the opportunities and the ethical applications of the technology, they might actually make the wrong decision.</p><p>So we also created the program to take a key decision maker from every single government entity and train him or her with the University of Oxford in the U.K. to understand AI algorithms, to be able to audit them and to also look at how to rightly deploy these technologies.</p><p>The next step right now is to actually uplift the ecosystem, so we're working a lot on democratizing computer power and AI systems and infrastructure for staffers in the UAE, for the government and for individuals, as well as researchers, mainly.</p><p>And we're thinking that this is going to actually improve our digital economy.</p><p>[09:25:13]</p><p>AL OLAMA: From a digital economy perspective, there's a lot of jobs that are going to be created because of the digital economy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>AL OLAMA: There's also this notion that if we actually improve the digital economy, new jobs are going to be created and new industries are going to be created and we're not going to just cannibalize from our traditional economy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, that is the big fear here and this is talked about all over the world, when you see the rise of the digital economy, particularly things like artificial intelligence and automation: jobs will be lost, jobs will also be created, but there's a skills gap between what's lost and what's created.</p><p>Is that also what you're trying to do? Prevent that skills gap widening or even appearing at all?</p><p>AL OLAMA: Absolutely. The first thing we need to understand is there isn't a finite number of jobs. There's always new jobs being created and that gives some sort of reassurance that people will find something to do.</p><p>But then there's another thing, which this is the role of government. We need to think about deploying AI in a way that does not just look gimmicky or it is fun, but also provides value and has the least number of jobs lost.</p><p>So we have an equation in the UAE when we look at deploying AI in government. The delta is first, how much impact this deployment of AI is going to have? The second is how many jobs are going to be lost or gained? And then third is how much money is going to be saved that can be reinvested in reskilling and retooling people?</p><p>There is this important factor that we need to unroll which is governments exist to serve the people. Governments exist to provide better livelihoods for them and we also exist to ensure that the future is better, not just to deploy technologies for the sake of deployment.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and this is another critical component here as well.</p><p>I just wonder, because I read that amid the outbreak of COVID-19, you had the entire government working remotely, clearly in certain industries working remotely is possible, in other industries, it's not.</p><p>I just wonder how you see that evolving -- the ability to work from home and that flexibility in the future, and particularly given I was in Dubai late last year and we were talking about smart cities and cities of the future.</p><p>How do you think more flexible working going forward will perhaps change the way that we were initially thinking about smart cities over the coming years?</p><p>AL OLAMA: So I think, Julia, the first thing is the new secret of attracting talent, of creating a more competitive economy is actually quality of life.</p><p>Remote work is great, but remote work without actually compensating for talent to stay in your company is going to make the talent migrate to other countries and operate from there and work remotely in your country.</p><p>What we are looking at is improving quality of life through our policies and programs as well. We do believe that because the UAE is situated in a very unique region, we have over two million people within a four-hour vicinity of the UAE.</p><p>We also have cutting-edge infrastructure and we have a very young population, so 65 percent of people in our region are under the age of 35.</p><p>What that means is that we can become a hub of talent. We can become the place where talent from around the region and the world actually migrates to work from the UAE, where we have good quality of life, where we have cutting-edge infrastructure and in general, the UAE is very accessible. You can access any market and you can also travel to anywhere on Earth, post- COVID, hopefully, and you'll be able to get the best of both worlds. That's what we are investing big on.</p><p>We also want to ensure that more family cohesion. There's a lot more happiness and there's a lot more impact on the livelihood of the individual that goes beyond just measuring productivity.</p><p>Productivity is important, we need to look at ways to measure productivity to help people improve and to understand how they can be better.</p><p>But instead of just looking at how you can come to the office and be in the office and lose the time in the commute, how can we deliver more? How can we do more? But at the same time make people happier and give them more flexibility in their lives.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's fascinating to hear you speak at a time when many countries around the world are focusing more on domestic policies and domestic talent. The UAE remains as open as ever.</p><p>Your Excellency, Minister, I'm going to leave it there. We've had some difficulties with interference with your shot, so I just want to apologize for that, too. We will get you back soon because I've only scratched the surface of the conversations and the questions I have for you.</p><p>But for now, I want to say thank you. The Minister for the United Arab Emirates there. Great to have you with us.</p><p>All right, still ahead, Big Pharma makes a big promise. A report says, three top brands will always put safety first when it comes to a COVID vaccine. More details next.</p><p>[09:33:20]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. It's Labor Day here in the United States, so Wall Street is closed for the long weekend, but that doesn't mean there isn't plenty of business news to bring you, including three U.S. pharma giants reportedly want to allay any fears the public might have over a new COVID vaccine.</p><p>According to the Wall Street Journal, Pfizer, Moderna, along with Johnson &amp; Johnson are making a joint pledge not to seek approval for their vaccines until they have been proven safe and effective.</p><p>A CNN poll recently suggested 40 percent of Americans wouldn't even want to get vaccinated even if the vaccine were free.</p><p>Our next guest believes people should be paid to take the vaccine. Robert Litan is nonresident senior fellow at Brookings and he joins us now. Robert, fantastic to have you on the show.</p><p>You're simply saying we need to incentivize people with a cash payment, effectively, to make them take the vaccine?</p><p>ROBERT LITAN, NONRESIDENT SENIOR FELLOW, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: That's right, and thank you, Julia, for having me on. The reason I suggested that really as a Plan B is that Plan A, which is sort of public encouragement, may not work precisely because of the statistic that you just cited.</p><p>CNN says 40 percent of people have reservations about taking the vaccine. Actually, there's another poll that was out last week, \"USA Today\" that indicated that only 33 percent would be willing to take the vaccine.</p><p>And so given all of that public hesitancy, we're going to need not only a broad public education effort, we're also going to need Dr. Fauci in particular to bless the vaccine, because I think a lot of it -- there's a lot of skepticism right now about the F.D.A., and so I think people want that additional assurance from Dr. Fauci.</p><p>[09:35:10]</p><p>LITAN: We'll probably need widespread assurance from the medical community that the vaccine is safe and effective. But even with all of that and with public service announcements, et cetera, we may not get to the point where we have what's called herd immunity and that's the point where essentially enough people have immunity that the virus starts to die down.</p><p>And I've done some calculations, very, very simple math based on Dr. Michael Osterholm, a leading infectious disease specialist who has appeared on this show, and he suggested that we need at least 60 percent of the population to be immune, but no vaccine is going to be perfect.</p><p>So if you optimistically assume that a vaccine is only 75 percent effective, which is probably, as I said, optimistic, that means that 80 percent of the population is going to have to take the vaccine for us to get to herd immunity and we don't have normal, which means a life without facemasks, a life without social distancing unless we get to that 80 percent level or something like it.</p><p>And given those reservations we talked about at the beginning, we're a long way from that goal, and that's why I ended up suggesting as a Plan B, paying people to actually take a vaccine.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It makes perfect sense. Let's talk through it then because you're saying $1,000.00 per person that takes the vaccine, but that you don't get the money up front. You get a small piece of it simply because you want to encourage people to talk to their friends, talk to their family, talk to their neighbors, and encourage them to take it, too.</p><p>And then once we reach that herd immunity level, you get the final chunk of the money. You're trying to incentivize people to get as many people to do this and encourage others to do it as possible.</p><p>LITAN: You've summarized it perfectly. I want to be clear to the audience, the thousand dollars I gave was illustrative. It's my seat of the pants judgment about what I think it will take to convert some of those people who are on a fence and may have reservations, but if you give them the thousand dollars and with a family of four, that's $4,000.00.</p><p>To be given this much money, it may flip them and you can get up to that level of 80 percent, but only, as you said, if the money is put out in tranches, so that you have an initial payment and then the last payment is contingent on the entire population reaching whatever national goal you want to set.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's interesting. I'm just doing the math on how much this would cost. Let's say -- what -- $250 billion if you're going to get everybody taking this vaccine. There will be people that look at this and say, hang on a second, isn't it actually just cheaper to use therapeutics?</p><p>If we managed COVID-19 better, let the people who want to take the vaccine take it, manage those that don't better and actually you don't have to spend all of that money and try and incentivize people to take it. What's your view on that?</p><p>LITAN: Okay, well, that's a good question. We've had advances in therapeutics. We've had three of them so far and it's brought the mortality rate down somewhat, but the COVID virus still seems to be at least five to six times more lethal than a seasonal flu, down from about ten times initially.</p><p>And we can hope for more advances in therapeutics, but what if you don't get that? That's the whole reason we need the vaccine. In the absence of really a quantum leap in therapeutics, we don't get life back to normal and we're not going to force people to take the vaccine.</p><p>I mean, Dr. Fauci has been clear about that and I think, we would almost have a political revolution if you try to force people.</p><p>So we're back to really paying people, and if it takes $250 billion or $265 billion to get back to normal that's a small price given the trillions of dollars we've already paid for people to ease the economic pain of the crisis, and also we've got trillions of dollars of lost economic output that we're going to miss if we don't get back to normal.</p><p>And so, if you add all of those trillions on the one side and ask people are they willing to basically accept a national increase in the debt of $265 billion, I think our average person out there watching, whether they're a parent or they're at university or a Main Street business or Big Business, they're going to say that's a bargain, for $265 billion, we can get our life back.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, you make a great comparison there with the stimulus payments and the ongoing that will be needed to support the economy if we carry on like this.</p><p>I have about 30 seconds, but very quickly, have you had any official feedback on the view here? Is this something that the government is considering?</p><p>LITAN: I've had no official feedback. I've had some good feedback on social media. I think the point of this interview is hopefully someone is going to pay attention and make sure that Sanjay Gupta pays attention so he maybe he talks about it on one of his shows. I watch him all the time.</p><p>But seriously, this is an idea that has to get into the public domain. It's a Plan B, as I said, but it may have to be Plan A.</p><p>[09:40:03]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, that's why I wanted to get you on the show the moment I read this. It certainly struck a chord. Robert, fantastic to have you with us. We'll get you back and we will discuss it again and hopefully we'll have a bit more official feedback on the prospects here as well.</p><p>Robert Litan there, nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution. Sir, thank you for coming and joining us.</p><p>All right, coming up next on FIRST MOVE, the fight against counterfeit products. How one startup is deploying its technology to help people in Africa and beyond in that battle, next.</p><p>[09:43:39]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: welcome back to first move. In the battle against fake products, U.S.-based company, Sproxil uses mobile authentication technology to help consumers detect counterfeit products in all kinds of industries, from things like medicine, to agriculture and beverages.</p><p>Our next guest founded the company in 2009 to tackle the problem of counterfeit medication in Africa. The continent accounted for 42 percent of all cases of fake or substandard medication reported to the World Health Organization between 2013 and 2017. What a battle.</p><p>Joining us now, founder and CEO of Sproxil, Ashifi Gogo. Sir, brilliant to have you on the show. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>That's a huge challenge. As I mentioned, not just about medication, but about other industries, too. Just start by explaining how your technology works.</p><p>ASHIFI GOGO, FOUNDER AND CEO, SPROXIL: Sure. Great. Thanks for having me. At Sproxil, we connect consumers with genuine product manufacturers by placing a unique code on each product that rolls off the factory line that a consumer can use a cell phone to verify and make sure what they pull off the shelf and buy actually came from the manufacturer as indicated on the packaging.</p><p>[09:45:01]</p><p>GOGO: And so by using the serialization and vast network approval devices, we are able to connect brands and consumers directly to make sure that consumers are not ripped off when they walk into the pharmacy or other retail points.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. So you're working directly with the manufacturer. I'm assuming the manufacturer effectively pays for the ability to produce this code, to have it scanned and for their own products to be identified as real.</p><p>GOGO: That is correct. And under some cases in some countries where they have regulated products, like heavily regulated products like pharmaceuticals, the governments may step in and decide to make consumer- facing authentication a requirement for selling products in that market.</p><p>So a good example is Nigeria, where in 2008, 84 infants died from teething syrup that was tainted with chemicals found in antifreeze. They've been battling counterfeit products for a long time and when we launched in Nigeria in 2010, the government eventually made it compulsory that for all antimalarial sold in that country, they need to have a consumer-facing verification solution so that consumers can have some confidence in the products that they are buying.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, the health risks here are clear whether we're talking about medicines or beverages, for example, alcoholic drinks. Because I know now that you're working with some of the biggest beverage makers -- alcoholic beverage makers in the world now to try and improve preventing fake products being sold under their brand names as well.</p><p>GOGO: Yes, it's a really interesting challenge, because in some of the African countries, the risk around counterfeit pharmaceuticals are generally known because unfortunately, the side effects make the headlines.</p><p>But for counterfeit liquor, it's not generally known that there's a big problem. So it makes it hard for brands to elect to take the lead on that messaging for fear of damage to the brand that they have built over decades. And so we've developed other ways of implementing anti- counterfeiting programs without necessarily harping on the counterfeiting message.</p><p>So by using consumer rewards programs and similar approaches, we're able to implement anti-counterfeiting solutions for the beverage industry, titans like Diageo that we service or Bacardi, without having to center the messaging on the counterfeiting risks.</p><p>And the consumer gets the benefit and the brand is able to move forward with the program as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you make a great point as well that in certain cases, perhaps consumers are okay taking a substitute or a cheaper version of a product. It's not necessarily about a counterfeit product, you have to incentivize them to buy the real thing here.</p><p>Are you profitable as a company? Talk to me about what it's been like because you were initially born in Ghana. You came to the United States and you were educated here. How challenging has it been over the last ten years to build this company and gain recognition?</p><p>GOGO: It's been quite an exciting ride. We are profitable. We're self- sustaining. We have very interesting plans to grow. And the face of the company has changed significantly.</p><p>When we started off, we had most of our staff here in the U.S. solving problems that are domestic to people in different time zones, and we went, wait a minute, you know, what if we could find people that are local to the problem and work with them to take this on.</p><p>And today, we have our workforce which is much larger overseas than it is here in the U.S., because we've been able to team up and find brilliant people locally who are moving in the front lines, so deeper into the territory of counterfeiters in those markets.</p><p>So, it's been really exciting. We are still humbled by the nature of the impact that we have. You know, over 2.6 billion products, individual product units, there is Sproxil's technology worldwide. Over 26 million people have benefitted from our work in just a short span of 10 years.</p><p>So it's been terrific and we're looking forward to even greater days ahead.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, there's nothing humbling about that. Fantastic to chat to you. Fantastic product as well and really great to watch it work. Come back and talk to us soon, because again, not enough time always and plenty more questions for you.</p><p>Ashifi Gogo, the CEO of Sproxil. Great to have you on the show. Thank you.</p><p>GOGO: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, as the global economic recovery increasingly at risk and how may it be helped? We'll hear the thoughts from some of the world's top CEOs, next.</p><p>[09:51:41]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. As talks over additional U.S. stimulus or financial aid drag on, the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic could take longer than expected.</p><p>CNN's John Defterios has been speaking to some high profile CEO's about their take on the situation and wishes for the coming months. John now joins us.</p><p>John, some top CEOs indeed and some real concerns, I think, voiced.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Indeed, for that, Julia. And the near-term challenge of course is trying to get this package done in the United States first, right, by September 30th and there's a huge gap between the White House and House Democrats of about a trillion dollars. So they may have to go to a Plan B just to get something done by the end of the month on unemployment benefits, for example.</p><p>But the medium term, what surprised me about this roundtable is that all four that were there were suggesting that we have to look at budget cuts already, much higher taxes and a debt burden that will kind of hover over the next generation of youth for years to come, Julia.</p><p>This is the Global Manufacturing and Industrialization Summit. Listen to the CEO of Honeywell and the others around the table. Pretty blunt language.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DARIUS ADAMCZYK, CEO, HONEYWELL: The bad news is that now we have an even bigger debt crisis, and frankly, that's been a problem before this crisis even started. And now governments around the world are going to have to figure out a way to pay for this. And I think that's the part that a lot of countries, a lot of businesses, have maybe taken not taken into the calculus, and I think that you're going to have to do that two ways. One is through revenue generation.</p><p>KHALDOON AL MUBARAK, GROUP CEO, MUBADALA INVESTMENT COMPANY: I think we have to take that into consideration as we talk about a second wave and third wave, you have to put it in the context, yes, it's going to happen, but also, I think there's going to be big progress and there has been big progress when it comes to treatment and therapeutics and there is a line of sight when it comes to vaccines.</p><p>And then I would put on top of that that economies and governments have handled well so far, to a large extent, on the stimulus and the intervention side, but that has a cost and the cost will catch up soon.</p><p>JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE, CEO, SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC: The governments have stepped up to the plate and trumped out the big crisis. My biggest concern today is for the youth because all the productive measures have been rightly so to protect the characteristics of the elders in our societies, but at the same time people who are getting punished or don't manage to get the drug potentially are the youngsters. They are the future.</p><p>JOE KAESER, CEO, SIEMENS: It is crucially important that we not only have billions and trillions of government money and stimulus, but also that this money is going to be invested into the future and not into backward oriented industries.</p><p>They are not going to tie anyway if we are not mindful about the future today, we actually -- you know, for much of the future which we can design entirely is truly important.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Joe Kaeser of Siemens rounding that, Julia. It is interesting, he was saying look, we have to be careful which industries actually get the benefits going forward and this is a company that has what -- nearly 200,000 employees.</p><p>And if you look, it is fascinating how much money has been piled in. I hadn't seen the numbers for the last month or so, so if you take the top five, all over 10 percent of GDP put into stimulus, we're looking at over $11 trillion.</p><p>The top three, the United States at 13 percent, then you have Canada at 15 percent of GDP and then Japan rising to 20 percent of GDP.</p><p>[09:55:20]</p><p>DEFTERIOS: But I think the sober notes from the global CEOs is this can't go on forever and even Steven Mnuchin over the weekend on the weekend shows in the United States was suggesting, Julia that we can get something done until September 30th and roll that over and then come December, it's somebody else's responsibility in a new presidential season, whether it's Donald Trump or Joe Biden. That's how delicate the subject is about piling on more debt going forward.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, even those that can borrow at incredibly cheap levels are saying this can't be the answer forever. John Defterios, great to have you with us. Great panel there, thank you so much.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, that's it for the show. I'm Julia Chatterley. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. Stay safe and we'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020090701cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60ST-2331-JB20-G3TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 7, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002LTC</classCode><className>SOFTBANK CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>9984 (TSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Stock Market</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Brexit</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Artificial Intelligence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>UAE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pharmaceutical Industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade Relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SMIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Journalism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Issuance of Visas</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mzg4RUQxNkU4QUZBNEJGNEE1NkFBMDk1QzEzMTE0QzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkM5NTNBQjk2MUM3NDBCQ0E1NEU3MDI4QkY4NEVBNzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000587</classCode><className>EMBARGOES &amp;

The hearing showed that lawmakers are beginning to understand what is and isn't important when it comes to regulating these large businesses. And it also showed an increased focus on the most important area of antitrust policy - mergers and acquisitions and whether regulators have exercised enough vigilance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The five biggest tech companies (the four that testified, plus Microsoft Corp.) now represent more than one-fifth of the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500. Their value has only risen in the coronavirus pandemic:</p><p>When a few companies get this big and dominant, it makes sense to think about how they might be using their size to unfairly control markets.</p><p>One typical defense against such allegations is that tech companies are not monopolies. Whether this is true depends on how markets are defined - for example, Google is overwhelmingly dominant among search engines, but has only about a third of digital ad revenues. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg argued that his company faces intense competition in many markets, especially from the other top tech companies.</p><p>But focusing on whether a company is a monopoly misses the point. Oligopolies, where a few big companies dominate the market, also tend to wield some degree of market power. In theory, that can allow powerful players to jack up consumer prices, underpay workers and squeeze suppliers.</p><p>The biggest worry concerns suppliers. Platform companies depend on a network of third-party companies - merchants who sell on Amazon, websites that run Google ads, app developers who sell on Apple's App Store and so on. The platforms' size potentially allows them to extract a lot of value from these smaller companies, demanding a larger share of their revenue or even creating and then favoring their own competing offerings.</p><p>It's a good thing that Congress focused some of its attention on the need to maintain fair relationships between platforms and suppliers. Ultimately, this issue will probably have to be resolved with regulation because breaking up platform companies would eventually cause new platforms to emerge and become dominant.</p><p>Another concern is the prices that online service companies charge advertisers. By some estimates, more than half of digital ad spending now goes to either Google or Facebook, with the fastest-rising competitor being Amazon. Advertisers are the true paying customers for free online services for consumers.</p><p>Facebook CEO Zuckerberg admitted in the hearing that he purchased social-networking company Instagram in 2012 as a way to head off a potential competitor. There have been allegations that the company has attempted or threatened to do the same with other young social networks, telling them that if they didn't accept an offer, Facebook would launch a competing product and drive them out of existence.</p><p>Ultimately, that could raise prices for advertisers, if Facebook properties are the only way for them to reach social-media users. Those sorts of buyouts and buyout threats could also have a chilling effect on startup formation and economic dynamism because even the threat of competition from a dominant company can deter new entrants. Columbia Law School professor Timothy Wu has argued that such buyouts are illegal under current antitrust law.</p><p>So if there's any case for antitrust action against Big Tech right now, it probably has to do with the acquisition of upstart competitors.</p><p>In any case, it's a very good thing that Congress is beginning to pay more attention to the problems of industrial concentration and oligopoly in the U.S. economy. Big Tech is obviously the most well-known and popular case, but with concentration rising across most industries, these hearings will hopefully be a jumping-off point for a broader re-examination of the value of mega-mergers and huge, dominant companies.</p><p>Noah Smith is a Bloomberg columnist. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/08/13/walters-an-official-crusade-against-prop-22/\"> Walters: An official crusade against Prop. 22, the gig workers measure </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/08/12/bruni-kamala-harris-is-the-future-so-mike-pence-may-be-history/\"> Bruni: Kamala Harris is the future, so Mike Pence may be history </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/08/11/krugman-trump-sends-in-the-economic-quacks/\"> Krugman: Trump's quack remedy may undermine the deal America needs </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/08/11/column-california-should-allow-its-voters-to-fill-u-s-senate-vacancies-not-the-governor/\"> Skelton: Who should fill U.S. Senate vacancies?

The hearing showed that lawmakers are beginning to understand what is and isn't important when it comes to regulating these large businesses. And it also showed an increased focus on the most important area of antitrust policy - mergers and acquisitions and whether regulators have exercised enough vigilance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The five biggest tech companies (the four that testified, plus Microsoft Corp.) now represent more than one-fifth of the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500. Their value has only risen in the coronavirus pandemic:</p><p>When a few companies get this big and dominant, it makes sense to think about how they might be using their size to unfairly control markets.</p><p>One typical defense against such allegations is that tech companies are not monopolies. Whether this is true depends on how markets are defined - for example, Google is overwhelmingly dominant among search engines, but has only about a third of digital ad revenues. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg argued that his company faces intense competition in many markets, especially from the other top tech companies.</p><p>But focusing on whether a company is a monopoly misses the point. Oligopolies, where a few big companies dominate the market, also tend to wield some degree of market power. In theory, that can allow powerful players to jack up consumer prices, underpay workers and squeeze suppliers.</p><p>The biggest worry concerns suppliers. Platform companies depend on a network of third-party companies - merchants who sell on Amazon, websites that run Google ads, app developers who sell on Apple's App Store and so on. The platforms' size potentially allows them to extract a lot of value from these smaller companies, demanding a larger share of their revenue or even creating and then favoring their own competing offerings.</p><p>It's a good thing that Congress focused some of its attention on the need to maintain fair relationships between platforms and suppliers. Ultimately, this issue will probably have to be resolved with regulation because breaking up platform companies would eventually cause new platforms to emerge and become dominant.</p><p>Another concern is the prices that online service companies charge advertisers. By some estimates, more than half of digital ad spending now goes to either Google or Facebook, with the fastest-rising competitor being Amazon. Advertisers are the true paying customers for free online services for consumers.</p><p>Facebook CEO Zuckerberg admitted in the hearing that he purchased social-networking company Instagram in 2012 as a way to head off a potential competitor. There have been allegations that the company has attempted or threatened to do the same with other young social networks, telling them that if they didn't accept an offer, Facebook would launch a competing product and drive them out of existence.</p><p>Ultimately, that could raise prices for advertisers, if Facebook properties are the only way for them to reach social-media users. Those sorts of buyouts and buyout threats could also have a chilling effect on startup formation and economic dynamism because even the threat of competition from a dominant company can deter new entrants. Columbia Law School professor Timothy Wu has argued that such buyouts are illegal under current antitrust law.</p><p>So if there's any case for antitrust action against Big Tech right now, it probably has to do with the acquisition of upstart competitors.</p><p>In any case, it's a very good thing that Congress is beginning to pay more attention to the problems of industrial concentration and oligopoly in the U.S. economy. Big Tech is obviously the most well-known and popular case, but with concentration rising across most industries, these hearings will hopefully be a jumping-off point for a broader re-examination of the value of mega-mergers and huge, dominant companies.</p><p>Noah Smith is a Bloomberg columnist. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/13/walters-an-official-crusade-against-prop-22/\"> Walters: An official crusade against Prop. 22, the gig workers measure </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/12/bruni-kamala-harris-is-the-future-so-mike-pence-may-be-history/\"> Bruni: Kamala Harris is the future, so Mike Pence may be history </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/11/krugman-trump-sends-in-the-economic-quacks/\"> Krugman: Trump's quack remedy may undermine the deal America needs </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/11/column-california-should-allow-its-voters-to-fill-u-s-senate-vacancies-not-the-governor/\"> Skelton: Who should fill U.S. Senate vacancies?

The hearing showed that lawmakers are beginning to understand what is and isn\u2019t important when it comes to regulating these large businesses. And it also showed an increased focus on the most important area of antitrust policy \u2014 mergers and acquisitions and whether regulators have exercised enough vigilance.   The five biggest tech companies (the four that testified, plus Microsoft Corp.) now represent more than one-fifth of the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500. Their value has only risen in the coronavirus pandemic:    When a few companies get this big and dominant, it makes sense to think about how they might be using their size to unfairly control markets.    One typical defense against such allegations is that tech companies are not monopolies. Whether this is true depends on how markets are defined \u2014 for example, Google is overwhelmingly dominant among search engines, but has only about a third of digital ad revenues. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg argued that his company faces intense competition in many markets, especially from the other top tech companies.     But focusing on whether a company is a monopoly misses the point. Oligopolies, where a few big companies dominate the market, also tend to wield some degree of market power. In theory, that can allow powerful players to jack up consumer prices, underpay workers and squeeze suppliers.    The biggest worry concerns suppliers. Platform companies depend on a network of third-party companies \u2014 merchants who sell on Amazon, websites that run Google ads, app developers who sell on Apple\u2019s App Store and so on. The platforms\u2019 size potentially allows them to extract a lot of value from these smaller companies, demanding a larger share of their revenue or even creating and then favoring their own competing offerings.    It\u2019s a good thing that Congress focused some of its attention on the need to maintain fair relationships between platforms and suppliers. Ultimately, this issue will probably have to be resolved with regulation because breaking up platform companies would eventually cause new platforms to emerge and become dominant.    Another concern is the prices that online service companies charge advertisers. By some estimates, more than half of digital ad spending now goes to either Google or Facebook, with the fastest-rising competitor being Amazon. Advertisers are the true paying customers for free online services for consumers.    Facebook CEO Zuckerberg admitted in the hearing that he purchased social-networking company Instagram in 2012 as a way to head off a potential competitor. There have been allegations that the company has attempted or threatened to do the same with other young social networks, telling them that if they didn\u2019t accept an offer, Facebook would launch a competing product and drive them out of existence.     Ultimately, that could raise prices for advertisers, if Facebook properties are the only way for them to reach social-media users. Those sorts of buyouts and buyout threats could also have a chilling effect on startup formation and economic dynamism because even the threat of competition from a dominant company can deter new entrants. Columbia Law School professor Timothy Wu has argued that such buyouts are illegal under current antitrust law.    So if there\u2019s any case for antitrust action against Big Tech right now, it probably has to do with the acquisition of upstart competitors.    In any case, it\u2019s a very good thing that Congress is beginning to pay more attention to the problems of industrial concentration and oligopoly in the U.S. economy. Big Tech is obviously the most well-known and popular case, but with concentration rising across most industries, these hearings will hopefully be a jumping-off point for a broader re-examination of the value of mega-mergers and huge, dominant companies.

After  scorching about 61,000 hectares in the last week and a half, the so-called  Campfire is likely to burn for 11 more days before it's finally contained,  and while the financial cost is still being tallied, the loss of human life  that is incalculable.  At least 80 people have been killed in this fire and  another fire in the south of the state.  </p><p>Nearly 1,000 people remain missing.  Community boards like this one with  photos and contact information are now popping up.  Survivors frantically  are searching for their loved ones.  The parking lot of this Walmart just  10 miles from the fire's epicenter has been transformed into this, a tent  city, after local shelters have reached full capacity.  And amid all the  devastation, one church is making this vow, \"We will rise from the ashes.\"  </p><p>Let's get straight to CNN's Kaylee Hartung.  She joins us from Chico,  California, where many of those who were displaced have sought refuge and  Kaylee, the number of missing has skyrocketed.  What is behind that and the  alarming death toll?  </p><p>KAYLEE HARTUNG, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, this fire when it was at its  worst was burning through the equivalent of New York's Manhattan Island  every three hours.  There were extremely high winds, there was low humidity  and warm conditions which really fueled this incredibly rapidly moving  fire.  </p><p>And so the people in the town of Paradise, a town with a population of  approximately 25,000 people had very little notice when they needed to  leave their hillside community.  Now, when we speak about this number of  missing, the number of people who were unaccounted for, authorities say  because so many people were displaced, they estimate about 50,000 people  evacuated from the fire zone, they say it is so difficult to manage this  list as they are sourcing information from multiple different types of  reports, whether that be 911 calls or e-mails, other incident reports.  </p><p>So 993 names are on the list as it stands now.  That number is absolutely  startling, but authorities say that's 283 fewer names than there were on  the list the day before.  They say for all of the folks who may be afraid  to look at the list because they might see someone's name on it, they ask  them to take a look and if you see anyone's name on this list who shouldn't  be on it, someone who is safe, please let them know because they are going  to comb through it meticulously to ensure everyone is accounted for.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Kaylee Hartung reporting for us live from Chico, California.   Kaylee, thank you.  Now, our meteorologist Chad Myers is at the CNN Weather  Center.  He has been monitoring conditions.  He joins us now and Chad, what  are the conditions like today?  </p><p>CHAD MYERS, METEOROLOGIST, CNN:  Not bad, although for the people that live  there, the smoke is in the air and certainly the air is as hazardous as  anything you can imagine in any industrialized country, even though there  is no true industry there.  </p><p>We are now 60,000 hectares here and even into the Woolsey fire, that is  down by Malibu, that is beginning to clear up, almost completely contained  here.  The smoke is in the air, the smog just feels like you're breathing  something and it's getting at the back of the people's throats here from  Sacramento all the way down to Oakland and San Francisco, a very big  populated areas just so much haze and smoke in the air, but rain is coming,  but a lot of rain is coming and that's a good thing, bad thing.  Good news,  bad news kind of thing here.  </p><p>We will see rain on Wednesday, we'll see another batch on Thursday  afternoon and again maybe even into Friday.  Some spots will pick up with  the first roundabout of 100 millimeters of rain and then another 50 on top  of that in just a couple of days.  You think, well, that's great, and it  is, it will put out the fire.  The problem is all of this land here is  about to turn into a giant mud slide.  And I'll tell you why in just a  second.  </p><p>[08:05:01]  </p><p>MYERS:  Fifty millimeters to put out the fires, but the burn scars are the  problem.  The burn scars are the problem because the fire almost like  painting a piece of wood won't allow the water to soak in.  The surface  below this super hot fire of the dirt, of the soil, turns hydrophobic.  It  actually seals it like searing a steak so that you sear the steak so that  the juices don't come out.  </p><p>If you sear the land, the juices or the rain doesn't soak in.  So all of  this ash that's in the way here will get all coagulated in to a slurry and  slide right down the hill.  And it's the sliding part that is going to be  the problem.  </p><p>On the bottom of these mudslides, sometimes these things can be doing 30 or  40 miles per hour and people can't get out of the way of these significant  mudslides.  We see them all the time.  The subsurface soil will not allow  any rain to soak in and so the mud just goes downhill.  We call it a debris  flow, but debris is lots of things -- trees, sticks, logs, sometimes even  boulders can be pushed down with this very almost cement-like, wet cement- like structure here as it slides downhill, Kristie.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Chad, really appreciate that you explained it.  When we hear  that rain is in the forecast, we think, oh, relief is on the way, but, no,  in fire ravaged California, rain is a double-edged sword when there's too  much of it.  Chad Myers, a good explainer, as always, thank you.  And to  find out how you can help the victims of the California wildfires, you can  check out our website, go to cnn.com/impact.  You will find a list of  vetted charities helping those in need.  </p><p>In a new interview, US President Donald Trump says he is not really sure if  the Saudi Crown Prince lied when he said he wasn't involved in Jamal  Khashoggi's murder.  This is at odds with the CIA assessment that the Crown  Prince personally ordered the killing.  </p><p>The Saudi journalist was killed on October 2nd inside the Saudi consulate  in Istanbul.  An audio recording by Mr. Trump's own intel officials now  have obtained captured part of the murder, but the US President  says there  is no need for him to listen to it.  Here is what he told Fox News.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I don't want to hear the  tape.  No reason for me to hear the tape.  </p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Why don't you want to hear it, sir?  </p><p>TRUMP:  Because it's a suffering tape.  It's a terrible tape.  I've been  fully briefed on it.  There is no reason for me to hear it.  In fact, I  said to the people, should I?  They said you really shouldn't.  There is no  reason.  I know exactly - I know everything that went on with the tape and  what happened.  </p><p>WALLACE:  And what happened?  </p><p>TRUMP:  It was very violent, very vicious and terrible.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Let's bring in Jomana Karadsheh.  She is live from outside the  Saudi consulate in Istanbul and Jomana, Trump doesn't want to listen to the  tape?  President Trump is distancing himself from the CIA assessment saying  it's too early to know.  Does this give the Saudis room to just brush off  the latest allegations?  </p><p>JOMANA KARADSHEH, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, you know, Kristie, the feeling  has been that since day one, the administration and President Trump  personally have at least publicly appeared not to want to push the Saudis  too much and some feel that it was Turkey's strategy, this drip feed of  leaks over the past few weeks that got us to this point where Saudi went  from basically denying any knowledge of what happened to Jamal Khashoggi to  now admitting that he was killed in the consulate.  </p><p>But when it comes to the President's position it seems, you know, so many  times we've heard him defending the relationship with Saudi Arabia,  defending the Crown Prince and basically saying that there's no evidence.   Take a listen to what the President said in an interview with Fox News.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  We now know that some of the people closest to him, some of his  closest advisers, were part of this.  Question, did MBS lie to you, sir?  </p><p>TRUMP:  I don't - I don't know.  You know, who can really know?  But I can  say this, he's got many people now that say he had no knowledge.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>KARADSHEH:  And, you know, some, Kristie, feel that the President and this  administration just want the world to take Saudi Arabia's word for it, for  what took place in this consulate, and then when you hear the President  saying it is too early to reach conclusions, some are wondering, you know,  they find it as a very baffling statement.  </p><p>It's been 50 days almost since Jamal Khashoggi was killed.  It has been  nearly four weeks since the CIA Director, Gina Haspel was here in Turkey  and the Turks shared the intelligence they had, she listened to the audio  recording.  Some are wondering why is it taking so long for this report  from the administration for them to really come out with the conclusion and  some here in this region also within the Turkish government, some officials  feel that we're seeing some sort of stalling tactics from some within the  administration as well as Saudi Arabia hoping that the longer this goes on  that the world will simply move on and just forget about th case.  </p><p>[08:10:08]  </p><p>KARADSHEH:  But that obviously is not happening right now, Kristie.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, because more pressure will be applied from various sources,  whether it's US Congress in the US or Turkish officials there where you're  reporting.  Jomana Karadsheh, reporting live.  Thank you.  </p><p>Now, there are growing signs of a ceasefire in the war in Yemen where a  leader of the Iran-backed Houthian movement says his forces are ready to  stop military operations against the Saudi-backed coalition.  The comments  followed diplomatic pressure on Saudi Arabia to engage in peace talks after  the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and now the Saudi King Salman says the  Kingdom supports a political solution to the conflict.  </p><p>CNN's Sam Kiley is in Abu Dhabi.  He joins me now.  Sam, the Houthi leader  is ready for a ceasefire, but what about the Saudi-led coalition?  </p><p>SAM KILEY, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:   Well, so far the  Saudi-led coalition has said at least during a lull in the fighting last  week that its attitude was that it was continuing operations at pace.  </p><p>That was before Mohammed al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthis, the Iranian  backed separatists in Yemen announced this overnight ceasefire.  It's a  unilateral offer to stop using long range missiles and stop using drones  not only against targets inside Yemen, but also beyond the borders, notably  into Saudi Arabia and here into the United Arab Emirates.  </p><p>Those were in part, part of a previous UN Resolution that called on the  Houthis to stop these sorts of operations ahead of any previous - any  possible ceasefire.  Now today, there is an expectation that Britain will  come up with a new UN Resolution, possibly requiring both sides, that was  the idea at least over the weekend, to create a level of equality, if you  like, in this requiring both the Saudis and the Houthis to simultaneously  cease operations.  </p><p>It will be interesting to see whether or not that appears in the final  resolution or whether it gets watered down after protests by the Saudis,  but there is a glimmer of hope here, Kristie, that towards the end of this  month there could be some peace talks that could get under way in Sweden,  not least because one of the major blocks to that had been the release of  50 wounded Houthis by the Saudis to allow them to go and seek medical help  outside the country.  The Saudis have now agreed to that.  </p><p>So these things are inching in the right direction at a time when of course  as you know the humanitarian crisis is catastrophic there.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, so peace is desperately needed.  Sam Kiley reporting.   Thank you.  You're watching \"News Stream.\"  Still ahead, we've breaking  news for you.  Nissan says its Chairman has been arrested after major  allegations made by the company.  What this means for the car giant?  What  is happening behind the scenes here with Carlos Ghosn, more on the  investigation that led to this development.  That is happening after the  break.  </p><p>Also ahead, the APEC Summit ends without its leaders agreeing on a joint  communique.  This is the very first time this has happened.  Keep it here.  </p><p>[08:15:00]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Welcome back.  Breaking news, in the past few minutes, Nissan  has revealed that its Chairman has been arrested after allegations of  serious misconduct.  Nissan accuses Carlos Ghosn of underreporting his  compensation and the personal use of company assets.  </p><p>Nissan says it's been going on for years.  Board member Greg Kelly also has  been accused in the scheme.  Anna Stewart is in London and joins us now.   Anna, it was an internal investigation that was launched and took place in  the last few months that led us to this moment.  Tell us more about the  investigation and what more did it reveal about Carlos Ghosn leading to his  arrest.  </p><p>ANNA STEWART, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Exactly.  We've just heard from the CEO  of Nissan himself, he is giving a press conference right now and he gave us  the information that Carlos Ghosn has been now been arrested as has Guy  Kelly, the other executive involved in this.  </p><p>And what they released today was a very clear statement actually in terms  of sort of what the allegations are.  It says, \"Over many years, both Ghosn  and Kelly have been reporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock  Exchange that were less than the actual amount.\"  And in addition to that,  Kristie, in regards to Ghosn, there are numerous other significant acts of  misconduct which have been uncovered such as the personal use of company  assets amongst other things.  </p><p>So that's all we know at this stage in terms of what is the investigation.   It was an internal investigation following a whistleblower report.  Now of  course, Nissan is cooperating with Japanese authorities and the CEO has  been arrested.  The question is now of course, will the board oust him,  which of course we largely expect, not just from Nissan but from the other  car companies that Carlos Ghosn heads up.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, Carlos Ghosn, he is a titan of industry.  He is not just  the chairman of Nissan, he is the Chairman and chief exec of Renault.  He  is the Chairman of Mitsubishi Motors.  I know you've been following the  stock price for at least a couple of these companies, and what does the  arrest mean for all these firms?  </p><p>STEWART:  Well, quite right, Renault, as you can see from the share price,  Kristie, double digits down this morning.  The news broke just after Nissan  closed for the day, but I can tell you that on the Frankfurt Stock  Exchange, those share prices are under pressure, too.  </p><p>Now of course, shareholders wants more clarity.  It's hard to understand  how he could retain any of his positions on any of these boards, frankly,  given the serious nature of the allegations against him.  We're waiting to  hear from Renault and from Mitsubishi.  Of course, they are likely having  crisis meetings with their boards now, but we should get more details in  the hours to come.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  All right, Anna Stewart reporting live from London.  We'll have  more details in the first move with Julia Chatterly at the top of the hour.   Anna, thank you.  </p><p>Now, after a turbulent last few days in Westminster, the British Prime  Minister is facing new challenges over her Brexit plan this week.  The  first began a couple of hours ago when Theresa May pitched her draft deal  to British business leaders.  </p><p>Now, the focus turns to the rest of the EU where there are key meetings  scheduled.  So what is motivating Britain's leader during these tough  talks?  Well, she explained this weekend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SOPHY RIDGE, ENGLISH BROADCAST JOURNALIST:  Have you ever thought at any  stage about just giving up?  What's the point of this?  </p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  No, I haven't.  Of course it's been a  tough week.  Actually, these negotiations have been tough right from the  start, but they were always going to get even more difficult right towards  the end when we are coming to that conclusion, but what I think is this  isn't about me, it's actually about what's right for the people of this  country.  It's about what's in the national interest.  That's what drives  me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Tough request to answer, tough times for Theresa May.  We've got  Nina Dos Santos live in London.  And Nina, let's talk about her pitch to  the business community which she just gave earlier in the day.  How much  business support does the Prime Minister have for her Brexit plan?  </p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, for the moment she does seem to  have the support of the biggest business lobby, which is the Confederation  of British Industries that's been long agitating about the fact that there  isn't enough clarity in the UK's Brexit negotiations and says that  essentially although this deal is not perfect, it is some sign of the kind  of stability that they would like to see, some visibility on the future  framework that the UK would have with the EU after it leaves the EU in  march of next year.  </p><p>There's also been some clarity over the last few days that seems to have  been given when it comes to this so-called transition period.  If the UK  leaves and hasn't yet got a deal with the EU, it seems as though instead of  that being an unlimited transition period, which is a total redline for  many Brexiteers, the government has firmed up the language on that to make  sure the transition period lasts no longer than January 2022.  </p><p>As you pointed out, Theresa May is going to be heading over to Brussels to  try and again, sell this deal to the community over there.  She's going to  be meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker she said in the next few days, largely  not to talk about the withdrawal agreement because she says this document  that of course has caused so much ire in Westminster over the last several  days that is largely the withdrawal document.  </p><p>[08:20:05]  </p><p>DOS SANTOS:  That she believes is said and done, it's the best deal they  are going to get.  But instead, the focus is going to shift towards the  future political declaration, the future political relationship and  economic relationship that the UK will have with the EU once it has left  the European Union.  </p><p>And when it comes to the voices that are coming back from Brussels, again,  the message has been we have agreed what we've agreed with Theresa May,  Theresa May saying to her MPs who as yet haven't had the numbers to mount a  big leadership challenge against her, changing me is not  going to achieve  anything.  This is the best deal that we can get, Kristie?  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, testing times for her and her Brexit plan.  Nina dos Santos  reporting.  Nina, thank you.  This year's APEC summit, usually a relatively  tame affair ended in dramatic fashion.  For the first time in its 25-year  history, the meeting wrapped up without a formal joint statement.  That's  because according to a source within the meeting, China wasn't happy with  some of the wording in a paragraph about trade.  </p><p>Tensions between Washington and Beijing, they were front and center  throughout the summit and that was evident in speeches by the Chinese  President and the US Vice President.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have great respect for  President Xi and great respect for China.  But in the President's words,  China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.  Those  days are over.  </p><p>XI JINPING, PRESIDENT OF CHINA (Through a translator):  History tells us to  take the road of confrontation, whether it's in the form of a cold war,  open war or trade war, it will produce no winners.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, the disagreement over the wording in the communique  apparently caused a scene at the Papua New Guinea Foreign Minister's  office.  Now for more, let's go straight to Ivan Watson.  And Ivan, usually  the APEC Summit ends with a communique and a photo op with the world  leaders in matching tunics.  That didn't happen in this time.  What went  wrong?  </p><p>IVAN WATSON, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, there was a  failure to achieve consensus here.  As the Prime Minister of the host  country, Papua New Guinea put it, it was  because of the two big giants,  China and the US, the two world's largest economies could not see eye to  eye, but there was also some drama on the sidelines.  </p><p>A source familiar with the incident tells CNN that at one point on Saturday  in the capital there, four Chinese diplomats barged into the office of  Papua New Guinea's Foreign Minister after he had rejected a request from  them to help draw up the final draft communique.  He was arguing that he  had to be objective as the host country and couldn't have their influence.  </p><p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry has denied that and claimed that these are  rumors aimed at trying to spoil the Chinese Papua New Guinea relationship.   That was a bit of a sidebar to a bigger issue and that was that the 21  countries couldn't come to an agreement.  A US official tells CNN that  China was alone against the other 20 countries because of a different -  difference of  agreement over visions of trade going into the future.   Kristie?  </p><p>LU STOUT:  A bizarre turn of events at the host nation for APEC this year.   Ivan, just how heated did it get between Xi Jinping and Mike Pence at APEC.   </p><p>WATSON:  They met twice and evidently they didn't swing at each other or  anything.  They did speak, but in their speeches they did make some pretty  blunt criticism at each other with Xi Jinping talking about the need for  multilateralism or rules-based system, for tolerance and warning against  protectionism, whereas Mike Pence went very much against one of Xi  Jinping's pet projects, his One Belt, One Road initiative.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>PENCE:  Know that the United States offers a better option.  We don't drown  our partners in a sea of debt, we don't coerce to compromise your  independence, the United States deals openly and fairly, we do not offer a  constricting belt or a one-way road.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WATSON:  So he is criticizing here China's One Belt, One Road initiative  where China has lavished huge amounts of money around the world on these  infrastructure projects and Pence basically arguing that this is a debt  trap that will take away nations' sovereignty.  Xi in his own speech said,  no, there is no hidden agenda to our One Belt, One Road initiative.  You  can see the jockeying here, Kristie, because Pence came to this meeting  talking about joint investment projects and infrastructure in the Asia- Pacific region that would be done with Australia, for example, or Japan.   Promising to bring electricity to Papua New Guinea which has issues with  power, and also announcing that there would be the creation of a new  trilateral military base on Papua New Guinea's island of Manus with the  Australians and Papua New Guinea.  </p><p>[08:25:09]  </p><p>WATSON:  So you can see the competition shaking out here in addition to a  trade war where both countries have levied tariffs on hundreds of billions  of dollars' worth of each other's goods.  There could be an off ramp and  Pence himself suggested this at the upcoming G-20 summit in Argentina where  President Trump and Xi Jinping will meet face-to-face, Kristie.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, for that, we will wait and see.  But wow, for APEC this  year, no communique, no consensus just open feuding.  Incredible.  Ivan  Watson, reporting, thank you.  </p><p>Now, not long ago Shenzhen was a poor fishing village on the southern coast  of China, but today it is one and has been for a few years the fastest  growing cities on the planet.  Matt Rivers takes us on a tour of China's  Silicon Valley.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>MATT RIVERS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Forty years ago, none of this existed.   The buildings, roads, none of it.  Shenzhen was a little more than a poor  fishing village on China's southern coast, but today, it's home to 12  million people and growing.  It's the world's greatest or biggest boomtown.   That's because it's one of the top centers of Chinese wealth, and this is  the man who started it all.  </p><p>That's Deng Xiaoping who led China from the late '70s to the early' '90s,  and it was his idea to open up China to the rest of the world.  He did that  in part by creating with these special economic zones which included  Shenzhen.  They got preferential tax treatment, more direct foreign  investment, and that more than anything else helped create all this.  </p><p>Western firms flooded in like China's first McDonalds and factories popped  up churning out boatloads of cheap electronics and consumer goods and  amongst them were a whole bunch of knock offs until manufacturers here  realized.  </p><p>ANDREW HUANG, AUTHOR, THE HARDWARE HACKER:  You can't really actually make  a big profit just pure copying, so they learned how to actually add value  to the designs, so now they're coming up with like new designs.  </p><p>RIVERS:  Tech startups lured by easy access to the global supply chain of  gadgets flourished in this warmer less polluted city far away from Beijing.   Innovating in AI, robotics and electric vehicles.  This isn't the stuff of  the future.  It's happening right now from facial recognition --  </p><p>So right now when you walk into the subway here, they take a picture of  your face.  There's lights there.  They take a picture of you every time  you walk under the subway.  </p><p>To an entire market, the world's largest operating almost entirely almost  cash and card free.  </p><p>So every little store here that you can buy fruit or whatever you need, you  go on your phone, you scan a QR code like this one, so this is WeChat Pay  and that's that, simple as that.  I just bought fruit from this woman.  </p><p>All of these innovations supported by the government in a bid to rebrand  \"Made in China\" to \"Created in China.\"  To be sure, much of the world is  wary of China's rise.  Can it truly challenge the US for economic  dominance?  That's not clear.  But if it does, Shenzhen, the city built in  just a single generation will likely be the force that makes it happen.   Matt Rivers, CNN, Shenzhen.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  The Chinese artist and activist, Ai Weiwei once said that,  \"Everything is art, everything is politics.\"  Now that is especially true  if you work somewhere where freedom of speech is not taken for granted like  Taiwan, but it's comments made outside the cutting room from Fu Yuea, a  director from Taiwan that are stirring up deep feelings on both sides of  the Taiwan  strait.  Take a listen to what she said at the Golden Horse  Film Awards this weekend.  It's the Chinese language equivalent of the  Oscars.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>FU YUET, TAIWANESE FILM DIRECTOR (Through a translator):  I really hope our  country will one day be treated as a genuine independent entity.  This is  my biggest wish as a Taiwanese.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, under its One China policy, Beijing considers Taiwan part  of its territory even though it is self-governed and democratic.  Taiwan's  leader has spoken out saying this, quote, \"I am proud of the Golden Horse  Ceremony yesterday because it accentuated how Taiwan is different from  China.\"  You're watching \"News Stream.\"  Still to come, President Trump is  speaking out about the Russia probe.  What he's saying about his written  answers to Special Counsel Mueller's questions, next.  </p><p>[08:30:41]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong.  You're watching \"News  Stream\" and these are your world headlines.   Nissan says it's Chairman,  Carlos Ghosn has been arrested after allegations by the company of serious  misconduct.  Nissan accuses him of underreporting his compensation and the  personal use of company assets.  Board member, Greg Kelly is also accused  in the alleged scheme and we have not yet heard a response from either of  them.  </p><p>California officials say the deadliest fire in the state's history won't be  contained for another 11 days.  At least 77 people have been killed; nearly  1,000 remain missing in the devastating Campfire.  Cooler temperatures and  rain are in the forecast for the devastated region.  </p><p>Israel's education minister says he is not resigning despite major  divisions in the government.  Many Israelis are upset that Prime Minister  Netanyahu agreed to a ceasefire with Hamas last week.  His Defense Minister  quit and the Prime Minister's base calls for a snap election.  Mr.  Netanyahu says that would be irresponsible.  </p><p>In a new interview with Fox News, US President Donald Trump said who can  really know if the Saudi Crown Prince lied when he said he wasn't involved  in Jamal Khashoggi's murder.  This is at odds with a CIA assessment that  the Crown Prince personally ordered the killing of the Saudi journalist  last month.  Mr. Trump says he will be getting a very full report on  Tuesday.  </p><p>In the same interview, President Trump spoke out about the Mueller probe  and criticism over the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting Attorney  General.  In the past, Whitaker has been critical of the Russia probe.   Here is what Mr. Trump told Fox News about Whitaker's oversight of the  special counsel.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  If Whitaker decides in any way to limit or curtail the Mueller  investigation, are you okay with that?  </p><p>TRUMP:  Look, it's going to be up to him.  I think he's very well aware  politically, I think he is astute politically.  He is a very smart person,  a very respected person, he's going to do what's right.  I really believe  he's going to do what's right.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But you won't overrule him if he decides to curtail.  </p><p>TRUMP:  I would not get involved.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  CNN's senior Washington correspondent, Joe Johns is at the White  House.  He joins us now.  Joe, good to see you.  Will President Trump sit  down for an interview with the special counsel?  What did he say to Fox?  </p><p>JOE JOHNS, SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPODENT, CNN:  Well, that's certainly the  farthest the President has gone and it's pretty strong language, too, isn't  it?  The President has said in the past that he had concerns about sitting  down with Mueller, but now just listen.  Listen so what the President had  to say.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  We gave very, very complete answers to a lot of questions that I  shouldn't have even been asked and I think that should solve the problem.   I hope it solves the problem.  If it doesn't, you know, I will be told and  we will make a decision at that time.  But probably, this is the end.  </p><p>WALLACE:  No interview.  </p><p>TRUMP:  I think we've wasted enough time on this witch-hunt and answer is  probably - we are finished.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>[08:35:05]  </p><p>JOHNS:  \"Probably, we are finished.\"  Now, if you talk to power lawyers  around Washington, DC, and I have, many of them have said they would never  allow the President of the United States to sit down with the special  counsel, simply because of the legal exposure that's involved when it comes  to things like perjury or obstruction of justice.  </p><p>Also, the President has been known to be a bit challenged by the truth.  So  there's that as well.  Difficult to see how an attorney would willingly  allow the President to sit down and answer questions, impromptu, with the  special counsel's office, Kristie.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  This was a wide-ranging interview, it generated a lot of  headlines.  Also in the interview, President Trump unloaded on retired  Admiral William McRaven, former head of Special Operations Command.  What  did he say?  </p><p>JOHNS:  Essentially reducing the man who spear-headed or was the architect  for the capture of Saddam Hussein as well as the killing of Osama bin  Laden, reducing his reputation to a political hack.  Listen to what he had  to say.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  McRaven, retired Admiral, Navy SEAL, 37 years, former head of US  Special operations.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Hillary Clinton fan.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Special operations --   </p><p>TRUMP:  Excuse me.  Hillary Clinton fan.  </p><p>WALLACE:   ... who led the operations, commanded the operations, that took  down Saddam Hussein and that killed Osama bin Laden says that your  sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy in his lifetime.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Okay, he is a Hillary Clinton backer and an Obama backer and  frankly --  </p><p>WALLACE:  But he was a Navy SEAL for 37 years.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner  than that?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>JOHNS:  That is the world of the President of the United States.  People  who oppose or criticize him are seen to do it because it is motivated by  politics, but people who support the President do it because of altruism.   Back to you.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  This interview just revealed so much about the US President.   Joe Johns reporting live from the White House.  Joe, thank you.  </p><p>After a contentious Senate race and recount, Florida will send a new  senator to Washington. Current US Senator Bill Nelson on the right conceded  to Republican challenger Rick Scott on Sunday.  The margin, just over  10,000 votes.  Meanwhile, the Senate Republicans will keep their majority  now with 52 seats.  Democrats only have 47.  One undecided race in  Mississippi will be decided later this month in a runoff.  </p><p>In the House of Representatives, Democrats have a majority with 232 seats,  Republicans have 200.  Three races are still undecided.  And as the new  Congress prepares to go to work, will they continue their colleagues' focus  on big tech in the wake of data breaches and disinformation campaigns, the  CEO of Apple says the scrutiny on his company and others could intensify.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you think that's inevitable?  </p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation, I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market is not working and it hasn't worked here.  I think  it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Tim Cook made those comments to \"Axios\" and they come as the  backlash grows for Facebook after that \"New York Times\" investigation  suggested it failed at recognizing and stopping Russian interference and  hired a PR hit firm to write negative stories about its critics.  </p><p>You're watching \"News Stream.\"  Still to come we are going to meet a  geographer who is determined to make Britain's capital city a thriving  national park.  We're going green.  That's next.  </p><p>[08:40:00]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Welcome back, now, in major cities around the world, creative  minds are tackling some of society's toughest issues.  In this edition of  CNN's \"Going Green\" we meet an inspiring environmentalist trying to turn  London into one of the first's urban national park.  Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>DAN RAVEN-ELLISON, GUERRILLA GEOGRAPHER AND CREATIVE EXPLORER:  I  absolutely love being in nature.  Throughout London, there are thousands of  parks like this one with this beautiful tree canopy and I love the  curvature of the branches, the dappled light coming through the trees, the  sound of wind going through the branches.  I'm Dan Raven-Ellison, working  to make London a national park city.  </p><p>When most people think of national parks, they think of deserts or rain  forests or mountains marlins, but I have explored all of the UK's national  parks and I noticed that maybe something is missing and that's a major  urban area.  </p><p>We share the city with 15,000 other species of wildlife and I don't think  that the urban life is worth any less, I don't think an urban red fox is  worth less than an arctic fox or a desert fox, it's just a red fox.  </p><p>I think people are awakening to the fact that we need to have a better  relationship with nature, for our own health and wellbeing, for the health  and wellbeing of wildlife populations, but we also need to have a better  relationship with nature for the health and resilience of our cities to  tackle climate change.  </p><p>I started the campaign to make London a national park city five years ago  now and when I started out, I think that most people thought that I was   completely bonkers, but I'm delighted to share after all of this work,  London is going to be launched as the world's first national park city in  July 2019.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Wow, that is a vision for London I'd love to see happen not just  there, but in so many places, urban centers around the world.  Now, when  you plan to visit Disneyland, you accept that waiting in line, that's just  part of the deal, but at Disneyland Japan, the waiting time to meet Mickey  Mouse on Sunday reached nightmarish proportions.  </p><p>Now, in the morning on Sunday this sign warned visitors of a 660-minute  wait to explore Mickey's House and to take a picture with the character.   That's 11 hours.  Later in the day, it shortened to a mere three hours.   November 18th marked 90 years since \"Steamboat Willie\" premiered, that was  Mickey's first public appearance and by the time, many of his fans got  through the line, it probably felt like 90 years had gone by.  </p><p>And that is \"News Stream.\"  I'm Kristie Lu Stout, but don't go anywhere.  \"World Sport's\" Alex Thomas is next.  </p><p>[SPORTS]  </p><p>[09:00:00]  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

After scorching about 61,000 hectares in the last week and a half, the so-called Campfire is likely to burn for 11 more days before it's finally contained, and while the financial cost is still being tallied, the loss of human life that is incalculable. At least 80 people have been killed in this fire and another fire in the south of the state.</p><p>Nearly 1,000 people remain missing. Community boards like this one with photos and contact information are now popping up. Survivors frantically are searching for their loved ones. The parking lot of this Walmart just 10 miles from the fire's epicenter has been transformed into this, a tent city, after local shelters have reached full capacity. And amid all the devastation, one church is making this vow, \"We will rise from the ashes.\"</p><p>Let's get straight to CNN's Kaylee Hartung. She joins us from Chico, California, where many of those who were displaced have sought refuge and Kaylee, the number of missing has skyrocketed. What is behind that and the alarming death toll?</p><p>KAYLEE HARTUNG, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, this fire when it was at its worst was burning through the equivalent of New York's Manhattan Island every three hours. There were extremely high winds, there was low humidity and warm conditions which really fueled this incredibly rapidly moving fire.</p><p>And so the people in the town of Paradise, a town with a population of approximately 25,000 people had very little notice when they needed to leave their hillside community. Now, when we speak about this number of missing, the number of people who were unaccounted for, authorities say because so many people were displaced, they estimate about 50,000 people evacuated from the fire zone, they say it is so difficult to manage this list as they are sourcing information from multiple different types of reports, whether that be 911 calls or e-mails, other incident reports.</p><p>So 993 names are on the list as it stands now. That number is absolutely startling, but authorities say that's 283 fewer names than there were on the list the day before. They say for all of the folks who may be afraid to look at the list because they might see someone's name on it, they ask them to take a look and if you see anyone's name on this list who shouldn't be on it, someone who is safe, please let them know because they are going to comb through it meticulously to ensure everyone is accounted for.</p><p>LU STOUT: Kaylee Hartung reporting for us live from Chico, California. Kaylee, thank you. Now, our meteorologist Chad Myers is at the CNN Weather Center. He has been monitoring conditions. He joins us now and Chad, what are the conditions like today?</p><p>CHAD MYERS, METEOROLOGIST, CNN: Not bad, although for the people that live there, the smoke is in the air and certainly the air is as hazardous as anything you can imagine in any industrialized country, even though there is no true industry there.</p><p>We are now 60,000 hectares here and even into the Woolsey fire, that is down by Malibu, that is beginning to clear up, almost completely contained here. The smoke is in the air, the smog just feels like you're breathing something and it's getting at the back of the people's throats here from Sacramento all the way down to Oakland and San Francisco, a very big populated areas just so much haze and smoke in the air, but rain is coming, but a lot of rain is coming and that's a good thing, bad thing. Good news, bad news kind of thing here.</p><p>We will see rain on Wednesday, we'll see another batch on Thursday afternoon and again maybe even into Friday. Some spots will pick up with the first roundabout of 100 millimeters of rain and then another 50 on top of that in just a couple of days. You think, well, that's great, and it is, it will put out the fire. The problem is all of this land here is about to turn into a giant mud slide. And I'll tell you why in just a second.</p><p>[08:05:01]</p><p>MYERS: Fifty millimeters to put out the fires, but the burn scars are the problem. The burn scars are the problem because the fire almost like painting a piece of wood won't allow the water to soak in. The surface below this super hot fire of the dirt, of the soil, turns hydrophobic. It actually seals it like searing a steak so that you sear the steak so that the juices don't come out.</p><p>If you sear the land, the juices or the rain doesn't soak in. So all of this ash that's in the way here will get all coagulated in to a slurry and slide right down the hill. And it's the sliding part that is going to be the problem.</p><p>On the bottom of these mudslides, sometimes these things can be doing 30 or 40 miles per hour and people can't get out of the way of these significant mudslides. We see them all the time. The subsurface soil will not allow any rain to soak in and so the mud just goes downhill. We call it a debris flow, but debris is lots of things -- trees, sticks, logs, sometimes even boulders can be pushed down with this very almost cement-like, wet cement- like structure here as it slides downhill, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Chad, really appreciate that you explained it. When we hear that rain is in the forecast, we think, oh, relief is on the way, but, no, in fire ravaged California, rain is a double-edged sword when there's too much of it. Chad Myers, a good explainer, as always, thank you. And to find out how you can help the victims of the California wildfires, you can check out our website, go to cnn.com/impact. You will find a list of vetted charities helping those in need.</p><p>In a new interview, US President Donald Trump says he is not really sure if the Saudi Crown Prince lied when he said he wasn't involved in Jamal Khashoggi's murder. This is at odds with the CIA assessment that the Crown Prince personally ordered the killing.</p><p>The Saudi journalist was killed on October 2nd inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. An audio recording by Mr. Trump's own intel officials now have obtained captured part of the murder, but the US President says there is no need for him to listen to it. Here is what he told Fox News.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't want to hear the tape. No reason for me to hear the tape.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Why don't you want to hear it, sir?</p><p>TRUMP: Because it's a suffering tape. It's a terrible tape. I've been fully briefed on it. There is no reason for me to hear it. In fact, I said to the people, should I? They said you really shouldn't. There is no reason. I know exactly - I know everything that went on with the tape and what happened.</p><p>WALLACE: And what happened?</p><p>TRUMP: It was very violent, very vicious and terrible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Let's bring in Jomana Karadsheh. She is live from outside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and Jomana, Trump doesn't want to listen to the tape? President Trump is distancing himself from the CIA assessment saying it's too early to know. Does this give the Saudis room to just brush off the latest allegations?</p><p>JOMANA KARADSHEH, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, you know, Kristie, the feeling has been that since day one, the administration and President Trump personally have at least publicly appeared not to want to push the Saudis too much and some feel that it was Turkey's strategy, this drip feed of leaks over the past few weeks that got us to this point where Saudi went from basically denying any knowledge of what happened to Jamal Khashoggi to now admitting that he was killed in the consulate.</p><p>But when it comes to the President's position it seems, you know, so many times we've heard him defending the relationship with Saudi Arabia, defending the Crown Prince and basically saying that there's no evidence. Take a listen to what the President said in an interview with Fox News.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We now know that some of the people closest to him, some of his closest advisers, were part of this. Question, did MBS lie to you, sir?</p><p>TRUMP: I don't - I don't know. You know, who can really know? But I can say this, he's got many people now that say he had no knowledge.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KARADSHEH: And, you know, some, Kristie, feel that the President and this administration just want the world to take Saudi Arabia's word for it, for what took place in this consulate, and then when you hear the President saying it is too early to reach conclusions, some are wondering, you know, they find it as a very baffling statement.</p><p>It's been 50 days almost since Jamal Khashoggi was killed. It has been nearly four weeks since the CIA Director, Gina Haspel was here in Turkey and the Turks shared the intelligence they had, she listened to the audio recording. Some are wondering why is it taking so long for this report from the administration for them to really come out with the conclusion and some here in this region also within the Turkish government, some officials feel that we're seeing some sort of stalling tactics from some within the administration as well as Saudi Arabia hoping that the longer this goes on that the world will simply move on and just forget about th case.</p><p>[08:10:08]</p><p>KARADSHEH: But that obviously is not happening right now, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, because more pressure will be applied from various sources, whether it's US Congress in the US or Turkish officials there where you're reporting. Jomana Karadsheh, reporting live. Thank you.</p><p>Now, there are growing signs of a ceasefire in the war in Yemen where a leader of the Iran-backed Houthian movement says his forces are ready to stop military operations against the Saudi-backed coalition. The comments followed diplomatic pressure on Saudi Arabia to engage in peace talks after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and now the Saudi King Salman says the Kingdom supports a political solution to the conflict.</p><p>CNN's Sam Kiley is in Abu Dhabi. He joins me now. Sam, the Houthi leader is ready for a ceasefire, but what about the Saudi-led coalition?</p><p>SAM KILEY, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, so far the Saudi-led coalition has said at least during a lull in the fighting last week that its attitude was that it was continuing operations at pace.</p><p>That was before Mohammed al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthis, the Iranian backed separatists in Yemen announced this overnight ceasefire. It's a unilateral offer to stop using long range missiles and stop using drones not only against targets inside Yemen, but also beyond the borders, notably into Saudi Arabia and here into the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Those were in part, part of a previous UN Resolution that called on the Houthis to stop these sorts of operations ahead of any previous - any possible ceasefire. Now today, there is an expectation that Britain will come up with a new UN Resolution, possibly requiring both sides, that was the idea at least over the weekend, to create a level of equality, if you like, in this requiring both the Saudis and the Houthis to simultaneously cease operations.</p><p>It will be interesting to see whether or not that appears in the final resolution or whether it gets watered down after protests by the Saudis, but there is a glimmer of hope here, Kristie, that towards the end of this month there could be some peace talks that could get under way in Sweden, not least because one of the major blocks to that had been the release of 50 wounded Houthis by the Saudis to allow them to go and seek medical help outside the country. The Saudis have now agreed to that.</p><p>So these things are inching in the right direction at a time when of course as you know the humanitarian crisis is catastrophic there.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, so peace is desperately needed. Sam Kiley reporting. Thank you. You're watching \"News Stream.\" Still ahead, we've breaking news for you. Nissan says its Chairman has been arrested after major allegations made by the company. What this means for the car giant? What is happening behind the scenes here with Carlos Ghosn, more on the investigation that led to this development. That is happening after the break.</p><p>Also ahead, the APEC Summit ends without its leaders agreeing on a joint communique. This is the very first time this has happened. Keep it here.</p><p>[08:15:00]</p><p>LU STOUT: Welcome back. Breaking news, in the past few minutes, Nissan has revealed that its Chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. Nissan accuses Carlos Ghosn of underreporting his compensation and the personal use of company assets.</p><p>Nissan says it's been going on for years. Board member Greg Kelly also has been accused in the scheme. Anna Stewart is in London and joins us now. Anna, it was an internal investigation that was launched and took place in the last few months that led us to this moment. Tell us more about the investigation and what more did it reveal about Carlos Ghosn leading to his arrest.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Exactly. We've just heard from the CEO of Nissan himself, he is giving a press conference right now and he gave us the information that Carlos Ghosn has been now been arrested as has Guy Kelly, the other executive involved in this.</p><p>And what they released today was a very clear statement actually in terms of sort of what the allegations are. It says, \"Over many years, both Ghosn and Kelly have been reporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock Exchange that were less than the actual amount.\" And in addition to that, Kristie, in regards to Ghosn, there are numerous other significant acts of misconduct which have been uncovered such as the personal use of company assets amongst other things.</p><p>So that's all we know at this stage in terms of what is the investigation. It was an internal investigation following a whistleblower report. Now of course, Nissan is cooperating with Japanese authorities and the CEO has been arrested. The question is now of course, will the board oust him, which of course we largely expect, not just from Nissan but from the other car companies that Carlos Ghosn heads up.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, Carlos Ghosn, he is a titan of industry. He is not just the chairman of Nissan, he is the Chairman and chief exec of Renault. He is the Chairman of Mitsubishi Motors. I know you've been following the stock price for at least a couple of these companies, and what does the arrest mean for all these firms?</p><p>STEWART: Well, quite right, Renault, as you can see from the share price, Kristie, double digits down this morning. The news broke just after Nissan closed for the day, but I can tell you that on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, those share prices are under pressure, too.</p><p>Now of course, shareholders wants more clarity. It's hard to understand how he could retain any of his positions on any of these boards, frankly, given the serious nature of the allegations against him. We're waiting to hear from Renault and from Mitsubishi. Of course, they are likely having crisis meetings with their boards now, but we should get more details in the hours to come.</p><p>LU STOUT: All right, Anna Stewart reporting live from London. We'll have more details in the first move with Julia Chatterly at the top of the hour. Anna, thank you.</p><p>Now, after a turbulent last few days in Westminster, the British Prime Minister is facing new challenges over her Brexit plan this week. The first began a couple of hours ago when Theresa May pitched her draft deal to British business leaders.</p><p>Now, the focus turns to the rest of the EU where there are key meetings scheduled. So what is motivating Britain's leader during these tough talks? Well, she explained this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOPHY RIDGE, ENGLISH BROADCAST JOURNALIST: Have you ever thought at any stage about just giving up? What's the point of this?</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: No, I haven't. Of course it's been a tough week. Actually, these negotiations have been tough right from the start, but they were always going to get even more difficult right towards the end when we are coming to that conclusion, but what I think is this isn't about me, it's actually about what's right for the people of this country. It's about what's in the national interest. That's what drives me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Tough request to answer, tough times for Theresa May. We've got Nina Dos Santos live in London. And Nina, let's talk about her pitch to the business community which she just gave earlier in the day. How much business support does the Prime Minister have for her Brexit plan?</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, for the moment she does seem to have the support of the biggest business lobby, which is the Confederation of British Industries that's been long agitating about the fact that there isn't enough clarity in the UK's Brexit negotiations and says that essentially although this deal is not perfect, it is some sign of the kind of stability that they would like to see, some visibility on the future framework that the UK would have with the EU after it leaves the EU in march of next year.</p><p>There's also been some clarity over the last few days that seems to have been given when it comes to this so-called transition period. If the UK leaves and hasn't yet got a deal with the EU, it seems as though instead of that being an unlimited transition period, which is a total redline for many Brexiteers, the government has firmed up the language on that to make sure the transition period lasts no longer than January 2022.</p><p>As you pointed out, Theresa May is going to be heading over to Brussels to try and again, sell this deal to the community over there. She's going to be meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker she said in the next few days, largely not to talk about the withdrawal agreement because she says this document that of course has caused so much ire in Westminster over the last several days that is largely the withdrawal document.</p><p>[08:20:05]</p><p>DOS SANTOS: That she believes is said and done, it's the best deal they are going to get. But instead, the focus is going to shift towards the future political declaration, the future political relationship and economic relationship that the UK will have with the EU once it has left the European Union.</p><p>And when it comes to the voices that are coming back from Brussels, again, the message has been we have agreed what we've agreed with Theresa May, Theresa May saying to her MPs who as yet haven't had the numbers to mount a big leadership challenge against her, changing me is not going to achieve anything. This is the best deal that we can get, Kristie?</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, testing times for her and her Brexit plan. Nina dos Santos reporting. Nina, thank you. This year's APEC summit, usually a relatively tame affair ended in dramatic fashion. For the first time in its 25-year history, the meeting wrapped up without a formal joint statement. That's because according to a source within the meeting, China wasn't happy with some of the wording in a paragraph about trade.</p><p>Tensions between Washington and Beijing, they were front and center throughout the summit and that was evident in speeches by the Chinese President and the US Vice President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have great respect for President Xi and great respect for China. But in the President's words, China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years. Those days are over.</p><p>XI JINPING, PRESIDENT OF CHINA (Through a translator): History tells us to take the road of confrontation, whether it's in the form of a cold war, open war or trade war, it will produce no winners.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, the disagreement over the wording in the communique apparently caused a scene at the Papua New Guinea Foreign Minister's office. Now for more, let's go straight to Ivan Watson. And Ivan, usually the APEC Summit ends with a communique and a photo op with the world leaders in matching tunics. That didn't happen in this time. What went wrong?</p><p>IVAN WATSON, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Yes, there was a failure to achieve consensus here. As the Prime Minister of the host country, Papua New Guinea put it, it was because of the two big giants, China and the US, the two world's largest economies could not see eye to eye, but there was also some drama on the sidelines.</p><p>A source familiar with the incident tells CNN that at one point on Saturday in the capital there, four Chinese diplomats barged into the office of Papua New Guinea's Foreign Minister after he had rejected a request from them to help draw up the final draft communique. He was arguing that he had to be objective as the host country and couldn't have their influence.</p><p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry has denied that and claimed that these are rumors aimed at trying to spoil the Chinese Papua New Guinea relationship. That was a bit of a sidebar to a bigger issue and that was that the 21 countries couldn't come to an agreement. A US official tells CNN that China was alone against the other 20 countries because of a different - difference of agreement over visions of trade going into the future. Kristie?</p><p>LU STOUT: A bizarre turn of events at the host nation for APEC this year. Ivan, just how heated did it get between Xi Jinping and Mike Pence at APEC.</p><p>WATSON: They met twice and evidently they didn't swing at each other or anything. They did speak, but in their speeches they did make some pretty blunt criticism at each other with Xi Jinping talking about the need for multilateralism or rules-based system, for tolerance and warning against protectionism, whereas Mike Pence went very much against one of Xi Jinping's pet projects, his One Belt, One Road initiative. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE: Know that the United States offers a better option. We don't drown our partners in a sea of debt, we don't coerce to compromise your independence, the United States deals openly and fairly, we do not offer a constricting belt or a one-way road.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATSON: So he is criticizing here China's One Belt, One Road initiative where China has lavished huge amounts of money around the world on these infrastructure projects and Pence basically arguing that this is a debt trap that will take away nations' sovereignty. Xi in his own speech said, no, there is no hidden agenda to our One Belt, One Road initiative. You can see the jockeying here, Kristie, because Pence came to this meeting talking about joint investment projects and infrastructure in the Asia- Pacific region that would be done with Australia, for example, or Japan. Promising to bring electricity to Papua New Guinea which has issues with power, and also announcing that there would be the creation of a new trilateral military base on Papua New Guinea's island of Manus with the Australians and Papua New Guinea.</p><p>[08:25:09]</p><p>WATSON: So you can see the competition shaking out here in addition to a trade war where both countries have levied tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of each other's goods. There could be an off ramp and Pence himself suggested this at the upcoming G-20 summit in Argentina where President Trump and Xi Jinping will meet face-to-face, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, for that, we will wait and see. But wow, for APEC this year, no communique, no consensus just open feuding. Incredible. Ivan Watson, reporting, thank you.</p><p>Now, not long ago Shenzhen was a poor fishing village on the southern coast of China, but today it is one and has been for a few years the fastest growing cities on the planet. Matt Rivers takes us on a tour of China's Silicon Valley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Forty years ago, none of this existed. The buildings, roads, none of it. Shenzhen was a little more than a poor fishing village on China's southern coast, but today, it's home to 12 million people and growing. It's the world's greatest or biggest boomtown. That's because it's one of the top centers of Chinese wealth, and this is the man who started it all.</p><p>That's Deng Xiaoping who led China from the late '70s to the early' '90s, and it was his idea to open up China to the rest of the world. He did that in part by creating with these special economic zones which included Shenzhen. They got preferential tax treatment, more direct foreign investment, and that more than anything else helped create all this.</p><p>Western firms flooded in like China's first McDonalds and factories popped up churning out boatloads of cheap electronics and consumer goods and amongst them were a whole bunch of knock offs until manufacturers here realized.</p><p>ANDREW HUANG, AUTHOR, THE HARDWARE HACKER: You can't really actually make a big profit just pure copying, so they learned how to actually add value to the designs, so now they're coming up with like new designs.</p><p>RIVERS: Tech startups lured by easy access to the global supply chain of gadgets flourished in this warmer less polluted city far away from Beijing. Innovating in AI, robotics and electric vehicles. This isn't the stuff of the future. It's happening right now from facial recognition --</p><p>So right now when you walk into the subway here, they take a picture of your face. There's lights there. They take a picture of you every time you walk under the subway.</p><p>To an entire market, the world's largest operating almost entirely almost cash and card free.</p><p>So every little store here that you can buy fruit or whatever you need, you go on your phone, you scan a QR code like this one, so this is WeChat Pay and that's that, simple as that. I just bought fruit from this woman.</p><p>All of these innovations supported by the government in a bid to rebrand \"Made in China\" to \"Created in China.\" To be sure, much of the world is wary of China's rise. Can it truly challenge the US for economic dominance? That's not clear. But if it does, Shenzhen, the city built in just a single generation will likely be the force that makes it happen. Matt Rivers, CNN, Shenzhen.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: The Chinese artist and activist, Ai Weiwei once said that, \"Everything is art, everything is politics.\" Now that is especially true if you work somewhere where freedom of speech is not taken for granted like Taiwan, but it's comments made outside the cutting room from Fu Yuea, a director from Taiwan that are stirring up deep feelings on both sides of the Taiwan strait. Take a listen to what she said at the Golden Horse Film Awards this weekend. It's the Chinese language equivalent of the Oscars.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FU YUET, TAIWANESE FILM DIRECTOR (Through a translator): I really hope our country will one day be treated as a genuine independent entity. This is my biggest wish as a Taiwanese.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, under its One China policy, Beijing considers Taiwan part of its territory even though it is self-governed and democratic. Taiwan's leader has spoken out saying this, quote, \"I am proud of the Golden Horse Ceremony yesterday because it accentuated how Taiwan is different from China.\" You're watching \"News Stream.\" Still to come, President Trump is speaking out about the Russia probe. What he's saying about his written answers to Special Counsel Mueller's questions, next.</p><p>[08:30:41]</p><p>LU STOUT: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching \"News Stream\" and these are your world headlines. Nissan says it's Chairman, Carlos Ghosn has been arrested after allegations by the company of serious misconduct. Nissan accuses him of underreporting his compensation and the personal use of company assets. Board member, Greg Kelly is also accused in the alleged scheme and we have not yet heard a response from either of them.</p><p>California officials say the deadliest fire in the state's history won't be contained for another 11 days. At least 77 people have been killed; nearly 1,000 remain missing in the devastating Campfire. Cooler temperatures and rain are in the forecast for the devastated region.</p><p>Israel's education minister says he is not resigning despite major divisions in the government. Many Israelis are upset that Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed to a ceasefire with Hamas last week. His Defense Minister quit and the Prime Minister's base calls for a snap election. Mr. Netanyahu says that would be irresponsible.</p><p>In a new interview with Fox News, US President Donald Trump said who can really know if the Saudi Crown Prince lied when he said he wasn't involved in Jamal Khashoggi's murder. This is at odds with a CIA assessment that the Crown Prince personally ordered the killing of the Saudi journalist last month. Mr. Trump says he will be getting a very full report on Tuesday.</p><p>In the same interview, President Trump spoke out about the Mueller probe and criticism over the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting Attorney General. In the past, Whitaker has been critical of the Russia probe. Here is what Mr. Trump told Fox News about Whitaker's oversight of the special counsel.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: If Whitaker decides in any way to limit or curtail the Mueller investigation, are you okay with that?</p><p>TRUMP: Look, it's going to be up to him. I think he's very well aware politically, I think he is astute politically. He is a very smart person, a very respected person, he's going to do what's right. I really believe he's going to do what's right.</p><p>WALLACE: But you won't overrule him if he decides to curtail.</p><p>TRUMP: I would not get involved.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: CNN's senior Washington correspondent, Joe Johns is at the White House. He joins us now. Joe, good to see you. Will President Trump sit down for an interview with the special counsel? What did he say to Fox?</p><p>JOE JOHNS, SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPODENT, CNN: Well, that's certainly the farthest the President has gone and it's pretty strong language, too, isn't it? The President has said in the past that he had concerns about sitting down with Mueller, but now just listen. Listen so what the President had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We gave very, very complete answers to a lot of questions that I shouldn't have even been asked and I think that should solve the problem. I hope it solves the problem. If it doesn't, you know, I will be told and we will make a decision at that time. But probably, this is the end.</p><p>WALLACE: No interview.</p><p>TRUMP: I think we've wasted enough time on this witch-hunt and answer is probably - we are finished.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:35:05]</p><p>JOHNS: \"Probably, we are finished.\" Now, if you talk to power lawyers around Washington, DC, and I have, many of them have said they would never allow the President of the United States to sit down with the special counsel, simply because of the legal exposure that's involved when it comes to things like perjury or obstruction of justice.</p><p>Also, the President has been known to be a bit challenged by the truth. So there's that as well. Difficult to see how an attorney would willingly allow the President to sit down and answer questions, impromptu, with the special counsel's office, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: This was a wide-ranging interview, it generated a lot of headlines. Also in the interview, President Trump unloaded on retired Admiral William McRaven, former head of Special Operations Command. What did he say?</p><p>JOHNS: Essentially reducing the man who spear-headed or was the architect for the capture of Saddam Hussein as well as the killing of Osama bin Laden, reducing his reputation to a political hack. Listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: McRaven, retired Admiral, Navy SEAL, 37 years, former head of US Special operations.</p><p>TRUMP: Hillary Clinton fan.</p><p>WALLACE: Special operations --</p><p>TRUMP: Excuse me. Hillary Clinton fan.</p><p>WALLACE: ... who led the operations, commanded the operations, that took down Saddam Hussein and that killed Osama bin Laden says that your sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy in his lifetime.</p><p>TRUMP: Okay, he is a Hillary Clinton backer and an Obama backer and frankly --</p><p>WALLACE: But he was a Navy SEAL for 37 years.</p><p>TRUMP: Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS: That is the world of the President of the United States. People who oppose or criticize him are seen to do it because it is motivated by politics, but people who support the President do it because of altruism. Back to you.</p><p>LU STOUT: This interview just revealed so much about the US President. Joe Johns reporting live from the White House. Joe, thank you.</p><p>After a contentious Senate race and recount, Florida will send a new senator to Washington.

In this edition of CNN's \"Going Green\" we meet an inspiring environmentalist trying to turn London into one of the first's urban national park. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>DAN RAVEN-ELLISON, GUERRILLA GEOGRAPHER AND CREATIVE EXPLORER: I absolutely love being in nature. Throughout London, there are thousands of parks like this one with this beautiful tree canopy and I love the curvature of the branches, the dappled light coming through the trees, the sound of wind going through the branches. I'm Dan Raven-Ellison, working to make London a national park city.</p><p>When most people think of national parks, they think of deserts or rain forests or mountains marlins, but I have explored all of the UK's national parks and I noticed that maybe something is missing and that's a major urban area.</p><p>We share the city with 15,000 other species of wildlife and I don't think that the urban life is worth any less, I don't think an urban red fox is worth less than an arctic fox or a desert fox, it's just a red fox.</p><p>I think people are awakening to the fact that we need to have a better relationship with nature, for our own health and wellbeing, for the health and wellbeing of wildlife populations, but we also need to have a better relationship with nature for the health and resilience of our cities to tackle climate change.</p><p>I started the campaign to make London a national park city five years ago now and when I started out, I think that most people thought that I was completely bonkers, but I'm delighted to share after all of this work, London is going to be launched as the world's first national park city in July 2019.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Wow, that is a vision for London I'd love to see happen not just there, but in so many places, urban centers around the world. Now, when you plan to visit Disneyland, you accept that waiting in line, that's just part of the deal, but at Disneyland Japan, the waiting time to meet Mickey Mouse on Sunday reached nightmarish proportions.</p><p>Now, in the morning on Sunday this sign warned visitors of a 660-minute wait to explore Mickey's House and to take a picture with the character. That's 11 hours. Later in the day, it shortened to a mere three hours.

After  scorching about 61,000 hectares in the last week and a half, the so-called  Campfire is likely to burn for 11 more days before it's finally contained,  and while the financial cost is still being tallied, the loss of human life  that is incalculable.  At least 80 people have been killed in this fire and  another fire in the south of the state.  </p><p>Nearly 1,000 people remain missing.  Community boards like this one with  photos and contact information are now popping up.  Survivors frantically  are searching for their loved ones.  The parking lot of this Walmart just  10 miles from the fire's epicenter has been transformed into this, a tent  city, after local shelters have reached full capacity.  And amid all the  devastation, one church is making this vow, \"We will rise from the ashes.\"  </p><p>Let's get straight to CNN's Kaylee Hartung.  She joins us from Chico,  California, where many of those who were displaced have sought refuge and  Kaylee, the number of missing has skyrocketed.  What is behind that and the  alarming death toll?  </p><p>KAYLEE HARTUNG, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, this fire when it was at its  worst was burning through the equivalent of New York's Manhattan Island  every three hours.  There were extremely high winds, there was low humidity  and warm conditions which really fueled this incredibly rapidly moving  fire.  </p><p>And so the people in the town of Paradise, a town with a population of  approximately 25,000 people had very little notice when they needed to  leave their hillside community.  Now, when we speak about this number of  missing, the number of people who were unaccounted for, authorities say  because so many people were displaced, they estimate about 50,000 people  evacuated from the fire zone, they say it is so difficult to manage this  list as they are sourcing information from multiple different types of  reports, whether that be 911 calls or e-mails, other incident reports.  </p><p>So 993 names are on the list as it stands now.  That number is absolutely  startling, but authorities say that's 283 fewer names than there were on  the list the day before.  They say for all of the folks who may be afraid  to look at the list because they might see someone's name on it, they ask  them to take a look and if you see anyone's name on this list who shouldn't  be on it, someone who is safe, please let them know because they are going  to comb through it meticulously to ensure everyone is accounted for.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Kaylee Hartung reporting for us live from Chico, California.   Kaylee, thank you.  Now, our meteorologist Chad Myers is at the CNN Weather  Center.  He has been monitoring conditions.  He joins us now and Chad, what  are the conditions like today?  </p><p>CHAD MYERS, METEOROLOGIST, CNN:  Not bad, although for the people that live  there, the smoke is in the air and certainly the air is as hazardous as  anything you can imagine in any industrialized country, even though there  is no true industry there.  </p><p>We are now 60,000 hectares here and even into the Woolsey fire, that is  down by Malibu, that is beginning to clear up, almost completely contained  here.  The smoke is in the air, the smog just feels like you're breathing  something and it's getting at the back of the people's throats here from  Sacramento all the way down to Oakland and San Francisco, a very big  populated areas just so much haze and smoke in the air, but rain is coming,  but a lot of rain is coming and that's a good thing, bad thing.  Good news,  bad news kind of thing here.  </p><p>We will see rain on Wednesday, we'll see another batch on Thursday  afternoon and again maybe even into Friday.  Some spots will pick up with  the first roundabout of 100 millimeters of rain and then another 50 on top  of that in just a couple of days.  You think, well, that's great, and it  is, it will put out the fire.  The problem is all of this land here is  about to turn into a giant mud slide.  And I'll tell you why in just a  second.  </p><p>[08:05:01]  </p><p>MYERS:  Fifty millimeters to put out the fires, but the burn scars are the  problem.  The burn scars are the problem because the fire almost like  painting a piece of wood won't allow the water to soak in.  The surface  below this super hot fire of the dirt, of the soil, turns hydrophobic.  It  actually seals it like searing a steak so that you sear the steak so that  the juices don't come out.  </p><p>If you sear the land, the juices or the rain doesn't soak in.  So all of  this ash that's in the way here will get all coagulated in to a slurry and  slide right down the hill.  And it's the sliding part that is going to be  the problem.  </p><p>On the bottom of these mudslides, sometimes these things can be doing 30 or  40 miles per hour and people can't get out of the way of these significant  mudslides.  We see them all the time.  The subsurface soil will not allow  any rain to soak in and so the mud just goes downhill.  We call it a debris  flow, but debris is lots of things -- trees, sticks, logs, sometimes even  boulders can be pushed down with this very almost cement-like, wet cement- like structure here as it slides downhill, Kristie.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Chad, really appreciate that you explained it.  When we hear  that rain is in the forecast, we think, oh, relief is on the way, but, no,  in fire ravaged California, rain is a double-edged sword when there's too  much of it.  Chad Myers, a good explainer, as always, thank you.  And to  find out how you can help the victims of the California wildfires, you can  check out our website, go to cnn.com/impact.  You will find a list of  vetted charities helping those in need.  </p><p>In a new interview, US President Donald Trump says he is not really sure if  the Saudi Crown Prince lied when he said he wasn't involved in Jamal  Khashoggi's murder.  This is at odds with the CIA assessment that the Crown  Prince personally ordered the killing.  </p><p>The Saudi journalist was killed on October 2nd inside the Saudi consulate  in Istanbul.  An audio recording by Mr. Trump's own intel officials now  have obtained captured part of the murder, but the US President  says there  is no need for him to listen to it.  Here is what he told Fox News.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I don't want to hear the  tape.  No reason for me to hear the tape.  </p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Why don't you want to hear it, sir?  </p><p>TRUMP:  Because it's a suffering tape.  It's a terrible tape.  I've been  fully briefed on it.  There is no reason for me to hear it.  In fact, I  said to the people, should I?  They said you really shouldn't.  There is no  reason.  I know exactly - I know everything that went on with the tape and  what happened.  </p><p>WALLACE:  And what happened?  </p><p>TRUMP:  It was very violent, very vicious and terrible.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Let's bring in Jomana Karadsheh.  She is live from outside the  Saudi consulate in Istanbul and Jomana, Trump doesn't want to listen to the  tape?  President Trump is distancing himself from the CIA assessment saying  it's too early to know.  Does this give the Saudis room to just brush off  the latest allegations?  </p><p>JOMANA KARADSHEH, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, you know, Kristie, the feeling  has been that since day one, the administration and President Trump  personally have at least publicly appeared not to want to push the Saudis  too much and some feel that it was Turkey's strategy, this drip feed of  leaks over the past few weeks that got us to this point where Saudi went  from basically denying any knowledge of what happened to Jamal Khashoggi to  now admitting that he was killed in the consulate.  </p><p>But when it comes to the President's position it seems, you know, so many  times we've heard him defending the relationship with Saudi Arabia,  defending the Crown Prince and basically saying that there's no evidence.   Take a listen to what the President said in an interview with Fox News.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  We now know that some of the people closest to him, some of his  closest advisers, were part of this.  Question, did MBS lie to you, sir?  </p><p>TRUMP:  I don't - I don't know.  You know, who can really know?  But I can  say this, he's got many people now that say he had no knowledge.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>KARADSHEH:  And, you know, some, Kristie, feel that the President and this  administration just want the world to take Saudi Arabia's word for it, for  what took place in this consulate, and then when you hear the President  saying it is too early to reach conclusions, some are wondering, you know,  they find it as a very baffling statement.  </p><p>It's been 50 days almost since Jamal Khashoggi was killed.  It has been  nearly four weeks since the CIA Director, Gina Haspel was here in Turkey  and the Turks shared the intelligence they had, she listened to the audio  recording.  Some are wondering why is it taking so long for this report  from the administration for them to really come out with the conclusion and  some here in this region also within the Turkish government, some officials  feel that we're seeing some sort of stalling tactics from some within the  administration as well as Saudi Arabia hoping that the longer this goes on  that the world will simply move on and just forget about th case.  </p><p>[08:10:08]  </p><p>KARADSHEH:  But that obviously is not happening right now, Kristie.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, because more pressure will be applied from various sources,  whether it's US Congress in the US or Turkish officials there where you're  reporting.  Jomana Karadsheh, reporting live.  Thank you.  </p><p>Now, there are growing signs of a ceasefire in the war in Yemen where a  leader of the Iran-backed Houthian movement says his forces are ready to  stop military operations against the Saudi-backed coalition.  The comments  followed diplomatic pressure on Saudi Arabia to engage in peace talks after  the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and now the Saudi King Salman says the  Kingdom supports a political solution to the conflict.  </p><p>CNN's Sam Kiley is in Abu Dhabi.  He joins me now.  Sam, the Houthi leader  is ready for a ceasefire, but what about the Saudi-led coalition?  </p><p>SAM KILEY, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:   Well, so far the  Saudi-led coalition has said at least during a lull in the fighting last  week that its attitude was that it was continuing operations at pace.  </p><p>That was before Mohammed al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthis, the Iranian  backed separatists in Yemen announced this overnight ceasefire.  It's a  unilateral offer to stop using long range missiles and stop using drones  not only against targets inside Yemen, but also beyond the borders, notably  into Saudi Arabia and here into the United Arab Emirates.  </p><p>Those were in part, part of a previous UN Resolution that called on the  Houthis to stop these sorts of operations ahead of any previous - any  possible ceasefire.  Now today, there is an expectation that Britain will  come up with a new UN Resolution, possibly requiring both sides, that was  the idea at least over the weekend, to create a level of equality, if you  like, in this requiring both the Saudis and the Houthis to simultaneously  cease operations.  </p><p>It will be interesting to see whether or not that appears in the final  resolution or whether it gets watered down after protests by the Saudis,  but there is a glimmer of hope here, Kristie, that towards the end of this  month there could be some peace talks that could get under way in Sweden,  not least because one of the major blocks to that had been the release of  50 wounded Houthis by the Saudis to allow them to go and seek medical help  outside the country.  The Saudis have now agreed to that.  </p><p>So these things are inching in the right direction at a time when of course  as you know the humanitarian crisis is catastrophic there.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, so peace is desperately needed.  Sam Kiley reporting.   Thank you.  You're watching \"News Stream.\"  Still ahead, we've breaking  news for you.  Nissan says its Chairman has been arrested after major  allegations made by the company.  What this means for the car giant?  What  is happening behind the scenes here with Carlos Ghosn, more on the  investigation that led to this development.  That is happening after the  break.  </p><p>Also ahead, the APEC Summit ends without its leaders agreeing on a joint  communique.  This is the very first time this has happened.  Keep it here.  </p><p>[08:15:00]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Welcome back.  Breaking news, in the past few minutes, Nissan  has revealed that its Chairman has been arrested after allegations of  serious misconduct.  Nissan accuses Carlos Ghosn of underreporting his  compensation and the personal use of company assets.  </p><p>Nissan says it's been going on for years.  Board member Greg Kelly also has  been accused in the scheme.  Anna Stewart is in London and joins us now.   Anna, it was an internal investigation that was launched and took place in  the last few months that led us to this moment.  Tell us more about the  investigation and what more did it reveal about Carlos Ghosn leading to his  arrest.  </p><p>ANNA STEWART, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Exactly.  We've just heard from the CEO  of Nissan himself, he is giving a press conference right now and he gave us  the information that Carlos Ghosn has been now been arrested as has Guy  Kelly, the other executive involved in this.  </p><p>And what they released today was a very clear statement actually in terms  of sort of what the allegations are.  It says, \"Over many years, both Ghosn  and Kelly have been reporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock  Exchange that were less than the actual amount.\"  And in addition to that,  Kristie, in regards to Ghosn, there are numerous other significant acts of  misconduct which have been uncovered such as the personal use of company  assets amongst other things.  </p><p>So that's all we know at this stage in terms of what is the investigation.   It was an internal investigation following a whistleblower report.  Now of  course, Nissan is cooperating with Japanese authorities and the CEO has  been arrested.  The question is now of course, will the board oust him,  which of course we largely expect, not just from Nissan but from the other  car companies that Carlos Ghosn heads up.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, Carlos Ghosn, he is a titan of industry.  He is not just  the chairman of Nissan, he is the Chairman and chief exec of Renault.  He  is the Chairman of Mitsubishi Motors.  I know you've been following the  stock price for at least a couple of these companies, and what does the  arrest mean for all these firms?  </p><p>STEWART:  Well, quite right, Renault, as you can see from the share price,  Kristie, double digits down this morning.  The news broke just after Nissan  closed for the day, but I can tell you that on the Frankfurt Stock  Exchange, those share prices are under pressure, too.  </p><p>Now of course, shareholders wants more clarity.  It's hard to understand  how he could retain any of his positions on any of these boards, frankly,  given the serious nature of the allegations against him.  We're waiting to  hear from Renault and from Mitsubishi.  Of course, they are likely having  crisis meetings with their boards now, but we should get more details in  the hours to come.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  All right, Anna Stewart reporting live from London.  We'll have  more details in the first move with Julia Chatterly at the top of the hour.   Anna, thank you.  </p><p>Now, after a turbulent last few days in Westminster, the British Prime  Minister is facing new challenges over her Brexit plan this week.  The  first began a couple of hours ago when Theresa May pitched her draft deal  to British business leaders.  </p><p>Now, the focus turns to the rest of the EU where there are key meetings  scheduled.  So what is motivating Britain's leader during these tough  talks?  Well, she explained this weekend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SOPHY RIDGE, ENGLISH BROADCAST JOURNALIST:  Have you ever thought at any  stage about just giving up?  What's the point of this?  </p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  No, I haven't.  Of course it's been a  tough week.  Actually, these negotiations have been tough right from the  start, but they were always going to get even more difficult right towards  the end when we are coming to that conclusion, but what I think is this  isn't about me, it's actually about what's right for the people of this  country.  It's about what's in the national interest.  That's what drives  me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Tough request to answer, tough times for Theresa May.  We've got  Nina Dos Santos live in London.  And Nina, let's talk about her pitch to  the business community which she just gave earlier in the day.  How much  business support does the Prime Minister have for her Brexit plan?  </p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, for the moment she does seem to  have the support of the biggest business lobby, which is the Confederation  of British Industries that's been long agitating about the fact that there  isn't enough clarity in the UK's Brexit negotiations and says that  essentially although this deal is not perfect, it is some sign of the kind  of stability that they would like to see, some visibility on the future  framework that the UK would have with the EU after it leaves the EU in  march of next year.  </p><p>There's also been some clarity over the last few days that seems to have  been given when it comes to this so-called transition period.  If the UK  leaves and hasn't yet got a deal with the EU, it seems as though instead of  that being an unlimited transition period, which is a total redline for  many Brexiteers, the government has firmed up the language on that to make  sure the transition period lasts no longer than January 2022.  </p><p>As you pointed out, Theresa May is going to be heading over to Brussels to  try and again, sell this deal to the community over there.  She's going to  be meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker she said in the next few days, largely  not to talk about the withdrawal agreement because she says this document  that of course has caused so much ire in Westminster over the last several  days that is largely the withdrawal document.  </p><p>[08:20:05]  </p><p>DOS SANTOS:  That she believes is said and done, it's the best deal they  are going to get.  But instead, the focus is going to shift towards the  future political declaration, the future political relationship and  economic relationship that the UK will have with the EU once it has left  the European Union.  </p><p>And when it comes to the voices that are coming back from Brussels, again,  the message has been we have agreed what we've agreed with Theresa May,  Theresa May saying to her MPs who as yet haven't had the numbers to mount a  big leadership challenge against her, changing me is not  going to achieve  anything.  This is the best deal that we can get, Kristie?  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, testing times for her and her Brexit plan.  Nina dos Santos  reporting.  Nina, thank you.  This year's APEC summit, usually a relatively  tame affair ended in dramatic fashion.  For the first time in its 25-year  history, the meeting wrapped up without a formal joint statement.  That's  because according to a source within the meeting, China wasn't happy with  some of the wording in a paragraph about trade.  </p><p>Tensions between Washington and Beijing, they were front and center  throughout the summit and that was evident in speeches by the Chinese  President and the US Vice President.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have great respect for  President Xi and great respect for China.  But in the President's words,  China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.  Those  days are over.  </p><p>XI JINPING, PRESIDENT OF CHINA (Through a translator):  History tells us to  take the road of confrontation, whether it's in the form of a cold war,  open war or trade war, it will produce no winners.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, the disagreement over the wording in the communique  apparently caused a scene at the Papua New Guinea Foreign Minister's  office.  Now for more, let's go straight to Ivan Watson.  And Ivan, usually  the APEC Summit ends with a communique and a photo op with the world  leaders in matching tunics.  That didn't happen in this time.  What went  wrong?  </p><p>IVAN WATSON, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, there was a  failure to achieve consensus here.  As the Prime Minister of the host  country, Papua New Guinea put it, it was  because of the two big giants,  China and the US, the two world's largest economies could not see eye to  eye, but there was also some drama on the sidelines.  </p><p>A source familiar with the incident tells CNN that at one point on Saturday  in the capital there, four Chinese diplomats barged into the office of  Papua New Guinea's Foreign Minister after he had rejected a request from  them to help draw up the final draft communique.  He was arguing that he  had to be objective as the host country and couldn't have their influence.  </p><p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry has denied that and claimed that these are  rumors aimed at trying to spoil the Chinese Papua New Guinea relationship.   That was a bit of a sidebar to a bigger issue and that was that the 21  countries couldn't come to an agreement.  A US official tells CNN that  China was alone against the other 20 countries because of a different -  difference of  agreement over visions of trade going into the future.   Kristie?  </p><p>LU STOUT:  A bizarre turn of events at the host nation for APEC this year.   Ivan, just how heated did it get between Xi Jinping and Mike Pence at APEC.   </p><p>WATSON:  They met twice and evidently they didn't swing at each other or  anything.  They did speak, but in their speeches they did make some pretty  blunt criticism at each other with Xi Jinping talking about the need for  multilateralism or rules-based system, for tolerance and warning against  protectionism, whereas Mike Pence went very much against one of Xi  Jinping's pet projects, his One Belt, One Road initiative.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>PENCE:  Know that the United States offers a better option.  We don't drown  our partners in a sea of debt, we don't coerce to compromise your  independence, the United States deals openly and fairly, we do not offer a  constricting belt or a one-way road.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WATSON:  So he is criticizing here China's One Belt, One Road initiative  where China has lavished huge amounts of money around the world on these  infrastructure projects and Pence basically arguing that this is a debt  trap that will take away nations' sovereignty.  Xi in his own speech said,  no, there is no hidden agenda to our One Belt, One Road initiative.  You  can see the jockeying here, Kristie, because Pence came to this meeting  talking about joint investment projects and infrastructure in the Asia- Pacific region that would be done with Australia, for example, or Japan.   Promising to bring electricity to Papua New Guinea which has issues with  power, and also announcing that there would be the creation of a new  trilateral military base on Papua New Guinea's island of Manus with the  Australians and Papua New Guinea.  </p><p>[08:25:09]  </p><p>WATSON:  So you can see the competition shaking out here in addition to a  trade war where both countries have levied tariffs on hundreds of billions  of dollars' worth of each other's goods.  There could be an off ramp and  Pence himself suggested this at the upcoming G-20 summit in Argentina where  President Trump and Xi Jinping will meet face-to-face, Kristie.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, for that, we will wait and see.  But wow, for APEC this  year, no communique, no consensus just open feuding.  Incredible.  Ivan  Watson, reporting, thank you.  </p><p>Now, not long ago Shenzhen was a poor fishing village on the southern coast  of China, but today it is one and has been for a few years the fastest  growing cities on the planet.  Matt Rivers takes us on a tour of China's  Silicon Valley.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>MATT RIVERS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Forty years ago, none of this existed.   The buildings, roads, none of it.  Shenzhen was a little more than a poor  fishing village on China's southern coast, but today, it's home to 12  million people and growing.  It's the world's greatest or biggest boomtown.   That's because it's one of the top centers of Chinese wealth, and this is  the man who started it all.  </p><p>That's Deng Xiaoping who led China from the late '70s to the early' '90s,  and it was his idea to open up China to the rest of the world.  He did that  in part by creating with these special economic zones which included  Shenzhen.  They got preferential tax treatment, more direct foreign  investment, and that more than anything else helped create all this.  </p><p>Western firms flooded in like China's first McDonalds and factories popped  up churning out boatloads of cheap electronics and consumer goods and  amongst them were a whole bunch of knock offs until manufacturers here  realized.  </p><p>ANDREW HUANG, AUTHOR, THE HARDWARE HACKER:  You can't really actually make  a big profit just pure copying, so they learned how to actually add value  to the designs, so now they're coming up with like new designs.  </p><p>RIVERS:  Tech startups lured by easy access to the global supply chain of  gadgets flourished in this warmer less polluted city far away from Beijing.   Innovating in AI, robotics and electric vehicles.  This isn't the stuff of  the future.  It's happening right now from facial recognition --  </p><p>So right now when you walk into the subway here, they take a picture of  your face.  There's lights there.  They take a picture of you every time  you walk under the subway.  </p><p>To an entire market, the world's largest operating almost entirely almost  cash and card free.  </p><p>So every little store here that you can buy fruit or whatever you need, you  go on your phone, you scan a QR code like this one, so this is WeChat Pay  and that's that, simple as that.  I just bought fruit from this woman.  </p><p>All of these innovations supported by the government in a bid to rebrand  \"Made in China\" to \"Created in China.\"  To be sure, much of the world is  wary of China's rise.  Can it truly challenge the US for economic  dominance?  That's not clear.  But if it does, Shenzhen, the city built in  just a single generation will likely be the force that makes it happen.   Matt Rivers, CNN, Shenzhen.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  The Chinese artist and activist, Ai Weiwei once said that,  \"Everything is art, everything is politics.\"  Now that is especially true  if you work somewhere where freedom of speech is not taken for granted like  Taiwan, but it's comments made outside the cutting room from Fu Yuea, a  director from Taiwan that are stirring up deep feelings on both sides of  the Taiwan  strait.  Take a listen to what she said at the Golden Horse  Film Awards this weekend.  It's the Chinese language equivalent of the  Oscars.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>FU YUET, TAIWANESE FILM DIRECTOR (Through a translator):  I really hope our  country will one day be treated as a genuine independent entity.  This is  my biggest wish as a Taiwanese.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, under its One China policy, Beijing considers Taiwan part  of its territory even though it is self-governed and democratic.  Taiwan's  leader has spoken out saying this, quote, \"I am proud of the Golden Horse  Ceremony yesterday because it accentuated how Taiwan is different from  China.\"  You're watching \"News Stream.\"  Still to come, President Trump is  speaking out about the Russia probe.  What he's saying about his written  answers to Special Counsel Mueller's questions, next.  </p><p>[08:30:41]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong.  You're watching \"News  Stream\" and these are your world headlines.   Nissan says it's Chairman,  Carlos Ghosn has been arrested after allegations by the company of serious  misconduct.  Nissan accuses him of underreporting his compensation and the  personal use of company assets.  Board member, Greg Kelly is also accused  in the alleged scheme and we have not yet heard a response from either of  them.  </p><p>California officials say the deadliest fire in the state's history won't be  contained for another 11 days.  At least 77 people have been killed; nearly  1,000 remain missing in the devastating Campfire.  Cooler temperatures and  rain are in the forecast for the devastated region.  </p><p>Israel's education minister says he is not resigning despite major  divisions in the government.  Many Israelis are upset that Prime Minister  Netanyahu agreed to a ceasefire with Hamas last week.  His Defense Minister  quit and the Prime Minister's base calls for a snap election.  Mr.  Netanyahu says that would be irresponsible.  </p><p>In a new interview with Fox News, US President Donald Trump said who can  really know if the Saudi Crown Prince lied when he said he wasn't involved  in Jamal Khashoggi's murder.  This is at odds with a CIA assessment that  the Crown Prince personally ordered the killing of the Saudi journalist  last month.  Mr. Trump says he will be getting a very full report on  Tuesday.  </p><p>In the same interview, President Trump spoke out about the Mueller probe  and criticism over the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting Attorney  General.  In the past, Whitaker has been critical of the Russia probe.   Here is what Mr. Trump told Fox News about Whitaker's oversight of the  special counsel.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  If Whitaker decides in any way to limit or curtail the Mueller  investigation, are you okay with that?  </p><p>TRUMP:  Look, it's going to be up to him.  I think he's very well aware  politically, I think he is astute politically.  He is a very smart person,  a very respected person, he's going to do what's right.  I really believe  he's going to do what's right.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But you won't overrule him if he decides to curtail.  </p><p>TRUMP:  I would not get involved.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  CNN's senior Washington correspondent, Joe Johns is at the White  House.  He joins us now.  Joe, good to see you.  Will President Trump sit  down for an interview with the special counsel?  What did he say to Fox?  </p><p>JOE JOHNS, SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPODENT, CNN:  Well, that's certainly the  farthest the President has gone and it's pretty strong language, too, isn't  it?  The President has said in the past that he had concerns about sitting  down with Mueller, but now just listen.  Listen so what the President had  to say.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  We gave very, very complete answers to a lot of questions that I  shouldn't have even been asked and I think that should solve the problem.   I hope it solves the problem.  If it doesn't, you know, I will be told and  we will make a decision at that time.  But probably, this is the end.  </p><p>WALLACE:  No interview.  </p><p>TRUMP:  I think we've wasted enough time on this witch-hunt and answer is  probably - we are finished.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>[08:35:05]  </p><p>JOHNS:  \"Probably, we are finished.\"  Now, if you talk to power lawyers  around Washington, DC, and I have, many of them have said they would never  allow the President of the United States to sit down with the special  counsel, simply because of the legal exposure that's involved when it comes  to things like perjury or obstruction of justice.  </p><p>Also, the President has been known to be a bit challenged by the truth.  So  there's that as well.  Difficult to see how an attorney would willingly  allow the President to sit down and answer questions, impromptu, with the  special counsel's office, Kristie.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  This was a wide-ranging interview, it generated a lot of  headlines.  Also in the interview, President Trump unloaded on retired  Admiral William McRaven, former head of Special Operations Command.  What  did he say?  </p><p>JOHNS:  Essentially reducing the man who spear-headed or was the architect  for the capture of Saddam Hussein as well as the killing of Osama bin  Laden, reducing his reputation to a political hack.  Listen to what he had  to say.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  McRaven, retired Admiral, Navy SEAL, 37 years, former head of US  Special operations.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Hillary Clinton fan.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Special operations --   </p><p>TRUMP:  Excuse me.  Hillary Clinton fan.  </p><p>WALLACE:   ... who led the operations, commanded the operations, that took  down Saddam Hussein and that killed Osama bin Laden says that your  sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy in his lifetime.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Okay, he is a Hillary Clinton backer and an Obama backer and  frankly --  </p><p>WALLACE:  But he was a Navy SEAL for 37 years.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner  than that?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>JOHNS:  That is the world of the President of the United States.  People  who oppose or criticize him are seen to do it because it is motivated by  politics, but people who support the President do it because of altruism.   Back to you.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  This interview just revealed so much about the US President.   Joe Johns reporting live from the White House.  Joe, thank you.  </p><p>After a contentious Senate race and recount, Florida will send a new  senator to Washington. Current US Senator Bill Nelson on the right conceded  to Republican challenger Rick Scott on Sunday.  The margin, just over  10,000 votes.  Meanwhile, the Senate Republicans will keep their majority  now with 52 seats.  Democrats only have 47.  One undecided race in  Mississippi will be decided later this month in a runoff.  </p><p>In the House of Representatives, Democrats have a majority with 232 seats,  Republicans have 200.  Three races are still undecided.  And as the new  Congress prepares to go to work, will they continue their colleagues' focus  on big tech in the wake of data breaches and disinformation campaigns, the  CEO of Apple says the scrutiny on his company and others could intensify.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you think that's inevitable?  </p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation, I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market is not working and it hasn't worked here.  I think  it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Tim Cook made those comments to \"Axios\" and they come as the  backlash grows for Facebook after that \"New York Times\" investigation  suggested it failed at recognizing and stopping Russian interference and  hired a PR hit firm to write negative stories about its critics.  </p><p>You're watching \"News Stream.\"  Still to come we are going to meet a  geographer who is determined to make Britain's capital city a thriving  national park.  We're going green.  That's next.  </p><p>[08:40:00]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Welcome back, now, in major cities around the world, creative  minds are tackling some of society's toughest issues.  In this edition of  CNN's \"Going Green\" we meet an inspiring environmentalist trying to turn  London into one of the first's urban national park.  Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>DAN RAVEN-ELLISON, GUERRILLA GEOGRAPHER AND CREATIVE EXPLORER:  I  absolutely love being in nature.  Throughout London, there are thousands of  parks like this one with this beautiful tree canopy and I love the  curvature of the branches, the dappled light coming through the trees, the  sound of wind going through the branches.  I'm Dan Raven-Ellison, working  to make London a national park city.  </p><p>When most people think of national parks, they think of deserts or rain  forests or mountains marlins, but I have explored all of the UK's national  parks and I noticed that maybe something is missing and that's a major  urban area.  </p><p>We share the city with 15,000 other species of wildlife and I don't think  that the urban life is worth any less, I don't think an urban red fox is  worth less than an arctic fox or a desert fox, it's just a red fox.  </p><p>I think people are awakening to the fact that we need to have a better  relationship with nature, for our own health and wellbeing, for the health  and wellbeing of wildlife populations, but we also need to have a better  relationship with nature for the health and resilience of our cities to  tackle climate change.  </p><p>I started the campaign to make London a national park city five years ago  now and when I started out, I think that most people thought that I was   completely bonkers, but I'm delighted to share after all of this work,  London is going to be launched as the world's first national park city in  July 2019.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Wow, that is a vision for London I'd love to see happen not just  there, but in so many places, urban centers around the world.  Now, when  you plan to visit Disneyland, you accept that waiting in line, that's just  part of the deal, but at Disneyland Japan, the waiting time to meet Mickey  Mouse on Sunday reached nightmarish proportions.  </p><p>Now, in the morning on Sunday this sign warned visitors of a 660-minute  wait to explore Mickey's House and to take a picture with the character.   That's 11 hours.  Later in the day, it shortened to a mere three hours.   November 18th marked 90 years since \"Steamboat Willie\" premiered, that was  Mickey's first public appearance and by the time, many of his fans got  through the line, it probably felt like 90 years had gone by.  </p><p>And that is \"News Stream.\"  I'm Kristie Lu Stout, but don't go anywhere.  \"World Sport's\" Alex Thomas is next.  </p><p>[SPORTS]  </p><p>[09:00:00]  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

After  scorching about 61,000 hectares in the last week and a half, the so-called  Campfire is likely to burn for 11 more days before it's finally contained,  and while the financial cost is still being tallied, the loss of human life  that is incalculable.  At least 80 people have been killed in this fire and  another fire in the south of the state.  </p><p> Nearly 1,000 people remain missing.  Community boards like this one with  photos and contact information are now popping up.  Survivors frantically  are searching for their loved ones.  The parking lot of this Walmart just  10 miles from the fire's epicenter has been transformed into this, a tent  city, after local shelters have reached full capacity.  And amid all the  devastation, one church is making this vow, \"We will rise from the ashes.\"  </p><p> Let's get straight to CNN's Kaylee Hartung.  She joins us from Chico,  California, where many of those who were displaced have sought refuge and  Kaylee, the number of missing has skyrocketed.  What is behind that and the  alarming death toll?  </p><p> KAYLEE HARTUNG, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, this fire when it was at its  worst was burning through the equivalent of New York's Manhattan Island  every three hours.  There were extremely high winds, there was low humidity  and warm conditions which really fueled this incredibly rapidly moving  fire.  </p><p> And so the people in the town of Paradise, a town with a population of  approximately 25,000 people had very little notice when they needed to  leave their hillside community.  Now, when we speak about this number of  missing, the number of people who were unaccounted for, authorities say  because so many people were displaced, they estimate about 50,000 people  evacuated from the fire zone, they say it is so difficult to manage this  list as they are sourcing information from multiple different types of  reports, whether that be 911 calls or e-mails, other incident reports.  </p><p> So 993 names are on the list as it stands now.  That number is absolutely  startling, but authorities say that's 283 fewer names than there were on  the list the day before.  They say for all of the folks who may be afraid  to look at the list because they might see someone's name on it, they ask  them to take a look and if you see anyone's name on this list who shouldn't  be on it, someone who is safe, please let them know because they are going  to comb through it meticulously to ensure everyone is accounted for.  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Kaylee Hartung reporting for us live from Chico, California.   Kaylee, thank you.  Now, our meteorologist Chad Myers is at the CNN Weather  Center.  He has been monitoring conditions.  He joins us now and Chad, what  are the conditions like today?  </p><p> CHAD MYERS, METEOROLOGIST, CNN:  Not bad, although for the people that live  there, the smoke is in the air and certainly the air is as hazardous as  anything you can imagine in any industrialized country, even though there  is no true industry there.  </p><p> We are now 60,000 hectares here and even into the Woolsey fire, that is  down by Malibu, that is beginning to clear up, almost completely contained  here.  The smoke is in the air, the smog just feels like you're breathing  something and it's getting at the back of the people's throats here from  Sacramento all the way down to Oakland and San Francisco, a very big  populated areas just so much haze and smoke in the air, but rain is coming,  but a lot of rain is coming and that's a good thing, bad thing.  Good news,  bad news kind of thing here.  </p><p> We will see rain on Wednesday, we'll see another batch on Thursday  afternoon and again maybe even into Friday.  Some spots will pick up with  the first roundabout of 100 millimeters of rain and then another 50 on top  of that in just a couple of days.  You think, well, that's great, and it  is, it will put out the fire.  The problem is all of this land here is  about to turn into a giant mud slide.  And I'll tell you why in just a  second.  </p><p> [08:05:01]  </p><p> MYERS:  Fifty millimeters to put out the fires, but the burn scars are the  problem.  The burn scars are the problem because the fire almost like  painting a piece of wood won't allow the water to soak in.  The surface  below this super hot fire of the dirt, of the soil, turns hydrophobic.  It  actually seals it like searing a steak so that you sear the steak so that  the juices don't come out.  </p><p> If you sear the land, the juices or the rain doesn't soak in.  So all of  this ash that's in the way here will get all coagulated in to a slurry and  slide right down the hill.  And it's the sliding part that is going to be  the problem.  </p><p> On the bottom of these mudslides, sometimes these things can be doing 30 or  40 miles per hour and people can't get out of the way of these significant  mudslides.  We see them all the time.  The subsurface soil will not allow  any rain to soak in and so the mud just goes downhill.  We call it a debris  flow, but debris is lots of things -- trees, sticks, logs, sometimes even  boulders can be pushed down with this very almost cement-like, wet cement- like structure here as it slides downhill, Kristie.  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Chad, really appreciate that you explained it.  When we hear  that rain is in the forecast, we think, oh, relief is on the way, but, no,  in fire ravaged California, rain is a double-edged sword when there's too  much of it.  Chad Myers, a good explainer, as always, thank you.  And to  find out how you can help the victims of the California wildfires, you can  check out our website, go to cnn.com/impact.  You will find a list of  vetted charities helping those in need.  </p><p> In a new interview, US President Donald Trump says he is not really sure if  the Saudi Crown Prince lied when he said he wasn't involved in Jamal  Khashoggi's murder.  This is at odds with the CIA assessment that the Crown  Prince personally ordered the killing.  </p><p> The Saudi journalist was killed on October 2nd inside the Saudi consulate  in Istanbul.  An audio recording by Mr. Trump's own intel officials now  have obtained captured part of the murder, but the US President  says there  is no need for him to listen to it.  Here is what he told Fox News.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I don't want to hear the  tape.  No reason for me to hear the tape.  </p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Why don't you want to hear it, sir?  </p><p> TRUMP:  Because it's a suffering tape.  It's a terrible tape.  I've been  fully briefed on it.  There is no reason for me to hear it.  In fact, I  said to the people, should I?  They said you really shouldn't.  There is no  reason.  I know exactly - I know everything that went on with the tape and  what happened.  </p><p> WALLACE:  And what happened?  </p><p> TRUMP:  It was very violent, very vicious and terrible.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Let's bring in Jomana Karadsheh.  She is live from outside the  Saudi consulate in Istanbul and Jomana, Trump doesn't want to listen to the  tape?  President Trump is distancing himself from the CIA assessment saying  it's too early to know.  Does this give the Saudis room to just brush off  the latest allegations?  </p><p> JOMANA KARADSHEH, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, you know, Kristie, the feeling  has been that since day one, the administration and President Trump  personally have at least publicly appeared not to want to push the Saudis  too much and some feel that it was Turkey's strategy, this drip feed of  leaks over the past few weeks that got us to this point where Saudi went  from basically denying any knowledge of what happened to Jamal Khashoggi to  now admitting that he was killed in the consulate.  </p><p> But when it comes to the President's position it seems, you know, so many  times we've heard him defending the relationship with Saudi Arabia,  defending the Crown Prince and basically saying that there's no evidence.   Take a listen to what the President said in an interview with Fox News.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  We now know that some of the people closest to him, some of his  closest advisers, were part of this.  Question, did MBS lie to you, sir?  </p><p> TRUMP:  I don't - I don't know.  You know, who can really know?  But I can  say this, he's got many people now that say he had no knowledge.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> KARADSHEH:  And, you know, some, Kristie, feel that the President and this  administration just want the world to take Saudi Arabia's word for it, for  what took place in this consulate, and then when you hear the President  saying it is too early to reach conclusions, some are wondering, you know,  they find it as a very baffling statement.  </p><p> It's been 50 days almost since Jamal Khashoggi was killed.  It has been  nearly four weeks since the CIA Director, Gina Haspel was here in Turkey  and the Turks shared the intelligence they had, she listened to the audio  recording.  Some are wondering why is it taking so long for this report  from the administration for them to really come out with the conclusion and  some here in this region also within the Turkish government, some officials  feel that we're seeing some sort of stalling tactics from some within the  administration as well as Saudi Arabia hoping that the longer this goes on  that the world will simply move on and just forget about th case.  </p><p> [08:10:08]  </p><p> KARADSHEH:  But that obviously is not happening right now, Kristie.  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Yes, because more pressure will be applied from various sources,  whether it's US Congress in the US or Turkish officials there where you're  reporting.  Jomana Karadsheh, reporting live.  Thank you.  </p><p> Now, there are growing signs of a ceasefire in the war in Yemen where a  leader of the Iran-backed Houthian movement says his forces are ready to  stop military operations against the Saudi-backed coalition.  The comments  followed diplomatic pressure on Saudi Arabia to engage in peace talks after  the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and now the Saudi King Salman says the  Kingdom supports a political solution to the conflict.  </p><p> CNN's Sam Kiley is in Abu Dhabi.  He joins me now.  Sam, the Houthi leader  is ready for a ceasefire, but what about the Saudi-led coalition?  </p><p> SAM KILEY, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:   Well, so far the  Saudi-led coalition has said at least during a lull in the fighting last  week that its attitude was that it was continuing operations at pace.  </p><p> That was before Mohammed al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthis, the Iranian  backed separatists in Yemen announced this overnight ceasefire.  It's a  unilateral offer to stop using long range missiles and stop using drones  not only against targets inside Yemen, but also beyond the borders, notably  into Saudi Arabia and here into the United Arab Emirates.  </p><p> Those were in part, part of a previous UN Resolution that called on the  Houthis to stop these sorts of operations ahead of any previous - any  possible ceasefire.  Now today, there is an expectation that Britain will  come up with a new UN Resolution, possibly requiring both sides, that was  the idea at least over the weekend, to create a level of equality, if you  like, in this requiring both the Saudis and the Houthis to simultaneously  cease operations.  </p><p> It will be interesting to see whether or not that appears in the final  resolution or whether it gets watered down after protests by the Saudis,  but there is a glimmer of hope here, Kristie, that towards the end of this  month there could be some peace talks that could get under way in Sweden,  not least because one of the major blocks to that had been the release of  50 wounded Houthis by the Saudis to allow them to go and seek medical help  outside the country.  The Saudis have now agreed to that.  </p><p> So these things are inching in the right direction at a time when of course  as you know the humanitarian crisis is catastrophic there.  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Yes, so peace is desperately needed.  Sam Kiley reporting.   Thank you.  You're watching \"News Stream.\"  Still ahead, we've breaking  news for you.  Nissan says its Chairman has been arrested after major  allegations made by the company.  What this means for the car giant?  What  is happening behind the scenes here with Carlos Ghosn, more on the  investigation that led to this development.  That is happening after the  break.  </p><p> Also ahead, the APEC Summit ends without its leaders agreeing on a joint  communique.  This is the very first time this has happened.  Keep it here.  </p><p> [08:15:00]  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Welcome back.  Breaking news, in the past few minutes, Nissan  has revealed that its Chairman has been arrested after allegations of  serious misconduct.  Nissan accuses Carlos Ghosn of underreporting his  compensation and the personal use of company assets.  </p><p>Nissan says it's been going on for years.  Board member Greg Kelly also has  been accused in the scheme.  Anna Stewart is in London and joins us now.   Anna, it was an internal investigation that was launched and took place in  the last few months that led us to this moment.  Tell us more about the  investigation and what more did it reveal about Carlos Ghosn leading to his  arrest.  </p><p> ANNA STEWART, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Exactly.  We've just heard from the CEO  of Nissan himself, he is giving a press conference right now and he gave us  the information that Carlos Ghosn has been now been arrested as has Guy  Kelly, the other executive involved in this.  </p><p> And what they released today was a very clear statement actually in terms  of sort of what the allegations are.  It says, \"Over many years, both Ghosn  and Kelly have been reporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock  Exchange that were less than the actual amount.\"  And in addition to that,  Kristie, in regards to Ghosn, there are numerous other significant acts of  misconduct which have been uncovered such as the personal use of company  assets amongst other things.  </p><p> So that's all we know at this stage in terms of what is the investigation.   It was an internal investigation following a whistleblower report.  Now of  course, Nissan is cooperating with Japanese authorities and the CEO has  been arrested.  The question is now of course, will the board oust him,  which of course we largely expect, not just from Nissan but from the other  car companies that Carlos Ghosn heads up.  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Yes, Carlos Ghosn, he is a titan of industry.  He is not just  the chairman of Nissan, he is the Chairman and chief exec of Renault.  He  is the Chairman of Mitsubishi Motors.  I know you've been following the  stock price for at least a couple of these companies, and what does the  arrest mean for all these firms?  </p><p> STEWART:  Well, quite right, Renault, as you can see from the share price,  Kristie, double digits down this morning.  The news broke just after Nissan  closed for the day, but I can tell you that on the Frankfurt Stock  Exchange, those share prices are under pressure, too.  </p><p> Now of course, shareholders wants more clarity.  It's hard to understand  how he could retain any of his positions on any of these boards, frankly,  given the serious nature of the allegations against him.  We're waiting to  hear from Renault and from Mitsubishi.  Of course, they are likely having  crisis meetings with their boards now, but we should get more details in  the hours to come.  </p><p> LU STOUT:  All right, Anna Stewart reporting live from London.  We'll have  more details in the first move with Julia Chatterly at the top of the hour.   Anna, thank you.  </p><p> Now, after a turbulent last few days in Westminster, the British Prime  Minister is facing new challenges over her Brexit plan this week.  The  first began a couple of hours ago when Theresa May pitched her draft deal  to British business leaders.  </p><p> Now, the focus turns to the rest of the EU where there are key meetings  scheduled.  So what is motivating Britain's leader during these tough  talks?  Well, she explained this weekend.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SOPHY RIDGE, ENGLISH BROADCAST JOURNALIST:  Have you ever thought at any  stage about just giving up?  What's the point of this?  </p><p> THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  No, I haven't.  Of course it's been a  tough week.  Actually, these negotiations have been tough right from the  start, but they were always going to get even more difficult right towards  the end when we are coming to that conclusion, but what I think is this  isn't about me, it's actually about what's right for the people of this  country.  It's about what's in the national interest.  That's what drives  me.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Tough request to answer, tough times for Theresa May.  We've got  Nina Dos Santos live in London.  And Nina, let's talk about her pitch to  the business community which she just gave earlier in the day.  How much  business support does the Prime Minister have for her Brexit plan?  </p><p> NINA DOS SANTOS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, for the moment she does seem to  have the support of the biggest business lobby, which is the Confederation  of British Industries that's been long agitating about the fact that there  isn't enough clarity in the UK's Brexit negotiations and says that  essentially although this deal is not perfect, it is some sign of the kind  of stability that they would like to see, some visibility on the future  framework that the UK would have with the EU after it leaves the EU in  march of next year.  </p><p> There's also been some clarity over the last few days that seems to have  been given when it comes to this so-called transition period.  If the UK  leaves and hasn't yet got a deal with the EU, it seems as though instead of  that being an unlimited transition period, which is a total redline for  many Brexiteers, the government has firmed up the language on that to make  sure the transition period lasts no longer than January 2022.  </p><p> As you pointed out, Theresa May is going to be heading over to Brussels to  try and again, sell this deal to the community over there.  She's going to  be meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker she said in the next few days, largely  not to talk about the withdrawal agreement because she says this document  that of course has caused so much ire in Westminster over the last several  days that is largely the withdrawal document.  </p><p> [08:20:05]  </p><p> DOS SANTOS:  That she believes is said and done, it's the best deal they  are going to get.  But instead, the focus is going to shift towards the  future political declaration, the future political relationship and  economic relationship that the UK will have with the EU once it has left  the European Union.  </p><p> And when it comes to the voices that are coming back from Brussels, again,  the message has been we have agreed what we've agreed with Theresa May,  Theresa May saying to her MPs who as yet haven't had the numbers to mount a  big leadership challenge against her, changing me is not  going to achieve  anything.  This is the best deal that we can get, Kristie?  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Yes, testing times for her and her Brexit plan.  Nina dos Santos  reporting.  Nina, thank you.  This year's APEC summit, usually a relatively  tame affair ended in dramatic fashion.  For the first time in its 25-year  history, the meeting wrapped up without a formal joint statement.  That's  because according to a source within the meeting, China wasn't happy with  some of the wording in a paragraph about trade.  </p><p> Tensions between Washington and Beijing, they were front and center  throughout the summit and that was evident in speeches by the Chinese  President and the US Vice President.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have great respect for  President Xi and great respect for China.  But in the President's words,  China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.  Those  days are over.  </p><p> XI JINPING, PRESIDENT OF CHINA (Through a translator):  History tells us to  take the road of confrontation, whether it's in the form of a cold war,  open war or trade war, it will produce no winners.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Now, the disagreement over the wording in the communique  apparently caused a scene at the Papua New Guinea Foreign Minister's  office.  Now for more, let's go straight to Ivan Watson.  And Ivan, usually  the APEC Summit ends with a communique and a photo op with the world  leaders in matching tunics.  That didn't happen in this time.  What went  wrong?  </p><p> IVAN WATSON, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, there was a  failure to achieve consensus here.  As the Prime Minister of the host  country, Papua New Guinea put it, it was  because of the two big giants,  China and the US, the two world's largest economies could not see eye to  eye, but there was also some drama on the sidelines.  </p><p> A source familiar with the incident tells CNN that at one point on Saturday  in the capital there, four Chinese diplomats barged into the office of  Papua New Guinea's Foreign Minister after he had rejected a request from  them to help draw up the final draft communique.  He was arguing that he  had to be objective as the host country and couldn't have their influence.  </p><p> The Chinese Foreign Ministry has denied that and claimed that these are  rumors aimed at trying to spoil the Chinese Papua New Guinea relationship.   That was a bit of a sidebar to a bigger issue and that was that the 21  countries couldn't come to an agreement.  A US official tells CNN that  China was alone against the other 20 countries because of a different -  difference of  agreement over visions of trade going into the future.   Kristie?  </p><p> LU STOUT:  A bizarre turn of events at the host nation for APEC this year.   Ivan, just how heated did it get between Xi Jinping and Mike Pence at APEC.   </p><p> WATSON:  They met twice and evidently they didn't swing at each other or  anything.  They did speak, but in their speeches they did make some pretty  blunt criticism at each other with Xi Jinping talking about the need for  multilateralism or rules-based system, for tolerance and warning against  protectionism, whereas Mike Pence went very much against one of Xi  Jinping's pet projects, his One Belt, One Road initiative.  Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> PENCE:  Know that the United States offers a better option.  We don't drown  our partners in a sea of debt, we don't coerce to compromise your  independence, the United States deals openly and fairly, we do not offer a  constricting belt or a one-way road.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WATSON:  So he is criticizing here China's One Belt, One Road initiative  where China has lavished huge amounts of money around the world on these  infrastructure projects and Pence basically arguing that this is a debt  trap that will take away nations' sovereignty.  Xi in his own speech said,  no, there is no hidden agenda to our One Belt, One Road initiative.  You  can see the jockeying here, Kristie, because Pence came to this meeting  talking about joint investment projects and infrastructure in the Asia- Pacific region that would be done with Australia, for example, or Japan.   Promising to bring electricity to Papua New Guinea which has issues with  power, and also announcing that there would be the creation of a new  trilateral military base on Papua New Guinea's island of Manus with the  Australians and Papua New Guinea.  </p><p> [08:25:09]  </p><p> WATSON:  So you can see the competition shaking out here in addition to a  trade war where both countries have levied tariffs on hundreds of billions  of dollars' worth of each other's goods.  There could be an off ramp and  Pence himself suggested this at the upcoming G-20 summit in Argentina where  President Trump and Xi Jinping will meet face-to-face, Kristie.  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Yes, for that, we will wait and see.  But wow, for APEC this  year, no communique, no consensus just open feuding.  Incredible.  Ivan  Watson, reporting, thank you.  </p><p> Now, not long ago Shenzhen was a poor fishing village on the southern coast  of China, but today it is one and has been for a few years the fastest  growing cities on the planet.  Matt Rivers takes us on a tour of China's  Silicon Valley.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> MATT RIVERS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Forty years ago, none of this existed.   The buildings, roads, none of it.  Shenzhen was a little more than a poor  fishing village on China's southern coast, but today, it's home to 12  million people and growing.  It's the world's greatest or biggest boomtown.   That's because it's one of the top centers of Chinese wealth, and this is  the man who started it all.  </p><p> That's Deng Xiaoping who led China from the late '70s to the early' '90s,  and it was his idea to open up China to the rest of the world.  He did that  in part by creating with these special economic zones which included  Shenzhen.  They got preferential tax treatment, more direct foreign  investment, and that more than anything else helped create all this.  </p><p> Western firms flooded in like China's first McDonalds and factories popped  up churning out boatloads of cheap electronics and consumer goods and  amongst them were a whole bunch of knock offs until manufacturers here  realized.  </p><p> ANDREW HUANG, AUTHOR, THE HARDWARE HACKER:  You can't really actually make  a big profit just pure copying, so they learned how to actually add value  to the designs, so now they're coming up with like new designs.  </p><p> RIVERS:  Tech startups lured by easy access to the global supply chain of  gadgets flourished in this warmer less polluted city far away from Beijing.   Innovating in AI, robotics and electric vehicles.  This isn't the stuff of  the future.  It's happening right now from facial recognition --  </p><p> So right now when you walk into the subway here, they take a picture of  your face.  There's lights there.  They take a picture of you every time  you walk under the subway.  </p><p> To an entire market, the world's largest operating almost entirely almost  cash and card free.  </p><p> So every little store here that you can buy fruit or whatever you need, you  go on your phone, you scan a QR code like this one, so this is WeChat Pay  and that's that, simple as that.  I just bought fruit from this woman.  </p><p> All of these innovations supported by the government in a bid to rebrand  \"Made in China\" to \"Created in China.\"  To be sure, much of the world is  wary of China's rise.  Can it truly challenge the US for economic  dominance?  That's not clear.  But if it does, Shenzhen, the city built in  just a single generation will likely be the force that makes it happen.   Matt Rivers, CNN, Shenzhen.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> LU STOUT:  The Chinese artist and activist, Ai Weiwei once said that,  \"Everything is art, everything is politics.\"  Now that is especially true  if you work somewhere where freedom of speech is not taken for granted like  Taiwan, but it's comments made outside the cutting room from Fu Yuea, a  director from Taiwan that are stirring up deep feelings on both sides of  the Taiwan  strait.  Take a listen to what she said at the Golden Horse  Film Awards this weekend.  It's the Chinese language equivalent of the  Oscars.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> FU YUET, TAIWANESE FILM DIRECTOR (Through a translator):  I really hope our  country will one day be treated as a genuine independent entity.  This is  my biggest wish as a Taiwanese.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Now, under its One China policy, Beijing considers Taiwan part  of its territory even though it is self-governed and democratic.  Taiwan's  leader has spoken out saying this, quote, \"I am proud of the Golden Horse  Ceremony yesterday because it accentuated how Taiwan is different from  China.\"  You're watching \"News Stream.\"  Still to come, President Trump is  speaking out about the Russia probe.  What he's saying about his written  answers to Special Counsel Mueller's questions, next.  </p><p> [08:30:41]  </p><p> LU STOUT:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong.  You're watching \"News  Stream\" and these are your world headlines.   Nissan says it's Chairman,  Carlos Ghosn has been arrested after allegations by the company of serious  misconduct.  Nissan accuses him of underreporting his compensation and the  personal use of company assets.  Board member, Greg Kelly is also accused  in the alleged scheme and we have not yet heard a response from either of  them.  </p><p>California officials say the deadliest fire in the state's history won't be  contained for another 11 days.  At least 77 people have been killed; nearly  1,000 remain missing in the devastating Campfire.  Cooler temperatures and  rain are in the forecast for the devastated region.  </p><p>Israel's education minister says he is not resigning despite major  divisions in the government.  Many Israelis are upset that Prime Minister  Netanyahu agreed to a ceasefire with Hamas last week.  His Defense Minister  quit and the Prime Minister's base calls for a snap election.  Mr.  Netanyahu says that would be irresponsible.  </p><p> In a new interview with Fox News, US President Donald Trump said who can  really know if the Saudi Crown Prince lied when he said he wasn't involved  in Jamal Khashoggi's murder.  This is at odds with a CIA assessment that  the Crown Prince personally ordered the killing of the Saudi journalist  last month.  Mr. Trump says he will be getting a very full report on  Tuesday.  </p><p> In the same interview, President Trump spoke out about the Mueller probe  and criticism over the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting Attorney  General.  In the past, Whitaker has been critical of the Russia probe.   Here is what Mr. Trump told Fox News about Whitaker's oversight of the  special counsel.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  If Whitaker decides in any way to limit or curtail the Mueller  investigation, are you okay with that?  </p><p> TRUMP:  Look, it's going to be up to him.  I think he's very well aware  politically, I think he is astute politically.  He is a very smart person,  a very respected person, he's going to do what's right.  I really believe  he's going to do what's right.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But you won't overrule him if he decides to curtail.  </p><p> TRUMP:  I would not get involved.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> LU STOUT:  CNN's senior Washington correspondent, Joe Johns is at the White  House.  He joins us now.  Joe, good to see you.  Will President Trump sit  down for an interview with the special counsel?  What did he say to Fox?  </p><p> JOE JOHNS, SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPODENT, CNN:  Well, that's certainly the  farthest the President has gone and it's pretty strong language, too, isn't  it?  The President has said in the past that he had concerns about sitting  down with Mueller, but now just listen.  Listen so what the President had  to say.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> TRUMP:  We gave very, very complete answers to a lot of questions that I  shouldn't have even been asked and I think that should solve the problem.   I hope it solves the problem.  If it doesn't, you know, I will be told and  we will make a decision at that time.  But probably, this is the end.  </p><p> WALLACE:  No interview.  </p><p> TRUMP:  I think we've wasted enough time on this witch-hunt and answer is  probably - we are finished.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> [08:35:05]  </p><p> JOHNS:  \"Probably, we are finished.\"  Now, if you talk to power lawyers  around Washington, DC, and I have, many of them have said they would never  allow the President of the United States to sit down with the special  counsel, simply because of the legal exposure that's involved when it comes  to things like perjury or obstruction of justice.  </p><p> Also, the President has been known to be a bit challenged by the truth.  So  there's that as well.  Difficult to see how an attorney would willingly  allow the President to sit down and answer questions, impromptu, with the  special counsel's office, Kristie.  </p><p> LU STOUT:  This was a wide-ranging interview, it generated a lot of  headlines.  Also in the interview, President Trump unloaded on retired  Admiral William McRaven, former head of Special Operations Command.  What  did he say?  </p><p> JOHNS:  Essentially reducing the man who spear-headed or was the architect  for the capture of Saddam Hussein as well as the killing of Osama bin  Laden, reducing his reputation to a political hack.  Listen to what he had  to say.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  McRaven, retired Admiral, Navy SEAL, 37 years, former head of US  Special operations.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Hillary Clinton fan.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Special operations --   </p><p> TRUMP:  Excuse me.  Hillary Clinton fan.  </p><p> WALLACE:   ... who led the operations, commanded the operations, that took  down Saddam Hussein and that killed Osama bin Laden says that your  sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy in his lifetime.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Okay, he is a Hillary Clinton backer and an Obama backer and  frankly --  </p><p> WALLACE:  But he was a Navy SEAL for 37 years.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner  than that?  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> JOHNS:  That is the world of the President of the United States.  People  who oppose or criticize him are seen to do it because it is motivated by  politics, but people who support the President do it because of altruism.   Back to you.  </p><p> LU STOUT:  This interview just revealed so much about the US President.   Joe Johns reporting live from the White House.  Joe, thank you.  </p><p> After a contentious Senate race and recount, Florida will send a new  senator to Washington. Current US Senator Bill Nelson on the right conceded  to Republican challenger Rick Scott on Sunday.  The margin, just over  10,000 votes.  Meanwhile, the Senate Republicans will keep their majority  now with 52 seats.  Democrats only have 47.  One undecided race in  Mississippi will be decided later this month in a runoff.  </p><p> In the House of Representatives, Democrats have a majority with 232 seats,  Republicans have 200.  Three races are still undecided.  And as the new  Congress prepares to go to work, will they continue their colleagues' focus  on big tech in the wake of data breaches and disinformation campaigns, the  CEO of Apple says the scrutiny on his company and others could intensify.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you think that's inevitable?  </p><p> TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of  regulation, I'm a big believer in the free market, but we have to admit  when the free market is not working and it hasn't worked here.  I think  it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Tim Cook made those comments to \"Axios\" and they come as the  backlash grows for Facebook after that \"New York Times\" investigation  suggested it failed at recognizing and stopping Russian interference and  hired a PR hit firm to write negative stories about its critics.  </p><p> You're watching \"News Stream.\"  Still to come we are going to meet a  geographer who is determined to make Britain's capital city a thriving  national park.  We're going green.  That's next.  </p><p> [08:40:00]  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Welcome back, now, in major cities around the world, creative  minds are tackling some of society's toughest issues.  In this edition of  CNN's \"Going Green\" we meet an inspiring environmentalist trying to turn  London into one of the first's urban national park.  Take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> DAN RAVEN-ELLISON, GUERRILLA GEOGRAPHER AND CREATIVE EXPLORER:  I  absolutely love being in nature.  Throughout London, there are thousands of  parks like this one with this beautiful tree canopy and I love the  curvature of the branches, the dappled light coming through the trees, the  sound of wind going through the branches.  I'm Dan Raven-Ellison, working  to make London a national park city.  </p><p> When most people think of national parks, they think of deserts or rain  forests or mountains marlins, but I have explored all of the UK's national  parks and I noticed that maybe something is missing and that's a major  urban area.  </p><p> We share the city with 15,000 other species of wildlife and I don't think  that the urban life is worth any less, I don't think an urban red fox is  worth less than an arctic fox or a desert fox, it's just a red fox.  </p><p> I think people are awakening to the fact that we need to have a better  relationship with nature, for our own health and wellbeing, for the health  and wellbeing of wildlife populations, but we also need to have a better  relationship with nature for the health and resilience of our cities to  tackle climate change.  </p><p> I started the campaign to make London a national park city five years ago  now and when I started out, I think that most people thought that I was   completely bonkers, but I'm delighted to share after all of this work,  London is going to be launched as the world's first national park city in  July 2019.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> LU STOUT:  Wow, that is a vision for London I'd love to see happen not just  there, but in so many places, urban centers around the world.  Now, when  you plan to visit Disneyland, you accept that waiting in line, that's just  part of the deal, but at Disneyland Japan, the waiting time to meet Mickey  Mouse on Sunday reached nightmarish proportions.  </p><p> Now, in the morning on Sunday this sign warned visitors of a 660-minute  wait to explore Mickey's House and to take a picture with the character.   That's 11 hours.  Later in the day, it shortened to a mere three hours.   November 18th marked 90 years since \"Steamboat Willie\" premiered, that was  Mickey's first public appearance and by the time, many of his fans got  through the line, it probably felt like 90 years had gone by.  </p><p> And that is \"News Stream.\"  I'm Kristie Lu Stout, but don't go anywhere.  \"World Sport's\" Alex Thomas is next.  </p><p> [SPORTS]  </p><p> [09:00:00]  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Snap's policy puts it somewhere between Facebook, which doesn't fact-check political ads, and Twitter, which has banned political ads entirely, in the heated debate over what role social media platforms should play in moderating paid political speech. Spiegel told CNBC that Snap wants to create a space for its younger user base to \"engage with the political conversation\" without misinformation. </p><p>However, Snap has a much smaller ad business than Facebook, which means reviewing each ad may be an easier task for Snap than it is for its larger rival. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Snap CEO Evan Spiegel told CNBC in an interview Monday that the company subjects \"all advertising to review, including political advertising.\" That includes fact-checking, he said. Spiegel said that Snap wants to create a space for its younger-skewing user base to \"engage with the political conversation, but we don't allow things like misinformation to appear in that advertising.\" A spokesperson for the company says that every ad is vetted by a team of humans to make sure that it follows Snapchat's guidelines, which prohibits being misleading or deceptive. The spokesperson says that Snap has indeed banned a small number of ads under this review process. Spiegel's comments make Snap the latest social media company to weigh in on political ads, in a heated debate that has already ensnared Facebook, Twitter, and Google. With its review policy, Snap appears to be staking a middle ground between Facebook and Twitter. Facebook has faced intense criticism[1] from lawmakers and its own employees[2] over its refusal to fact-check political ads on its platform. In a jab at Facebook, Twitter took the opposite approach[3], saying it will ban political ads entirely, though questions remain about how Twitter will enforce the policy in practice. Google has remained relatively quiet on the matter, but did ban political ads in Canada[4] ahead of an election earlier this year, saying it would be hard to comply with the country's new transparency rules. It's also worth noting that Snap has a substantially smaller digital advertising business than Facebook[5], which also might make it more realistic to proactively review content than its larger rivals.NOW WATCH: Most maps of Louisiana aren't entirely right.

Revealing its financials to the public would go a long way to show if Snap could support such a heady valuation.\u00a0</p><p>As talks of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Snap</emphasis>'s highly coveted IPO have finally come into fruition, the social media company's decision on where it will list is also something to watch as the rivalry between America's largest exchanges presses on. (no details on the exchange were given in the WSJ's report and Snap did not respond to requests for comment)\u00a0</p><p>Although Nasdaq has remained favorable with tech companies, the rivalry between Nasdaq and the NYSE has only become fiercer over the years as more than 60% of tech companies have chosen to list on the NYSE over the last four years compared to when in 2006 it only had 12% of all tech IPOs . Companies like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twilio</emphasis><br/> , <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Square </emphasis><br/> , <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Line</emphasis><br/> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GoDaddy</emphasis><br/> have run counter to preconceived notions to join <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twitter</emphasis><br/> , <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yelp</emphasis><br/> , <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Box </emphasis><br/> , and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oracle</emphasis><br/> on NYSE. The race between the two exchanges continues to heat up.</p><p>Snap is expected by many to choose the Nasdaq as its listing site just as former tech darling\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook </emphasis><br/> \u00a0had done. But as many experts say, the choice is less of a foregone conclusion as the New York Stock Exchange has implemented a number of changes over the past few years and presents a number of benefits over the Nasdaq. Still, Nasdaq is no slouch and the competition will certainly take place to land one of the most high profile listings in recent history.</p><p>Meanwhile, both exchanges continue to promote Snapchat on their Twitter accounts likely to try and curry favor with the company's executives.\u00a0</p><p>To celebrate  in   is taking you on a tour of  :   <br/></p><p> \u2014 Nasdaq (@NASDAQ) <br/></p><p>It's  from the Bell Podium. Only on    <br/></p><p> \u2014 NYSE (@NYSE)  <br/><br/></p><p>So, how do companies choose which exchange to list on and what benefits do each provide? How did the Nasdaq become the defacto destination for tech companies and how is the NYSE competing with its uptown brethren? There are a number of reasons.</p><p>Although\u00a0Nasdaq has had a higher number of tech IPOs, the ones that succeeded in raising the vast majority of capital\u00a0to help companies grow, expand their businesses, pay down debt\u00a0or provide meaningful liquidity events for investors have almost exclusively listed on the NYSE, according to John Tuttle, Global Head of Listings at the New York Stock Exchange. Last year, companies that listed on the NYSE raised about $11.3 billion from 33 IPOs while Nasdaq won 81 of the 111 IPOs, (73% win rate) raising $9.4 billion.</p><p>\"The majority of companies on Nasdaq are actually quite small. If you look at the median market cap, if you look at all of the companies listed on the stock exchange, and all of the companies listed on Nasdaq, the median cap for companies listed on the NYSE is roughly $2.4 billion, for Nasdaq it's under $300 million,\" said Tuttle.\u00a0</p><p>Back in the 80s and 90s, the NYSE focused on older and more established blue chips companies, its stringent and restrictive rules disqualified many of the then up-and-coming tech companies.</p><p>\"In 1983 the tech companies were just starting to grow. They weren't big enough to pass the listing requirements on the American and New York [stock exchanges]. By the time they were big enough to switch, the rule had changed and Nasdaq effectively convinced them that. They now offered the same trade info as the other exchanges so switching wouldn't get them much,\" said Daniel Weaver, professor of finance at Rutgers Business School.</p><p>\"I have taken three technology companies public, all of them on Nasdaq. Over the past decade, Nasdaq has consistently demonstrated their alignment with Coupa's core values of ensuring customer success, striving for excellence, and focusing on results. Thus, the partnership is a natural fit,\" said Todd Ford, CFO at <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Coupa Software</emphasis><br/> , which went public in October\u00a0raising about $133 million.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Editors' Pick:</emphasis> This article was originally published on Nov. 16 and has been updated to reflect recent news about Snap's IPO plans and new app\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">developments.</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Snapchat's new glasses called Spectacles\u00a0</emphasis><br/></p><p>While some companies like the exposure of Nasdaq's electronic billboard in Times Square, others prefer to have\u00a0NYSE's human\u00a0oversight and accountability in the mix.</p><p>\"There are some people who like NYSE's hybrid mix of electronic trading plus human intervention. It gives some investors comfort of being able to buy or sell during periods of high volatility,\" said Ken Marlin, Managing Partner at <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marlin &amp; Associates Securities LLC</emphasis>. \"NYSE is 200 years older than Nasdaq. Some people like the message that sends.\"</p><p>The competition has set off Nasdaq to invest more in\u00a0entrepreneurship and innovation.

The Android version of Snapchat has long been criticized, especially for its poor camera quality and frequent app crashes. The update has already been rolled out to Android devices, and can be downloaded now. Android users finally have a new \u2014 and improved \u2014 version of the Snapchat app available to download. </p><p>The Android version of Snapchat has long been criticized for being inferior to the iOS version available for those with Apple devices, so an overhaul to the app will come as welcome news to many Android owners. Snapchat announced Monday[3] on Twitter that it had released a Snapchat update \"rebuilt just for Android.\"Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1115298256798482433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw To @Android[4]. Love, Snapchat. #SnapForAndroid[5] pic.twitter.com/MGOFQYa9Cj[6];The app should be available to download now from the Google Play store, but at least one Android-owning Business Insider reporter wasn't able to update the app on their phone, so keep checking Google Play throughout the day. An update to Android's Snapchat app has been long-awaited and is very overdue. Snapchat has known for at least three years that its Android version has had issues. Android users have documented and complained frequently about the app's frequent crashing and poor quality camera. Need a sampling? One Reddit user wrote in last year that the Android app \"runs worse than literal dog s--t.\" \"By far the worst app experience I've ever had on any device is unquestionably Snapchat,\" another Reddit user wrote in 2016. \"I can't even take a photo let alone apply any of the filters or text to it without waiting a good minute for the app to be somewhat usable. What is going on here Snapchat?\" Snapchat hasn't done anything to appease Android users' criticism until now. Read more: Snap has known its Android app is terrible for years \u2014 and it may be too late to win back those millions of angry users[7] On its face, the new Snapchat looks exactly the same as its predecessor design-wise. However, the camera has been completely revamped. Here are two pictures I took, one with the old Snapchat app and one with the updated version.The post-updated Snapchat didn't crash while I was playing around with it, but I'll have to see whether it's still buggy with longer use. Considering that Android devices account for more than 80% of[8] the global smartphone market, the Snapchat update is long overdue. The app's poor quality explains why Snapchat's biggest decline in daily active users recently was among Android users, as Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel[9] explained to analysts in an earnings call[10] in October. The updated Android app may help to mitigate some of Snapchat's woes and combat a decline in daily users. However, Snapchat's central demographic is largely younger millennials and Gen Zers, who overwhelmingly own iPhones[11]. But as Snap looks to expand its footprint and userbase by launching in new markets, having a reliable Android version will be key. Fortunately for Snapchat, Gen Zers still cite the platform as their favorite social app, according to a recent survey of teens from Piper Jaffray[12]. The Snapchat update should be available for Android users to download in the Google Play store.

Josh Hawley's proposed legislation.'We're well within our First Amendment rights to decide what shows up,' Snap CEO Evan Spiegel explained[1] to CNBC's 'Power Lunch.' Spiegel then cited that the First Amendment is written to 'protect individuals and private businesses from the government.' </p><p>What he failed to mention was that Section 230 protections are themselves a form of government regulation that can be changed.Snap had proclaimed just last week[2] that it will no longer allow the president of the United Stated to access the same tools allowed for celebrities and other favored influencers on the platform to reach youth.This comes after Sen. Hawley (R-Mo.) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) separately announced in late May[3] that they were both working on legislation to crack down on Big Tech's hypocritical misuse of Section 230 protections while failing to act as platforms for free speech.Axios summarized[4] that the 'Hawley bill will be an additional threat against platforms like Facebook and Twitter following President Donald Trump's executive order[5] aimed at curbing their legal protections from content posted by users.'Axios explained how damning this legislation would be for hypocritical Big Tech platforms: 'The legislation would open platforms to legal liability if they enforce their terms of services in unequal or uneven ways, including by making politically motivated moderation decisions.' The legislation is reportedly coming very soon and already is being circulated: 'Hawley and his office have had multiple conversations with senior White House and Justice Department on revisiting Section 230, the source said. They have shared draft text of the measure with other Senate offices seeking cosponsors, and the bill could be introduced as early as next week.'

Josh Hawley's proposed legislation.'We're well within our First Amendment rights to decide what shows up,' Snap CEO Evan Spiegel explained[1] to CNBC's 'Power Lunch.' Spiegel then cited that the First Amendment is written to 'protect individuals and private businesses from the government.' </p><p>What he failed to mention was that Section 230 protections are themselves a form of government regulation that can be changed.Snap had proclaimed just last week[2] that it will no longer allow the president of the United Stated to access the same tools allowed for celebrities and other favored influencers on the platform to reach youth.This comes after Sen. Hawley (R-Mo.) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) separately announced in late May[3] that they were both working on legislation to crack down on Big Tech's hypocritical misuse of Section 230 protections while failing to act as platforms for free speech.Axios summarized[4] that the 'Hawley bill will be an additional threat against platforms like Facebook and Twitter following President Donald Trump's executive order[5] aimed at curbing their legal protections from content posted by users.'Axios explained how damning this legislation would be for hypocritical Big Tech platforms: 'The legislation would open platforms to legal liability if they enforce their terms of services in unequal or uneven ways, including by making politically motivated moderation decisions.' The legislation is reportedly coming very soon and already is being circulated: 'Hawley and his office have had multiple conversations with senior White House and Justice Department on revisiting Section 230, the source said. They have shared draft text of the measure with other Senate offices seeking cosponsors, and the bill could be introduced as early as next week.'

We really appreciate it.</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL, </nameText></person>CO-FOUNDER, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, SNAP INC.: Thanks for having me.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: You know, I think it's been -- so here we are, year 8 in the history of the company, and I think it's been an eventful year -- has been an eventful 8 years and even more eventful, probably, 2 years I think you'd say in a lot of cases. I guess, one of the questions I would kind of want to start with is, how do you think about the core use case that Snap provides for people that is differentiated, unique, and that really drives the overall user behavior?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: Fundamentally, and I think this has stayed the same since we launched the core product, this idea of communicating visually has really improved people's lives and I think brought them closer to their friends, largely because when you communicate visually, it's far more expressive than text. And given the way that Snapchat is structured, our messages disappear, they're created in an instant from the camera. When you express yourself on Snapchat, you're actually free from a lot of the pressure that people feel when they post an image on social media. And so I think what has really grown our service to date and what has inspired so much passion around the Snapchat product is this idea of expressing yourself and doing it in a way that's visual.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Got it. And really throughout the last couple of years, there's been a series of management changes and certain changes throughout the C-suite and a lot of the leadership team. I know this comes up a lot with investors that I talk with. I'd be curious to kind of view your perspective of how do you view the changes that have been made to the management team so far? What have been your biggest learnings? And how do you think about the 1 or 2 keys that you look for the management team to execute on now, going forward?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: Well, I can't even tell you how excited I am about the team that we have today. It's just awesome to be surrounded by people who are so talented. Jeremi, who builds the ad business at Amazon, Jared was the CEO of HuffPost. We have really awesome leaders who joined the company. And I think one of the things that we saw was that some of the folks who are still, to this day and my very close friends who helped us build the company from my dad's house, at some point went from leading a team of 2 to a team of 1,000. And I think sometimes at that point it's important to transition the leadership capability because the job is just really, really different. So one of the things we've done over the last 1.5 years is really go and find the most experienced leaders who love leading really big teams and structuring large organizations. And then, I think, we really tried to make sure that they enjoy playing together as a team. And so that's one of the things that I found, to just be a huge differentiator that when we're recruiting, when we're talking to people, making sure -- we just make it clear, hey, we play like a team here. Teamwork is the most important thing to us. And so if you don't want to contribute as a team member, this probably isn't the right fit. And I think the second thing we've done, we had these values: kind, smart, and creative, since we started the company. But one of the things that we did over the last 1.5 years was to really start acting more aggressively on those values. And so rather than just having the values, we started saying things like, hey, if you're a top performer but you're not living our values, you're not kind, then this really isn't the right fit for you either. And so I think this sort of intersection of teamwork and our values has made just a massive difference in the way the team works together and ultimately performs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I think it's really interesting you brought the kindness factor, because one of the areas you and I talked about last week was sort of our most values-based development, and sort of making sure that you really do have societal values in how you design the product, how it iterates. So maybe talk about that. How do you sort of ensure that the product that you bring for the people on Snap is actually sort of for the good of society?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: Well, I think these sort of -- these are the problems that we love the most in product development because they usually don't have a clear answer. And so one of the things that we do to try to get to a place that we feel comfortable with is really looking at the past. And so we look at behaviors that sort of human beings have done for years and years, thousands of years in some cases, and we try to bring them to life and empower them through technology. So the obvious example is our ephemerality. Most conversations we have with our friends are ephemeral. Humans feel comfortable when their conversations are ephemeral. They feel like they can express themselves more. So bringing that ephemerality to technology was a big breakthrough for us. The same thing with Stories. So with Stories, we realized everyone tells stories in chronological order, beginning, middle and end. And yet on the Internet, for some reason, everything was reversed. And so we found that just by putting stories back in chronological order, people felt more comfortable creating them, it made more sense, people could construct narratives to really communicate with their friends. And so that made a really big difference for us. And I think one of the things that we're looking at and thinking a lot about now is really the difference between communication and broadcast. And so, historically, in our society, we've actually thought very differently about these 2 modes of connecting with other people. And if you look at communications, telecommunications for example, we have totally different sets of sort of responsibilities around that. We actually say that privacy is a norm with one-to-one communication, at least in America, that actually telecommunications is governed by a totally different regulator than the folks who look after a broadcast. Right, and historically, broadcasting -- obviously, you know all this, but was basically built on this idea that broadcasting happens over public airways, therefore there needs to be a public interest involved. And there are totally different standards around what can and should be broadcast to millions of people. And so as we look at the development of our service going forward, we've taken a lot of what we've learned from the past and said if you want to have a conversation with your friends, we'll respect your privacy. You can say things that might be like untrue or something like that, but when it comes to broadcast media, we're much more selective about what gets broadcast to millions and millions of people. And so one of the things that we've just found, even as we, I think, shift human behavior through technology, that we can usually shape technology to uplift the behaviors that humans are already comfortable with, rather than sort of radically departing from those.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Got it. Got it. And before we get into certain -- some of the specifics of the products and the changes, I wanted to ask you, so from an internal to external perspective, there's a lot written by Wall Street analysts, media, a lot has been written about the company. Hopefully, you've read some, maybe read a little, maybe read none. What do you think is sort of the most misunderstood part of the overall story? Where you look at it and you say, that's just not right?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: I think there are a couple. I think, first and foremost, a lot of people are surprised when they actually look at the data and see the overlap between our audience and the audiences for products built by our competitors. So for example, in our core markets like the United States, or U.K., or France, or something like that, we tend to have roughly the same audience size, actually, as products that people perceive to have a much larger audience. And so I think from a data perspective, this is all publicly available information, you can check out the ads manager for different companies' products. Largely, the delta in usage comes from countries like India, or Indonesia, or the Philippines, where our product is not grown. And so one of the things that we're thinking a lot about now is how do we want to approach our international growth? How do we want to sort of stage that, where do we want to focus our resources, perhaps more so in countries we feel like we can monetize. And as part of that, how can we really improve our product experience on Android, where historically, our Android products has performed much worse than our iOS product. So I think that's sort of the first one. I think another one that I find that's very interesting is that for 13 to 34-year-old, this is really our core demographic, they know and love our product. And generally, their parents do too. But what we find this that there's oftentimes this group of people in the middle, maybe they're 35 to 45 or something like that, whose kids aren't yet old enough to use Snapchat, and they haven't yet adopted the product. Obviously, we're only, as you mentioned, 8 years old. So it takes time for these things to grow. And then, that demographic actually is writing a lot of the research reports, right, and they're writing a lot of the news articles. And so one of the things that we find is that sometimes people's own sort of biases based on their own behavior informs the way that they cover our company. And so I think we've been thinking a lot about how to just educate folks who haven't yet experienced our products.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: My 4-year-old does though use the specs. So he still does whatever (inaudible) specs walking around. One of the -- my 5-month-old, no, but the 4-year-old, yes. The app redesign, so I want to start talking about that, sticking with the iOS app. You made some pretty forward-looking decisions to sort of separate the types of consumption on the platform. Had some challenges there, now you're kind of working through that. So maybe talk us through the underlying thought process of the app redesign, your biggest learnings from it. And what are sort of next one or 2 key iterations you see coming in the app for the next 1 to 2 years?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: As we look at the app redesign and what we've been really trying to accomplish, it's this idea that I mentioned earlier about trying to help people feel comfortable expressing ourselves -- themselves. And one of the things that we found, was that in the past in our service, popular accounts or official accounts were actually mixed in with accounts from your friends. And so you'd swipe in to go look at your stories, and you'd see an influencer at the top of the page, even before you saw your friend's content. And what we felt like was that these influencers are people who are making this content professionally, oftentimes raise the bar in terms of self-expression so that normal people like me, or whatever, feel uncomfortable posting because our lives can't compete with this sort of idealized portrayal that we see from influencers. And so we felt like if we wanted to create a place where people really felt comfortable expressing themselves, that we had to separate out all the content created by friends from content that's created by professionals, like influencers. And we knew that this would be a bit controversial. Influencers have a lot of distribution and really public voices, and we were effectively saying, hey we're going to take influencer content that was at the top and we're going to demote it below your friends. And so we felt like influencers would be frustrated, but that they, over time, would understand the value of this transition because ultimately, we believe that as users feel more comfortable, they engage more, and that will positively impact all the other types of contents that we have in our service. So we made that transition. We made a couple of mistakes along the way. We broke some of the ways that people communicate. And obviously, the communication on Snapchat is what drives the frequency of use of our product. So if you make it hard to talk with your friends, people will come back less often, and that did have a negative impact, obviously, on our daily active user number. I think, year-on-year, something like down 2% or something like that. But ultimately -- maybe a little more -- ultimately, we believe that, that trade-off was really important because it set us up well for the long term of our business. And I think one of the things that, that allowed us to do beyond just elevating your content from your friends and making you feel more comfortable, was it created a space for personalized media content. So in the past, we had a very limited number of professional content creators creating content on our service. And we felt like if we wanted to have a personalized content experience not only do we need to open that up to more content creators, have a longer tail of content to personalize from, but we also need to create an environment where there is basically an infinite scroll of that sort of content. And in the past, it was really just one limited horizontal scroll at the bottom of all your friends stuff. So we rebuilt Discover. We onboarded more content partners. We created a feed that's personalized based on users' interests. And again, very early stage there, but we're really excited by what we're seeing in terms of the growth and time spent with that premium content. So I think, overall, it has been a bit of a rocky transition, but in terms of the long-term success of the business, and the growth of our content business, we're very excited by what we're seeing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And then, the Android redesign you mentioned earlier, what are some of the 1 or 2 of the key points you're trying to fix there? Are they similar? Or is there -- what can you learn from the Android redesign? How do we think about a timing of a new Android app?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: Well, we're already starting to roll out the updated Android application. We're really excited by what we're seeing there. We learned a lot over the last 1.5 years, so we're taking our time on this one, rather than ripping the Band-Aid. But we're definitely excited about what we're seeing, and I think the most important thing to understand when it comes to Android, and the reason why our incremental approach to improving that product didn't work and we had to rebuild it from the ground up, is that if you look at Snapchat, it's a collection of a lot of different features. So we have the communications part of the service. We have a content part of the service. We have a map. We have memories. We have our camera. And it -- historically, all of those different features were fighting each other for resources on the phone, and those resources are limited, whether they are memory or disc space or something like that. And what we had to do was effectively build a common platform that all of these features can sit on top of, that allocates resources much more effectively. And so that took a lot of work. Obviously, we had to do like 6 years of engineering in Europe or something like that. So huge credit to our team that did an outstanding job. But we're excited about what we're seeing, and that's going to, I think, allow us to move a lot faster now that we can sort of decouple developments of features that were previously sort of entangled. So we're excited about that too.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Is it those 2 changes, sort of the iOS app and the Android app, is that how you think about driving user growth? Because I think in the fourth quarter we saw more stable user growth and then sort of some encouraging commentary about 2019. If you would just sort of pinpoint 1 or 2 key factors you think will drive user growth, drive 2019, what are those?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: Well, Android is absolutely critical to our strategy. If you think about it there's, I think, something like 2 billion Android users that don't use Snapchat. So a couple of percent of those, I think, would be well received by all of us. So that's something that we're definitely excited about in terms of the future opportunity. And that explains a lot of the delta, as I mentioned, between the strength we see in core markets like U.S., U.K., France, and sort of international markets like India or Indonesia, where the vast majority of users have Android phones. And so for us, what we saw was that in the United States, for example, there's sort of a network effect. If you have really highly-engaged iOS users, they can bring Android users into the product experience, even though the Android experience isn't so great. And in the United States, the Android phones are much better than we see in international markets. But in international markets where the Android phones are not so great, and the user base is almost 100% Android, or 90%, or 80%, it's very, very hard to see the same sort of network effect in terms of engagement that you see with iOS. So I think, really excited about the opportunity on Android going forward.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Got it. Got it. On the monetization front, well, I have a few. The first one is sort of a high-level question. One of the concerns that we've had over the last year, sort of there's been question marks around how monetizable stories engagement is? Because people are tap, tap, tapping, and so it does that cause people to naturally to skip the ads more frequently than a news feed. What's your reaction to that? Is that a structural feeling that monetization is tap? Or are we completely off base?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: So I think there's a couple of different ways to understand the monetization opportunity around Stories. I think, first and foremost, it's important to understand that most advertisers are buying advertising based on objective now. Whereas, in the past, maybe advertisers would only buy advertising based on views or something like that. And one of the things we found with Stories, and this idea that you can swipe up on a story to take an action. It allows our advertisers to optimize against tons of different goals, whether it's buying a product on their website or installing an app or something like that. So first and foremost, advertisers are going to bid based on their objective. And then, I think the second thing is, your question, if an advertiser is optimizing primarily for brand impression or view time, how does the tap to skip impact that. And so one of the things that we saw was a huge opportunity to build a product that is in line with a more narrative content experience. And so we released Shows, which are roughly 5 minutes in length, more premium content experience, and have non-skippable advertisements. And those non-skippable ads, which we call Commercials, have gotten a ton of traction. And that's a guaranteed view. And so I think for brand advertisers that care a lot about that narrative storytelling, and aren't necessarily optimizing, for example, for an app install. That's a really appealing product. And you can still optimize, of course, for video views even in skippable advertising. But for folks who really want that premium branded impression, commercials are a great product for that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And do you -- that's actually really helpful. Do you see the business -- you've made a lot of changes and improvements at the ad product from moving towards self-serve, better measurement. You mentioned the Commercials. What are sort of one or 2 of the key points you still think you need to really improve in the ad side? Or if we say if we added this, it would really help advertisers better optimize their spend on the platform.</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: We have some pretty cool products coming on the e-commerce side that we're excited about. But I think, for us, really, the focus over the next year or 2 is much more about advertiser education. I think a lot of folks, especially in the United States, we built our business with a direct sales team. Right? And only in the last 1.5 years that we really transitioned to a self-serve model. And so a lot of the work that we have to do now is just to let people know that that's available. To help them share the great outcomes and great ROI that people are seeing on our platform. And I think as we shifted from branded direct sales to performance advertising, we maybe didn't even realize how much legwork we needed to do to share the great results people are seeing. Because performance advertisers sort of, unlike brands, don't necessarily celebrate their wins because they don't want more people in the auction because then, the prices go up. And so we actually have to do a lot more of that legwork to show the great results that people are seeing on our platform, the really high ROI that advertisers are seeing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I have just one on the mechanics, because I know there's a lot of people interested in sort of the mechanics of the model. So if you think about the drivers of advertising in '19 and in '20, pick a long-term user growth, time spent per user, ads load, and pricing. Which of those 4 you sort of think as being the biggest driver of advertising in the next couple of years?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: I think that, at least from what we've seen in the industry, the #1 driver is actually going to be the number of advertisers, especially because we have a second-price auction, right? And so I think what's really interesting about a second-price auction is that as that second price gets closer and closer to the first price, you can drive much higher pricing for advertising, even though your cost per outcome is actually decreasing. And so this is sort of, I think, one of the exciting phenomenons we see broadly in the industry that self-serve will let us really deliver for our clients.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: As we're getting mic-ed up in the back, first, [Mike have] mentioned how his wife has just now become a user, a 50 -year-old. I know there's a -- which is great. I know there's a push to sort of try to get older demographics on the platform. What do you think you need to do to sort of bring on more 40, 50-year-old people on to the platform, to sort of tap into that user opportunity?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: Fundamentally, people use Snapchat to basically cultivate their relationships with their friends, and usually close friends. So I think the first and most important thing is that people have friends on our service. And I think what we're seeing is that now that our user base is aging up in our 8th year of business, the more folks have friends on Snapchat that they can talk to. So I think that's sort of number one. I think, number two, once you come into our Snapchat experience, whether you're on the camera and you're using augmented reality, or you're on Discover and playing with our content, we really need to tailor and personalize those content and augmented reality experiences to older customers. And so that means the lenses will look different, that means the content offering will feel different, and I think that's a really important piece that after your friends bring you into the service, really making sure you feel at home when you're using the product. So we're putting a lot of effort into that now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: On the AR point, you were an early innovator in AR. And I think one of the parts that's probably a little underappreciated is the Lens Studio that you guys launched, I think, in 2017. So I would actually be curious to hear about, one, what type of adoption have you seen out of that? What has that done to overall engagement? And then, if you sort of step back around AR and the Lens Studio, how important is hardware in sort of your long-term view?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: So super excited by what we're seeing with Lens Studio. I think we've shared, there's over 300,000 people building lenses with Lens Studio, which is just awesome. Totally blown away our expectations. I think a really good example of what happens when you have this sort of engagement we do around our camera because that's really attractive to developers who want their products to be used. And so I think by starting with the consumer augmented reality platform that just works on your smartphone, we've gotten a lot of traction in the developer community. And I think that bodes really well for the future. I think, if you look structurally at the opportunity for augmented reality and really for our vision of computing overlaid on the world, we think about this in terms of the evolution of computing platforms. And so if you think about sort of the desktop computing platform, the killer app, was really about information retrieval and Google just dominate it. The second generation mobile computing, really about connecting with your friends, which Facebook has done a tremendous job of doing, and I think as we look forward to the next generation of computing, which we believe is experiential computing, this idea that computing is going to be integrated with the world around you rather than sort of some isolated concept. The Internet is over here and the real world's here. That's not how people experience computing today. Computing is intertwined in our daily lives. And so as we look at that next generation of experiential computing, I think Snapchat is really well positioned because of our leadership in the camera. And I think one of the things that's interesting about these computing transitions, is that you typically see a merchant behavior on sort of the prior platform before it jumps and really catches fire on the new platform. So an example would be Facebook, right? Facebook was born on desktop. People were communicating, but it was kind of a pain. So you had to go to your desktop to check and see what your friends were up to. And so when we transitioned to mobile computing platform, Facebook really took off, because your friends were available in your pocket. And I think now what you're seeing with Snap, that people are starting to overlay computing on the world around them through our camera on their smartphone, is just the beginning of what you're going to see when computing is actually overlaid on the world, on the next platform. And so we've been investing a ton as you know in hardware. We believe that's a really important piece of this. It's going to take 10 years to get there, I think, maybe a little bit longer. We obviously are doing a lot of work on Snapchat, which is, I think, for us, a really great playground for augmented reality, and of course, we've done a ton with our developer tools. And so as those sort of 3 pieces come together, the consumer application, the hardware and the developer platform, I think that's going to build really nicely over the next decade or so as we look at experiential computing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And you mentioned earlier Discover, and sort of the what you're seeing with the commercials, and sort of starting to monetize it a little bit better. So with Discover, we've seen both some scripted and some non-scripted content on there. I guess, the 2-part question is sort of, philosophically, how do you think about the need for premium content in Discover? And then, if you were to say here is one thing I would be most excited to add to Discover, what type of video content would that be?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: So I think one of the interesting things about Discover today is that people are coming to it for a lot of different reasons. So we obviously identified this huge opportunity around premium content, and starting with publisher stories, and now Shows that's grown really nicely. But there's also a lot of engagement around our community-based content. So for example, coverage of the Oscars that comes directly from people with phones on the red carpet or something like that, or a Laker game where fans are sharing their perspective from all over the stadium. And one of the things that we're trying to do over the next year or 2 is disentangle that community-based content from the premium content, and really give them both their own space to shine. And so I think if I were to look at the next year or 2, the thing I'm most excited about is that by disentangling both of them, I think we're going to do a better job getting at the essence of what both of those content types deliver, and that, that will, I think, really help our community increase their engagement because the content will be merchandised in a way that makes it easier to find and easier to understand.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Anything you want to share about the number of users who are using Discover or time spent on Discover? What's the -- what type of engagement are you seeing right now?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: I think we'll leave that to the earnings call.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Right. Got to try. But the app redesign, presumably the app redesign is sort of going to, hopefully, better surface a lot of the Discover content for the users.</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: Yes. We've already seen a lot of progress there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Got it. You mentioned earlier the e-commerce opportunity, and sort of as one area where you see a chance for more advertisers to kind of come in. You have the Collection Ads, the product catalogs, the Pixel targeting. Talk to us sort of what are one or 2 of the holes you still need to fill to really drive more e-commerce behavior? And do you need payments?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: We already have been doing some pretty interesting things experimenting with payments. So you can swipe up to buy products, you can put it in your credit card information. We'll store that information for you to make your purchase easier the next time. So I think there's a lot that we can do there. And we're experimenting with sort of our own store, if you will, where you can buy custom Bitmoji gear, you and your friends on a coffee cup or something like that. And what we've always found is that, very early on, if we can experiment with something on our own, whether it's Discover, we built our own channel to play around with media or with Lenses. We started by building our own Lenses before we open them to developers. We're doing a lot to learn by creating our own store, just to start. And so I think we'll be able to take a lot of these learnings from our e-commerce store, and maybe apply them more broadly to the product.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And what have been the learnings with the map products so far? Engagement -- how do you monetize -- talk to us about maps?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: It's a really exciting product, because I think the opportunity we identified was this idea that maps really have not been personalized. Despite the fact that most of what you do on your phone today is personalized just for you. Your map is the same as your map, is the same as your map. And that really doesn't reflect your understanding of the world or even your understanding of your neighborhood, right? So one of the things that we noticed was that if we were able to personalize a map for each individual who use our service whether that's by adding their friends or adding events that are interesting to them or changing the landmarks on their map, that we could really make our map more reflective of the way that people understand the world around them. And so that's going to be a really long journey, but the engagement we're seeing around that product is very exciting and we released features like status updates. You can see when your friends are flying around or visiting different places. And that's, I think, drove a lot of interest in that product.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: We're going to open it up to audience Q&amp;A after a couple of more questions. So if you do have a question for Evan, raise your hand. There should be mic runners. Before we open it up, I have to ask one on data privacy and regulation. Here's where the lawyers get nervous. There's a lot of headlines around regulation, regulating big tech, data privacy. Talk to us kind of what your perspective on this. How does it impact the way you think about the business structure, the way you run the business. Sort of talk to us about regulation, data privacy.</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: This is something that we cared about for a really long time since the really, the beginning of our product. Just the idea of data minimization or the right to be forgotten was ridiculous. And so it was hilarious for us, actually, to see that 7 years later or 6 years later, something like that, people starting to talk about data minimization as if it's something that all companies could do. Because in the past, people equated data minimization with sexting. So that's been a wild arc, from our experience. So I think as we look at privacy, for us, again, it's really that cornerstone of people feeling comfortable expressing themselves. And so if you're not able to protect someone's privacy, how are they supposed to express themselves openly with their friends and family? And so that's why we've always thought so deliberately about this, over time, through our product. I think, as we look at the industry, I think one of the interesting things now is that a lot of stuff that's been happening for many, many years is just now coming to light. The public is just now understanding how a lot of companies gather and use data. And so I definitely think we're sort of at the beginning of this process. And I think that's largely to be expected given the way that politicians have thought about regulating the Internet over a longer period of time. So I think it was the Clinton administration that something like what, 20 years ago said, hey, the Internet is this totally new thing. It's really different than the real world, and so let's just let people experiment and kind of see what happens. And I think now we're understanding that the Internet and the real world are not 2 distinct places. They're one and the same. The Internet has a huge impact on the real world. And so because of that, we need to be more thoughtful about the products that we're creating on the Internet. And so I think this is sort of part of the natural evolution of the way that this technology is being used. And hopefully, we'll be able to have sort of a thoughtful dialogue as a society about what we expect from the Internet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I think someone on that administration invented the Internet. Questions for Evan? If you have any question, raise your hand. There should be a mic runner, running to you. On the back, to my right?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: You collect a lot of information on your users. Do you feel that there's sometimes undue pressure from your stakeholders from Wall Street about trying to monetize some of the information that you collect on your users? They have a different perspective, perhaps, right?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: Yes. We definitely feel that pressure. I think that's actually one of the reasons why Founder Control is important, because we do make a lot of trade-offs in the interest of our community frequently, where we actually make less money because we're not willing to engage in practices that maybe other Internet advertising businesses do. So I think that's part of building long-term trust with our user base. And as we look at sort of this transition to experiential computing that's going to deeply integrate computing with the real world, that trust is vitally important to users feeling comfortable allowing us into their lives in that way. And so I think right now, we're building that trust and building that track record with our community, that we won't misuse their data, that we'll do the right thing for them, and hopefully, that means that, down the road, 10 years from now, that as computing gets more and more intertwined with people's day-to-day lives, that our community trusts us to do right by them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: On the user point -- by the way, if you have anything, raise your hand. I have a bunch. On the user front, so I'd be curious to hear. So the early improvements that you've seen in the user stability and now the potential for growth, is it more driven by more gross ads coming in? So new people coming on the platform? Or are you actually seeing sort of better retention and lower churn from your users as coming back? What's driven the improvement so far?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: I can't share specifics on that beyond what we shared on the earnings call, but I definitely think there's good opportunity ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: There's a lot about costs on sort of the cash flow of the business. You've taken some steps to sort of have some cost rationalization, it looks like at least, in the last quarter, maybe the last 6 months. Maybe talk to us about how you think about further cost rationalization as a potential extra lever for cash flows to go over the next years?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: Yes. Sure. So I think, from a high level, the most important thing is to understand as we're driving towards breakeven, that's really about optionality in the business. So when we're generating our own cash, we've got a lot of options, and I think that's what's fundamentally important to us. And I don't think that drives towards breakeven is causing us to ignore any of the massive long-term opportunities that we see, for example, around augmented reality or hardware. We're continuing to invest substantially, and will continue to do so for a very long period of time. But I would say that I think we have done a very good job focusing on cost on a per user basis, for example, our cost of revenue is lower than some other folks in the space. And I think that is really reflective of the focus our team has had, and also on our strategy of leveraging the cloud. We were one of the first companies to really build our business in the cloud. So rather than racking servers, we were able to get going just with a couple of engineers focused primarily on innovation and end user experience. And Google sort of handled the scaling for us in our early days. So I think as we look forward, obviously, tons of leverage in the business. I think that's starting to materialize. People are seeing that for sure, but I don't think we're going to ignore the long-term opportunities that we're really excited about.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Over there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just 2 quick ones. You said Android was critical for 2019. Should we assume that, that -- that the redesign is fully rolled out by end of this year? And then, just secondly, on the Shows. Can you just give an example of a handful of Shows that you're either most excited about or that are driving most viewership. It's tougher to monitor than House of Cards on Netflix or something like that.</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: That's a great point. I think we should do, actually, a better job of talking about the Shows that are really successful on Snap. I think one recent example is Bringing Up Bhabie, which I think had 10 million viewers in the first -- very short amount of time. I don't think I can give you the specific. I think, maybe, 24 hours or something like that. What was really cool about that is that we ran a trailer on Snap in our Discover feed, to prompt people to subscribe before the show even came out. And so we had a huge audience waiting for that content, which is the first time we've really seen that behavior on Snap, and I think indicative of the excitement around the premium content on our service. Something like Endless Summer, which was a reality TV show that came out sort of in the first slate of Shows, has done really, really well. We're excited about that. And so I think we're going to continue to experiment with all different types of content, but it was really cool to see that excitement building for Bringing Up Bhabie. And I think on the Android side, yes, it will be -- the rebuild will be rolled out by the end of the year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: There. In front of the room.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Evan, you caught a lot of flack in the press about the way decisions are made, internally, sometimes being accused of them being unilateral and not well thought out. Why do you think people don't understand about how decisions are made at Snap?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: Well, I think we sort of have to separate out public perception of the way that decisions are made from reality because I'm not sure the public perception is going to change if we continue to take big risks, right? And so I think this idea and this has been from the beginning, that whether it's ephemerality, whether its Stories, whether it's Lenses, time and time again I think we've taken really, really big bets, and sometimes with substantial disruption, on more than one occasion. And I think whenever those decisions are made, the PR around them is going to be challenging, overall, and people are going to question our decision-making. And I think, ultimately, having a vision for the future means that you're willing to bet big like that and take those big risks, despite that sort of blowback. I think what we see inside the organization has really been a push towards distributed decision-making. The way that we do that is just by being very clear about whether or not a decision is reversible. If it's reversible, go ahead and make the decision. If it's irreversible, we should have a conversation together as a leadership team. But by and large, in the technology industry, I think one of the really exciting things, is that most decisions are reversible. And so it actually allows people to move really, really quickly and innovate really quickly because if you make a mistake, you can just change your mind. And so I think that's one of the great things about our industry, that most mistakes are correctable in a really short period of time. But that is different than taking really big bets on product, which is something that we're going to continue to do. So I think you can't hire really brilliant, talented people if you just unilaterally make decisions. I think everyone wants to share their point of view, and everyone has a really special and different point of view on our leadership team. So I really want to make sure everyone's voice is heard. It's important that, that cascades throughout the organization. The best way to do it is distributed decision-making. But I don't want that to distract from the fact that there's going to be -- continue to be a narrative that we take big bets and don't listen to people in pursuit of what we believe is the right thing to do for our community.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: We'll do one more, before we break. The idea of what will bring new people to the platform. We've talked about Android. I talked about Discover, and sort of the premium content. So we're sitting here a year from now and users have grown, I don't know, let's say, 30 million over the course of 2019. What do you think will be the biggest factor on the platform that brings new users to the platform. Is it just friends joining? Or is it sort of a premium content? And what brings in new user growth?</p><p><person><nameText>EVAN SPIEGEL</nameText></person>: I think unlocking that core value of visual communication is vitally important, and that's sort of at the intersection of friends on the platform, the actual client-side software working really well, which is why we've invested so much on Android and also your network connectivity. So there are some markets today, internationally, where connectivity primarily happens on Wi-Fi in a fixed location. It's going to be harder for us to grow there than in markets like India, for example, where, actually, a substantial number of the population -- potential amount of population has access to LTE, in a really affordable way. And so I think, sort of the intersection between your friends and connectivity, and client-side device performance, will be the drivers of growth.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. All right.

It's Friday, Feb. 17, and we're talking tech and exploring Snap's IPO filing. I'm\u00a0your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by fool.com senior tech specialist Evan Niu. Evan, how's it going?</p><p>Evan Niu:\u00a0Pretty good, pretty good.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Are you a Snapchat user? Do you have it on your phone?</p><p>Niu:\u00a0I recently downloaded it just to play around with it. I've read plenty about it, I know how it works, I know the gist of it. But I started playing around with it, and it's really not intuitive or easy to use. [laughs] I don't have a lot of people on there that I follow, so I certainly don't have the full experience of regular users. But I don't really see the appeal to it. It seems really niche to me.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Yeah, I'll say, I am a Snapchat user. I have a lot of friends that use it. My interest will wane depending on how often my friends are using it, and that will bring me in or out of the system. But, it seems to be super popular with millennials, and given a lot of the buzz with the company and the fact that it is a big tech company that's\u00a0thinking about going public, there are a lot of investors that are interested in it.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Yeah, there's been so much hype around this thing. It doesn't seem to me like it has a mainstream appeal, which is the exact problem that\u00a0Twitter\u00a0(NYSE: TWTR)\u00a0has run into over the past few years. I see a lot more closer comparisons to Twitter than\u00a0Facebook\u00a0(NASDAQ: FB), which is the exact opposite storyline that Snap is going to try to sell doing its roadshow.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Yeah. Listeners, to give you an idea of what we're going to talk about today, give you a little overview of Snap, the Snapchat property specifically, talk a bit about their plans to go public, and what Evan and I noticed when we dug through the S-1 that recently became available. So, we talked about, they are social media company, but they call themselves a camera company,\u00a0which is interesting.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0I noticed this really funny coincidence -- I don't know if you would call it a coincidence -- Snapchat used to consider itself a storytelling company, and now it's calling itself a camera company. Meanwhile,\u00a0GoPro\u00a0used to call itself a camera company and now is trying to call itself a storytelling company. So, these two companies, they have this weird identity thing where they want to be each other, and I don't get why, because it's not like GoPro is doing very well. I think it's kind of a weird thing rebrand themselves as a camera company. I mean, they\u00a0have the new Spectacle glasses with cameras, but I don't know. It's just a weird identity to me.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Yeah. For listeners who might not be familiar with the social media platform Snapchat, basically, you can think of it as a messaging platform where you are, for the most part, shooting quick, instantly deleted pictures and videos to you and your friends. You can also post them as stories. It has gained a lot of popularity with the millennial group. User count is still kind of low, we can talk about that a little bit, but the company is planning to go public, looking to raise $3 billion via the public markets in an issuance that would value the whole company a\u00a0somewhere between $20 [billion] to $25 billion. As tech IPOs go, this might be one of the biggest ones for 2017.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Yeah, definitely. It's definitely the most exciting, the most looked forward to. People have been waiting for this thing for years.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Yeah,\u00a0and anything that's consumer-facing is naturally going to have a lot more buzz to it. I think there might be some folks out there who are saying, \"Wait a minute, I thought I saw an announcement that this company planned to IPO back in the fall of 2016. Why are we just getting the S-1 and all the information\u00a0about the company in the past couple weeks?\" That's because Snap opted to go public via the confidential IPO process. This process and this approach is a byproduct of the 2012 Jumpstart Our Businesses Act. Basically, under this updated legislation, companies with under $1 billion in annual revenue can file paperwork for an IPO confidentially with the SEC. That allows the company to go back and forth with the regulatory agency without alerting the public that they are planning on IPO-ing, although Snap chose to do so anyway. Then, once the company decides they do want to go forward with an issuance, the filing must be made public at least three weeks prior to the IPO roadshow beginning, which is when the underwriting investment banks begin talking to clients and building interest in a potential issuance. This is all to say, while the \"confidential IPO\" name might sound kind of shady, this is something that's totally on the up-and-up. And that is the reason why we only got a look at the company's books and the S-1 earlier this month, even though they announced intentions to IPO a ways back.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Right.\u00a0I think part of the purpose is to, like you mentioned, avoid public scrutiny for the early drafts of the S-1. All companies always have to file the S-1, but this way they can refine it without all the public scrutiny, looking at it and scrutinizing it. I think the idea is to encourage more companies to explore the IPO process, and if companies do end up going public, they get more capital, and it just boosts the economy in terms of more investments happening. I think that's the goal. But, yeah, it is a little weird when you hear \"confidential.\"</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Yeah, and I think it also gives companies the opportunity to maybe think about going public and walk back without sharing all of their business information publicly. So, you can test the waters and see if you're ready, and you might decide you're not, but you don't have to go through the question of your business practices,\u00a0if you think you're going to file and you have to publicly walk back.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Right,\u00a0exactly.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0So, that's part of it. There are some adjustments in the regulatory requirements for how far back a company needs to provide financial statements, as well. But really, all in all, it's a tool that allows small-growing companies to keep some of their core business info private and make the going-public process a little bit easier. And that's really all there is to the confidential IPO process. Given that the company's S-1 filing became public earlier this month, I think it's fairly safe to assume we're going to see Snap trading on the New York Stock Exchange sometime in the next couple months. Evan?</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Yeah, seems like it's coming.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Considering that they are a social media company, I think it makes the most sense to start looking at their user base and what's going on there. That's kind of the lifeblood of businesses like Facebook and Twitter, and Snap is really no different. Within their S-1, they mention, \"We assess the health of our business by measuring daily active users because we believe that this metric is the most reliable way to understand engagement on our platform.\" So, it's clear that this is what they're honing it on as a key metric, and it's what investors are going to be watching as well.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Yeah. I did find it interesting that they don't disclose monthly active users, they only disclose daily active users, which is right around 160 million. With social media companies, I always tend to look at sequential growth as opposed to year-over-year growth, because with user base, that's the nature, there's no seasonality, it's just how much you can grow over time. So, I look at sequential. In that respect, Snap's growth is really decelerating -- it's grinding to a halt, almost. And the company tries to explain this in saying, \"Oh, it's because we haven't come out with any big new product innovation.\" And, of course, that has an impact, but you also have to worry about competition, because Facebook has done a really good job copying a lot of Snapchat's features, especially the Story thing, which is now on Instagram. Facebook already has, I think, about 150 million daily active users using Stories now. And they launched that last year, and it's an exact replica. So, you have to wonder if that's what's taking a bite out of it. And, obviously, Facebook is much bigger, they have more resources,\u00a0they can innovate and develop faster. It's really Mark Zuckerberg, and Silicon Valley's -- I mean, Snapchat isn't based in Silicon Valley, but Facebook certainly is -- and Facebook tried to buy them, and if they can't buy them, they'll copy them, and they compete, and that's exactly what they're doing. And they're doing a really good job so far. So, I think there is some concern about competition and whether or not Snap can really keep up.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Yeah. And Facebook famously made Snapchat an offer, I believe it was somewhere around $5 billion or so, a little ways back, and CEO Evan Spiegel said, \"No, we're going to see what we can do with this on our own.\" If they wind up going public at this gaudy valuation, it certainly works out well for him, but you wonder if that might have stoked the competitive fire in Mark Zuckerberg a little bit.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0And he can also empathize, because he did the exact same thing with\u00a0Google\u00a0(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). [laughs] So many people tried to buy Facebook, and he said, \"No, I want to do my own thing,\" and now Facebook is enormous and he is one of the richest men in the world. [laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Yeah it's hard to blame him for that. To put some numbers on what's going on with their user growth, like you said, year-over-year, the numbers look really great. They're up 48%. But sequentially, Q3 to Q4 of 2016, growth was only 3%. So, if you look at the graph that they provided in their S-1, it does look like growth is flattening out a little bit. Given that so much of the expectation for these social platforms is continuing to build user base, and being able to monetize that user base really well, you have to worry about that as an ongoing risk for the business.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Yeah. If they are a niche product, which, it seems that way to me, then this could be it...and, obviously, 160 million daily users is a pretty big number. And you can build a healthy business there if you keep your expectations modest and try to build around that base. Whereas, if you're trying to grow, if you're spending a ton of money trying to grow it, and you can't, which is exactly the problem that Twitter is having, then that's when it\u00a0starts to hurt financially. But if you just accept it for what it is and plan your business accordingly, you can build a pretty decent business out of it.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Yeah. For some context, I went back and looked at Facebook's S-1\u00a0to see how they stacked up when they went public. At the time, they had 480 million daily active users, and they were posting 48% year-over-year growth and 6% sequential growth. You hear that and think, \"Well, those growth rates are kind of similar, right?\" The difference was scale. Even when they were doing single-digit sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, they were still adding tens of millions of users, not five million, as Snapchat did last quarter. I think that's a huge risk, especially as you see a more entrenched competitor taking what's working for you and has a lot of traction with users that you already have on your platform and just applying it to this massive user base that they have.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Right. Facebook is interesting because they started earlier, before the really big rise of mobile. So a lot of their early days were on desktop. Then, they had to navigate the transition to mobile, which they have done ridiculously well, far better than I think anyone ever imagined, whereas companies like Twitter and Snap, they came out on mobile from the beginning. Particularly Snap -- I mean, there is no desktop Snapchat.\u00a0</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Right. Beyond the user base, I think a lot of people want to know what's going on with the financials as well. In 2016, the company booked $404 million in revenue, up from $58 million in revenue in 2015. That is humongous growth, but that is on a very tiny denominator. The reality with Snapchat is that they really just kind of turned on the monetization engine there, and have only really rolled out ads for a very short period of time. Right now, even, it's still a pretty ad-light experience for users.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Yeah. They only recently released their API to automate ad sales, which is a hugely important part of scaling for advertising businesses, because it allows your advertisers to do this automatically, it's much less labor-intensive to do it. So, they literally only did this a few months ago, and it's still in beta. So, it's very early days in terms of their ad business.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0And that's really what's going to be making up most of the money for Snap overall, right?\u00a0Advertising made up 96% of Snap's revenue in 2016. I don't expect that to change. We talked about how they have the Spectacles as well, and they bill themselves as a camera company. There might be some hardware applications somewhere down the road, but in terms of a scalable, high-margin business, they're going to look to monetize the Snapchat platform first, because if they can do it well, the opportunity is the biggest there.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Oh, absolutely. You can't make money on hardware. Those glasses...you might make a little bit of money, but the whole point of that is to get people to use the platform.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Exactly, yeah. And that just feeds into the idea of people posting their stories and sending stuff to friends, and making that video and picture capture a little bit easier. Looking down at their bottom line, they ran a $500 million loss in 2016, down even more from losses of $370 million in 2015. The company is also free cash flow negative to the tune of $670 million. No surprise there. It's a high-growth tech company,\u00a0very rarely are they profitable when they go public. But one thing, I don't want to nitpick too much with costs, but one line item that popped out to me was general and administrative expenses are $165 million, which is more than they spent in sales and marketing, and almost as much as the company spent in R&amp;D. And they talk about how this is attributable to headcount increasing 200% year over year, but from a corporate strategy perspective, it seems like there's sinking a ton of money into G&amp;A. I would think, if anything, the big money suck would be on the tech side, and gaining talent and pushing the platform in a new direction.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Particularly with them talking about how important product innovation is to driving user growth, you would think they would invest more in that. But yeah, overall, I'm not too surprised at their costs in terms of their operating expenses. I just don't know what they're going to do next to try to really grow the platform more. Why aren't they spending more money on R&amp;D?</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Yeah. And they're going to have to. If you look at the current valuation...we talked about how they're probably going to end up IPOing somewhere in the $20 [billion] to $25 billion valuation range. That would mean that they are trading at 62X trailing sales. Not earnings, sales. That is a huge number.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Yeah, it's ridiculous. I remember when Twitter and Facebook went public a few years back. They both went probably right around 25-26X sales. And back then, I was like, \"Wow, that's really expensive.\" [laughs] And now, 62X sales,\u00a0it's unheard of. It just speaks to the hype around this company. Of course, the valuation is going to change, and we don't know what they're actually going to price the IPO at. Right now, everything is really preliminary, and they don't price the IPO until the night before it actually goes public. And, of course, that's all a function of how successful the roadshow is. If they\u00a0can really drum up investor interest, or conversely, if they don't, then that's going to really drive what the IPO price is at. But there's a possibility that this goes higher if they have a really good roadshow, which is insane. Can you imagine them getting closer to 70X sales? Who knows at this point -- it's not impossible for that to happen. It's just insane that this company would be able to command such a premium.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0And I think another layer of context here: Were it to IPO and have a valuation somewhere in the mid 20s, it would basically be valued at twice Twitter's current valuation. According to analysts, Snapchat has more daily active users than Twitter, but Twitter brought in 5X as much revenue last year. So, when you think about what a really successful ad launch would look like, and building out the platform in a way that has non-invasive ads that don't really detract too much from user experience, and you start to get into that $2.5 billion annual ad revenue, and building on that. And they would be doing that at twice the valuation that Twitter is currently at. So, you just look at the numbers, and it's really tough to make it work, the way it's currently priced.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Yeah. There's no way I'm touching this thing. [laughs]\u00a0</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Beyond valuation and some of the user growth issues, I know that you particularly wanted to hone in on some of the stuff with voting rights with the shares they'll actually be issuing.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Yeah,\u00a0I think it's really interesting. The shares that they're issuing to the public get zero votes. Not even one, zero. A lot of tech companies have been doing this thing for a long time where they give the public shares one vote, and the insiders get these supervoting shares with 10 votes or more. That allows the company founders and insiders to maintain control no matter what. Google is probably the biggest and earliest example of this. Even today, collectively, all the insiders, between the executives and directors of Google, they collectively control about 60% of the voting power. So, public investors really have no say. If they disagree with something,\u00a0they have no recourse. Facebook is, of course, another good example, with Zuckerberg himself personally controlling about 60% of the voting power. So, he wouldn't even have to ask anyone, he just does whatever he wants. So, the question is, is it really a big deal? Investors are now used to this idea that they don't get a say and how these companies are run. The difference with Snap is that they're basically being upfront and being like, \"You don't even get to pretend like you have a say.\"\u00a0</p><p>Certainly, it's all bad from a corporate governance perspective on principle, because obviously, it's better for shareholders to have a say. But at the same time, you can see that it's worked quite well for companies like Google and Facebook. Imagine if Google shareholders had a vote in telling Google not to do all this random side stuff that they explore, you could argue that the company wouldn't be as successful as it has. There is a case to be made that this is a good thing, in some situations. But we don't know how it's going to play out for Snap.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Yeah. I think one of the reasons why I have a bone to pick with it is, you have the two company co-founders, Evan Spiegel, the CEO, and Robert Murphy, the CTO. They are the sole owners of the supervoting Class C shares, which get 10 votes. Any Class Bs or Cs that are sold are transferred automatically convert to the Class As, the non-voting shares. Anything that would happen with them, they have a supermajority, and anything that might happen would continue to concentrate that power. So, you look at these tech companies later on issuing non-voting shares, or with Facebook, deciding that they want to split its stock and issue C shares so that Mark Zuckerberg can retain his control of the company and be able to give away the non-voting shares through his charitable efforts. Mark Zuckerberg has demonstrated that he has the right combination of that tech-forward thinking and the business savvy in order to run one of the world's biggest companies and do it incredibly successfully. Spiegel and Murphy don't have that track record.\u00a0</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Right.\u00a0Zuckerberg has definitely earned some respect. He's really demonstrated that he can execute on these bigger-picture strategies and growing Facebook in the way that he has. The stock split thing is funny because, like you were saying, he voted it in personally, single-handedly. It doesn't matter if you didn't like the stock split, which hasn't actually occurred yet even though it's been approved, because he said it would happen. But, yeah, you really need to trust these\u00a0founders. And Spiegel is 26 or 27. Of course, Zuckerberg was too, a few years back. But, to your point, he just doesn't have a track record. And it's like, what has he done beyond creating Snapchat? You can't really point to any single great business move and be like, \"That was a really smart strategy, that was a really good move.\" You know? You have to have a lot of faith.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0One of the other things I'm seeing a lot of people talk about, digging through the S-1 and doing their homework on the company, is the company's cloud strategy.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Yeah, this is really an interesting topic for me because Snapchat is doing something that's really unprecedented in terms of how they're approaching their cloud infrastructure. Most of the time, when companies are launching these apps and online services and consumer-based products, eventually, when they get to a certain point, they start investing in their own infrastructure, either by building their own data centers and servers in co-located facilities that they share with other companies, or building their own. Facebook is building its seventh data center, and it's fully owned. Twitter co-locates its data centers. Snap is not doing any of that. Snap is relying 100% on third-party cloud infrastructure providers, Google Cloud andAmazon AWS. It's just crazy because the scale at which they're operating, it would normally make sense to start investing in it yourself, but Snap is content to basically continue to do this through third parties. It's not clear if this is going to work, because no one has ever tried this before, so it's this huge experiment, and there are a lot of risks because you don't get to control your infrastructure in your back end, which is incredibly important to your business, and you're also spending a ton of money. Obviously, building the infrastructure yourself costs a ridiculous amount of money. But over time, it will eventually pay for itself.\u00a0</p><p>So, what Snap is\u00a0doing is that they committed to spending $3 billion total over the next five years between Google and Amazon combined. Google is the primary provider, and Amazon is basically a backup. They're spending $400 million a year on Google. The spending commitment with Amazon ramps up, it starts at like $50 million and then it's $350 million by the end. But that's a huge spending commitment. This is, very specifically, their largest cost. If you look at their financials, the cost revenue is predominantly composed of these infrastructure costs, and cost revenue is greater than revenue. So, they have a negative gross margin right now because of this strategy very specifically. At the same time, because of these long-term commitments, the pressure is now on for the ad business. You have to grow ad sales to these levels just to keep up with it, just to break even on gross profit, before you even start talking about operating expenses.\u00a0</p><p>The pressure to grow the ad business is incredibly high, and they have almost no experience doing that. So, it's a huge risk not only operationally, but it's also a huge risk financially. If you are unable to grow your ad business enough to cover these costs, you're just going to be hemorrhaging cash. And it doesn't matter how popular the service is, if you're just blowing through money and you can't bring in enough to cover these costs, it's not sustainable. We don't know if they'll be able to do it or not, but the point is, the risk that's there is insane. They have to really turn up these ad sales just to cover their spending commitments.</p><p>Lewis:\u00a0Yeah, beyond all of the general investor interest in Snap that will undoubtedly be there for the next couple years and beyond, I think there will be a lot of tech insiders watching this decision. If it works, maybe they'll use it as a blueprint, and decide that it allows the company to be more nimble. But, you have to wonder about the company's ability to control costs, and have total control over what's going on with the IT infrastructure, because that's how everyone is interacting with their product.</p><p>Niu:\u00a0Yeah.\u00a0Everyone in the cloud infrastructure market is watching very closely, because they're like, \"This is crazy, how much this company is spending.\" It's great news for the cloud infrastructure market, of course, because it's one of the biggest customers out there. They're bringing in a lot of money, and everyone is going to see if this can really work. I mean, it's worth noting that Snap is hedging itself saying it might eventually -- in the S-1, it says they may choose to invest in its\u00a0infrastructure at some point. A few months ago, they actually poached Amazon's head of data centers for AWS. So, it's like, there are some hints that they're exploring the idea of doing their own infrastructure. But, at the same time, it probably wouldn't be for the next five years because of these commitments. So, yeah, they're still leaving themselves an out.\u00a0But it seems really risky. It might work out great. In the event that things go down -- let's say the service just crashes -- that does let them ramp down variable costs with more flexibility, as opposed to, if you spend all this money to build all this infrastructure and the service dies for whatever reason,\u00a0theoretically, then you would be stuck\u00a0with all this infrastructure you paid all this money for. Versus, just paying it as a variable expense based on usage. So, it's going to be something that's going to be very interesting to see play out, not just because of Snap, but also because of the implications for the bigger companies that are providing these services like Amazon and Google, also\u00a0Microsoft. Microsoft would certainly like to get a piece of that spending. But yeah,\u00a0I think that has a lot of implications for the broader infrastructure market.</p><p>Lewis: To\u00a0bring it back around to the stock itself and how we're\u00a0looking at it, it seems like you and I are in the same camp here --\u00a0we have some concerns over user growth,\u00a0the valuation as it's currently being reported, we'll see\u00a0what happens after they run through the roadshow,\u00a0but the valuation is a little too rich for us to really\u00a0even look at too much, also we have a lot of questions\u00a0about the competitive risks with some\u00a0Facebook and Instagram looming out there,\u00a0and possibly being able to just grab features and drop it on their installed base. Does that wrap\u00a0how we feel about Snap?\u00a0Anything else you want to add in there, Evan?</p><p>Niu: I don't think Snap's\u00a0investable,\u00a0honestly. There are so many risks,\u00a0the financials don't make sense, the valuation doesn't make sense, you get no voting.\u00a0[laughs] I don't doubt that shares will pop from the offering just\u00a0because of the hype,\u00a0but as we've seen with many overhyped IPOs in recent years,\u00a0it only takes a few months for the market to sober up. Plus, Snap's\u00a0also doing a different thing with the lock-up period.\u00a0Employees will be able to sell sooner -- the lock-up expires for employees sooner than is typical. Normally,\u00a0it's about 180 days. They're\u00a0going to allow their employees to sell at 150 days,\u00a0along with all the co-founders. So,\u00a0there could be some selling pressure as all these investors and employees cash out. The employees and all the insiders are\u00a0going to make a ton of money,\u00a0but as far as public investors go,\u00a0I don't know. It's also worth mentioning that their\u00a0stock-based compensation expenses\u00a0so far are quite small because they're still private.\u00a0I think last year it was something like $30-some million,\u00a0which is a tiny proportion of their expenses. But\u00a0when companies go public, the\u00a0liquidity event\u00a0triggers a ridiculous increase in\u00a0stock-based compensation cost\u00a0because now that stock is worth so much more. And\u00a0that's typical for all companies that go public --\u00a0right after they go public,\u00a0they have a huge increase in stock-based comp. That's\u00a0something to be aware that is coming. Plus, they're\u00a0probably going to start unloading pretty quickly.\u00a0I don't know, I just don't see,\u00a0after the initial honeymoon, how this thing can really go even further,\u00a0after it's already at such a ridiculous level. You know what I mean?</p><p>Lewis: I am absolutely with you. Listeners,\u00a0you can be sure that as details start to crystallize\u00a0and we get a better sense of what's happening with the Snap IPO, we'll be sure to do an update on this episode as market conditions clear up a little bit. But,\u00a0for now, I think that does it. Evan?</p><p>Niu: Yeah,\u00a0I think we hit it.</p><p>Lewis: Listeners, that does it for this episode of Industry Focus.

Why it matters: The app could certainly pose a real threat to Snapchat, as it will be made available and likely marketed to all of Instagram's 1 billion+ users around the world.Details: The description of the new Threads app by Facebook draws an uncanny resemblance to Snapchat. Facebook calls it a \"camera-first messaging app that helps you stay connected to your close friends.\" </p><p>This is nearly identical to how Snapchat describes its main app and core functionality. The big picture: Social media and messaging communication is becoming more private, group-oriented and ephemeral as privacy concerns mount. Facebook said earlier this year it would pivot its business toward being more privacy-centric[2] as a result of these trends. Be smart: It's notable that Facebook chose to launch the app amid multiple U.S. antitrust probes[3] into how it may be using its dominance to cripple competitors. Just last week, the Wall Street Journal reported[4] that Snapchat's legal team has been documenting Facebook's anti-competitive tactics for years in a file dubbed \"Project Voldemort.\" Our thought bubble: The move suggests that Facebook isn't too worried about whether or how launching rival apps and features could be an antitrust problem for now.Go deeper: Rivals aim to document Facebook,

So good to be with you tonight. The administration is angry at China for letting Snowden leave Hong Kong for Moscow, and even angrier at Russia for refusing to release the guy to the United States and Craig Smith says the U.S. is looking weak, and in debt so he's not surprised and former CIA operative Mike Baker, also here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Craig, let's start with you. I mean China, the idea that China can protect its civil liberties that is a laugh and a half. But you think it's because of our debt picture here at home, that's why basically we're getting thumbed - the nose is thumbed at us overseas. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>CRAIG SMITH, SWISS AMERICA TRADING CORP. CHAIRMAN: Yeah, I think that's part of it, Liz. But I also think it's a lack of leadership in the White House. I mean if we had a strong president right now, he should be able to pick up the telephone, speak to the premier of China, speak to Vladimir Putin. I mean remember when, you know, before the election, hey, after the election I can be more flexible? I remember back, Liz, when <person><nameText>Ronald Reagan </nameText></person>was our president, while he was being sworn into office, 444 days of our people being held hostage, they were releasing the hostages. Why? Because they knew they had a strong man in the White House, they did not have somebody that was just playing president, he was being president and leading, and that is why I think that they are paying no attention to what Mr. Obama wants, quite frankly.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: You know, Mr. Baker to Craig's point here. It's about restoring U.S. economic strength. You can have these grand global ambitions with your foreign policy, right? You can do - you could talk about fixing climate change and global poverty. You know people would say some people say yeah, that's what we should do. But you can't do it if you don't have economic strength at home, right?</p><p/><p>MIKE BAKER, FMR. CIA COVERT OPERATIONS OFFICER: Well, I think it's absolutely true, and I think you'd have to go back a number of years to find when our relations, particularly with China and Russia were this bad. And it really does speaks to the lack of leverage, to the lack of influence that we have, the lack of respect that we're getting there. But I don't think you can discount also the politics of this, as well, and what I mean by that is, I'm not going out on a limb by saying that, you know, this White House, screwed the pooch on Benghazi out of political fear over what a problem on the ground in Benghazi could mean for the looming presidential election, so it is not a big stretch to say that, you know, is this White House really excited to actually, despite what they are saying right now? To get their hands on Snowden, get him back here, and then have the spectacle of a trial. What all that would mean, keeping the story on the front pages ahead of the midterm elections, I think that can't be discounted when we are looking, because I hate to think that the White House is so incompetent right now that they were not able to pressure, to strong arm, to get China's cooperation.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: You know, you know, you make a great point, Mike. And Craig, here is the deal. I mean right now the Snowden case, what we know right now about it, right? Is that this was a guy complaining about U.S. surveillance of citizens. Let's be clear. We don't know if there was any leaks that he's giving to overseas countries like - counties overseas such as China. So what I'm - but the point being is that essentially this is a story line where Russia is saying the United States has been overzealous as a global cop, that we've have been overreaching, we've been overplaying our hand, but to Mr. Baker's point, that if we have an unstable United States, that means instability in the Middle East, and it gets problems like Benghazi and Libya. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Absolutely right. Mike - Mike - Mike hit it all, it's all political, look at Benghazi, we're going to go out and get the bad guys, man, well, he does nothing about it. We don't even know who told the story and the fib about, you know, it was a video on YouTube. And Mike is correct, we've had a deterioration of our relationships with Russia and China, and I believe part of it is due to the economic stress that we've had between the nations, and think about it, do we really believe that Vladimir Putin does not want to have some dominant position in the world? And if we have allowed relationships to get so bad, to where our president, the leader of the free world cannot pick up a telephone, which I doubt, and again, I'm speculating on this, E-mac , but I don't think he picked up the telephone and called the premier or called Vladimir Putin, and said, hey, I need you, guys, to work with me, let's work this thing out, we need this guy back home, we've got to find out what happened.</p><p/><p>And look, Mike and I would agree, this guy is a bad guy, he stole things from America, he is a thief at least, I mean who knows what he has given up, but again, we don't know, so why don't we work with China and Russia, to get him back and find out what happened? The answer is, they are telling us to go fly a kite, Liz .</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And they have every right to do it, quite frankly, because of the way they've been treated.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: You know, Mike, I'll tell you, it's still a striking, and no small irony, Mike, that you know Snowden is running to countries that are so against civil liberties, I mean you're going to find civil liberties in China and Russia? You know, the thing is, we said, for decades the U.S. there has been complaints about the U.S. being the world's global cop, but right now it seems to me that countries are being more vocal and more forward about their criticisms publicly in the press. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>BAKER: Right. Well, I think they can afford to do that, because again, our credibility are - and it's not even so much credibility, because, you know, it really is a lack of leadership. And it is sort of a plank (ph) position of weakness. And that, you know, Putin loves nothing more than to stick it in whenever he's got the opportunity. You know, the Chinese relationship has always been fraught with nuances and difficulties, but it really is incredibly poor at this point. You know, to your point, about what he's actually told Snowden, meaning what he's actually given up, he sat in Hong Kong and provided to the Chinese information about our national security posture towards the Chinese government. Now, you know, people have been conflating that thing, well, look, I mean, that, you know, we are beating up on the Chinese over their decades of economic espionage and stealing of our military and government secrets. And so, it is only fair play, but it's not. We're working in a different world than the Chinese are. Chinese have an economic miracle because they were willing existentially to steal everything, and so I am worried, that as with a lot of these stories, they've become so layered, that you start to lose fact - track of the matters.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: And you say, you start to lose .</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, you start to lose perspective, because China certainly is not a country with a lot of economic liberties, like we have here in the United States, right? Final word, Mr. Baker. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>BAKER: Well, again, I'm stunned, I made the mistake early on as this story was breaking to say that, you know, I thought we would get Snowden back in short order, I could not imagine that our relationship with China will be so bad that they would be willing to blow it up over letting him go, I was wrong.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: All right, Craig Smith.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Send Mike in, he'll get him.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: OK, send Mike .</p><p/><p>SMITH: Send Mike in - Michael will go get him, I guarantee you.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: All right. Thank you, guys. Good to be with you tonight. Next up China keeps getting away with hacking us, so no wonder its neighboring India is getting in on the act, and cyber criminals in that country accused of hitting the United States targets including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Heritage's Dean Cheng on how China's bad habits are spreading. Dean, take it.</p><p/><p>DEAN CHENG, HERITAGE FOUNDATION ASIA EXPERT: Well, what we're seeing right now, is to build off your previous guests, the fact that we have a weak economy. We have a president who is unable to make commitments that he can live up to. And most recently, he almost desperately invited the Chinese premier out to Rancho Mirage, and the Chinese slapped him in the face but not even willing to spend the night at the resort. They stayed at a separate hotel, to send the message, we don't trust you, and we don't think you're going to do anything if we insult you.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: All right, but if you take a step back, I hear what you're saying, take a step back. Is it getting easier for any big player to get in on the act of cyber hacking or has this been a story that's always been out there that has not been reported on? Go ahead.</p><p/><p>CHENG: It is - look. Somebody who is smart with a laptop can operate from an Internet cafe anywhere in the world, they are smart they can create botnets and they can start doing all sorts of nastiness, the problem with Mr. Snowden is, he knows all the counter measures. He knows all the things that we do to try and keep other people from being able to use that.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: All right, but stay on India, who is cyber hacking in India? And what are they going after?</p><p/><p>CHENG: I think that in the case of India, you've probably got actors who are interested in commercial opportunities, contracts, who is going to make a play for an acquisition or who would - the Indians like to partner up with. Basically, you can see the people hold cards.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: All right, is there cyber hacking coming out of Pakistan?</p><p/><p>CHENG: At this point there is probably cyber hacking coming out of every country, but I think that India simply for its sheer size, but also it's much more advanced IT capacity, is probably a little bit more of concern than Pakistan.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Dean, are you concerned that rather than these countries building a functioning economy that they are turning instead to cyber hacking?</p><p/><p>CHENG: I think for particularly countries whose economies are already rickety, places like Pakistan, places like Venezuela, they are going to look at this, as the way out. And it's not. I mean the thing is that at the end of the day if you really want to build an economy, you have to have a fully functional system, but for some of these countries, what they are really after is political. They want political control, and cyber is a way to do that. So, it's both econ and politics.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: OK. Final point. Dean, quickly, three sec - we only have a limited amount of time. Which countries are you most worried about in terms of cyber hacking the United States and their companies here?</p><p/><p>CHENG: Well, I think China and Russia absolutely lead the pack. Believe it or not, North Korea is another source, and we are probably going to start seeing more things coming from South America.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: So, the final question: North Korea is cyber hacking the United States., what are they cyber hacking here?</p><p/><p>CHENG: They are trying to break into our military, but they are also trying to break into things like our power grids and any other parts of the communications and information backbone, ways to hurt the United States, cheaply but devastatingly.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: OK. Dean Cheng, thank you so much for being with us tonight, it's really good to see you, sir. Next up, coming up how the government could force businesses to hire ex-cons. This sounds criminal, but it's true. Next, also thousands of pages, hundreds of surprises, and costing billions of dollars. No, I'm not talking about the health care law. You know all about that one. We're talking about the immigration bill that is giving businesses a lot of headaches.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SEN. JEFF SESSIONS (R ) ALABAMA: On a 1200 page (INAUDIBLE), 200 pages more than the bill we were looking at last week, and no one has read. Our senators have not had a chance to read the bill.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: All right, the Senate immigration bill is starting to look a lot like the healthcare law, too long to read, too complicated to understand. And add on stocking it at the last minute like 1.5 billion bucks in stimulus for job training. To Imogen Lloyd Webber, Peter Suderman, Ron Meyer. Ron, is this health care part two, Ron?</p><p/><p>RON MEYER, CONSESRVATIVE STRATEGIST: Oh, I think it looks like that, and for me, I think it's basically worse, because you have a bill with seemingly good intentions, and then you are just loading it up with pork, and I think that if we look at the jobs program in there, it's really not even going to help young people. And I think if a program is good, it should be brought up on its own merits. We should be talking about your unemployment and the great youth depression, but this is not the right time, immigration reform should be focused on immigration reform, and getting border security, and then figuring out how we can make sure we can take care of the folks who are here already. And that's - that has nothing to do with all we are talking about. And these pork pieces.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Imogen, to Ron's point - we didn't know (inaudible) after the fact that after health care reform was said and done, here is what was in it, 300 million bucks extra Medicaid for Louisiana, more money for Massachusetts for Medicare, money for Tennessee hospitals, and look at this, Imo, $100 million to the Senator Chris Dodd Medical Center, you are concerned after the fact when all the headlines and the media goes away that these boondoggles are shoehorned in at the last minute.</p><p/><p>IMOGEN LLOYD WEBBER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: From what I understand this has been happening throughout history on some level, though, to these bills. And fundamentally this may pass the Senate, surprisingly, but at great Dixie from the Dorothy of 70 (ph), that's what people are expecting. It's not going to pass the House, so, yes, we can be concerned, but believe me, the House are going to be complaining even more.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: So, Peter S, Imogen is not worried about the pork because it's just going to get rejected anyway. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>PETER SUDERMAN, REASON MAGAZINE SENIOR EDITOR: I think what bills like these show us is the folly of comprehensive - comprehensive reform of any sort, whether its health care, whether it's immigration. If you are worried about immigration, if you want more immigration, if you want to find a solution to the problem of 11 million people who are here illegally, what do we do with them? Then those are the problems you should be solving, we should be creating, sane paths to immigration here in the United States rather than this incredibly screwing - incredibly complicated system that we have right now. Instead, what we're doing is, you know, focusing on trying to do everything at once, that is not immigration reform, that is - and it's bad politics.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: You know, so, Ron, to Peter's point, we are trying to everything - kitchen sink this thing. Trying to do everything at once. It should be just about border security and then immigration reform. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>MEYER: Well, yeah, I think that is true. And I think that we should be looking at how to make a better legal immigration system. And I think that that deserves a debate, that deserves a focus, instead of all these other provisions, why can't we just focus - I mean it seems so simple - why can't Congress just focus on one thing at a time so the American people can comprehend what's going on?</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, but what would that one thing be?</p><p/><p>MEYER: I think that they are just trying to be (inaudible)</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: But would that one thing be, Imogen?</p><p/><p>WEBBER: Well, I have a very different view, perhaps, I am a legal immigrant. I think absolutely you need to do something about the illegals in this country, but I think there should only be a path to residency, I don't mean there should be a path to citizenship, a man (ph) - people a year, and those who come here legally, they are the ones who deserve that path to citizenship. If you came here illegally, you should only have a path to residency.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: What do you mean by the difference between residency and citizenship? Go ahead.</p><p/><p>WEBBER: So, I have a Green Card, but I am not a U.S. citizen, and I think you have to behave honorably to be a U.S. citizen, and if you dishonor the process in anyway, which you did by coming here illegally, you should never have the honor of being a U.S. citizen. You should only have to get residency, a Green Card, pay your taxes.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: So, that's interesting, Peter. So, have a period of time, where you are a residence and then earn your way to citizenship. What do you think?</p><p/><p>SUDERMAN: So, this bill does not let people who are here illegally right now become citizens for more than a decade, basically they get a provisional status, and then after a decade, after a little more than a decade, they have a chance to become a citizen. So that's actually what's either something like what's in the bill right now, is a waiting period. But look, the .</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>SUDERMAN: . for coming here.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Hang on. We know that. We know that that's in the bill. This is Imogen is talking about something different, though. She is saying that you have to turn in a good track record here before you become a citizen. Right, Imo?</p><p/><p>WEBBER: Well, I'm saying that if you came here, illegally you should not be a citizen at all, which is not in the bill.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: So, that is the point.</p><p/><p>WEBBER: You should only be (inaudible) residency.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Peter, but that's the point. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>SUDERMAN: You know, if that is what we're going to do, then what we need to be focusing on is creating a clearer and saner path to get here legally, and right now if you look at the process, we have done this in the recent magazine, we've laid it out. You look at the process for coming here legally for most people it is insane. It is incredibly complicated.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: All right. I want to bring it - I hear what you're saying. But I do want to bring it back. And let's get a fact to what we started out talking about. And Ron, you make a valid point about what happens with these bills, and that is, they become derailed, somehow, and they become a way to get votes, you have to do a buy in, right? And it becomes, of course, a big pork fest. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>MEYER: And instead of doing what I think the other two guests are actually doing on air, which is compromising, saying, and this is something that I think would pass the House, compromise where there is no citizenship, but there is permanent legal status. I think that's amendment they could pass, something that would be a good compromise. But instead of figuring out how to compromise and how to work together, what Congress is doing is who can we pay off to gets the votes to pass this bill, and that is what the Congress has become.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: I hear what you're saying. You're saying if you simplify it, and you just focus in, you would not have to have all this pork going on.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>MEYER: That is what Chairman Goodlatte on the House side is exactly trying to do.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Peter, what do you think of that?</p><p/><p>SUDERMAN: I would like to see a series of bills that make it clear that the problem is that immigration is really hard, and the problem is that we have a whole bunch of people here who unauthorized, who are illegal, that need to be legalized. And that is what we need to focus on. It's good for American workers, it's good for the economy, and that's what immigration reform should be.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Imogen, you get the last word. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>WEBBER: Well, the CBO is saying the immigration bill could save American taxpayers up to a trillion dollars. So clearly the immigration reform-</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: But they have been off with their focus (ph), though, I mean, they have been off with their numbers by a factor of 200 billion or more a year, right?</p><p/><p>WEBBER: But can the immigration reform - needs to be sorted out. You need to sort out 11 million people here who are here illegally.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: OK, good points, gang, you are going to be up later in the show.</p><p/><p>Next up, how the government is trying to make companies hire, get this, felons, ex-cons, without even knowing that they are hiring ex-cons. That is up next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. The Obama administration is suing Dollar General and BMW over alleged unfair use of criminal background checks when they try to hire workers. Now the government claims that screenings discriminate against minorities. Now to the lawyers. We've got Nicole Deborde, who says that companies should have the right to refuse hiring ex-cons. And Jennifer Bonjean disagrees, Nicole?</p><p/><p>NICOLE DEBORDE, ATTORNEY: Yes, I mean, a company should be able to decide who they want to hire and they should be able to decide what their criteria are, as long as they are legal. And looking for someone's criminal history is a certainly legal method of determining whether or not you want to employee that person.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Jennifer, what do you think?</p><p/><p>JENNIFER BONJEAN, ATTORNEY: Yes, of course they should have the right to look at a criminal background, just as a police officer should have the right to write a ticket to someone who is speeding, but it can also be employed in a discriminatory matter, and that is the issue. The issue is not whether employers can use criminal background checks. They can. But they cannot use it as a tool to discriminate in the same way that police officers cannot use pulling people over and giving a speeding tickets to a predominantly minority group -</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: But, hang on, Nicole. We're talking about hiring ex-cons who could put your workers or your customers at risk. What is fallout if companies can't use this to basically screen workers? What's the fallout?</p><p/><p>DEBORDE: Well, they can use criminal histories to decide whether or not to employ them, but the risk is if a company cannot access this information or is told they can't use the information that they've accessed in order to hire someone or not hire them, if they hire someone who is either dangerous or violent, or steals the customers' money, they could be held liable for making a choice about who to have around their customers or around their customer's money. So they could end up finding themselves on the other end of a lawsuit for hiring somebody that they did not carefully screen.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Go ahead.</p><p/><p>BONJEAN: And that is stating the obvious, really quite honestly, that is not the issue. The issue for example with BMW, for instance, is that BMW did this process they called a transitional period, and they went and they required all these individuals to reapply for their jobs, which is a dubious practice in and of itself. And after having to reapply, they found some information about certain employees, and they ended up letting about 70 African-Americans go. One woman, as an example, who had been on the job 14 years, had --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BONJEAN: She had a misdemeanor conviction from 20 years ago. She'd been on the job for 14 years.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: You are turning this into a racist issue.</p><p/><p>BONJEAN: It is.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Wait, hang on. This is not a race issue, this is about hiring workers with clean backgrounds, you are turning it into a race issue.</p><p/><p>BONJEAN: No, it is becoming a discriminatory practice, and in fact studies have shown that white people with criminal backgrounds get call-backs at a higher percentage than African-Americans without criminal backgrounds. There are discriminatory practices in employment. We have to look at them and scrutinize them. And if this is being used as tool to discriminate, it is unlawful, and it violates the Civil Rights Act.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: I hear what you're saying, and, of course, that is wrong. Nicole, what I'm saying is, we're going down the road with the ESC (ph) - by the way, it's not a rule they can (inaudible), the only way they can get their point across is via lawsuits. They basically issue guidelines, and what they do is they look for high profile company names like BMW to smack them around to make their point. Aare we morphing from this being a company should be allowed to in a free market to hire who they want into a race issue? Go ahead, Nicole.</p><p/><p>DEBORDE: It sure sounds like something that's being morphed into a race issue. I mean, the reality is that a company should be able to sue criminal backgrounds to make the choice about who they want to hire. If they want to hire someone with a criminal history background and take the chance on somebody, I am not saying that is not necessarily a bad idea, but they need to be able to make that conscious choice with the information, and that is something they should be free to do, using a criminal history background.</p><p/><p>BONJEAN: And they are, no one is forcing companies to hire people with criminal backgrounds. That is not what is happening here.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Then why are they suing?</p><p/><p>BONJEAN: Because they are using the tool as a discriminatory practice.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: But why shouldn't companies be allowed to say, you know what, I don't want an ex-con or a felon in my workforce?</p><p/><p>BONJEAN: They can say that, and if they do screening and if it's an accurate screening, they can do that.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: So you have no problem with that.</p><p/><p>BONJEAN: I have no problem with it. No, what I'm saying is after the fact, that you decide you want to get rid of 70 African-American employees, and then you use some tool to do it.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Nobody disagrees with you. I hear what you're saying.</p><p/><p>BONJEAN: But that is what's happening. The ELC (ph) is not going on and doing litigation on cases that are really --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: OK, I hear what you're saying. Go ahead, Nicole.</p><p/><p>DEBORDE: You know, it is one of these ironic situations. The government wants to get out there and brand people as criminals by charging them with all kinds of criminal history, all kinds of things that give them criminal history, and now when a company tries to use the information that the government created in the first place by prosecuting all these people and giving them a criminal history, the government gets mad, and now sues them, and says you cannot use the criminal history that we essentially prosecuted these people for and gave them a label. So they want to give them a label, but they don't want them to use it.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: All right, you two have been terrific. We've got to leave it there, unfortunately. I think we could have gone another half hour on that, that was great, great stuff, you guys.</p><p/><p>Next up, coming up, we're just a few days into summer, and as the weather is heating up, stocks are going down. New worries we're headed for a summer sell-off that will sulk you. That's up next, don't go away.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Uh-oh, you know what? We had another down day on Wall Street. The Dow and the S&amp;P both on track for their worst month in a year. No wonder, we've got scandals, we've got the Fed, we've got China, all weighing on stocks. To market insiders Ben Willis and Jonathan Murray, is it going to be a long hot summer for the market. Mr. Willis, what do you think?</p><p/><p>BEN WILLIS, ALBERT FRIED AND CO., MANAGING DIRECTOR: It will be a long hot summer. Volatility will be key word for the summer. And we're going to continue to be moved by the central markets this central government, bankers throughout the world, have China, you can't leave out the E.U., and of course, our own fed. Tapering the market with their jawboning is what's moving the market from our perspective.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Jonathan, what do you think?</p><p/><p>JONATHAN MURRAY, UBS MANAGING DIRECTOR: I don't disagree with Ben. I think that certainly we are going to see enhanced volatility, but that doesn't mean that there are some pretty good opportunities for investors out there, Liz. I think that ironically we have to remind ourselves that the risk of buying stocks today has lessened now that markets are off about 5 percent or 6 percent.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: All right, Ben, you have Federal Reserve saying, stop the market, we want to get off, but does that mean investors should say, we want to get off this ride too or should they buy the downdraft, and sit tight on some of their good stocks?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: The investors, normal tendency, the human tendency is they want to get off the roller coaster and say stop. And the fact of the matter is if you are in bond market right now, you sought that safe haven of the U.S. Treasury market in particular, you want to get off the roller coaster without a doubt. That to me interest rate risk is the biggest scare in your portfolio. On equity side, in broad market, I think that will continue to trade lower in volatility.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: How much lower?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I think another 5 percent to the down side. The China is a new one.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: So you're saying what's your bottom for the Dow this summer?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: For the summer probably, into -- well below 14,000 range.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: And then would you start buying then?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I am buying some equities right now. I don't entirely disagree. Like I said -- if -- if I'm an investor that only buys the S&amp;P 500 indices or those type of products, no, I'm not a buyer.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Jonathan, what's your low on the Dow this summer? How low does it go?</p><p/><p>MURRAY: I have no idea, Liz. I have no idea.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: We both need to sip cocktails in Bermuda. Seriously, just give the viewers some idea. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>MURRAY: I do know that there are some really good companies out there that can be had at great prices and some really great companies that can be purchased at good prices. I am still a big bull on dividend paying stocks even they are sort of out of favor right now. I think if you can identify a good, solid, high quality company with a clean balance sheet that can consistently raise its dividend going forward. That is great for all of these retiring Americans.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: The most unreconstructed bull has to agree that the market may have gotten ahead of the recovery, but there is a big broader zoom picture going on then with the world economy, right? So you have to say, is the market really cheap right now? Should you be buying? Is it historically cheap? I see numbers saying it is cheap.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I love to have more of a controversy in exchange with Mr. Murray, but unfortunately I that -- that the way that individual investor should be trading. When stocks go on sale, when there is a panic throughout the world, the same way in financial crisis that we saw, you have best banks in America on sale for $1 and $2 a share. That is when real money is made.</p><p/><p>Warren Buffet bought a chunk of Goldman Sachs and made billions of dollars because every else panicked and did not want a piece of it -- that's where you want to take a look at those stocks that have been beaten up and the dividend stocks are the ones that have taken on the chin the most --</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: So you say buy dividend stocks?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: That's where I would be putting my grandmother's money.</p><p/><p>MURRAY: I am an old fashion value dividend --</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Blue chip dividends.</p><p/><p>MURRAY: And to your point about valuation, Liz, I think it's interesting that if you -- look at P/Es it's not only measurement of valuation, but certainly its one measurement. Price earnings ratios, if you look at the p of the Dow Jones Industrial average seven years ago, it is rough where of it today, right? Around 14,000, 15,000 or so, same thing with the S&amp;P 500, but the E, the denominate or is up from $88 a share in S&amp;P 500, which is what it earned back in '07 to 110 today, so the E is up 30 percent.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Corporate earnings are coming in strong. We don't have really like the accounting shenanigans from prior bubbles. Final word, Jonathan.</p><p/><p>MURRAY: Yes. Listen, the stock market is not China. The stock market is not the fed. It's not QE. It is not tapering. The stock market is individual businesses, like fracking and horizontal drilling and 3D printing and big data and cures for cancer and other diseases. That is what you are investing in.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: A market of stocks.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: There you go. Ben Willis, Jonathan Murray, so good to be with you two. Thanks so much for you time.</p><p/><p>Guess what is back from the dead. No, not the zombies from \"World War Z,\" Twinkies! Yes, Twinkies, coming up from the grave, don't go away.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: I'm happy about this news development, a Twinkie homecoming, a movie theatre in your home, and the food police hammering -- I am talking about the Twinkie story. Jonathan Hoenig, Scott Martin here for tonight's biz blitz, so let's get to it. So first up, guess what's back? The Twinkie making its return next month after Hostess shut its doors and shut out the unions that help bring the company to bankruptcy meaning Hostess -- is the Twinkie better off without a union worker making it?</p><p/><p>SCOTT MARTIN, ACCENT ASSET MANAGEMENT CEO: Well, clearly, E-Mac, it is because Twinkies have been losing money for years now. The last thing they need is oppressive unions to take away more of those profits. But you have to guess E-Mac this may not be that tasty of an ending for Twinkie. Because, again, when you look at Twinkie in marketplace versus more organic healthier options, I don't know anyone that bought a Twinkie or a Snowball or a Ho-ho --</p><p/><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTIC ASSET MANAGEMENT: I did, I did.</p><p/><p>MARTIN: Without a mask on, by the way, you don't want to be seen buying those things.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: I don't care, I love it. I love Twinkies, and --</p><p/><p>MARTIN: I want a picture.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: You know what I'm excited about Jonathan Hoenig. We have Zingers coming back, and Ho-Hos coming back, Ding Dongs. Jonathan Hoenig, should we be saying, should the company be sending a big box of Ding Dongs to that union that helped drive -- the Hostess into bankruptcy. Go ahead, Jonathan.</p><p/><p>HOENIG: Well, they are American classics, happy they are back, Liz. Unfortunately, it was unions not the public taste that was really keeping them down. You know, in a free market there are an unlimited amount of jobs, manufacturing Twinkies, TV sets or anything that can be created. Unfortunately, it has been difficult for manufacturing companies to actually produce because the economics have to work. So it is great to see private equity investors, and job cuts, new jobs created and the Twinkies live.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: I like the company that bought Twinkies. They have all major food groups they have Blue Ribbon beer. They have Bumble Bee Tuna. They've got Pam cooking spray and that Golden's mustard, what are you talking about healthy choices here?</p><p/><p>MARTIN: Exactly. Jonathan, don't make me come over there because here's the issue. I mean, if you are asking for Twinkies to carry this company into sunset, you guys are nuts. Believe me the first day, they sell them, I think it will be great, but you know, weeks, three, four, and five forget about it.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: All right, you made your point. Hoenig you are up first to answer this question, if Disney executives are happy with \"Monster University's\" Box Office finish now. What are they going to do if viewers were able to watch it at home? This is huge a trend taking a hold overseas. Disney, Sony testing a new business model that will let movie lovers rent films at home on the very same day they are released in movie theatres. Jonathan, is this a smart strategy?</p><p/><p>HOENIG: It is terrific. Entertainment companies, Liz are innovating. Gone are days of standing in line with that big stack of grimy VHS videotapes. I mean, the whole world of entertainment from Netflix to Red Box down the line have made getting wonderful films and entertainment, better, cheaper, more accessible and more efficient for the consumers. So I think that is would be a tremendous win not only for the studios, but ultimately for the consumer who gets higher quality entertainment at a lower price.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Scott, does -- are we going to see here in the United States, we're already seeing it for independent films that you get movies on pay- per-view at same time, they are in the movie theatre, is there -- do you see any time in future, Scott Martin, where the viewer at home can watch those same movies the day they are released?</p><p/><p>MARTIN: I hope so. I think it is a big one. My VHS tapes were never grimy, thank you very much. But, I tell you --</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: They had Twinkies all over them and Ding Dongs.</p><p/><p>MARTIN: You are right, but, situation at movie theatre, when you go out and fill your tank up with gas, you have to park. It's very expensive so nowadays with kids and people staying home and save money, I think it is a great idea to stream the stuff right to their homes and not have to leave the house to see it.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Scott Martin, I know you like healthy living so you will love this next topic. You're going to answer the first question on this one. Is Pepsi caving to food police, focusing on being not just a soda company, but also expanding to healthier options. We're going to have Pepsi selling yogurt. So Scott, are you going to be drinking a Diet Pepsi with your yogurt?</p><p/><p>MARTIN: That's kind of a funny issue, isn't it? Now it's kind of the anti- Twinkie. I mean, they are going the other direction, which you got to get credit for. But, do you want to eat yogurt that's made by Pepsi. They have a longstanding reputation in soda, Frito-lay chips. I don't know if yogurt's going to sell real big for them.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Jonathan Hoenig, is Pepsi responding to the market?</p><p/><p>HOENIG: They are responding to the market. This is not an appeal to the health conscious people. The fact is that Greek yogurt is like what hot wings was in 2010. It's like what the avocado was in 2006, a hot food trend. So I think Pepsi is just really capitalizing on this. They are out to make money. I don't think that America's waistline is their number one priority nor should it be.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Pepsi is not responding to the food police, do you think they are?</p><p/><p>MARTIN: No, but, you have to fit the company or say the product into the image. Listen, I'm all for them expanding their product line. Yes, the Greek yogurt area is growing considerably, but still, if you're at the store, you think of Pepsi, you are buying soda.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: You know, I for one, dipping my Frito-Lay chips into my yogurt with my Diet Pepsi.</p><p/><p>MARTIN: It sounds tasty to me.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: I'll be having my Ding Dongs smeared over with Golden Mustard how is that?</p><p/><p>MARTIN: You go on those diets, and we'll come back in a year.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: We'll say woo-hoo with a Pepsi blue ribbon beer. Good to be with you, gang, so funny and so smart.</p><p/><p>Next up, this 4th of July, get ready for some fireworks, but not in the sky, at the super market because you know, what, your barbecue will burn a hole your wallet.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Well, the 4th of July is almost here, before you start grilling, prepared to get grilled at the supermarket because food prices are exploding like fireworks, ground beef, chicken breast, potatoes, all up significantly from last year. So you know what is up? Let's ask commodity analyst, Phil Flynn. Phil, what is going to with these food prices going up?</p><p/><p>PHIL FLYNN, THE PRICE FUTURES GROUP: You know, I tell you, it has a lot to do with a lot of issues. I think more than anything it was last year's drought. You know cost of feed for chickens and cattle went through the roof, that is one of the reasons why the price of steak is approaching $5 a pound toward the 4th of July. That is almost un-American, you know, how could you not have a thing without steak? Then chicken going up. Only thing that is flat right now are hotdogs and I guess, hotdogs is pretty American, but you're going to have to stick to that.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Let's break it down. Are you having a cheap bas barbecue with cheap food?</p><p/><p>FLYNN: Right, you can bring back Twinkies. But, you know, the bottom line is that we had a challenging year, when it comes to cattle, next year, I think they will look better, global demand will be down, it looks like we'll have a pretty get crop. The prices should be down, one thing that government continues to want us to pay higher prices they find new ways to do it, instead of taking corn, feeding it to cattle and chicken so my chicken wings are cheaper they put it in our gas tank.</p><p/><p>They will improve that that has been another thing, a lot of chicken producers are screaming bloody murder, saying you are driving up the cost of feed. It is harder for me to feed my chickens. So, you know, at the end of the day, it's going to cost us all more.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Phil, you make such an important point because we had big agricultural company executives taking at Capitol Hill and saying, you know what? This is just foolish what you are doing with ethanol and corn in the gas tank. It is not working it is making corn more expensive, and making gas prices more expensive and ruining the gas tank.</p><p/><p>FLYNN: It is, now with this rule by the Supreme Court, the 15 percent, you know, it could do damage to your vehicle. A lot of the carmakers are not going to say that warranty is valid because they didn't produce these vehicles and these engines for 15 percent ethanol. It will be a scary time, but government does not want to hear that. They think this is a good deal. It's good for the environment. Tell that to people around the world who are starving right now. It's not such a great idea.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: You know that is a concern, you know that poor people around the world, they are not getting the food supply as they could. But that point about car warranty may not cover your gas tank if basically corn ethanol wrecks it. Is that true?</p><p/><p>FLYNN: It's true, a lot is not just automobile makers, but small engine makers, you know, lawn mowers, your snow blowers. You know, a lot of these makers are saying we didn't sign for this. We produced an engine that was supposed to be protecting 10 percent ethanol. Nobody said 15 percent and they think it could damage some of the vehicles. The people on other side say, it is not going to impact anything, but tell that, if you have a problem, your gas tank rusts out and you want to get it fixed they will tell you sorry, Charlie, you are out of luck.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Why chicken? Why is it going up so much?</p><p/><p>FLYNN: It was really the drought last year. Remember last Super Bowl, I was panicked they were talking about a chicken wing shortage that was you know, a throw away item here. And then, then we have shortage. We have a big price spike on chicken wings then the prices came back down. A lot of it has been the drought. Feed cost has gone through the roof, you look at price of corn, it has been through the roof. I do think it is going to ease a little bit, but, you know not fast enough for the 4th of July.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: You say food prices are going to come down, is that your final word?</p><p/><p>FLYNN: They will come down. We have a good crop this year. China is slowing down a little bit. Pricing should come down once government figures out a new way to waste food.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: OK, Phil Flynn, thank you so much. Always good to be with you, sir. Thanks so much for your time.</p><p/><p>Next up, tech companies fighting back against government snooping, but you will not believe the next story, could it be just for show, they gave a big fat award to NSA top guy. We are going to let you in on the next big secret, don't go away.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: All right, on the surface tech companies appear to be fighting back against NSA snooping, but you dig deeper, you might come up with a different opinion because a trade group representing Microsoft and Google and the like just gave NSA Head General Keith Alexander the, quote, \"Government Executive Of The Year Award\" for this year. A weird way to express disappointment and we're back with Peter and Ron and Imogen.</p><p/><p>IMOGEN LLOYD WEBBER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Silicon Valley are in bed with the government, the former head of Facebook security now works for NSA and you look at these lobbying numbers, Facebook money on lobbies up 196 percent last year. They want the government on the side.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Here is the thing, Ron Meyer, Google and Facebook and Microsoft, saying that is terrible, we're getting pressure by U.S. to give information over, but here you have one of the biggest tech lobby groups giving an award to the NSA. Is the tech crowd, is Silicon Valley becoming more like Wall Street with the turn style between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C.?</p><p/><p>MEYER: Well, it makes business sense for them to do it unfortunately and that is the problem.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Why all of the shock, shock? You know from \"Casablanca\" on part of the tech crowd when they are doing this on the side.</p><p/><p>MEYER: You talk about two different parts of the company, one is the PR side talking with customers. The other is lobbying side talking with government. The problem is they don't want people to think that is what they are doing, but they are, from a consumer perspective this worries me, young people are furious over this that we have some companies we trust with most private information working with the government and allowing them to do the large general warrants.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Peter, does this undercut tech crowd's credibility?</p><p/><p>SUDERMAN: I think those big tech companies like Google and Facebook are really in a tough position because they have to ask themselves, is it more trouble to work with the federal government or is it more --</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: That's not my question. Is this undercut their credibility when tech lobby is giving an award to head of NSA, and we have a turn style between Silicon Valley and WashingtonD.C., with law enforcement and surveillance crowd?</p><p/><p>SUDERMAN: You know, certainly is does not make it easier for them, but that is my point.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Does it under cut their credibility?</p><p/><p>SUDERMAN: It does not make it easier for them to oppose the government efforts. So in some ways it had the potential to do, but this is what I'm trying to say they have a tough choice to make. So when federal government comes knocking on their door, they have to decide do we answer or not.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Does it under cut their credibility when they get so upset?</p><p/><p>WEBBER: Of course it does, on many levels we should have expected it. We knew, but problem is money and politics. American politicians spend over $7 billion last year, getting re-elected. They have to raise that money, and get it from somewhere. They get it from big business.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: You know, Ron, the question, I'm thinking, could the tech crowd have avoided this. Could they have -- tech crowd have gone around this, said, we're going to like we sell our information to advertisers, tech crowd makes money marketing from giving in account to marketers -- giving information to marketers, could they say we'll sell the information to the government.</p><p/><p>MEYER: Well, I think that would be a more open process, I think it -- might make people read the terms of agreement when you join these sites, if you know your information is going to the government. I feel that users don't know that, it would be a more open process.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Peter, tech crowd is feeling put in a corner. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>SUDERMAN: I mean, with question of whether or not they could have sold it, you have to ask, whether the federal government would have been willing to pay for it the issue that tech community has learned that it is difficult to ignore requests of the federal government, if you call them requests.</p><p/><p>MEYER: Quote, unquote.</p><p/><p>SUDERMAN: They are demands, Microsoft tried in 90s and found out activity easier to play ball.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: But why could they have said you can -- you know stomp your feet all you like we'll sell it to you.</p><p/><p>MEYER: Tell that to a court order.</p><p/><p>SUDERMAN: Whether federal government would have paid.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: I hear what you are saying, Ron, about the FISA court, but, you know I understand the weight and authority of the FISA court, I get it but you know, these are not you know, the lilies of the valley, they are big companies. And they are going to buckle under a FISA court order. I understand they have to comply, but do you feel they could have put up more of a fight.</p><p/><p>MEYER: I think it is a double standard, you add Google opposing internet regulation bill last year, they are companies of people, when it looks good for them, and good to be in with government they are, they are losing a ton of credibility.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Imogen, go ahead.</p><p/><p>WEBBER: They want government on their side for tax, and antitrust legislation, and legislation to privacy, of course, they are not going to turn to government say go away.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: You say, they can't, they would poison the well of goodwill.</p><p/><p>WEBBER: I'm saying they need government on their side.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: All right, Peter, final word.</p><p/><p>SUDERMAN: I guess, I feel like you know, too much to -- it may be too much to expect Facebook and Google to really put up a huge amount of resistance given their relationship with federal government, and what federal government can do to them.</p><p/><p>MACDONALD: Thank you for watching America. I hope you have a good evening.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

So good to be  with you tonight.  The administration is angry at China for letting Snowden  leave Hong Kong for Moscow, and even angrier at Russia for refusing to  release the guy to the United States and Craig Smith says the U.S. is  looking weak, and in debt so he's not surprised and former CIA operative  Mike Baker, also here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Craig, let's start with you.  I mean China, the idea that China can protect  its civil liberties that is a laugh and a half.  But you think it's because  of our debt picture here at home, that's why basically we're getting  thumbed - the nose is thumbed at us overseas.  Go ahead.</p><p>CRAIG SMITH, SWISS AMERICA TRADING CORP. CHAIRMAN:  Yeah, I think that's  part of it, Liz.  But I also think it's a lack of leadership in the White  House.  I mean if we had a strong president right now, he should be able to  pick up the telephone, speak to the premier of China, speak to Vladimir  Putin.  I mean remember when, you know, before the election, hey, after the  election I can be more flexible?  I remember back, Liz, when Ronald Reagan  was our president, while he was being sworn into office, 444 days of our  people being held hostage, they were releasing the hostages.  Why?  Because  they knew they had a strong man in the White House, they did not have  somebody that was just playing president, he was being president and  leading, and that is why I think that they are paying no attention to what  Mr. Obama wants, quite frankly.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Mr. Baker to Craig's point here.  It's about  restoring U.S. economic strength.  You can have these grand global  ambitions with your foreign policy, right?  You can do - you could talk  about fixing climate change and global poverty.  You know people would say  some people say yeah, that's what we should do.  But you can't do it if you  don't have economic strength at home, right?</p><p>MIKE BAKER, FMR. CIA COVERT OPERATIONS OFFICER:  Well, I think it's  absolutely true, and I think you'd have to go back a number of years to  find when our relations, particularly with China and Russia were this bad.   And it really does speaks to the lack of leverage, to the lack of influence  that we have, the lack of respect that we're getting there.  But I don't  think you can discount also the politics of this, as well, and what I mean  by that is, I'm not going out on a limb by saying that, you know, this  White House, screwed the pooch on Benghazi out of political fear over what  a problem on the ground in Benghazi could mean for the looming presidential  election, so it is not a big stretch to say that, you know, is this White  House really excited to actually, despite what they are saying right now?   To get their hands on Snowden, get him back here, and then have the  spectacle of a trial.  What all that would mean, keeping the story on the  front pages ahead of the midterm elections, I think that can't be  discounted when we are looking, because I hate to think that the White  House is so incompetent right now that they were not able to pressure, to  strong arm, to get China's cooperation.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, you know, you make a great point, Mike.  And Craig,  here is the deal.  I mean right now the Snowden case, what we know right  now about it, right?  Is that this was a guy complaining about U.S.  surveillance of citizens.  Let's be clear.  We don't know if there was any  leaks that he's giving to overseas countries like - counties overseas such  as China.  So what I'm - but the point being is that essentially this is a  story line where Russia is saying the United States has been overzealous as  a global cop, that we've have been overreaching, we've been overplaying our  hand, but to Mr. Baker's point, that if we have an unstable United States,  that means instability in the Middle East, and it gets problems like  Benghazi and Libya.  Go ahead.</p><p>SMITH:  Absolutely right.  Mike - Mike - Mike hit it all, it's all  political, look at Benghazi, we're going to go out and get the bad guys,  man, well, he does nothing about it.  We don't even know who told the story  and the fib about, you know, it was a video on YouTube.  And Mike is  correct, we've had a deterioration of our relationships with Russia and  China, and I believe part of it is due to the economic stress that we've  had between the nations, and think about it, do we really believe that  Vladimir Putin does not want to have some dominant position in the world?   And if we have allowed relationships to get so bad, to where our president,  the leader of the free world cannot pick up a telephone, which I doubt, and  again, I'm speculating on this, E-mac , but I don't think he picked up the  telephone and called the premier or called Vladimir Putin, and said, hey, I  need you, guys, to work with me, let's work this thing out, we need this  guy back home, we've got to find out what happened.</p><p>And look, Mike and I would agree, this guy is a bad guy, he stole things  from America, he is a thief at least, I mean who knows what he has given  up, but again, we don't know, so why don't we work with China and Russia,  to get him back and find out what happened?  The answer is, they are  telling us to go fly a kite, Liz .</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  And they have every right to do it, quite frankly, because of the  way they've been treated. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Mike, I'll tell you, it's still a striking, and no  small irony, Mike, that you know Snowden is running to countries that are  so against civil liberties, I mean you're going to find civil liberties in  China and Russia?  You know, the thing is, we said, for decades the U.S.  there has been complaints about the U.S. being the world's global cop, but  right now it seems to me that countries are being more vocal and more  forward about their criticisms publicly in the press.  Go ahead.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.  Well, I think they can afford to do that, because again,  our credibility are - and it's not even so much credibility, because, you  know, it really is a lack of leadership.  And it is sort of a plank (ph)  position of weakness.  And that, you know, Putin loves nothing more than to  stick it in whenever he's got the opportunity.  You know, the Chinese  relationship has always been fraught with nuances and difficulties, but it  really is incredibly poor at this point.  You know, to your point, about  what he's actually told Snowden, meaning what he's actually given up, he  sat in Hong Kong and provided to the Chinese information about our national  security posture towards the Chinese government.  Now, you know, people  have been conflating that thing, well, look, I mean, that, you know, we are  beating up on the Chinese over their decades of economic espionage and  stealing of our military and government secrets.  And so, it is only fair  play, but it's not.  We're working in a different world than the Chinese  are.  Chinese have an economic miracle because they were willing  existentially to steal everything, and so I am worried, that as with a lot  of these stories, they've become so layered, that you start to lose fact -  track of the matters.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And you say, you start to lose .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, you start to lose perspective, because China certainly is  not a country with a lot of economic liberties, like we have here in the  United States, right?  Final word, Mr. Baker.  Go ahead.</p><p>BAKER:  Well, again, I'm stunned, I made the mistake early on as this story  was breaking to say that, you know, I thought we would get Snowden back in  short order, I could not imagine that our relationship with China will be  so bad that they would be willing to blow it up over letting him go, I was  wrong.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right, Craig Smith.</p><p>SMITH:  Send Mike in, he'll get him.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, send Mike .</p><p>SMITH:  Send Mike in - Michael will go get him, I guarantee you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Good to be with you tonight.   Next up China keeps getting away with hacking us, so no wonder its  neighboring India is getting in on the act, and cyber criminals in that  country accused of hitting the United States targets including the Chicago  Mercantile Exchange and Heritage's Dean Cheng on how China's bad habits are  spreading.  Dean, take it.</p><p>DEAN CHENG, HERITAGE FOUNDATION ASIA EXPERT:   Well, what we're seeing  right now, is to build off your previous guests, the fact that we have a  weak economy.  We have a president who is unable to make commitments that  he can live up to.  And most recently, he almost desperately invited the  Chinese premier out to Rancho Mirage, and the Chinese slapped him in the  face but not even willing to spend the night at the resort.  They stayed at  a separate hotel, to send the message, we don't trust you, and we don't  think you're going to do anything if we insult you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right, but if you take a step back, I hear what you're  saying, take a step back.  Is it getting easier for any big player to get  in on the act of cyber hacking or has this been a story that's always been  out there that has not been reported on?  Go ahead.</p><p>CHENG:  It is - look.  Somebody who is smart with a laptop can operate from  an Internet cafe anywhere in the world, they are smart they can create  botnets and they can start doing all sorts of nastiness, the problem with  Mr. Snowden is, he knows all the counter measures.  He knows all the things  that we do to try and keep other people from being able to use that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right, but stay on India, who is cyber hacking in India?   And what are they going after?</p><p>CHENG:  I think that in the case of India, you've probably got actors who  are interested in commercial opportunities, contracts, who is going to make  a play for an acquisition or who would - the Indians like to partner up  with.  Basically, you can see the people hold cards.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right, is there cyber hacking coming out of Pakistan?</p><p>CHENG:  At this point there is probably cyber hacking coming out of every  country, but I think that India simply for its sheer size, but also it's  much more advanced IT capacity, is probably a little bit more of concern  than Pakistan.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Dean, are you concerned that rather than these countries  building a functioning economy that they are turning instead to cyber  hacking?</p><p>CHENG:  I think for particularly countries whose economies are already  rickety, places like Pakistan, places like Venezuela, they are going to  look at this, as the way out.  And it's not.  I mean the thing is that at  the end of the day if you really want to build an economy, you have to have  a fully functional system, but for some of these countries, what they are  really after is political.  They want political control, and cyber is a way  to do that.  So, it's both econ and politics.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.  Final point. Dean, quickly, three sec - we only have a  limited amount of time.  Which countries are you most worried about in  terms of cyber hacking the United States and their companies here?</p><p>CHENG:  Well, I think China and Russia absolutely lead the pack.  Believe  it or not, North Korea is another source, and we are probably going to  start seeing more things coming from South America.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, the final question:  North Korea is cyber hacking the  United States., what are they cyber hacking here?</p><p>CHENG:  They are trying to break into our military, but they are also  trying to break into things like our power grids and any other parts of the  communications and information backbone, ways to hurt the United States,  cheaply but devastatingly.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.  Dean Cheng, thank you so much for being with us tonight,  it's really good to see you, sir.  Next up, coming up how the government  could force businesses to hire ex-cons.  This sounds criminal, but it's  true.  Next, also thousands of pages, hundreds of surprises, and costing  billions of dollars.  No, I'm not talking about the health care law.  You  know all about that one.  We're talking about the immigration bill that is  giving businesses a lot of headaches.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JEFF SESSIONS (R ) ALABAMA:  On a 1200 page (INAUDIBLE), 200 pages  more than the bill we were looking at last week, and no one has read.  Our  senators have not had a chance to read the bill. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right, the Senate immigration bill is starting to look a  lot like the healthcare law, too long to read, too complicated to  understand.  And add on stocking it at the last minute like 1.5 billion  bucks in stimulus for job training.  To Imogen Lloyd Webber, Peter  Suderman, Ron Meyer.  Ron, is this health care part two, Ron?</p><p>RON MEYER, CONSESRVATIVE STRATEGIST:  Oh, I think it looks like that, and  for me, I think it's basically worse, because you have a bill with  seemingly good intentions, and then you are just loading it up with pork,  and I think that if we look at the jobs program in there, it's really not  even going to help young people.  And I think if a program is good, it  should be brought up on its own merits.  We should be talking about your  unemployment and the great youth depression, but this is not the right  time, immigration reform should be focused on immigration reform, and  getting border security, and then figuring out how we can make sure we can  take care of the folks who are here already.  And that's - that has nothing  to do with all we are talking about.  And these pork pieces.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Imogen, to Ron's point - we didn't know (inaudible) after the  fact that after health care reform was said and done, here is what was in  it, 300 million bucks extra Medicaid for Louisiana, more money for  Massachusetts for Medicare, money for Tennessee hospitals, and look at  this, Imo, $100 million to the Senator Chris Dodd Medical Center, you are  concerned after the fact when all the headlines and the media goes away  that these boondoggles are shoehorned in at the last minute.</p><p>IMOGEN LLOYD WEBBER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  From what I understand this  has been happening throughout history on some level, though, to these  bills.  And fundamentally this may pass the Senate, surprisingly, but at  great Dixie from the Dorothy of 70 (ph), that's what people are expecting.   It's not going to pass the House, so, yes, we can be concerned, but believe  me, the House are going to be complaining even more.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, Peter S, Imogen is not worried about the pork because it's  just going to get rejected anyway.  Go ahead.</p><p>PETER SUDERMAN, REASON MAGAZINE SENIOR EDITOR:  I think what bills like  these show us is the folly of comprehensive - comprehensive reform of any  sort, whether its health care, whether it's immigration.  If you are  worried about immigration, if you want more immigration, if you want to  find a solution to the problem of 11 million people who are here illegally,  what do we do with them?  Then those are the problems you should be  solving, we should be creating, sane paths to immigration here in the  United States rather than this incredibly screwing - incredibly complicated  system that we have right now.  Instead, what we're doing is, you know,  focusing on trying to do everything at once, that is not immigration  reform, that is - and it's bad politics. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, so, Ron, to Peter's point, we are trying to  everything - kitchen sink this thing.  Trying to do everything at once.  It  should be just about border security and then immigration reform.  Go  ahead.</p><p>MEYER:  Well, yeah, I think that is true.  And I think that we should be  looking at how to make a better legal immigration system.  And I think that  that deserves a debate, that deserves a focus, instead of all these other  provisions, why can't we just focus - I mean it seems so simple - why can't  Congress just focus on one thing at a time so the American people can  comprehend what's going on?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, but what would that one thing be?</p><p>MEYER:  I think that they are just trying to be (inaudible)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But would that one thing be, Imogen?</p><p>WEBBER:  Well, I have a very different view, perhaps, I am a legal  immigrant.  I think absolutely you need to do something about the illegals  in this country, but I think there should only be a path to residency, I  don't mean there should be a path to citizenship, a man (ph) - people a  year, and those who come here legally, they are the ones who deserve that  path to citizenship.  If you came here illegally, you should only have a  path to residency.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What do you mean by the difference between residency and  citizenship?  Go ahead.</p><p>WEBBER:  So, I have a Green Card, but I am not a U.S. citizen, and I think  you have to behave honorably to be a U.S. citizen, and if you dishonor the  process in anyway, which you did by coming here illegally, you should never  have the honor of being a U.S. citizen.  You should only have to get  residency, a Green Card, pay your taxes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, that's interesting, Peter.  So, have a period of time,  where you are a residence and then earn your way to citizenship.  What do  you think?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  So, this bill does not let people who are here illegally right  now become citizens for more than a decade, basically they get a  provisional status, and then after a decade, after a little more than a  decade, they have a chance to become a citizen.  So that's actually what's  either something like what's in the bill right now, is a waiting period.   But look, the .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SUDERMAN:  . for coming here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Hang on.  We know that.  We know that that's in the bill.  This  is Imogen is talking about something different, though.  She is saying that  you have to turn in a good track record here before you become a citizen.   Right, Imo?</p><p>WEBBER:  Well, I'm saying that if you came here, illegally you should not  be a citizen at all, which is not in the bill.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, that is the point.</p><p>WEBBER:  You should only be (inaudible) residency.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Peter, but that's the point.  Go ahead.</p><p>SUDERMAN:  You know, if that is what we're going to do, then what we need  to be focusing on is creating a clearer and saner path to get here legally,  and right now if you look at the process, we have done this in the recent  magazine, we've laid it out.  You look at the process for coming here  legally for most people it is insane.  It is incredibly complicated.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right.  I want to bring it - I hear what you're saying.   But I do want to bring it back.  And let's get a fact to what we started  out talking about.  And Ron, you make a valid point about what happens with  these bills, and that is, they become derailed, somehow, and they become a  way to get votes, you have to do a buy in, right?  And it becomes, of  course, a big pork fest.  Go ahead.</p><p>MEYER:  And instead of doing what I think the other two guests are actually  doing on air, which is compromising, saying, and this is something that I  think would pass the House, compromise where there is no citizenship, but  there is permanent legal status.  I think that's amendment they could pass,  something that would be a good compromise.  But instead of figuring out how  to compromise and how to work together, what Congress is doing is who can  we pay off to gets the votes to pass this bill, and that is what the  Congress has become.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  I hear what you're saying.  You're saying if you simplify it,  and you just focus in, you would not have to have all this pork going on.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MEYER:  That is what Chairman Goodlatte on the House side is exactly trying  to do.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Peter, what do you think of that? </p><p>SUDERMAN:  I would like to see a series of bills that make it clear that  the problem is that immigration is really hard, and the problem is that we  have a whole bunch of people here who unauthorized, who are illegal, that  need to be legalized.  And that is what we need to focus on.  It's good for  American workers, it's good for the economy, and that's what immigration  reform should be.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Imogen, you get the last word.  Go ahead.</p><p>WEBBER:  Well, the CBO is saying the immigration bill could save American  taxpayers up to a trillion dollars.  So clearly the immigration reform-</p><p>MACDONALD:  But they have been off with their focus (ph), though, I mean,  they have been off with their numbers by a factor of 200 billion or more a  year, right? </p><p>WEBBER:  But can the immigration reform - needs to be sorted out.  You need  to sort out 11 million people here who are here illegally.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, good points, gang, you are going to be up later in the  show.  </p><p>Next up, how the government is trying to make companies hire, get this,  felons, ex-cons, without even knowing that they are hiring ex-cons.  That  is up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back.  The Obama administration is suing Dollar General  and BMW over alleged unfair use of criminal background checks when they try  to hire workers.  Now the government claims that screenings discriminate  against minorities.  Now to the lawyers.  We've got Nicole Deborde, who  says that companies should have the right to refuse hiring ex-cons.  And  Jennifer Bonjean disagrees, Nicole? </p><p>NICOLE DEBORDE, ATTORNEY:  Yes, I mean, a company should be able to decide  who they want to hire and they should be able to decide what their criteria  are, as long as they are legal.  And looking for someone's criminal history  is a certainly legal method of determining whether or not you want to  employee that person.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jennifer, what do you think?  </p><p>JENNIFER BONJEAN, ATTORNEY:  Yes, of course they should have the right to  look at a criminal background, just as a police officer should have the  right to write a ticket to someone who is speeding, but it can also be  employed in a discriminatory matter, and that is the issue.  The issue is  not whether employers can use criminal background checks.  They can.  But  they cannot use it as a tool to discriminate in the same way that police  officers cannot use pulling people over and giving a speeding tickets to a  predominantly minority group - </p><p>MACDONALD:  But, hang on, Nicole.  We're talking about hiring ex-cons who  could put your workers or your customers at risk.  What is fallout if  companies can't use this to basically screen workers?  What's the fallout?</p><p>DEBORDE:  Well, they can use criminal histories to decide whether or not to  employ them, but the risk is     if a company cannot access this  information or is told they can't use the information that they've accessed  in order to hire someone or not hire them, if they hire someone who is  either dangerous or violent, or steals the customers' money, they could be  held liable for making a choice about who to have around their customers or  around their customer's money.  So they could end up finding themselves on  the other end of a lawsuit for hiring somebody that they did not carefully  screen.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Go ahead.  </p><p>BONJEAN:  And that is stating the obvious, really quite honestly, that is  not the issue.  The issue for example with BMW, for instance, is that BMW  did this process they called a transitional period, and they went and they  required all these individuals to reapply for their jobs, which is a  dubious practice in and of itself.  And after having to reapply, they found  some information about certain employees, and they ended up letting about  70 African-Americans go.  One woman, as an example, who had been on the job  14 years, had -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BONJEAN:  She had a misdemeanor conviction from 20 years ago.  She'd been  on the job for 14 years.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You are turning this into a racist issue.  </p><p>BONJEAN:  It is.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  Wait, hang on.  This is not a race issue, this is about hiring  workers with clean backgrounds, you are turning it into a race issue.  </p><p>BONJEAN:  No, it is becoming a discriminatory practice, and in fact studies  have shown that white people with criminal backgrounds get call-backs at a  higher percentage than African-Americans without criminal backgrounds.   There are discriminatory practices in employment.  We have to look at them  and scrutinize them.  And if this is being used as tool to discriminate, it  is unlawful, and it violates the Civil Rights Act.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  I hear what you're saying, and, of course, that is wrong.   Nicole, what I'm saying is, we're going down the road with the ESC (ph) -  by the way, it's not a rule they can (inaudible), the only way they can get  their point across is via lawsuits.  They basically issue guidelines, and  what they do is they look for high profile company names like BMW to smack  them around to make their point. Aare we morphing from this being a company  should be allowed to in a free market to hire who they want into a race  issue?  Go ahead, Nicole.</p><p>DEBORDE:  It sure sounds like something that's being morphed into a race  issue.  I mean, the reality is that a company should be able to sue  criminal backgrounds to make the choice about who they want to hire.  If  they want to hire someone with a criminal history background and take the  chance on somebody, I am not saying that is not necessarily a bad idea, but  they need to be able to make that conscious choice with the information,  and that is something they should be free to do, using a criminal history  background.</p><p>BONJEAN:  And they are, no one is forcing companies to hire people with  criminal backgrounds.  That is not what is happening here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Then why are they suing? </p><p>BONJEAN:  Because they are using the tool as a discriminatory practice.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  But why shouldn't companies be allowed to say, you know what, I  don't want an ex-con or a felon in my workforce? </p><p>BONJEAN:  They can say that, and if they do screening and if it's an  accurate screening, they can do that.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  So you have no problem with that.  </p><p>BONJEAN:  I have no problem with it.  No, what I'm saying is after the  fact, that you decide you want to get rid of 70 African-American employees,  and then you use some tool to do it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Nobody disagrees with you.  I hear what you're saying.</p><p>BONJEAN:  But that is what's happening.  The ELC (ph) is not going on and  doing litigation on cases that are really -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, I hear what you're saying.  Go ahead, Nicole.</p><p>DEBORDE:  You know, it is one of these ironic situations.  The government  wants to get out there and brand people as criminals by charging them with  all kinds of criminal history, all kinds of things that give them criminal  history, and now when a company tries to use the information that the  government created in the first place by prosecuting all these people and  giving them a criminal history, the government gets mad, and now sues them,  and says you cannot use the criminal history that we essentially prosecuted  these people for and gave them a label.  So they want to give them a label,  but they don't want them to use it.  </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right, you two have been terrific.  We've got to leave it  there, unfortunately.  I think we could have gone another half hour on  that, that was great, great stuff, you guys.  </p><p>Next up, coming up, we're just a few days into summer, and as the weather  is heating up, stocks are going down.  New worries we're headed for a  summer sell-off that will sulk you.  That's up next, don't go away.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Uh-oh, you know what?  We had another down day on Wall Street.   The Dow and the S&amp;P both on track for their worst month in a year.  No  wonder, we've got scandals, we've got the Fed, we've got China, all  weighing on stocks. To market insiders Ben Willis and Jonathan Murray, is  it going to be a long hot summer for the market.  Mr. Willis, what do you  think?</p><p>BEN WILLIS, ALBERT FRIED AND CO., MANAGING DIRECTOR:  It will be a long hot  summer.  Volatility will be key word for the summer.  And we're going to  continue to be moved by the central markets this central government,  bankers throughout the world, have China, you can't leave out the E.U., and  of course, our own fed.  Tapering the market with their jawboning is what's  moving the market from our perspective.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jonathan, what do you think? </p><p>JONATHAN MURRAY, UBS MANAGING DIRECTOR:  I don't disagree with Ben.  I  think that certainly we are going to see enhanced volatility, but that  doesn't mean that there are some pretty good opportunities for investors  out there, Liz.  I think that ironically we have to remind ourselves that  the risk of buying stocks today has lessened now that markets are off about  5 percent or 6 percent.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right, Ben, you have Federal Reserve saying, stop the  market, we want to get off, but does that mean investors should say, we  want to get off this ride too or should they buy the downdraft, and sit  tight on some of their good stocks?</p><p>WILLIS:  The investors, normal tendency, the human tendency is they want to  get off the roller coaster and say stop.  And the fact of the matter is if  you are in bond market right now, you sought that safe haven of the U.S.  Treasury market in particular, you want to get off the roller coaster  without a doubt.  That to me interest rate risk is the biggest scare in  your portfolio.  On equity side, in broad market, I think that will  continue to trade lower in volatility.</p><p>MACDONALD:  How much lower?</p><p>WILLIS:  I think another 5 percent to the down side.  The China is a new  one.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So you're saying what's your bottom for the Dow this summer?</p><p>WILLIS:  For the summer probably, into -- well below 14,000 range.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And then would you start buying then?</p><p>WILLIS:  I am buying some equities right now.  I don't entirely disagree.   Like I said -- if -- if I'm an investor that only buys the S&amp;P 500 indices  or those type of products, no, I'm not a buyer.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jonathan, what's your low on the Dow this summer?  How low does  it go?</p><p>MURRAY:  I have no idea, Liz.  I have no idea.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We both need to sip cocktails in Bermuda.  Seriously, just give  the viewers some idea.  Go ahead.</p><p>MURRAY:  I do know that there are some really good companies out there that  can be had at great prices and some really great companies that can be  purchased at good prices.  I am still a big bull on dividend paying stocks  even they are sort of out of favor right now.  I think if you can identify  a good, solid, high quality company with a clean balance sheet that can  consistently raise its dividend going forward.  That is great for all of  these retiring Americans.</p><p>MACDONALD:  The most unreconstructed bull has to agree that the market may  have gotten ahead of the recovery, but there is a big broader zoom picture  going on then with the world economy, right?  So you have to say, is the  market really cheap right now?  Should you be buying?  Is it historically  cheap?  I see numbers saying it is cheap.</p><p>WILLIS:  I love to have more of a controversy in exchange with Mr. Murray,  but unfortunately I that -- that the way that individual investor should be  trading.  When stocks go on sale, when there is a panic throughout the  world, the same way in financial crisis that we saw, you have best banks in  America on sale for $1 and $2 a share.  That is when real money is made.</p><p>Warren Buffet bought a chunk of Goldman Sachs and made billions of dollars  because every else panicked and did not want a piece of it -- that's where  you want to take a look at those stocks that have been beaten up and the  dividend stocks are the ones that have taken on the chin the most -- </p><p>MACDONALD:  So you say buy dividend stocks?</p><p>WILLIS:  That's where I would be putting my grandmother's money.</p><p>MURRAY:  I am an old fashion value dividend -- </p><p>MACDONALD:  Blue chip dividends.</p><p>MURRAY:  And to your point about valuation, Liz, I think it's interesting  that if you -- look at P/Es it's not only measurement of valuation, but  certainly its one measurement.  Price earnings ratios, if you look at the p  of the Dow Jones Industrial average seven years ago, it is rough where of  it today, right?  Around 14,000, 15,000 or so, same thing with the S&amp;P 500,  but the E, the denominate or is up from $88 a share in S&amp;P 500, which is  what it earned back in '07 to 110 today, so the E is up 30 percent.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Corporate earnings are coming in strong.  We don't have really  like the accounting shenanigans from prior bubbles.  Final word, Jonathan.</p><p>MURRAY:  Yes.  Listen, the stock market is not China.  The stock market is  not the fed.  It's not QE.  It is not tapering.  The stock market is  individual businesses, like fracking and horizontal drilling and 3D  printing and big data and cures for cancer and other diseases.  That is  what you are investing in.</p><p>WILLIS:  A market of stocks.</p><p>MACDONALD:  There you go.  Ben Willis, Jonathan Murray, so good to be with  you two.  Thanks so much for you time. </p><p>Guess what is back from the dead.  No, not the zombies from \"World War Z,\"  Twinkies!  Yes, Twinkies, coming up from the grave, don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm happy about this news development, a Twinkie homecoming, a  movie theatre in your home, and the food police hammering -- I am talking  about the Twinkie story.  Jonathan Hoenig, Scott Martin here for tonight's  biz blitz, so let's get to it.  So first up, guess what's back?  The  Twinkie making its return next month after Hostess shut its doors and shut  out the unions that help bring the company to bankruptcy meaning Hostess --  is the Twinkie better off without a union worker making it?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, ACCENT ASSET MANAGEMENT CEO:  Well, clearly, E-Mac, it is  because Twinkies have been losing money for years now.  The last thing they  need is oppressive unions to take away more of those profits.  But you have  to guess E-Mac this may not be that tasty of an ending for Twinkie.   Because, again, when you look at Twinkie in marketplace versus more organic  healthier options, I don't know anyone that bought a Twinkie or a Snowball  or a Ho-ho -- </p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTIC ASSET MANAGEMENT:  I did, I did.</p><p>MARTIN:  Without a mask on, by the way, you don't want to be seen buying  those things.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I don't care, I love it.  I love Twinkies, and -- </p><p>MARTIN:  I want a picture.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know what I'm excited about Jonathan Hoenig.  We have  Zingers coming back, and Ho-Hos coming back, Ding Dongs.  Jonathan Hoenig,  should we be saying, should the company be sending a big box of Ding Dongs  to that union that helped drive -- the Hostess into bankruptcy.  Go ahead,  Jonathan.</p><p>HOENIG:  Well, they are American classics, happy they are back, Liz.   Unfortunately, it was unions not the public taste that was really keeping  them down.  You know, in a free market there are an unlimited amount of  jobs, manufacturing Twinkies, TV sets or anything that can be created.   Unfortunately, it has been difficult for manufacturing companies to  actually produce because the economics have to work.  So it is great to see  private equity investors, and job cuts, new jobs created and the Twinkies  live.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I like the company that bought Twinkies.  They have all major  food groups they have Blue Ribbon beer.  They have Bumble Bee Tuna.   They've got Pam cooking spray and that Golden's mustard, what are you  talking about healthy choices here?</p><p>MARTIN:  Exactly.  Jonathan, don't make me come over there because here's  the issue.  I mean, if you are asking for Twinkies to carry this company  into sunset, you guys are nuts.  Believe me the first day, they sell them,  I think it will be great, but you know, weeks, three, four, and five forget  about it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right, you made your point.  Hoenig you are up first to  answer this question, if Disney executives are happy with \"Monster  University's\" Box Office finish now.  What are they going to do if viewers  were able to watch it at home?  This is huge a trend taking a hold  overseas.  Disney, Sony testing a new business model that will let movie  lovers rent films at home on the very same day they are released in movie  theatres.  Jonathan, is this a smart strategy?</p><p>HOENIG:  It is terrific.  Entertainment companies, Liz are innovating.   Gone are days of standing in line with that big stack of grimy VHS  videotapes.  I mean, the whole world of entertainment from Netflix to Red  Box down the line have made getting wonderful films and entertainment,  better, cheaper, more accessible and more efficient for the consumers.  So  I think that is would be a tremendous win not only for the studios, but  ultimately for the consumer who gets higher quality entertainment at a  lower price.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Scott, does -- are we going to see here in the United States,  we're already seeing it for independent films that you get movies on pay- per-view at same time, they are in the movie theatre, is there -- do you  see any time in future, Scott Martin, where the viewer at home can watch  those same movies the day they are released?</p><p>MARTIN:  I hope so.  I think it is a big one.  My VHS tapes were never  grimy, thank you very much.  But, I tell you -- </p><p>MACDONALD:  They had Twinkies all over them and Ding Dongs.</p><p>MARTIN:  You are right, but, situation at movie theatre, when you go out  and fill your tank up with gas, you have to park.  It's very expensive so  nowadays with kids and people staying home and save money, I think it is a  great idea to stream the stuff right to their homes and not have to leave  the house to see it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Scott Martin, I know you like healthy living so you will love  this next topic.  You're going to answer the first question on this one.   Is Pepsi caving to food police, focusing on being not just a soda company,  but also expanding to healthier options.  We're going to have Pepsi selling  yogurt.  So Scott, are you going to be drinking a Diet Pepsi with your  yogurt?</p><p>MARTIN:  That's kind of a funny issue, isn't it?  Now it's kind of the  anti- Twinkie.  I mean, they are going the other direction, which you got  to get credit for.  But, do you want to eat yogurt that's made by Pepsi.   They have a longstanding reputation in soda, Frito-lay chips.  I don't know  if yogurt's going to sell real big for them.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jonathan Hoenig, is Pepsi responding to the market?</p><p>HOENIG:  They are responding to the market.  This is not an appeal to the  health conscious people.  The fact is that Greek yogurt is like what hot  wings was in 2010.  It's like what the avocado was in 2006, a hot food  trend.  So I think Pepsi is just really capitalizing on this.  They are out  to make money.  I don't think that America's waistline is their number one  priority nor should it be.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Pepsi is not responding to the food police, do you think they  are?</p><p>MARTIN:  No, but, you have to fit the company or say the product into the  image.  Listen, I'm all for them expanding their product line.  Yes, the  Greek yogurt area is growing considerably, but still, if you're at the  store, you think of Pepsi, you are buying soda.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, I for one, dipping my Frito-Lay chips into my yogurt  with my Diet Pepsi.</p><p>MARTIN:  It sounds tasty to me.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'll be having my Ding Dongs smeared over with Golden Mustard  how is that?</p><p>MARTIN:  You go on those diets, and we'll come back in a year.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We'll say woo-hoo with a Pepsi blue ribbon beer.  Good to be  with you, gang, so funny and so smart.</p><p>Next up, this 4th of July, get ready for some fireworks, but not in the  sky, at the super market because you know, what, your barbecue will burn a  hole your wallet.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, the 4th of July is almost here, before you start  grilling, prepared to get grilled at the supermarket because food prices  are exploding like fireworks, ground beef, chicken breast, potatoes, all up  significantly from last year.  So you know what is up?  Let's ask commodity  analyst, Phil Flynn.  Phil, what is going to with these food prices going  up?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, THE PRICE FUTURES GROUP:  You know, I tell you, it has a lot to  do with a lot of issues.  I think more than anything it was last year's  drought.  You know cost of feed for chickens and cattle went through the  roof, that is one of the reasons why the price of steak is approaching $5 a  pound toward the 4th of July.  That is almost un-American, you know, how  could you not have a thing without steak?  Then chicken going up.  Only  thing that is flat right now are hotdogs and I guess, hotdogs is pretty  American, but you're going to have to stick to that.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's break it down.  Are you having a cheap bas barbecue with  cheap food?</p><p>FLYNN:  Right, you can bring back Twinkies.  But, you know, the bottom line  is that we had a challenging year, when it comes to cattle, next year, I  think they will look better, global demand will be down, it looks like  we'll have a pretty get crop.  The prices should be down, one thing that  government continues to want us to pay higher prices they find new ways to  do it, instead of taking corn, feeding it to cattle and chicken so my  chicken wings are cheaper they put it in our gas tank.</p><p>They will improve that that has been another thing, a lot of chicken  producers are screaming bloody murder, saying you are driving up the cost  of feed.  It is harder for me to feed my chickens.  So, you know, at the  end of the day, it's going to cost us all more.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Phil, you make such an important point because we had big  agricultural company executives taking at Capitol Hill and saying, you know  what?  This is just foolish what you are doing with ethanol and corn in the  gas tank.  It is not working it is making corn more expensive, and making  gas prices more expensive and ruining the gas tank.</p><p>FLYNN:  It is, now with this rule by the Supreme Court, the 15 percent, you  know, it could do damage to your vehicle.  A lot of the carmakers are not  going to say that warranty is valid because they didn't produce these  vehicles and these engines for 15 percent ethanol.  It will be a scary  time, but government does not want to hear that.  They think this is a good  deal.  It's good for the environment.   Tell that to people around the  world who are starving right now.  It's not such a great idea.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know that is a concern, you know that poor people around  the world, they are not getting the food supply as they could.  But that  point about car warranty may not cover your gas tank if basically corn  ethanol wrecks it.  Is that true?</p><p>FLYNN:  It's true, a lot is not just automobile makers, but small engine  makers, you know, lawn mowers, your snow blowers.  You know, a lot of these  makers are saying we didn't sign for this.  We produced an engine that was  supposed to be protecting 10 percent ethanol.  Nobody said 15 percent and  they think it could damage some of the vehicles.  The people on other side  say, it is not going to impact anything, but tell that, if you have a  problem, your gas tank rusts out and you want to get it fixed they will  tell you sorry, Charlie, you are out of luck.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Why chicken?  Why is it going up so much?</p><p>FLYNN:  It was really the drought last year.  Remember last Super Bowl, I  was panicked they were talking about a chicken wing shortage that was you  know, a throw away item here.  And then, then we have shortage.  We have a  big price spike on chicken wings then the prices came back down.  A lot of  it has been the drought.  Feed cost has gone through the roof, you look at  price of corn, it has been through the roof.  I do think it is going to  ease a little bit, but, you know not fast enough for the 4th of July.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You say food prices are going to come down, is that your final  word?</p><p>FLYNN:  They will come down.  We have a good crop this year.  China is  slowing down a little bit.  Pricing should come down once government  figures out a new way to waste food.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, Phil Flynn, thank you so much.  Always good to be with you,  sir.  Thanks so much for your time.</p><p>Next up, tech companies fighting back against government snooping, but you  will not believe the next story, could it be just for show, they gave a big  fat award to NSA top guy.  We are going to let you in on the next big  secret, don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right, on the surface tech companies appear to be fighting  back against NSA snooping, but you dig deeper, you might come up with a  different opinion because a trade group representing Microsoft and Google  and the like just gave NSA Head General Keith Alexander the, quote,  \"Government Executive Of The Year Award\" for this year.  A weird way to  express disappointment and we're back with Peter and Ron and Imogen.</p><p>IMOGEN LLOYD WEBBER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Silicon Valley are in bed with  the government, the former head of Facebook security now works for NSA and  you look at these lobbying numbers, Facebook money on lobbies up 196  percent last year.  They want the government on the side.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Here is the thing, Ron Meyer, Google and Facebook and  Microsoft, saying that is terrible, we're getting pressure by U.S. to give  information over, but here you have one of the biggest tech lobby groups  giving an award to the NSA.  Is the tech crowd, is Silicon Valley becoming  more like Wall Street with the turn style between Silicon Valley and  Washington, D.C.?</p><p>MEYER:  Well, it makes business sense for them to do it unfortunately and  that is the problem.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Why all of the shock, shock?  You know from \"Casablanca\" on  part of the tech crowd when they are doing this on the side.</p><p>MEYER:  You talk about two different parts of the company, one is the PR  side talking with customers.  The other is lobbying side talking with  government.  The problem is they don't want people to think that is what  they are doing, but they are, from a consumer perspective this worries me,  young people are furious over this that we have some companies we trust  with most private information working with the government and allowing them  to do the large general warrants.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Peter, does this undercut tech crowd's credibility?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I think those big tech companies like Google and Facebook are  really in a tough position because they have to ask themselves, is it more  trouble to work with the federal government or is it more -- </p><p>MACDONALD:  That's not my question.  Is this undercut their credibility  when tech lobby is giving an award to head of NSA, and we have a turn style  between Silicon Valley and WashingtonD.C., with law enforcement and  surveillance crowd?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  You know, certainly is does not make it easier for them, but  that is my point.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Does it under cut their credibility?</p><p>SUDERMAN:  It does not make it easier for them to oppose the government  efforts.  So in some ways it had the potential to do, but this is what I'm  trying to say they have a tough choice to make.  So when federal government  comes knocking on their door, they have to decide do we answer or not.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Does it under cut their credibility when they get so upset?</p><p>WEBBER:  Of course it does, on many levels we should have expected it.  We  knew, but problem is money and politics.  American politicians spend over  $7 billion last year, getting re-elected.  They have to raise that money,  and get it from somewhere.  They get it from big business.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Ron, the question, I'm thinking, could the tech crowd  have avoided this.  Could they have -- tech crowd have gone around this,  said, we're going to like we sell our information to advertisers, tech  crowd makes money marketing from giving in account to marketers -- giving  information to marketers, could they say we'll sell the information to the  government.</p><p>MEYER:  Well, I think that would be a more open process, I think it --  might make people read the terms of agreement when you join these sites, if  you know your information is going to the government.  I feel that users  don't know that, it would be a more open process.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Peter, tech crowd is feeling put in a corner.  Go ahead.</p><p>SUDERMAN:  I mean, with question of whether or not they could have sold it,  you have to ask, whether the federal government would have been willing to  pay for it the issue that tech community has learned that it is difficult  to ignore requests of the federal government, if you call them requests.</p><p>MEYER:  Quote, unquote.</p><p>SUDERMAN:  They are demands, Microsoft tried in 90s and found out activity  easier to play ball.</p><p>MACDONALD:  But why could they have said you can -- you know stomp your  feet all you like we'll sell it to you.</p><p>MEYER:  Tell that to a court order.</p><p>SUDERMAN:  Whether federal government would have paid.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I hear what you are saying, Ron, about the FISA court, but, you  know I understand the weight and authority of the FISA court, I get it but  you know, these are not you know, the lilies of the valley, they are big  companies.  And they are going to buckle under a FISA court order.  I  understand they have to comply, but do you feel they could have put up more  of a fight.</p><p>MEYER:  I think it is a double standard, you add Google opposing internet  regulation bill last year, they are companies of people, when it looks good  for them, and good to be in with government they are, they are losing a ton  of credibility.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Imogen, go ahead.</p><p>WEBBER:  They want government on their side for tax, and antitrust  legislation, and legislation to privacy, of course, they are not going to  turn to government say go away.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You say, they can't, they would poison the well of goodwill.</p><p>WEBBER:  I'm saying they need government on their side.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right, Peter, final word. </p><p>SUDERMAN:  I guess, I feel like you know, too much to -- it may be too much  to expect Facebook and Google to really put up a huge amount of resistance  given their relationship with federal government, and what federal  government can do to them.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you for watching America.  I hope you have a good  evening.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

So good to be with you tonight. The administration is angry at China for letting Snowden leave Hong Kong for Moscow, and even angrier at Russia for refusing to release the guy to the United States and Craig Smith says the U.S. is looking weak, and in debt so he's not surprised and former CIA operative Mike Baker, also here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Craig, let's start with you. I mean China, the idea that China can protect its civil liberties that is a laugh and a half. But you think it's because of our debt picture here at home, that's why basically we're getting thumbed - the nose is thumbed at us overseas. Go ahead.</p><p>CRAIG SMITH, SWISS AMERICA TRADING CORP. CHAIRMAN: Yeah, I think that's part of it, Liz. But I also think it's a lack of leadership in the White House. I mean if we had a strong president right now, he should be able to pick up the telephone, speak to the premier of China, speak to Vladimir Putin. I mean remember when, you know, before the election, hey, after the election I can be more flexible? I remember back, Liz, when <person><nameText>Ronald Reagan </nameText></person>was our president, while he was being sworn into office, 444 days of our people being held hostage, they were releasing the hostages. Why? Because they knew they had a strong man in the White House, they did not have somebody that was just playing president, he was being president and leading, and that is why I think that they are paying no attention to what Mr. Obama wants, quite frankly.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Mr. Baker to Craig's point here. It's about restoring U.S. economic strength. You can have these grand global ambitions with your foreign policy, right? You can do - you could talk about fixing climate change and global poverty. You know people would say some people say yeah, that's what we should do. But you can't do it if you don't have economic strength at home, right?</p><p>MIKE BAKER, FMR. CIA COVERT OPERATIONS OFFICER: Well, I think it's absolutely true, and I think you'd have to go back a number of years to find when our relations, particularly with China and Russia were this bad. And it really does speaks to the lack of leverage, to the lack of influence that we have, the lack of respect that we're getting there. But I don't think you can discount also the politics of this, as well, and what I mean by that is, I'm not going out on a limb by saying that, you know, this White House, screwed the pooch on Benghazi out of political fear over what a problem on the ground in Benghazi could mean for the looming presidential election, so it is not a big stretch to say that, you know, is this White House really excited to actually, despite what they are saying right now? To get their hands on Snowden, get him back here, and then have the spectacle of a trial. What all that would mean, keeping the story on the front pages ahead of the midterm elections, I think that can't be discounted when we are looking, because I hate to think that the White House is so incompetent right now that they were not able to pressure, to strong arm, to get China's cooperation.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, you know, you make a great point, Mike. And Craig, here is the deal. I mean right now the Snowden case, what we know right now about it, right? Is that this was a guy complaining about U.S. surveillance of citizens. Let's be clear. We don't know if there was any leaks that he's giving to overseas countries like - counties overseas such as China. So what I'm - but the point being is that essentially this is a story line where Russia is saying the United States has been overzealous as a global cop, that we've have been overreaching, we've been overplaying our hand, but to Mr. Baker's point, that if we have an unstable United States, that means instability in the Middle East, and it gets problems like Benghazi and Libya. Go ahead.</p><p>SMITH: Absolutely right. Mike - Mike - Mike hit it all, it's all political, look at Benghazi, we're going to go out and get the bad guys, man, well, he does nothing about it. We don't even know who told the story and the fib about, you know, it was a video on YouTube. And Mike is correct, we've had a deterioration of our relationships with Russia and China, and I believe part of it is due to the economic stress that we've had between the nations, and think about it, do we really believe that Vladimir Putin does not want to have some dominant position in the world? And if we have allowed relationships to get so bad, to where our president, the leader of the free world cannot pick up a telephone, which I doubt, and again, I'm speculating on this, E-mac , but I don't think he picked up the telephone and called the premier or called Vladimir Putin, and said, hey, I need you, guys, to work with me, let's work this thing out, we need this guy back home, we've got to find out what happened.</p><p>And look, Mike and I would agree, this guy is a bad guy, he stole things from America, he is a thief at least, I mean who knows what he has given up, but again, we don't know, so why don't we work with China and Russia, to get him back and find out what happened? The answer is, they are telling us to go fly a kite, Liz .</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>SMITH: And they have every right to do it, quite frankly, because of the way they've been treated.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Mike, I'll tell you, it's still a striking, and no small irony, Mike, that you know Snowden is running to countries that are so against civil liberties, I mean you're going to find civil liberties in China and Russia? You know, the thing is, we said, for decades the U.S. there has been complaints about the U.S. being the world's global cop, but right now it seems to me that countries are being more vocal and more forward about their criticisms publicly in the press. Go ahead.</p><p>BAKER: Right. Well, I think they can afford to do that, because again, our credibility are - and it's not even so much credibility, because, you know, it really is a lack of leadership. And it is sort of a plank (ph) position of weakness. And that, you know, Putin loves nothing more than to stick it in whenever he's got the opportunity. You know, the Chinese relationship has always been fraught with nuances and difficulties, but it really is incredibly poor at this point. You know, to your point, about what he's actually told Snowden, meaning what he's actually given up, he sat in Hong Kong and provided to the Chinese information about our national security posture towards the Chinese government. Now, you know, people have been conflating that thing, well, look, I mean, that, you know, we are beating up on the Chinese over their decades of economic espionage and stealing of our military and government secrets. And so, it is only fair play, but it's not. We're working in a different world than the Chinese are. Chinese have an economic miracle because they were willing existentially to steal everything, and so I am worried, that as with a lot of these stories, they've become so layered, that you start to lose fact - track of the matters.</p><p>MACDONALD: And you say, you start to lose .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, you start to lose perspective, because China certainly is not a country with a lot of economic liberties, like we have here in the United States, right? Final word, Mr. Baker. Go ahead.</p><p>BAKER: Well, again, I'm stunned, I made the mistake early on as this story was breaking to say that, you know, I thought we would get Snowden back in short order, I could not imagine that our relationship with China will be so bad that they would be willing to blow it up over letting him go, I was wrong.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, Craig Smith.</p><p>SMITH: Send Mike in, he'll get him.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, send Mike .</p><p>SMITH: Send Mike in - Michael will go get him, I guarantee you.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Thank you, guys. Good to be with you tonight. Next up China keeps getting away with hacking us, so no wonder its neighboring India is getting in on the act, and cyber criminals in that country accused of hitting the United States targets including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Heritage's Dean Cheng on how China's bad habits are spreading. Dean, take it.</p><p>DEAN CHENG, HERITAGE FOUNDATION ASIA EXPERT: Well, what we're seeing right now, is to build off your previous guests, the fact that we have a weak economy. We have a president who is unable to make commitments that he can live up to. And most recently, he almost desperately invited the Chinese premier out to Rancho Mirage, and the Chinese slapped him in the face but not even willing to spend the night at the resort. They stayed at a separate hotel, to send the message, we don't trust you, and we don't think you're going to do anything if we insult you.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, but if you take a step back, I hear what you're saying, take a step back. Is it getting easier for any big player to get in on the act of cyber hacking or has this been a story that's always been out there that has not been reported on? Go ahead.</p><p>CHENG: It is - look. Somebody who is smart with a laptop can operate from an Internet cafe anywhere in the world, they are smart they can create botnets and they can start doing all sorts of nastiness, the problem with Mr. Snowden is, he knows all the counter measures. He knows all the things that we do to try and keep other people from being able to use that.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, but stay on India, who is cyber hacking in India? And what are they going after?</p><p>CHENG: I think that in the case of India, you've probably got actors who are interested in commercial opportunities, contracts, who is going to make a play for an acquisition or who would - the Indians like to partner up with. Basically, you can see the people hold cards.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, is there cyber hacking coming out of Pakistan?</p><p>CHENG: At this point there is probably cyber hacking coming out of every country, but I think that India simply for its sheer size, but also it's much more advanced IT capacity, is probably a little bit more of concern than Pakistan.</p><p>MACDONALD: Dean, are you concerned that rather than these countries building a functioning economy that they are turning instead to cyber hacking?</p><p>CHENG: I think for particularly countries whose economies are already rickety, places like Pakistan, places like Venezuela, they are going to look at this, as the way out. And it's not. I mean the thing is that at the end of the day if you really want to build an economy, you have to have a fully functional system, but for some of these countries, what they are really after is political. They want political control, and cyber is a way to do that. So, it's both econ and politics.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Final point. Dean, quickly, three sec - we only have a limited amount of time. Which countries are you most worried about in terms of cyber hacking the United States and their companies here?</p><p>CHENG: Well, I think China and Russia absolutely lead the pack. Believe it or not, North Korea is another source, and we are probably going to start seeing more things coming from South America.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, the final question: North Korea is cyber hacking the United States., what are they cyber hacking here?</p><p>CHENG: They are trying to break into our military, but they are also trying to break into things like our power grids and any other parts of the communications and information backbone, ways to hurt the United States, cheaply but devastatingly.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Dean Cheng, thank you so much for being with us tonight, it's really good to see you, sir. Next up, coming up how the government could force businesses to hire ex-cons. This sounds criminal, but it's true. Next, also thousands of pages, hundreds of surprises, and costing billions of dollars. No, I'm not talking about the health care law. You know all about that one. We're talking about the immigration bill that is giving businesses a lot of headaches.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JEFF SESSIONS (R ) ALABAMA: On a 1200 page (INAUDIBLE), 200 pages more than the bill we were looking at last week, and no one has read. Our senators have not had a chance to read the bill.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, the Senate immigration bill is starting to look a lot like the healthcare law, too long to read, too complicated to understand. And add on stocking it at the last minute like 1.5 billion bucks in stimulus for job training. To Imogen Lloyd Webber, Peter Suderman, Ron Meyer. Ron, is this health care part two, Ron?</p><p>RON MEYER, CONSESRVATIVE STRATEGIST: Oh, I think it looks like that, and for me, I think it's basically worse, because you have a bill with seemingly good intentions, and then you are just loading it up with pork, and I think that if we look at the jobs program in there, it's really not even going to help young people. And I think if a program is good, it should be brought up on its own merits. We should be talking about your unemployment and the great youth depression, but this is not the right time, immigration reform should be focused on immigration reform, and getting border security, and then figuring out how we can make sure we can take care of the folks who are here already. And that's - that has nothing to do with all we are talking about. And these pork pieces.</p><p>MACDONALD: Imogen, to Ron's point - we didn't know (inaudible) after the fact that after health care reform was said and done, here is what was in it, 300 million bucks extra Medicaid for Louisiana, more money for Massachusetts for Medicare, money for Tennessee hospitals, and look at this, Imo, $100 million to the Senator Chris Dodd Medical Center, you are concerned after the fact when all the headlines and the media goes away that these boondoggles are shoehorned in at the last minute.</p><p>IMOGEN LLOYD WEBBER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: From what I understand this has been happening throughout history on some level, though, to these bills. And fundamentally this may pass the Senate, surprisingly, but at great Dixie from the Dorothy of 70 (ph), that's what people are expecting. It's not going to pass the House, so, yes, we can be concerned, but believe me, the House are going to be complaining even more.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, Peter S, Imogen is not worried about the pork because it's just going to get rejected anyway. Go ahead.</p><p>PETER SUDERMAN, REASON MAGAZINE SENIOR EDITOR: I think what bills like these show us is the folly of comprehensive - comprehensive reform of any sort, whether its health care, whether it's immigration. If you are worried about immigration, if you want more immigration, if you want to find a solution to the problem of 11 million people who are here illegally, what do we do with them? Then those are the problems you should be solving, we should be creating, sane paths to immigration here in the United States rather than this incredibly screwing - incredibly complicated system that we have right now. Instead, what we're doing is, you know, focusing on trying to do everything at once, that is not immigration reform, that is - and it's bad politics.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, so, Ron, to Peter's point, we are trying to everything - kitchen sink this thing. Trying to do everything at once. It should be just about border security and then immigration reform. Go ahead.</p><p>MEYER: Well, yeah, I think that is true. And I think that we should be looking at how to make a better legal immigration system. And I think that that deserves a debate, that deserves a focus, instead of all these other provisions, why can't we just focus - I mean it seems so simple - why can't Congress just focus on one thing at a time so the American people can comprehend what's going on?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, but what would that one thing be?</p><p>MEYER: I think that they are just trying to be (inaudible)</p><p>MACDONALD: But would that one thing be, Imogen?</p><p>WEBBER: Well, I have a very different view, perhaps, I am a legal immigrant. I think absolutely you need to do something about the illegals in this country, but I think there should only be a path to residency, I don't mean there should be a path to citizenship, a man (ph) - people a year, and those who come here legally, they are the ones who deserve that path to citizenship. If you came here illegally, you should only have a path to residency.</p><p>MACDONALD: What do you mean by the difference between residency and citizenship? Go ahead.</p><p>WEBBER: So, I have a Green Card, but I am not a U.S. citizen, and I think you have to behave honorably to be a U.S. citizen, and if you dishonor the process in anyway, which you did by coming here illegally, you should never have the honor of being a U.S. citizen. You should only have to get residency, a Green Card, pay your taxes.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, that's interesting, Peter. So, have a period of time, where you are a residence and then earn your way to citizenship. What do you think?</p><p>SUDERMAN: So, this bill does not let people who are here illegally right now become citizens for more than a decade, basically they get a provisional status, and then after a decade, after a little more than a decade, they have a chance to become a citizen. So that's actually what's either something like what's in the bill right now, is a waiting period. But look, the .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SUDERMAN: . for coming here.</p><p>MACDONALD: Hang on. We know that. We know that that's in the bill. This is Imogen is talking about something different, though. She is saying that you have to turn in a good track record here before you become a citizen. Right, Imo?</p><p>WEBBER: Well, I'm saying that if you came here, illegally you should not be a citizen at all, which is not in the bill.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, that is the point.</p><p>WEBBER: You should only be (inaudible) residency.</p><p>MACDONALD: Peter, but that's the point. Go ahead.</p><p>SUDERMAN: You know, if that is what we're going to do, then what we need to be focusing on is creating a clearer and saner path to get here legally, and right now if you look at the process, we have done this in the recent magazine, we've laid it out. You look at the process for coming here legally for most people it is insane. It is incredibly complicated.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. I want to bring it - I hear what you're saying. But I do want to bring it back. And let's get a fact to what we started out talking about. And Ron, you make a valid point about what happens with these bills, and that is, they become derailed, somehow, and they become a way to get votes, you have to do a buy in, right? And it becomes, of course, a big pork fest. Go ahead.</p><p>MEYER: And instead of doing what I think the other two guests are actually doing on air, which is compromising, saying, and this is something that I think would pass the House, compromise where there is no citizenship, but there is permanent legal status. I think that's amendment they could pass, something that would be a good compromise. But instead of figuring out how to compromise and how to work together, what Congress is doing is who can we pay off to gets the votes to pass this bill, and that is what the Congress has become.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: I hear what you're saying. You're saying if you simplify it, and you just focus in, you would not have to have all this pork going on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MEYER: That is what Chairman Goodlatte on the House side is exactly trying to do.</p><p>MACDONALD: Peter, what do you think of that?</p><p>SUDERMAN: I would like to see a series of bills that make it clear that the problem is that immigration is really hard, and the problem is that we have a whole bunch of people here who unauthorized, who are illegal, that need to be legalized. And that is what we need to focus on. It's good for American workers, it's good for the economy, and that's what immigration reform should be.</p><p>MACDONALD: Imogen, you get the last word. Go ahead.</p><p>WEBBER: Well, the CBO is saying the immigration bill could save American taxpayers up to a trillion dollars. So clearly the immigration reform-</p><p>MACDONALD: But they have been off with their focus (ph), though, I mean, they have been off with their numbers by a factor of 200 billion or more a year, right?</p><p>WEBBER: But can the immigration reform - needs to be sorted out. You need to sort out 11 million people here who are here illegally.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, good points, gang, you are going to be up later in the show.</p><p>Next up, how the government is trying to make companies hire, get this, felons, ex-cons, without even knowing that they are hiring ex-cons. That is up next.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. The Obama administration is suing Dollar General and BMW over alleged unfair use of criminal background checks when they try to hire workers. Now the government claims that screenings discriminate against minorities. Now to the lawyers. We've got Nicole Deborde, who says that companies should have the right to refuse hiring ex-cons. And Jennifer Bonjean disagrees, Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE DEBORDE, ATTORNEY: Yes, I mean, a company should be able to decide who they want to hire and they should be able to decide what their criteria are, as long as they are legal. And looking for someone's criminal history is a certainly legal method of determining whether or not you want to employee that person.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jennifer, what do you think?</p><p>JENNIFER BONJEAN, ATTORNEY: Yes, of course they should have the right to look at a criminal background, just as a police officer should have the right to write a ticket to someone who is speeding, but it can also be employed in a discriminatory matter, and that is the issue. The issue is not whether employers can use criminal background checks. They can. But they cannot use it as a tool to discriminate in the same way that police officers cannot use pulling people over and giving a speeding tickets to a predominantly minority group -</p><p>MACDONALD: But, hang on, Nicole. We're talking about hiring ex-cons who could put your workers or your customers at risk. What is fallout if companies can't use this to basically screen workers? What's the fallout?</p><p>DEBORDE: Well, they can use criminal histories to decide whether or not to employ them, but the risk is if a company cannot access this information or is told they can't use the information that they've accessed in order to hire someone or not hire them, if they hire someone who is either dangerous or violent, or steals the customers' money, they could be held liable for making a choice about who to have around their customers or around their customer's money. So they could end up finding themselves on the other end of a lawsuit for hiring somebody that they did not carefully screen.</p><p>MACDONALD: Go ahead.</p><p>BONJEAN: And that is stating the obvious, really quite honestly, that is not the issue. The issue for example with BMW, for instance, is that BMW did this process they called a transitional period, and they went and they required all these individuals to reapply for their jobs, which is a dubious practice in and of itself. And after having to reapply, they found some information about certain employees, and they ended up letting about 70 African-Americans go. One woman, as an example, who had been on the job 14 years, had --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BONJEAN: She had a misdemeanor conviction from 20 years ago. She'd been on the job for 14 years.</p><p>MACDONALD: You are turning this into a racist issue.</p><p>BONJEAN: It is.</p><p>MACDONALD: Wait, hang on. This is not a race issue, this is about hiring workers with clean backgrounds, you are turning it into a race issue.</p><p>BONJEAN: No, it is becoming a discriminatory practice, and in fact studies have shown that white people with criminal backgrounds get call-backs at a higher percentage than African-Americans without criminal backgrounds. There are discriminatory practices in employment. We have to look at them and scrutinize them. And if this is being used as tool to discriminate, it is unlawful, and it violates the Civil Rights Act.</p><p>MACDONALD: I hear what you're saying, and, of course, that is wrong. Nicole, what I'm saying is, we're going down the road with the ESC (ph) - by the way, it's not a rule they can (inaudible), the only way they can get their point across is via lawsuits. They basically issue guidelines, and what they do is they look for high profile company names like BMW to smack them around to make their point. Aare we morphing from this being a company should be allowed to in a free market to hire who they want into a race issue? Go ahead, Nicole.</p><p>DEBORDE: It sure sounds like something that's being morphed into a race issue. I mean, the reality is that a company should be able to sue criminal backgrounds to make the choice about who they want to hire. If they want to hire someone with a criminal history background and take the chance on somebody, I am not saying that is not necessarily a bad idea, but they need to be able to make that conscious choice with the information, and that is something they should be free to do, using a criminal history background.</p><p>BONJEAN: And they are, no one is forcing companies to hire people with criminal backgrounds. That is not what is happening here.</p><p>MACDONALD: Then why are they suing?</p><p>BONJEAN: Because they are using the tool as a discriminatory practice.</p><p>MACDONALD: But why shouldn't companies be allowed to say, you know what, I don't want an ex-con or a felon in my workforce?</p><p>BONJEAN: They can say that, and if they do screening and if it's an accurate screening, they can do that.</p><p>MACDONALD: So you have no problem with that.</p><p>BONJEAN: I have no problem with it. No, what I'm saying is after the fact, that you decide you want to get rid of 70 African-American employees, and then you use some tool to do it.</p><p>MACDONALD: Nobody disagrees with you. I hear what you're saying.</p><p>BONJEAN: But that is what's happening. The ELC (ph) is not going on and doing litigation on cases that are really --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, I hear what you're saying. Go ahead, Nicole.</p><p>DEBORDE: You know, it is one of these ironic situations. The government wants to get out there and brand people as criminals by charging them with all kinds of criminal history, all kinds of things that give them criminal history, and now when a company tries to use the information that the government created in the first place by prosecuting all these people and giving them a criminal history, the government gets mad, and now sues them, and says you cannot use the criminal history that we essentially prosecuted these people for and gave them a label. So they want to give them a label, but they don't want them to use it.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, you two have been terrific. We've got to leave it there, unfortunately. I think we could have gone another half hour on that, that was great, great stuff, you guys.</p><p>Next up, coming up, we're just a few days into summer, and as the weather is heating up, stocks are going down. New worries we're headed for a summer sell-off that will sulk you. That's up next, don't go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: Uh-oh, you know what? We had another down day on Wall Street. The Dow and the S&amp;P both on track for their worst month in a year. No wonder, we've got scandals, we've got the Fed, we've got China, all weighing on stocks. To market insiders Ben Willis and Jonathan Murray, is it going to be a long hot summer for the market. Mr. Willis, what do you think?</p><p>BEN WILLIS, ALBERT FRIED AND CO., MANAGING DIRECTOR: It will be a long hot summer. Volatility will be key word for the summer. And we're going to continue to be moved by the central markets this central government, bankers throughout the world, have China, you can't leave out the E.U., and of course, our own fed. Tapering the market with their jawboning is what's moving the market from our perspective.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jonathan, what do you think?</p><p>JONATHAN MURRAY, UBS MANAGING DIRECTOR: I don't disagree with Ben. I think that certainly we are going to see enhanced volatility, but that doesn't mean that there are some pretty good opportunities for investors out there, Liz. I think that ironically we have to remind ourselves that the risk of buying stocks today has lessened now that markets are off about 5 percent or 6 percent.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, Ben, you have Federal Reserve saying, stop the market, we want to get off, but does that mean investors should say, we want to get off this ride too or should they buy the downdraft, and sit tight on some of their good stocks?</p><p>WILLIS: The investors, normal tendency, the human tendency is they want to get off the roller coaster and say stop. And the fact of the matter is if you are in bond market right now, you sought that safe haven of the U.S. Treasury market in particular, you want to get off the roller coaster without a doubt. That to me interest rate risk is the biggest scare in your portfolio. On equity side, in broad market, I think that will continue to trade lower in volatility.</p><p>MACDONALD: How much lower?</p><p>WILLIS: I think another 5 percent to the down side. The China is a new one.</p><p>MACDONALD: So you're saying what's your bottom for the Dow this summer?</p><p>WILLIS: For the summer probably, into -- well below 14,000 range.</p><p>MACDONALD: And then would you start buying then?</p><p>WILLIS: I am buying some equities right now. I don't entirely disagree. Like I said -- if -- if I'm an investor that only buys the S&amp;P 500 indices or those type of products, no, I'm not a buyer.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jonathan, what's your low on the Dow this summer? How low does it go?</p><p>MURRAY: I have no idea, Liz. I have no idea.</p><p>MACDONALD: We both need to sip cocktails in Bermuda. Seriously, just give the viewers some idea. Go ahead.</p><p>MURRAY: I do know that there are some really good companies out there that can be had at great prices and some really great companies that can be purchased at good prices. I am still a big bull on dividend paying stocks even they are sort of out of favor right now. I think if you can identify a good, solid, high quality company with a clean balance sheet that can consistently raise its dividend going forward. That is great for all of these retiring Americans.</p><p>MACDONALD: The most unreconstructed bull has to agree that the market may have gotten ahead of the recovery, but there is a big broader zoom picture going on then with the world economy, right? So you have to say, is the market really cheap right now? Should you be buying? Is it historically cheap? I see numbers saying it is cheap.</p><p>WILLIS: I love to have more of a controversy in exchange with Mr. Murray, but unfortunately I that -- that the way that individual investor should be trading. When stocks go on sale, when there is a panic throughout the world, the same way in financial crisis that we saw, you have best banks in America on sale for $1 and $2 a share. That is when real money is made.</p><p>Warren Buffet bought a chunk of Goldman Sachs and made billions of dollars because every else panicked and did not want a piece of it -- that's where you want to take a look at those stocks that have been beaten up and the dividend stocks are the ones that have taken on the chin the most --</p><p>MACDONALD: So you say buy dividend stocks?</p><p>WILLIS: That's where I would be putting my grandmother's money.</p><p>MURRAY: I am an old fashion value dividend --</p><p>MACDONALD: Blue chip dividends.</p><p>MURRAY: And to your point about valuation, Liz, I think it's interesting that if you -- look at P/Es it's not only measurement of valuation, but certainly its one measurement. Price earnings ratios, if you look at the p of the Dow Jones Industrial average seven years ago, it is rough where of it today, right? Around 14,000, 15,000 or so, same thing with the S&amp;P 500, but the E, the denominate or is up from $88 a share in S&amp;P 500, which is what it earned back in '07 to 110 today, so the E is up 30 percent.</p><p>MACDONALD: Corporate earnings are coming in strong. We don't have really like the accounting shenanigans from prior bubbles. Final word, Jonathan.</p><p>MURRAY: Yes. Listen, the stock market is not China. The stock market is not the fed. It's not QE. It is not tapering. The stock market is individual businesses, like fracking and horizontal drilling and 3D printing and big data and cures for cancer and other diseases. That is what you are investing in.</p><p>WILLIS: A market of stocks.</p><p>MACDONALD: There you go. Ben Willis, Jonathan Murray, so good to be with you two. Thanks so much for you time.</p><p>Guess what is back from the dead. No, not the zombies from \"World War Z,\" Twinkies! Yes, Twinkies, coming up from the grave, don't go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: I'm happy about this news development, a Twinkie homecoming, a movie theatre in your home, and the food police hammering -- I am talking about the Twinkie story. Jonathan Hoenig, Scott Martin here for tonight`s biz blitz, so let's get to it. So first up, guess what's back? The Twinkie making its return next month after Hostess shut its doors and shut out the unions that help bring the company to bankruptcy meaning Hostess -- is the Twinkie better off without a union worker making it?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, ACCENT ASSET MANAGEMENT CEO: Well, clearly, E-Mac, it is because Twinkies have been losing money for years now. The last thing they need is oppressive unions to take away more of those profits. But you have to guess E-Mac this may not be that tasty of an ending for Twinkie. Because, again, when you look at Twinkie in marketplace versus more organic healthier options, I don't know anyone that bought a Twinkie or a Snowball or a Ho-ho --</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTIC ASSET MANAGEMENT: I did, I did.</p><p>MARTIN: Without a mask on, by the way, you don't want to be seen buying those things.</p><p>MACDONALD: I don't care, I love it. I love Twinkies, and --</p><p>MARTIN: I want a picture.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know what I'm excited about Jonathan Hoenig. We have Zingers coming back, and Ho-Hos coming back, Ding Dongs. Jonathan Hoenig, should we be saying, should the company be sending a big box of Ding Dongs to that union that helped drive -- the Hostess into bankruptcy. Go ahead, Jonathan.</p><p>HOENIG: Well, they are American classics, happy they are back, Liz. Unfortunately, it was unions not the public taste that was really keeping them down. You know, in a free market there are an unlimited amount of jobs, manufacturing Twinkies, TV sets or anything that can be created. Unfortunately, it has been difficult for manufacturing companies to actually produce because the economics have to work. So it is great to see private equity investors, and job cuts, new jobs created and the Twinkies live.</p><p>MACDONALD: I like the company that bought Twinkies. They have all major food groups they have Blue Ribbon beer. They have Bumble Bee Tuna. They've got Pam cooking spray and that Golden's mustard, what are you talking about healthy choices here?</p><p>MARTIN: Exactly. Jonathan, don't make me come over there because here's the issue. I mean, if you are asking for Twinkies to carry this company into sunset, you guys are nuts. Believe me the first day, they sell them, I think it will be great, but you know, weeks, three, four, and five forget about it.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, you made your point. Hoenig you are up first to answer this question, if Disney executives are happy with \"Monster University's\" Box Office finish now. What are they going to do if viewers were able to watch it at home? This is huge a trend taking a hold overseas. Disney, Sony testing a new business model that will let movie lovers rent films at home on the very same day they are released in movie theatres. Jonathan, is this a smart strategy?</p><p>HOENIG: It is terrific. Entertainment companies, Liz are innovating. Gone are days of standing in line with that big stack of grimy VHS videotapes. I mean, the whole world of entertainment from Netflix to Red Box down the line have made getting wonderful films and entertainment, better, cheaper, more accessible and more efficient for the consumers. So I think that is would be a tremendous win not only for the studios, but ultimately for the consumer who gets higher quality entertainment at a lower price.</p><p>MACDONALD: Scott, does -- are we going to see here in the United States, we're already seeing it for independent films that you get movies on pay- per-view at same time, they are in the movie theatre, is there -- do you see any time in future, Scott Martin, where the viewer at home can watch those same movies the day they are released?</p><p>MARTIN: I hope so. I think it is a big one. My VHS tapes were never grimy, thank you very much. But, I tell you --</p><p>MACDONALD: They had Twinkies all over them and Ding Dongs.</p><p>MARTIN: You are right, but, situation at movie theatre, when you go out and fill your tank up with gas, you have to park. It's very expensive so nowadays with kids and people staying home and save money, I think it is a great idea to stream the stuff right to their homes and not have to leave the house to see it.</p><p>MACDONALD: Scott Martin, I know you like healthy living so you will love this next topic. You're going to answer the first question on this one. Is Pepsi caving to food police, focusing on being not just a soda company, but also expanding to healthier options. We're going to have Pepsi selling yogurt. So Scott, are you going to be drinking a Diet Pepsi with your yogurt?</p><p>MARTIN: That's kind of a funny issue, isn't it? Now it's kind of the anti- Twinkie. I mean, they are going the other direction, which you got to get credit for. But, do you want to eat yogurt that's made by Pepsi. They have a longstanding reputation in soda, Frito-lay chips. I don't know if yogurt's going to sell real big for them.</p><p>MACDONALD: Jonathan Hoenig, is Pepsi responding to the market?</p><p>HOENIG: They are responding to the market. This is not an appeal to the health conscious people. The fact is that Greek yogurt is like what hot wings was in 2010. It's like what the avocado was in 2006, a hot food trend. So I think Pepsi is just really capitalizing on this. They are out to make money. I don't think that America's waistline is their number one priority nor should it be.</p><p>MACDONALD: Pepsi is not responding to the food police, do you think they are?</p><p>MARTIN: No, but, you have to fit the company or say the product into the image. Listen, I'm all for them expanding their product line. Yes, the Greek yogurt area is growing considerably, but still, if you're at the store, you think of Pepsi, you are buying soda.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, I for one, dipping my Frito-Lay chips into my yogurt with my Diet Pepsi.</p><p>MARTIN: It sounds tasty to me.</p><p>MACDONALD: I'll be having my Ding Dongs smeared over with Golden Mustard how is that?</p><p>MARTIN: You go on those diets, and we'll come back in a year.</p><p>MACDONALD: We'll say woo-hoo with a Pepsi blue ribbon beer. Good to be with you, gang, so funny and so smart.</p><p>Next up, this 4th of July, get ready for some fireworks, but not in the sky, at the super market because you know, what, your barbecue will burn a hole your wallet.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, the 4th of July is almost here, before you start grilling, prepared to get grilled at the supermarket because food prices are exploding like fireworks, ground beef, chicken breast, potatoes, all up significantly from last year. So you know what is up? Let's ask commodity analyst, Phil Flynn. Phil, what is going to with these food prices going up?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, THE PRICE FUTURES GROUP: You know, I tell you, it has a lot to do with a lot of issues. I think more than anything it was last year's drought. You know cost of feed for chickens and cattle went through the roof, that is one of the reasons why the price of steak is approaching $5 a pound toward the 4th of July. That is almost un-American, you know, how could you not have a thing without steak? Then chicken going up. Only thing that is flat right now are hotdogs and I guess, hotdogs is pretty American, but you're going to have to stick to that.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's break it down. Are you having a cheap bas barbecue with cheap food?</p><p>FLYNN: Right, you can bring back Twinkies. But, you know, the bottom line is that we had a challenging year, when it comes to cattle, next year, I think they will look better, global demand will be down, it looks like we'll have a pretty get crop. The prices should be down, one thing that government continues to want us to pay higher prices they find new ways to do it, instead of taking corn, feeding it to cattle and chicken so my chicken wings are cheaper they put it in our gas tank.</p><p>They will improve that that has been another thing, a lot of chicken producers are screaming bloody murder, saying you are driving up the cost of feed. It is harder for me to feed my chickens. So, you know, at the end of the day, it's going to cost us all more.</p><p>MACDONALD: Phil, you make such an important point because we had big agricultural company executives taking at Capitol Hill and saying, you know what? This is just foolish what you are doing with ethanol and corn in the gas tank. It is not working it is making corn more expensive, and making gas prices more expensive and ruining the gas tank.</p><p>FLYNN: It is, now with this rule by the Supreme Court, the 15 percent, you know, it could do damage to your vehicle. A lot of the carmakers are not going to say that warranty is valid because they didn't produce these vehicles and these engines for 15 percent ethanol. It will be a scary time, but government does not want to hear that. They think this is a good deal. It's good for the environment. Tell that to people around the world who are starving right now. It's not such a great idea.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know that is a concern, you know that poor people around the world, they are not getting the food supply as they could. But that point about car warranty may not cover your gas tank if basically corn ethanol wrecks it. Is that true?</p><p>FLYNN: It's true, a lot is not just automobile makers, but small engine makers, you know, lawn mowers, your snow blowers. You know, a lot of these makers are saying we didn't sign for this. We produced an engine that was supposed to be protecting 10 percent ethanol. Nobody said 15 percent and they think it could damage some of the vehicles. The people on other side say, it is not going to impact anything, but tell that, if you have a problem, your gas tank rusts out and you want to get it fixed they will tell you sorry, Charlie, you are out of luck.</p><p>MACDONALD: Why chicken? Why is it going up so much?</p><p>FLYNN: It was really the drought last year. Remember last Super Bowl, I was panicked they were talking about a chicken wing shortage that was you know, a throw away item here. And then, then we have shortage. We have a big price spike on chicken wings then the prices came back down. A lot of it has been the drought. Feed cost has gone through the roof, you look at price of corn, it has been through the roof. I do think it is going to ease a little bit, but, you know not fast enough for the 4th of July.</p><p>MACDONALD: You say food prices are going to come down, is that your final word?</p><p>FLYNN: They will come down. We have a good crop this year. China is slowing down a little bit. Pricing should come down once government figures out a new way to waste food.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, Phil Flynn, thank you so much. Always good to be with you, sir. Thanks so much for your time.</p><p>Next up, tech companies fighting back against government snooping, but you will not believe the next story, could it be just for show, they gave a big fat award to NSA top guy. We are going to let you in on the next big secret, don't go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, on the surface tech companies appear to be fighting back against NSA snooping, but you dig deeper, you might come up with a different opinion because a trade group representing Microsoft and Google and the like just gave NSA Head General Keith Alexander the, quote, \"Government Executive Of The Year Award\" for this year. A weird way to express disappointment and we're back with Peter and Ron and Imogen.</p><p>IMOGEN LLOYD WEBBER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Silicon Valley are in bed with the government, the former head of Facebook security now works for NSA and you look at these lobbying numbers, Facebook money on lobbies up 196 percent last year. They want the government on the side.</p><p>MACDONALD: Here is the thing, Ron Meyer, Google and Facebook and Microsoft, saying that is terrible, we're getting pressure by U.S. to give information over, but here you have one of the biggest tech lobby groups giving an award to the NSA. Is the tech crowd, is Silicon Valley becoming more like Wall Street with the turn style between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C.?</p><p>MEYER: Well, it makes business sense for them to do it unfortunately and that is the problem.</p><p>MACDONALD: Why all of the shock, shock? You know from \"Casablanca\" on part of the tech crowd when they are doing this on the side.</p><p>MEYER: You talk about two different parts of the company, one is the PR side talking with customers. The other is lobbying side talking with government. The problem is they don't want people to think that is what they are doing, but they are, from a consumer perspective this worries me, young people are furious over this that we have some companies we trust with most private information working with the government and allowing them to do the large general warrants.</p><p>MACDONALD: Peter, does this undercut tech crowd's credibility?</p><p>SUDERMAN: I think those big tech companies like Google and Facebook are really in a tough position because they have to ask themselves, is it more trouble to work with the federal government or is it more --</p><p>MACDONALD: That's not my question. Is this undercut their credibility when tech lobby is giving an award to head of NSA, and we have a turn style between Silicon Valley and Washington D.C., with law enforcement and surveillance crowd?</p><p>SUDERMAN: You know, certainly is does not make it easier for them, but that is my point.</p><p>MACDONALD: Does it under cut their credibility?</p><p>SUDERMAN: It does not make it easier for them to oppose the government efforts. So in some ways it had the potential to do, but this is what I'm trying to say they have a tough choice to make. So when federal government comes knocking on their door, they have to decide do we answer or not.</p><p>MACDONALD: Does it under cut their credibility when they get so upset?</p><p>WEBBER: Of course it does, on many levels we should have expected it. We knew, but problem is money and politics. American politicians spend over $7 billion last year, getting re-elected. They have to raise that money, and get it from somewhere. They get it from big business.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Ron, the question, I'm thinking, could the tech crowd have avoided this. Could they have -- tech crowd have gone around this, said, we're going to like we sell our information to advertisers, tech crowd makes money marketing from giving in account to marketers -- giving information to marketers, could they say we'll sell the information to the government.</p><p>MEYER: Well, I think that would be a more open process, I think it -- might make people read the terms of agreement when you join these sites, if you know your information is going to the government. I feel that users don't know that, it would be a more open process.</p><p>MACDONALD: Peter, tech crowd is feeling put in a corner. Go ahead.</p><p>SUDERMAN: I mean, with question of whether or not they could have sold it, you have to ask, whether the federal government would have been willing to pay for it the issue that tech community has learned that it is difficult to ignore requests of the federal government, if you call them requests.</p><p>MEYER: Quote, unquote.</p><p>SUDERMAN: They are demands, Microsoft tried in 90s and found out activity easier to play ball.</p><p>MACDONALD: But why could they have said you can -- you know stomp your feet all you like we'll sell it to you.</p><p>MEYER: Tell that to a court order.</p><p>SUDERMAN: Whether federal government would have paid.</p><p>MACDONALD: I hear what you are saying, Ron, about the FISA court, but, you know I understand the weight and authority of the FISA court, I get it but you know, these are not you know, the lilies of the valley, they are big companies. And they are going to buckle under a FISA court order. I understand they have to comply, but do you feel they could have put up more of a fight.</p><p>MEYER: I think it is a double standard, you add Google opposing internet regulation bill last year, they are companies of people, when it looks good for them, and good to be in with government they are, they are losing a ton of credibility.</p><p>MACDONALD: Imogen, go ahead.</p><p>WEBBER: They want government on their side for tax, and antitrust legislation, and legislation to privacy, of course, they are not going to turn to government say go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: You say, they can't, they would poison the well of goodwill.</p><p>WEBBER: I'm saying they need government on their side.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, Peter, final word.</p><p>SUDERMAN: I guess, I feel like you know, too much to -- it may be too much to expect Facebook and Google to really put up a huge amount of resistance given their relationship with federal government, and what federal government can do to them.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you for watching America. I hope you have a good evening.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAVUTO-2013062401cb223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAVUTO2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58RJ-T5M1-JB20-G4W0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">347932</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8166\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CAVUTO</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>June 24, 2013 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Espionage</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Food and Beverages</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Security</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000868</classCode><className>HOSTAGE TAKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000CA2H</classCode><className>POVERTY &amp; HOMELESSNESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009VZZ</classCode><className>RONALD REAGAN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>PE000DCSC</classCode><className>EDWARD SNOWDEN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE0009U46</classCode><className>VLADIMIR PUTIN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE000A5DL</classCode><className>NEIL CAVUTO</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX266</classCode><className>MOSCOW, RUSSIAN FEDERATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC302</classCode><className>CHINA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC578</classCode><className>RUSSIAN FEDERATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC303</classCode><className>HONG KONG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

In the same city, two men and two women, all 18, were charged in January after live-streaming themselves torturing a special needs student.</p><p>About the same time, footage of a 12-year-old girl hanging herself stayed on Facebook for two weeks, and Islamic extremists from the Middle East to Europe regularly share videos of mass murder and grisly executions by their child soldiers.</p><p>All of it is there to see and easy to find on the world's biggest social media platform, which is at the centre of a growing storm of criticism for not doing enough to police the community it has created.</p><p>\"We have a lot more to do here. We're reminded of this this week by the tragedy in Cleveland. Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Robert Godwin Sr, and we have a lot of work,\" Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg says.</p><p>\"We will keep doing all of what we can to keep tragedies like this from happening.\" Zuckerberg was speaking at his company's annual developer conference last Tuesday and turned then to business. But many are questioning whether Facebook is actually doing \"all of what we can\".</p><p>\"There are really horrific and heinous acts happening online, from child pornography to extremism, to trolling, to cybercrime and malware viruses,\" says Professor Hany Farid from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. \"You name it, the internet is becoming a kind of a cesspool, and I think the social media companies have been very slow to respond, frustratingly slow.\" Big tech companies including Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter argue they are dealing with so much data it's impossible to monitor every video and photo their users post. But the booming success of the social media behemoths shows they are in control of their content when it makes commercial sense.</p><p>\"There's really not been that much action trying to address this in a serious way, and what frustrates me is that the companies will say, 'Well it's a really hard problem. We have a massive amount of data, we have a massive amount of users and we can't possibly regulate',\" Farid says.</p><p>\"I find that sort of inexcusable. The 'massive amount of data, the massive amount of users' doesn't seem to prevent them from being very effective in advertising, in collecting personal data and selling that personal data - making really a lot of money leveraging that data.</p><p>\"They harvest the data and they make a lot of money doing it, so you can't just say this is really complicated - because obviously you have figured out in certain dimensions how to manage the data.\" Most social media companies rely on their users to report offensive content for their moderators to evaluate and then take steps including removal and reporting it to law enforcement agencies.</p><p>\"This is like the police saying, 'We've got a bunch of laws on the books and we are going to sit in our office all day long and we are going to wait for people to tell us what they think is wrong'. That's their model and that's completely insane,\" Farid says.</p><p>Most of this monitoring is then outsourced - such as the investigations Google introduced in the wake of the \"fake news\" controversy during the 2016 election, which are being helmed by Politifact and Snopes.</p><p>There is also an army of Facebook and Twitter minimum-wage human moderators working out of offices in Asian countries, including the Philippines, who Farid describes as \"traumatised, looking at this horrific content all day long\".</p><p>\"So even at that level, it barely rates on Facebook's radar,\" he says. \"On the other hand, how many people do they have on the advertising side, how many people do they have on the analytics side, how many engineers developing the next generation of Facebook features? The labour distribution is a good indication of how seriously they take it.\" Cyber safety expert Hemanshu Nigam agrees social media companies have been too slow to respond to the proliferation of vile content, a problem compounded by their pace of growth.</p><p>\"Part of the problem is that with Facebook, what we are experiencing is a technology company that is slowly evolving into a media company, and also evolving into a political powerhouse.</p><p>\"In many ways that's creating an identity crisis, because each one of these identities comes with different responsibilities,\" he says.</p><p>Nigam runs online safety consultancy SSP Blue, but was formerly chief security officer of MySpace, where every piece of media was moderated before being posted.</p><p>\"There was a human being looking at it and if it was deemed inappropriate, then it was fingerprinted so it could not be shared by another user on the site,\" he says.</p><p>\"Those were very proactive measures we took.\" Nigam says such a model wouldn't now work due to the sheer number of users of Facebook, Google and Twitter, but a combination of human and computer-driven moderation is possible.</p><p>\"One of the greatest challenges that Facebook faced (this week) was that the content kept being shared, and the question that was left unanswered is why that video wasn't stopped,\" Nigam says.</p><p>\"When you're the platform, you're the mayor, the regulator, the legislator, the enforcer, the first responder, the educator. You have to serve every role in that society that typically a government serves.\"</p><p>Farid says less eyes on each video would take away one of the key motivations for sick people to share their most depraved acts.For Mr Godwin's family, the sharing of his death only added to their pain. \"Please please please stop retweeting that video and report anyone who has posted it! That is my grandfather show some respect #Cleveland,\" his grandson Ryan Godwin tweeted. Tellingly, his message has been retweeted more than 30,000 times - far more than the number of views for the vile snuff film that stole his family patriarch.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-TheTelegraph20170422Telegraph58000256253093</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAITEL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NC8-T8W1-JD3N-51N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Telegraph Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>April 22, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Subscribers will see stories like this every day on our website (and in our daily emails) as an added value to your subscription.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world's three most valuable internet companies - Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook- report earnings this week after a rally in tech stocks that has sent investor expectations to all-time highs.</p><p>The trio's outsized valuations raise the stakes for second-quarter results and analysts are warning that any signs of a break in their growth momentum could send shares tumbling.</p><p>The collective value of the S&amp;P 500 technology sector surpassed its dotcom bubble peak of March 2000 for the first time last week. Investors have rewarded companies that have come to dominate their sector, as Googleand Facebookhave in online advertising and Amazon does in ecommerce, while punishing smaller rivals such as Snap that struggle to match their scale.</p><p>\"Any signs of a break in the momentum of the business obviously would change the trajectory of the shares,\" says Jan Dawson, analyst at Jackdaw Research. \"It is hard to see how these companies' valuations could go any further than they are at the moment, unless there's some big upside surprise. There's a lot more potential for a short-term correction than a steepening of the trajectory.\"</p><p>Amazon and Alphabet typically see their individual stock prices jump by at least 5 per cent the day after posting their latest financial results, according to data from Bloomberg. Six months ago was a notable exception, when all three saw their shares drop in the wake of their fourth-quarter earnings reports.</p><p>\"People can be easily spooked by these stocks\" in such situations, says Mr Dawson, given that their results are normally so predictable.</p><p>The pull back earlier this year was shortlived: Facebookshares have gained almost 30 per cent in the past six months, while Alphabet is up 20 per cent and Amazon 27 per cent over the same period.</p><p>Facebook's longer-term rally has been all the more remarkable given that its shares have fallen the day after it reported earnings for each of the past three quarters, despite consistently beating Wall Street's forecasts on both revenues and earnings.</p><p>Facebookhas warned for some time that its rate of growth would slow as it reached saturation point in the number of advertisements it could show in its main app's news feed. However, the forecast slowdown has so far failed to materialise. Meanwhile, it has been inserting more ads in new places across its \"family\" of apps, including Instagram and Messenger.</p><p>Like Facebook, Alphabet has benefited in recent years from huge growth in mobile advertising. Google's vast scale across both search and display advertising on the web has made it so difficult for others to compete that its rivals are ganging up against it, as the likes of News Corp and other US newspaper owners are doing with the News Media Alliance, to demand regulatory change.</p><p>While concerns over ad placement on YouTube and other Googleproperties may nibble away at its performance on the edges, the area that is more likely to cause a surprise are Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" - divisions that include self-driving cars and healthcare technology - where investment often outstrips income.</p><p>Cost-conscious investors will also be scouring Amazon's results for signs that it is readying itself for another period of investment.</p><p>Despite strong growth in Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing division that accounts for the lion's share of the group's profits, Amazon remains one of the least profitable among the big tech companies, with a net income margin of just 1.8 per cent over the past four quarters.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

He contends that by financing and forcing this misguided special-interest legislation, the Big-Tech Goliaths will no longer need to operate beyond the law as they do now - but they can operate within it, free to take what they choose without fear of having to pay for it.</p><p>In his opinion piece, Leckrone confirmed that the self-styled \"Coalition for Patent Fairness\" (CPF) continues to be well funded by Big-Tech Goliaths seeking to force passage of the so-called Patent \"Reform\" Act. He noted that public financial information for the seven CPF founders, namely, Apple, Cisco, Dell, HP, Intel, Micron and Oracle, reveal that these Goliaths are not burdened with patent litigation costs/awards as the CPF claims. In fact, the seven Goliaths paid out a trifling 1/9th of 1 percent (0.11%) of their revenues in patent awards during the 11 years between 1996 and 2006 -- far less than the relevant R&amp;D would have cost them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economist Pat Choate Proves CPF Claims False</emphasis></p><p>According to a recent policy paper authored by economist Pat Choate, the CPF falsely claims that patent lawsuits are hampering the ability of its Goliath founders to finance R&amp;D when in fact, disclosed patent settlements of the CPF founders equaled 1.5 percent of their total R&amp;D investment, confirming that patent litigation has had no significant impact on the CPF research and development activities. Moreover, the CPF founders regularly go to the \"rocket dockets\" where they are prolific plaintiffs. Choate's policy paper noted that in the 11-year period of 1996-2006, the seven CPF founders disclosed a total of $1.9 billion in patent settlement payments, an average of $173 million per year. During that same time, these seven corporations had collective revenues of more than $1.7 trillion. Choate's complete policy paper can be accessed at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tplgroup.net/legislation/pdf/Analysis103007.pdf\">http://www.tplgroup.net/legislation/pdf/Analysis103007.pdf</url>.</p><p>According to Leckrone, the real motivation for the CPF attack on the Patent System and law is probably best demonstrated by the policy paper's report that CPF founders have been involved in over 350 antitrust and price fixing lawsuits over the 11-year period, displaying their arrogant disregard for the laws we all have to live by.</p><p>\"Choate's paper also reports that the ratio of lawsuits to patents issued has remained less than 1.5 percent for many years debunking also the CPF claim that there is some sort of patent litigation crisis, and making it clear that the case being made for the Patent Reform Act now before the Senate is baseless,\" said Leckrone. \"It is ironic that these Goliaths now seek to weaken the very patent system that enabled them to achieve their growth and stature by protecting their intellectual property from infringement.\"</p><p>Leckrone believes that innovation from smaller companies represents real competition to the Goliaths, and the US Patent System has been and continues to be effective in leveling the playing field. \"Our legendary patent system has been instrumental in making America the cradle of innovation. Indeed, it has spawned the world's most effective start-up culture with Silicon Valley as its poster child. It has also fueled the development of the world's most effective venture-capital infrastructure, which in turn has driven economic and job growth.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key to Improving Patent Quality</emphasis></p><p>\"Our Patent System has been a treasure to our country and it deserves better than a rushed passage of seriously flawed legislation,\" asserted Leckrone. \"Lost in the pressure for change is the recognition that the key to improvement will come from our support of the talented men and women who work in the patent office. It is they who are charged with examining and issuing quality patents worthy of their constitutional basis. We need to help the patent office continuously improve the quality of the examination so that only worthy patents are issued.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Growing Opposition to the Patent Reform Act of 2007</emphasis></p><p>Opposition to the so-called Patent Reform Act continues to grow across America with inventors, venture capitalists, universities, trade associations, labor organizations and more than 400 business corporations small and large voicing their concerns. The TPL Group, which has made it a high priority to spread the word about the flawed legislation before Congress, is urging all Americans to write to their Senators. To help others communicate their concern, the company has posted abundant resources on its website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tplgroup.net/legislation\">www.tplgroup.net/legislation</url>including contact information for elected representatives.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About The TPL Group</emphasis></p><p>Founded in 1988, Technology Properties Limited (The TPL Group) has emerged as a global coalition of high technology enterprises involved in the development, management and commercialization of Intellectual Property (IP) assets as well as the design, manufacture and sales of proprietary products based on these same IP assets.

The Patent Reform Act now up for vote in the U.S. Senate is but the latest blatant example of how Goliaths are wielding their power to smother innovation. Indeed, the Goliaths seek a major overhaul of our patent system that would pave the way for them to roll over competitors by misappropriating their intellectual property.</p><p>The Goliaths are using their economic power to induce persons and organizations with political clout to force changes to the laws of the land so that Goliaths no longer need to operate \"beyond the law\" -- but within it, out of reach and free from sanction.</p><p>Thoughtful examination reveals that this proposed legislation would change the calculations of damages imposed on patent infringers in a way that would drastically limit the amounts they must pay patent owners; create a new post-grant, quasi-judicial review process that would provide infringers new opportunities to challenge patents that have already been issued; and change the rules on venue -- where a patent holder can sue an infringer -- in a way that would favor infringers over patent owners.</p><p>More evidence of the monopolistic power wielded by the Goliaths was unmasked and checked recently, thanks to the European Union's top anti-trust regulator. In a series of recent charges leveled by the EU anti-trust body, first against Intel in July 2007 and then against Microsoft two months later, both global giants were cited for monopolistic practices aimed at stifling competition. The cited abuses were not new as both Intel and Microsoft were sanctioned earlier for similar practices by the governments of Korea and Japan, and have faced, and continue to face U.S. government scrutiny and sanctions.</p><p>Now, these high-tech Goliaths have slipped the Patent Reform Act of 2007 through committees in both the House and the Senate. This bill, if enacted, will be the coup de grace for the U.S. Patent System as well as for the inventors and innovation it protects. The self-styled Coalition for Patent Fairness (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.patentfairness.org\">www.patentfairness.org</url>) continues to be well funded by high-tech Goliaths seeking to force passage of this act. Financial information for Apple, Cisco, Dell, HP, Intel, Micron and Oracle, reveal that these Goliaths are not as burdened with patent litigation costs/awards as the coalition claims. In fact, the seven Goliaths paid out 1/9th of 1 percent (0.11 percent) of their revenues in patent awards during the 11 years between 1996 and 2006, according to Pat Choate, an economist and author on manufacturing policy.</p><p>In a recent policy paper, Choate reported that the coalition founders collectively invested more than $131 billion on R&amp;D for at period. He noted that disclosed patent settlements equaled 1.5 percent of their total R&amp;D investment, which suggests that patent litigation has had no significant impact on their research and development activities. When one considers the fact that the ratio of lawsuits to patents issued has remained less than 1.5 percent for many years, it is clear that the case being made for the Patent Reform Act now before the Senate is false. In the 11-year period of 1996-2006, the seven coalition founders disclosed a total of $1.9 billion in patent settlement payments, an average of $173 million per year. During that same time, these seven corporations had collective revenues of more than $1.7 trillion.</p><p>It is ironic that these companies now seek to weaken the very patent system that enabled them to achieve their growth and stature by protecting their intellectual property from infringement. Clearly, innovation from smaller companies represents real competition to the Goliaths, and our patent system has proved effective in leveling the playing field. Our legendary patent system has been instrumental in making America the cradle of innovation. Indeed, it has spawned the world's most effective start-up culture with Silicon Valley as its poster child. It has also fueled the development of the world's most effective venture-capital infrastructure, which in turn has driven economic and job growth.</p><p>Protecting U.S. innovation directly translates to preventing the exportation of U.S. jobs. The American patent system does not need the major changes that the Goliaths are seeking to impose. Rather than this so called reform, we need to help the U.S. Patent Office continuously improve the quality of the examination so that only worthy patents are issued. Any legislation regarding our patent system should rehabilitate, not debilitate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dan Leckroneis chairman of the TPL Group in Cupertino.

Still, Huynh says investors should understand there are limits to how bad things are going to get for US stocks in particular. She's recommending three trades ahead of that downturn. Two of them are built around the market's big winners continuing to outperform. </p><p>But for a third, she's saying it's time to pull the ripcord. Click here for more BI Prime stories[1]. The three-legged stool is a classic approach to retirement. And Sophie Huynh, a cross asset strategist at Societe Generale, says a different three-legged stool can help investors prepare for a rough stretch in the stock market. Huynh expects the US economy to go into a recession in the second quarter of 2020, leading to a downturn for stocks. But her prediction also calls for a relatively mild recession. And just as important, she said there are powerful trends that limit how badly US stocks are going to get hurt. Even if the Federal Reserve can't prevent a recession, its interest rate cuts[2] will be a key source of support for the market, Huynh says. She thinks the high dividends of US companies will help as well. And while a recession always hurts corporate earnings growth \u2014 which has historically been the biggest driver of stock prices \u2014 Huynh says this would be a mild recession after a period of already-slow growth. That means earnings forecasts won't fall as much as they usually do when a recession hits, and that means stocks won't be punished as badly. With that in mind, she's offering three trades to help investors thrive during the downturn.(1) US stocks, especially dividend aristocratsYes, Huynh says US stocks still make more sense than equities in other areas even with a recession looming. Falling interest rates are a huge advantage, she writes, as US equities tend to beat all of their international competitors when rates start to go down. She backs that up with this chart that shows US stock breaking away from their peers and staying on top for more than a year after the rate-cutting cycle begins. If that weren't enough, she adds that US stocks now offer much better yields than Treasury bonds, which has the important effect of limiting the downside for those stocks by supporting their valuations. One way for investors to add exposure to those dividend growth companies is the ProShares S...00 Dividend Aristocrats ETF[3].(2) Buy emerging markets, sell big techHuynh is telling investors to short the Nasdaq 100[4] in favor of emerging markets stocks, as three major developments make big tech look less appealing than it has for most of the past decade.

Being a small and resource-constrained country, Singapore cannot afford to be in the \u00e2  too-late zone\u00e2  and the Government sees the Smart Nation effort as an opportunity for significant transformations in the economy and society, he said. But there remain challenges. One of which is figuring out the right regulatory structure and avoiding possible downsides given the lack of prior experiences and success models, said Dr Puthucheary in response to a question posed during a panel discussion at the Smart Nation Innovations Week opening symposium. To help with that, the Government has since taken on the approach of a \u00e2  regulatory sandbox\u00e2  which has found success in industries, such as financial technology (FinTech) monitored by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This idea of creating a safe space for experimentation will be applied to other domains where uncertainties remain about the appropriate regulatory structure to drive innovation, he added. </p><p>The second challenge, according to Dr Puthucheary, is how digital transformation initiatives remain a \u00e2  hard sell\u00e2  to Singaporeans amid fears about job losses and privacy, as well as how a significant portion of the local population are not English-educated or digital natives. All these add to the challenge of convincing Singaporeans that the transformation will be beneficial. \u00e2  There is anxiety about how much value this is to them,\u00e2  said Dr Puthucheary. This is where the country\u00e2  s first Digital Readiness Blueprint comes in. In response to a question from Channel NewsAsia during a group interview after the opening symposium, Dr Puthucheary said: \u00e2  That looks at issues around access, literacy and participation \u00e2 \" how do we give Singaporeans increasing access to the benefits of the digital revolution and how do we make sure they have literacy \u00e2 \u00a6 and skills needed to participate in the online space.\u00e2  Efforts are also underway to help workers navigate disruption of technology on jobs \u00e2 \" an issue that \u00e2  is not something to shy away from\u00e2  given how it has \u00e2  very real\u00e2  concerns, he said. For example, the Labour Movement is committed to re-training and re-skilling the local workforce while education institutions here are ensuring that students are well-prepared for opportunities in the current world. \u00e2  Social acceptance of our digital initiatives is very important because ultimately, what we do has to translate to benefits for Singaporeans \u00e2 \u00a6 Some of these things are happening at such a rapid pace, it means that people have to learn new skills and that is an anxiety for anybody,\u00e2  said Dr Puthucheary. \u00e2  If we can get all that right, then Singaporeans will see that there are a lot of benefits to this journey of transformation through technology that we are using Smart Nation for,\u00e2  he added. DATA \u00e2  IS THE NEW AIR\u00e2  Alongside Dr Puthucheary, other speakers for the two panel discussions held at the Marina Bay Sands include DBS CEO Piyush Gupta and Michaelia Cash, Australia\u00e2  s Minister for jobs and innovation, who weighed in on how technology is transforming people\u00e2  s lives, cities and economies. The increasing importance of data and the recent rise in privacy concerns were among the issues tossed up during the discussions. For instance, data has had profound implications on the banking sector by changing how things work and allowing everyone, ranging from start-ups to big tech oligarchs, to dip their toes into the industry, said Mr Gupta. \u00e2  Data is a big thing,\u00e2  he said. \u00e2  People call data the new oil. I think data is more than the new oil; it is the new air.\u00e2  However, this comes with both upsides and downsides. While digital technology has paved the way for financial inclusion, it also has unintended consequences on areas like jobs, added Mr Gupta. Citing DBS as an example where the use of technology has allowed it reduce the number of employees at its bank branches and call centres by half, the chief of Singapore\u00e2  s biggest lender said: \u00e2  We have been automating and digitising \u00e2 \u00a6 but what does that mean to the nature of jobs? What does it mean to where the jobs come from?\u00e2  Ms Harriet Green, chairman and CEO of IBM Asia-Pacific, said the issue of data stewardship is at the heart of digitisation, be it for governments or businesses. Noting that 80 per cent of the world\u00e2  s data currently belongs to companies and is not searchable, she added: \u00e2  With a greater power (comes) a deep responsibility around stewarding and being the guardians of the data of our clients and of the people that give us that data.\u00e2  On the issue of privacy fears, Dr Puthucheary said putting in place the right type of protection will be appropriate, such as making sure that citizens have the \u00e2  recourse to either appeal, challenge or to secure their privacy\u00e2 . However, this should be done in a way that does not constrain business opportunities. \u00e2  The opportunities that will be available through the analysis of data are likely to increase and we must make sure that we all benefit from that process,\u00e2  he said. \u00e2  There is some clear anxiety given what has happened recently and it\u00e2  s appropriate that we correct and put in place the right type of protection.

They should face penalties if they don't do this, and the money raised could be used to fund social media literacy programmes in schools. Damian Collins MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee [Re: Should investors be concerned about Facebook's prospects?] There are certainly plenty of reasons to be concerned about Facebook's prospects, what with GDPR and the fallout from Cambridge Analytica, but when you look at the numbers, they are still fairly good. Even though monthly and daily active users came in lower than expected, they were still 11 per cent up year-on-year, and the market reaction could merely be a reality check to investors who believed that earnings and revenue growth could always be adjusted exponentially higher.</p><p>Investors also need to remember that Instagram and WhatsApp are other strings to the Facebook bow, and management have expressed confidence that extra revenue can be extracted from this area of the business. If this confidence isn't misplaced and these areas are monetised effectively, the slowdown seen in other areas should be manageable.

On Tuesdaythe company he founded, Facebook, announced plans to create an alternative financial system based on its cryptocurrency, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/facebook-cryptocurrency-launch-calibra-know-so-far-a4169631.html\">Libra</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook hopes that eventually many of the 2.7 billion monthly users of its apps - Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - will use Libra instead of their national currencies to buy, sell and send money. Zuckerberg has said he wants it to be as easy for people to send money to one another as it is to send a photo. If this happens it will give Facebook extraordinary influence over the global economy, a major reason why governments may wish to look closely at the company's plans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read more</p><p>What is Libra? Facebook's new cryptocurrency, explained</p><p>Facebook's attitude to regulation has long been similar to that of other Silicon Valley giants, such as Uber, to act first and ask permission later, an attitudethat has earned it the ire of politicians.</p><p>While those politicians may have scratched their heads at the minutiae of social networks and privacy issues, they are likely to be much less complacent about any challenge to the flow and security of people's money.</p><p>A new global currency would be a threat to the sovereignty of nations, which has historically depended on a nations' control of money.</p><p>Zuckerberg has been working on this plan for several years and has hired an all-star cast of cryptocurrency experts to build Libra. Computer scientists and cryptographers have been wrestling with the challenge of creating a safe, anonymous and tradable digital currency for decades. But only recently has computer processing power reached a point where it was possible.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he wants it to be as easy for people to send money to one another as it is to send a photo (</p><p>AFP</p><p>/Getty Images)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/facebook-cryptocurrency-launch-calibra-know-so-far-a4169631.html\">Bitcoin</url> emerged in 2008 out of the ruins of the financial crisis as an ideological and technological challenge to the existing economic system. Its supporters believed it would circumvent the disgraced financial structures and empower new forms of government rooted in cyberspace, far from the pillared temples of the world's central banks and finance ministries.</p><p>Libra will launch next year, and will run on a blockchain-based network similar to that which runs Bitcoin. That network has been developed by Facebook, but will be open-sourced for developers so they can experiment with it and build new applications for the technology.</p><p>David Marcus, Facebook's blockchain head and former boss of PayPal, emphasised the open, collaborative nature of Libra this week. \"This was going to be a very involved endeavour that will not only require breaking new ground, but also coming up with a new decentralised form of government.\"</p><p>Facebook is determined not to seem like Big Brother controlling this new global currency. It already has 27 other partners in the nonprofit Libra Association, companies such as Visa, MasterCard, Spotify, Vodafone and Uber, which are going to co-develop the system. They will also contribute to the Libra Reserve, a pool of hard currency assets to ensure that each unit of Libra is backed by something of actual value - unlike Bitcoin, whose only value lies inits scarcity.</p><p>Read more</p><p>As Bitcoin's price soars should it now be taken seriously?</p><p>In its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/facebook-cryptocurrency-launch-calibra-know-so-far-a4169631.html\">white paper on Libra</url>, Facebook's researchers write: \"Imagine an open, interoperable ecosystem of financial services that developers and organisations will build to help people and businesses hold and transfer Libra for everyday use. To enable the Libra ecosystem to achieve this vision over time, the blockchain has been built from the ground up to prioritise scalability, security, efficiency in storage and throughput, and future adaptability.\"</p><p>The spirit of Libra is open, adaptable and efficient. It will aim to liberate people farther from expensive, inefficient banks, which are being shown up by financial start-ups in every niche, from mortgages to wire transfers.</p><p>Facebook says that it wants to co-operate with banks. Marcus said: \"You'll see banks on this between now and next year, because if we bring on another billion people, they'll need savings accounts, loans, and things banks are very good at.\"</p><p>Banks, though, are not going to like Facebook's vow to drive down fees. Facebook will profit from advertising to ever stickier users, but banks will struggle to make up the lost revenue.</p><p>Facebook is also emphasising the value of Libra to users in developing economies, where mobile financial services are accelerating. Once again, it is going to run into banks, which are also trying to develop businesses in these lightly regulated markets where they can charge fees and interest rates that would be intolerable in developed markets.</p><p>2.7 billion</p><p>The monthly number of users of Facebook apps - Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - that it hopes will turn to Libra</p><p>Facebook has looked on jealously at its main Chinese rival, WeChat, which has built payments into its wildly popular messaging services and grown rapidly in emerging markets. Facebook, by contrast, has been restrained by regulators in its major markets up until now. It hopes that Libra's combination of scale and security will mitigate fears over digital currencies.</p><p>Last October, Facebook hired former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg as its head of global affairs at a time when the company's reputation was going up in flames. The revelations of Russian interference in America's political system via fake news and advertising on Facebook was roiling Washington.</p><p>Facebook has also come under siege for not doing enough to identify and remove hateful postings. Zuckerberg has defended the company and spoken of its investment in artificial intelligence tools to clean up its platform.But in March this year, when a gunman opened fire on Muslim worshippers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/facebook-cryptocurrency-launch-calibra-know-so-far-a4169631.html\">in Christchurch, New Zealand</url>, killing 51, his livestream video of the attack remained on Facebook for an hour before it was removed, by which time it had spread all over the network.</p><p>Read more</p><p>Social media does nothing to help people with social anxiety</p><p>This was just another of many blows to the platform's claim that it is a force for good.Distaste for Facebook spans the political spectrum in Washington. From President Trump at one end to Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren on the other, politicians are united in their desire to see the big tech companies broken up, or at least taken down several notches.</p><p>Even the slightest suggestion that Libra might be used for drug dealing, money laundering or any other criminal activity could lead to its being shut down in the US or Europe.</p><p>Even if Libra does thrive in developing economies, rejection in its biggest markets would be a humiliation for Zuckerberg, who is trying to salvage his reputation and that of his company.</p><p>While its revenues continue to grow and its share price has recovered from a sharp slump last year, Facebook has lost several key employees in the past year, including the founders of Instagram and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/facebook-cryptocurrency-launch-calibra-know-so-far-a4169631.html\">WhatsApp</url>.

But Mark Zuckerberg didn't get to be one of the richest men in history before he turned 30 by shirking a challenge. On Monday the company he founded, Facebook, announced plans to create an alternative financial system based on its cryptocurrency, Libra.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook hopes that eventually many of the 2.7 billion monthly users of its apps - Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - will use Libra instead of their national currencies to buy, sell and send money. Zuckerberg has said he wants it to be as easy for people to send money to one another as it is to send a photo. If this happens it will give Facebook extraordinary influence over the global economy, a major reason why governments may wish to look closely at the company's plans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook's attitude to regulation has long been similar to that of other Silicon Valley giants, such as Uber, to act first and ask permission later, an attitude that has earned it the ire of politicians.</p><p>While those politicians may have scratched their heads at the minutiae of social networks and privacy issues, they are likely to be much less complacent about any challenge to the flow and security of people's money.</p><p>A new global currency would be a threat to the sovereignty of nations, which has historically depended on a nations' control of money.</p><p>Zuckerberg has been working on this plan for several years and has hired an all-star cast of cryptocurrency experts to build Libra. Computer scientists and cryptographers have been wrestling with the challenge of creating a safe, anonymous and tradable digital currency for decades. But only recently has computer processing power reached a point where it was possible.</p><p>Bitcoin emerged in 2008 out of the ruins of the financial crisis as an ideological and technological challenge to the existing economic system. Its supporters believed it would circumvent the dis-graced financial structures and empower new forms of government rooted in cyberspace, far from the pillared temples of the world's central banks and finance ministries.</p><p>Libra will launch next year, and will run on a blockchain-based network similar to that which runs Bitcoin. That network has been developed by Facebook, but will be open-sourced for developers so they can experiment with it and build new applications for the technology.</p><p>David Marcus, Facebook's blockchain head and former boss of Pay-Pal, emphasised the open, collaborative nature of Libra this week. \"This was going to be a very involved endeavour that will not only require breaking new ground, but also coming up with a new decentralised form of government.\"</p><p>Facebook is determined not to seem like Big Brother controlling this new global currency. It already has 27 other partners in the nonprofit Libra Association, companies such as Visa, MasterCard, Spotify, Vodafone and Uber, which are going to codevelop the system. They will also contribute to the Libra Reserve, a pool of hard currency assets to ensure that each unit of Libra is backed by something of actual value - unlike Bitcoin, whose only value lies in its scarcity. In its white paper on Libra, Facebook's researchers write: \"Imagine an open, interoperable ecosystem of financial services that developers and organisations will build to help people and businesses hold and transfer Libra for everyday use. To enable the Libra ecosystem to achieve this vision over time, the blockchain has been built from the ground up to prioritise scalability, security, efficiency in storage and throughput, and future adaptability.\"</p><p>The spirit of Libra is open, adaptable and efficient. It will aim to liberate people farther from expensive, inefficient banks, which are being shown up by financial start-ups in every niche, from mortgages to wire transfers.</p><p>Facebook says that it wants to co-operate with banks. Marcus said: \"You'll see banks on this between now and next year, because if we bring on another billion people, they'll need savings accounts, loans, and things banks are very good at.\"</p><p>BANKS, though, are not going to like Facebook's vow to drive down fees. Facebook will profit from advertising to ever stickier users, but banks will struggle to make up the lost revenue.</p><p>Facebook is also emphasising the value of Libra to users in developing economies, where mobile financial services are accelerating. Once again, it is going to run into banks, which are also trying to develop businesses in these lightly regulated markets where they can charge fees and interest rates that would be intolerable in developed markets.</p><p>Facebook has looked on jealously at its main Chinese rival, WeChat, which has built payments into its wildly popular messaging services and grown rapidly in emerging markets. Facebook, by contrast, has been restrained by regulators in its major markets up until now. It hopes that Libra's combination of scale and security will mitigate fears over digital currencies.</p><p>Last October, Facebook hired former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg as its head of global affairs at a time when the company's reputation was going up in flames. The revelations of Russian interference in America's political system via fake news and advertising on Facebook was roiling Washington. Facebook has also come under siege for not doing enough to identify and remove hateful postings. Zuckerberg has defended the company and spoken of its investment in artificial intelligence tools to clean up its platform.</p><p>But in March this year, when a gunman opened fire on Muslim worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand, killing 51, his livestream video of the attack remained on Facebook for an hour before it was removed, by which time it had spread all over the network.</p><p>This was just another of many blows to the platform's claim that it is a force for good.</p><p>Distaste for Facebook spans the political spectrum in Washington. From President Trump at one end to Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren on the other, politicians are united in their desire to see the big tech companies broken up, or at least taken down several notches.</p><p>Even the slightest suggestion that Libra might be used for drug dealing, money laundering or any other criminal activity could lead to its being shut down in the US or Europe.</p><p>Even if Libra does thrive in developing economies, rejection in its biggest markets would be a humiliation for Zuckerberg, who is trying to salvage his reputation and that of his company.</p><p>While its revenues continue to grow and its share price has recovered from a sharp slump last year, Facebook has lost several key employees in the past year, including the founders of Instagram and WhatsApp. Employee morale is low and the company has lost favour with the best tech talent.</p><p>Facebook may have adopted the language of the open, anti-authoritarian, free-wheeling crypto-culture, but it is a Silicon Valley behemoth which is seeking to clean up its reputation.</p><p>Its size and influence will ensure that Libra is respected and feared. Its challenge will be to be trusted.</p><p>@delvesbroughton</p><p>2.7billion The monthly number of users of Facebook apps - Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - that it hopes will turn to Libra</p><p>Zuckerberg wants it to be as easy for people to send money to one another as it is to send a photo</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Disruptor: Mark Zuckerberg has announced plans to launch Libra, a cryptocurrency</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTAND-150317675</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTAND2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCH-7MG1-DYTY-C271-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138528</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1238\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Evening Standard (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31730\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 19, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But I believe that it's an obligation upon their part to get smarter and better at preventing the data that's in their systems from being misused.\"</p><p>Mr MacGibbon said China was seeking to disrupt Western democracies in the same way as Russia in the 2016 US presidential election, and observed that Facebook in particular had been dragged kicking and screaming into recognising its responsibilities to protect the fabric of society.</p><p>He said high-profile Australians such as Atlassian founder Mike Cannon-Brookes were entitled in a democracy to express their views on social media without being compromised, but platforms were not doing enough to enable that.</p><p>He said Twitter and Facebook still routinely accepted advertising dollars from scammers, who used the images and reputations of high-profile figures to promote phoney products, and had created an environment where operations such as Zhenhua could thrive.</p><p>\"If the Financial Review was taking ad space from criminals, you wouldn't last long, but these sites allow criminals to use other people's brands and information to peddle crime to unsuspecting people. They need to do more on things like that, like they need to do more to prevent scraping, there's no doubt,\" Mr MacGibbon said.</p><p>\"Mike Cannon-Brookes should have a profile. I mean, he's entitled to have one ... But individuals need to make sure that they understand how the information they're giving, which is sometimes innocuous, can be used against them and against society more broadly.</p><p>\"He has strong views that can run counter to the establishment and you could see why a country like China or Russia or North Korea, who don't have our interests at heart, could try to be quite divisive, and misuse Cannon-Brookes as a vehicle. He is now in a situation where he needs to be able to make sure that when his views are being misused that he jumps in very quickly and says 'Actually, that's not me.'\"</p><p>Bans for Zhenhua</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson said the scraping of public data off its pages by Zhenhua was against its policies, and it was now banned from accessing the platform.</p><p>\"Even public data shouldn't be collected in this way. We have banned Zhenhua Data Technology from our platform and sent a cease and desist letter ordering them to stop,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p>A spokesperson for Microsoft-owned LinkedIn said it would also take action after the stories of Chinese scraping emerged.</p><p>The spokesperson said LinkedIn was committed to keeping its platform safe, trusted and professional, and to keep its members' information safe and secure.</p><p>\"We do not permit the use of any software that scrapes or copies information from LinkedIn under our user agreement ... We have technical measures and defences in place to protect against the use of any such tools on our platform and are constantly working to improve them,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p>\"If any violation of our user agreement is uncovered or reported, we investigate and take necessary steps to protect our members' information.\"</p><p>Twitter declined to comment on the actions of the Chinese company, or discuss what it does to try to prevent people from scraping data from public profiles, or whether there was more it should do to prevent intelligence gathering.</p><p>A spokesperson sent a generic statement saying it had rules in place to address users' privacy.</p><p>\"Twitter takes privacy seriously, and we expect everyone using Twitter content and the Twitter API to do the same. Any use of the Twitter developer platform, Twitter API, or Twitter content in a manner that is inconsistent with peoples' reasonable expectations of privacy may be subject to enforcement action, which can include suspension and termination of API and Twitter Content access,\" the statement said.</p><p>Australian Information and Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk said the scraping of personal information on a large scale from social media sites, and subsequent matching and combining of different data sets, raised privacy concerns.</p><p>The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the UK's Information Commissioner's Office are investigating the personal information handling practices of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/biometric-myopia-expanding-the-facial-recognition-debate-20200616-p5536d\">controversial tech company Clearview AI</url>, focusing on the company's use of \"scraped\" data and biometrics of individuals.</p><p>Ms Falk suggested social media platforms were failing in their responsibilities under the Privacy Act to prevent the misuse of their users' information.</p><p>\"If a social media company covered by Australian privacy law discloses personal information for a purpose other than the primary purpose of collection, it may only do so with consent unless an exception applies,\" Ms Falk said.</p><p>\"It must also take reasonable steps to protect the personal information it holds from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure ... Social media companies should implement measures to detect unauthorised web scraping and take steps to enforce non-compliance with their policies.\"</p><p>Chris Cooper, executive director of Responsible Technology Australia, an activist group seeking to rein in the excesses of big tech, said regulation might be needed to ensure the tech platforms took the threat of China's misinformation seriously.</p><p>\"We need to rein in the weapons these bad actors are using in their disinformation campaigns. To date we haven't seen the social media platforms particularly exercised about how malicious actors are weaponising their technology to run vast disinformation campaigns,\" he said.</p><p>\"Facebook, Google and their ilk see no difference between legitimate and harmful content - to them it's just advertising revenue. So we need greater oversight and regulation over how disinformation is monetised, so that platforms are discouraged from it.\"</p><p>He said Australians needed better data rights to restrict access to the ammunition for bad online actors, meaning the ubiquitous surveillance and the selling of insights to personal data on every user, including young people, must end.</p><p>\"The detailed character profiles bad actors create from scraped personal data is the ammunition used in co-ordinated disinformation campaigns,\" Mr Cooper said.</p><p>\"While we can't prevent foreign or domestic forces from trying to manipulate our society, we can restrict their access to the social media platforms that they weaponise to sow division and undermine Australian democracy.\"</p><p>Vice-chairman of the Australian Privacy Foundation Roger Clarke said successive governments had permitted ever wider access to personaldata held by both governments and corporations, so he viewed it as no surprise the personal-dossier industry was now vastly larger than when it was primarily the business of credit agencies and consumer databases.</p><p>\"The abuses that social media operators have been permitted to perpetratehave added massively to the pool,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520326252</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VR-VX31-DY19-C1D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1407\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Siegel was speaking at an event with Congressman Ted Lieu and VoteCommonGood leader Rev. Doug Pagitt, a progressive evangelical activist. Asked how he would face down Republicans calling him a socialist and claiming he would turn Bastrop and Tomball into Venezuela, Siegel laughed and told the crowd that \"according to the GOP, Social Security is a 'socialist' program. </p><p>Medicare and Medicaid, too. Basically, any program that cares for the poor, for the elderly, for those needing a little extra help to have a fair shot at success. When Jesus threw the money-changers out of the temple, and gave alms to the poor and sick, I guess that was 'socialist' too. But it's not 'socialist' when megacorporations, whether Big Tech or Big Oil, get hundreds of millions in subsidies from the American taxpayers. The good thing about this Republican fear-mongering is that at a certain point voters tune it out, and it loses its effect. My plan is to run on a strong progressive platform that serves the needs of the people of the Texas 10th Congressional District. The Republicans refused Medicaid expansion in Texas, and as a result we have rural hospitals closing and sky-high maternal mortality rates. The alternative I support is a commitment to universal healthcare, in the form of Medicare For All. The Republican budget would cut just about every essential social program to pay for tax cuts for the rich. We will campaign on a program of caring for people, not corporations.\"Yep, that's how it's done. Mike gets an \"A.\" California freshmen Katie Hill and Harley Rouda don't. In a badly misguided and twisted piece for Real Clear Politics by Susan Crabtree, Beleaguered California GOP Sees Path To 2020 Rebound[3], there's a section about how the Republicans hope to take back the 7 seats they lost in 2018 by screaming \"socialism!\" Crabtree wrote that \"Republicans aren't the only ones recoiling from national Democrats' far-left turn. Newly elected California House Democrats from traditionally red districts, such as Katie Hill and Harley Rouda, now fear the socialist label could cost them re-election and swing the House majority back to the GOP. Over the last week, some Democratic House freshmen have started lashing out against their brasher colleagues' support for socialism, impeachment and the divisive Green New Deal.\" Let me mention that before we go on that Hill's district is certainly not red any longer and that the Democrats have a new registration advantage over the gradually dying-off GOP.Crabtree continued by noting that \"Hill, who last November flipped a Los Angeles-area district that Republicans had held for decades, made it clear she's not jumping on the Ocasio-Cortez bandwagon. 'As we run up to this presidential [election], we need to show that Democrats, as a whole, are not socialists,' she told Politico last week. 'We're not pushing for impeachment without serious cause and serious evidence.' Rouda, a businessman and former Republican who defeated 15-term Rep. Rohrabacher, also distanced himself from his freshman class's far-left flank. 'I'd like to think that the Republican Party is not run by a bunch of folks that subscribe to be nationalists, like Steve King does,' he said, referring to the Iowa congressman who lost his committee seats after making controversial statements on white supremacy and nationalism. 'So while Steve King's views don't represent the entire Republican Party, those on the far left of the Democratic Party do not represent the mainstream caucus.' Except Steve King's views do represent the entire Republican Party and the kind of socialism AOC and her outspoken colleagues are talking about is as American as apple pie and at the heart of Democratic Party values. Re-read Mike Siegel's explanation above. The defensive crouch Rouda, and to some extent, Hill, take may turn out to be counter-productive and dysfunctional as the national GOP pours money into their messaging. Crabtree: This open Democratic grousing is music to California GOP operatives' ears.'[Speaker Nancy] Pelosi is not in control of her caucus, and she has got to figure out a way to rein in these three complete narcissists,' said Jason Roe, a Southern California-based Republican campaign strategist, referring to Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Omar. 'Any punishment that Pelosi can mete out is a victory for them. They are disrupters, and if they are being punished for disrupting, it's exactly what they want. You can't use traditional levers of power with them.'Roe is telling his GOP clients running for office in California to 'stay away from litigating Trump and start litigating AOC and the left-- this is the gift that keeps on giving.' <url normalizedValue=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XDVv3rgfJJU/XJZdg0-U3MI/AAAAAAABjTM/RZ3osbBmifYRTvjJkz8NH6KhW9ES6hQUQCLcBGAs/s1600/BybPxfAIgAEie0s.jpgSomething\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XDVv3rgfJJU/XJZdg0-U3MI/AAAAAAABjTM/RZ3osbBmifYRTvjJkz8NH6KhW9ES6hQUQCLcBGAs/s1600/BybPxfAIgAEie0s.jpgSomething</url> tells me Susan Crabtree is never going to grow up to be a Catherine Rampell, one of the sharpest and most incisive minds at the Washington Post. Last week she wrote about how the Republicans are turning their party into the boy who cried socialism. Trump's socialism ploy, she wrote, is just \"more lazy name-calling from a lazy thinker, but this time the lazy name-calling may backfire. For years, Trump has premised his political pitch on the idea that he alone can protect Americans from the many invaders who wish us harm-- chiefly immigrants, terrorists and globalists. Lately, he's added another boogeyman to the bunch, one that's supposedly homegrown: socialists. In this year's State of the Union, he declared, 'Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country,' as if that were ever truly a risk. He has ramped up similar comments in recent months and has now enlisted his economic advisers in his fight against the great socialist straw man.\" Ever since 1947, the White House Council of Economic Advisers has released its annual Economic Report of the President. This enormous tome is supposed to summarize the trends in the economy and lay out the president's vision for solving ongoing and future challenges. Though the document usually has some political spin-- the president's economic advisers want their boss to look good, after all-- it usually sticks to legitimate economic concerns facing the country.Not so this time. When the council released its report this week, it bizarrely included an entire chapter seemingly designed to flesh out cable-news talking points about how Democrats secretly want to turn the United States into a socialist hellscape. Readers of the report-- or of even just the council's slides posted on Twitter-- might reasonably come away thinking that the most pressing economic questions facing the U.S. economy include: Was collective farming under Mao Zedong successful? How much did Joseph Stalin end up shrinking the livestock population?If these throwbacks seem wholly unrelated to any of the debates we're actually having right now as a country, that's because they are.The real debate Americans are having-- including those on the far left trying to gain greater control of the Democratic Party-- is about how regulated markets should be and how to make the rules fairer. No one in the 2020 race, not even relative outlier and self-proclaimed democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is proposing that we recreate the Great Leap Forward.Despite what you may have heard from Team Trump-- and despite the many TV interviewers asking Democratic politicians whether they're \"capitalist\" or \"socialist,\" as if that's a meaningful binary-- all modern countries have elements of capitalism and socialism.That includes the United States. We have public schools, public roads, subsidized health care for the elderly and other forms of social insurance. Yet we also have private property, and the government does not control the means of production-- which is, you know, actually how socialism is defined.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aPce6GH2JsY/XJZdxg8wzTI/AAAAAAABjTQ/I7q1jZplSsINQs2LEMIMVsqZeWA_SZsFQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-03-23%2Bat%2B9.12.37%2BAM.pngTrump\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aPce6GH2JsY/XJZdxg8wzTI/AAAAAAABjTQ/I7q1jZplSsINQs2LEMIMVsqZeWA_SZsFQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-03-23%2Bat%2B9.12.37%2BAM.pngTrump</url> and his advisers pretend otherwise, in the hopes of confusing and freaking out the public. After all, most people know they're supposed to be afraid of 'socialism,' even if they have no idea what the term means.In fact, in a Gallup poll last year that asked Americans to explain their understanding of the term \"socialism,\" responses were all over the map. The most common answer, volunteered by about a quarter of respondents, was that it had something to do with \"equality\"-- \"equal standing for everybody, all equal in rights, equal in distribution,\" something to that effect. Smaller percentages mentioned communism, government control of utilities or even \"talking to people, being social, social media, getting along with people.\"Given this level of confusion, it's not clear that Trump's strategy to smear the Democratic Party as a Socialist Menace will be terribly effective.Sure, maybe it'll mobilize older people who lived through the Cold War and associate socialism with the evil Soviet Union. But Trump probably already had the old people vote locked up.Whether it will scare younger people is a separate question. A majority of adults under age 30 already view the term \"socialism\" positively; about 40 percent of those ages 30 to 49 say the same.That might be because of dissatisfaction with the results of the existing (predominantly capitalist) economic system. But it might perversely also be because Republicans have been so relentless in their alarmist attacks on socialism-- or, rather, 'socialism.'Over the past 60 years-- since Ronald Reagan warned that Medicare would doom the country to the s-word-- the GOP has turned into the boy who cried socialism. If you persist in describing popular and not-all-that-radical policies as \"socialist\" (protections for preexisting conditions or letting kids stay on their parents' health insurance until age 26), at some point the term starts to lose its negative valence. \"Ex\"-Republican businessmen, like Rouda--who likely grew up in homes where Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were not revered the way they were in the home I grew up in-- and who found themselves swept into Congress in the blue wave-- really an anti-Trump wave-- should listen carefully to what Rampell is saying-- and to how Mike Siegel is campaigning. Here's Bernie answering a similar question: Play Video[4] [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IjLoHgvBhCI\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/IjLoHgvBhCI</url> [ 2]:

They may be joined by Singapore, where a parliamentary poll might also be held this year. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The key question is -- can the problem be fixed without trampling on basic rights of privacy and free speech? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The issue has been highlighted by the controversy surrounding a government-backed bill in Singapore that would give the authorities powers to hit Facebook and other social media groups with heavy fines if they do not comply with new censorship rules. </p><p>The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill would make it illegal to spread \"false statements of fact\" in Singapore, where that information is \"prejudicial\" to Singapore's security or \"public tranquility.\" </p><p>Individuals found guilty of contravening the act can face fines of up to 100,000 Singapore dollars (about $73,000), and, or, up to 10 years in prison. Companies found guilty of spreading \"fake news,\" can face fines of up to one million Singapore dollars. Human Rights Watch, the non-government organization, has warned the new powers could be used for \"political purposes.\" </p><p>Singapore is not alone in Asia. In the region as in the rest of the world, the struggle against fake news is being fought hard. </p><p>As a stopgap measure, governments, businesses and others are looking for technological solutions to identify and block the spread of misinformation and pernicious content. But, ultimately these technology \"fixes,\" alone, may not be enough to prevent the corrosive effects of social media. </p><p>Meanwhile, a regulatory assault on the world's dominant tech companies is gathering force, as the Singapore example shows. This will entail a fundamental overhaul of the business models of social media platforms as well as the breaking up of monopolies, based on new antitrust standards, and larger penalties for lawbreakers. </p><p>Asian governments are watching closely as regulators in EU and the U.S. go after big tech. The EU has just hit Google with a $1.7 billion antitrust action, which would bring Google's total EU penalties to $9.3 billion since 2017. In the U.S., where data capitalism has also come under fire, Facebook is facing criminal charges over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, along with other accusations involving massive breaches of trust and of privacy. </p><p>These are welcome developments. </p><p>However, this must all be viewed in a broader context, as the digital landscape fragments into a \"splinternet,\" based on different political and social values. </p><p>Wendy Hall and Kieron O'Hara of Southampton University in the UK have identified four emerging blocs: the libertarian bloc (which is broken); the commercial bloc (which is dominated by a handful of tech companies); the European bloc, based on tough regulation (which is gaining appeal); and the China-style digital authoritarianism bloc. </p><p>Asian democracies will adopt and adapt ideas from all four camps. But there is a good chance that after the 2019 elections, governments will choose the enforcement of accountability, or even authoritarian control, over individual rights and privacy. </p><p>In Thailand, despite allegations of irregularities in vote counting, the opposition Pheu Thai party, loyal to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, waged a successful social media revolt against the military junta. If Palang Pracharat, for the junta, wishes to stay in power, it will have to move further toward digital authoritarianism. </p><p>In the Philippines, strongman President Rodrigo Duterte has also tried to muzzle the opposition. As with Duterte's presidential election win, expect to see social media awash with fake stories. </p><p>In India and Indonesia, voters are far less constrained by government pressure. But that makes the role of social media, and criticism of it, all the more important. This is especially true for India, where hate speech on WhatsApp, the messaging network, has been linked to lynchings. </p><p>Back on the technology front, companies and tech-savvy citizens are promoting the use of \"fact-checking\" algorithms to prevent misinformation spreading. Another technology stopgap involves curtailing mass mailings and setting limits on sharing capabilities on social media apps, thereby slowing the spread of misinformation. In India, for example, after the mob lynchings, WhatsApp limited a single person's forwarding options of a message to five times. With over 200 million users on the Indian subcontinent, however -- all forwarding texts, in real time -- this approach clearly has failed. </p><p>Yet another stopgap involves the use of technology to identify and block machines from masquerading as humans. In Malaysia's 2018 elections, \"bots,\" including human-sounding chat-bots, were behind the mass distribution of targeted texts and phone calls, reaching millions. </p><p>Asia's 2019 elections will confirm how the basic business model of social media platforms, which value anonymity, creates a serious lack of accountability. </p><p>Technical measures, alone, will have limited success in stopping fake news. The tech companies' collective failure will give policy makers license to choose remedies that would previously have been rejected as undemocratic. Increasingly, there is talk, for example, of assigning social media users with digital identification numbers. </p><p>This accountability approach is gaining support, everywhere. In the West, there is a growing consensus among computer scientists that if online robots are not identifiable as such, social media's corrosive effects could destroy democracy. </p><p>In the end, Asian policy makers will find that the best technological approach to preventing fake news may be the simplest one: hitting the kill switch. The Indian government has formally asked its telecom operators to advise how Facebook and WhatsApp can be blocked entirely. </p><p>With over a billion people, India is the world's most populous democracy. Yet, ironically, it may turn to an approach reminiscent of China's censorship and authoritarian practices. </p><p>New Delhi has cut off services to Facebook and Twitter in Kashmir 28 times in the past five years, and in 2016, access was blocked for five months -- on the grounds that these platforms were being used for anti-social and \"anti-national\" purposes. </p><p>Rather than resorting to censorship and blocking internet access, however, democratic governments should first try responsible regulation, through partnerships with platform companies and civil society. But this cannot happen until the basic social media business model, with its focus on targeted advertising, is fixed. </p><p>According to Stuart Russell, a University of California, Berkeley computer scientist and a vocal critic of social media, the heart of the issue is \"click-through\" advertising. The click-through advertising model feeds content to people that best aligns with their interests, but according to Russel, what the algorithms really do is modify behavior by feeding people information that steers them toward predictable extremes. Hence the proliferation of fake political news on the far left and the far right, and the abundance of incendiary \"clickbait\" items designed to pull people toward these extremes. </p><p>The latest round of elections in Asia will result in countermeasures against fake news. Hopefully policy makers will work closely with other stakeholders and use a smart balance of technology and regulations to fix the problem, while taking care to not crush democracy itself. </p><p>Alex Capri is a senior fellow in the Business School at the National University of Singapore.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NIKKEI-RSI068725709042019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NIKKEI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VX7-KNM1-DYBD-M002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8002</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1290\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Nikkei Asian Review (Japan)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Karin Pettersson, a Swedish journalist who is director, public policy, Schibsted Media Group, discusses its impact in a conversation with Anam Ajmal:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nowadays, readers get their news from social media and there is a lot of misinformation online. But the media also need these platforms. Is there a way to balance equations between readers and news organisations?</p><p>I think there was a period in time when media companies were very naive when it came to social media. As news organisations, we should be cautious not to rely too much on these platforms. There is a need to keep the relationship between readers and news organisations in our own hands. But a lot of organisations have gone ahead and really teamed up with Facebook and that\u2019s a big problem.</p><p>Now, there is a shift because media companies have started building up other subscription models; consumer business models that are dependent directly on the readers so that they can get news without having to rely on social media.</p><p>Does social media favour a certain kind of ideology?</p><p>There is a trope in almost every debate that right wing extremism is really good at using social media. One of the conclusions in our book (The Internet is Broken: Silicon Valley and the Crisis of Democracy) is rather social media is really good at right-wing extremism. This is because these right wing parties and their ideologies\u2019 purpose is to stoke fear. That\u2019s part of their political programme. Although these platforms are not designed for a specific ideology, they fit the right-wing ideologies very well. If a left-wing party began to ride on fear that would also work.</p><p>What are the most problematic social media platforms?</p><p>All different platforms have very different concerns that need to be addressed. But Facebook and YouTube are the most problematic because of the huge number of users. They have massive reach and impact. Twitter has its own problems and it really impacts the public discourse as it works as a non-functioning spin room for mass media.</p><p>One of the reasons social media has become so polarising is that their algorithms push content that is very emotional, which is problematic for democracies. We need compromise and truth in a democracy, but social media prevents such discussions from happening.</p><p>Have tech giants intentionally come up with these algorithms that promote right wing content?</p><p>It\u2019s really difficult to say if these platforms keep tweaking their algorithms to promote certain kind of content. Sometimes they change the algorithms and tell us a little bit about what the purpose was behind the changes. All we can do is study and research the impacts or effects of social media. One of the big problems of these times is that there is no way to concretely know what these algorithms promote and throw on individuals\u2019 newsfeeds. It\u2019s all a black box.</p><p>Has the internet become a threat to democracy?</p><p>The problem lies in the companies\u2019 business models as they need users to keep coming back so that they can collect as much data from each one of us and then sell back advertising. The most efficient way to get users to come back is to give them content that is very high on emotion and that is often content that drives fear, hatred and mistrust. So, it seems to be this new public sphere is not neutral, rather it elevates a certain kind of content that hinders discussions.</p><p>What is the way forward? How can we make the internet safer?</p><p>I think what we need is consumer interest to be stronger in this discussion. If you look at earlier stages in history and look at the tobacco industry, for example, for the longest time people didn\u2019t understand how harmful their products were. We arrived at conclusions only when consumers got involved, there was a lot of research around the subject and then eventually politicians started regulating this field. We are in very early stages with technology right now. What we need is strong consumer interests, politicians need to know and understand the issue more deeply.</p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example, is an interesting case. The idea of the politicians and lawmakers was really to level the playing field and to give power back to the consumers. It was meant to curb the power of the big tech companies. The regulation is still new and only recently Google was fined pretty heavily in France for not living up to the intentions of the GDPR. So, the intention of the lawmakers was good, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see. People don\u2019t really know what they are getting into when they opt in or opt out, and no good regulation can come from that.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPN-RBH1-DXJR-H3NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

If you provide a huge platform, you should have a huge number of people looking after it. Like any publisher, they should be legally responsible for what they publish.</p><p>  ANTHONY J. WALTERS, CHICAGO</p><p>  To the Editor:</p><p>  Getting the toothpaste back into the tube will not be easy. It's been clear for some time now that social media is an instrument of chaos. It is the equivalent of millions of people standing on soapboxes on the street and shouting things at you. Many of the things are false, some are abusive and a lot of people hide behind curtains so you can't know their true identities.</p><p>  As more and more Americans believe what they see on social media, they will not agree on what is real and what is fake.</p><p>  Democracy requires an informed and involved citizenry, and if the people in the country cannot even agree on what is actually happening, then how can our democracy survive?</p><p>  It may be too late, but at the very least Facebook and the others must limit their news feeds to only what comes from legitimate, acknowledged professional journalism sources.</p><p>  There will still be a lot of ''alternate facts,'' conspiracy theories and plain lies bandied about by both innocent and willful postings, and the sites certainly should provide fact-checks about any of these that gain currency. But to wean people, especially young people, away from social media and back to legitimate news sources may be an impossible task.</p><p>  MICHAEL SPIELMAN, BRONX</p><p>  To the Editor:</p><p>  While reports of entities associated with the Russian government posting propagandistic material on social media outlets are undoubtedly true, those reports are neither surprising nor significant. It is no secret that outlets such as Facebook and Twitter are online gossip boards rather than journalistic or scholarly venues.</p><p>  What is surprising is that people would base important decisions on social media postings since verification of their accuracy is virtually impossible. Doing so is intellectually lazy at best.</p><p>  PAUL ROMERO, OAKLAND, CALIF.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-324329171112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PY0-1071-DXY4-X0VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"762\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/opinion/sunday/social-media-politics.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/opinion/sunday/social-media-politics.html</url><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 12, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Letter</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

You \u201ccurate\u201d your letters page very carefully; so should they.</p><p>It is no excuse to protest that they simply have too much \u201cink\u201d to ever be able to do this. If you provide a huge platform, you should have a huge number of people looking after it. Like any publisher, they should be legally responsible for what they publish.</p><p>ANTHONY J. WALTERS, CHICAGO</p><p>To the Editor:</p><p>Getting the toothpaste back into the tube will not be easy. It\u2019s been clear for some time now that social media is an instrument of chaos. It is the equivalent of millions of people standing on soapboxes on the street and shouting things at you. Many of the things are false, some are abusive and a lot of people hide behind curtains so you can\u2019t know their true identities.</p><p>As more and more Americans believe what they see on social media, they will not agree on what is real and what is fake.</p><p>Democracy requires an informed and involved citizenry, and if the people in the country cannot even agree on what is actually happening, then how can our democracy survive?</p><p>It may be too late, but at the very least Facebook and the others must limit their news feeds to only what comes from legitimate, acknowledged professional journalism sources.</p><p>There will still be a lot of \u201calternate facts,\u201d conspiracy theories and plain lies bandied about by both innocent and willful postings, and the sites certainly should provide fact-checks about any of these that gain currency. But to wean people, especially young people, away from social media and back to legitimate news sources may be an impossible task.</p><p>MICHAEL SPIELMAN, BRONX</p><p>To the Editor:</p><p>While reports of entities associated with the Russian government posting propagandistic material on social media outlets are undoubtedly true, those reports are neither surprising nor significant. It is no secret that outlets such as Facebook and Twitter are online gossip boards rather than journalistic or scholarly venues.</p><p>What is surprising is that people would base important decisions on social media postings since verification of their accuracy is virtually impossible. Doing so is intellectually lazy at best.</p><p>PAUL ROMERO, OAKLAND, CALIF.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000005532432</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PY5-YTT1-JBG3-601H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"750\"/><timeReceived>00:00 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 11, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Letter</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Twitter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Twitter</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Advertising &amp; Marketing of Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) Accounts</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxQzYwQjAwQTZFNEE3RUIyN0VBNTUwREJBNzY4MkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDdCMjE1Mzc0MEExNEQzRkE4RjkzODY2MUREMEE5RTY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Social Networking Sites</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkJEOEE3NERCMEE5NDAyRTgzQ0QzNTc3MkM3NzI0MUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U2OEYyMDlBMThBNDQxRjg4NkFGM0I4REVDODE1QTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N511000CC</classCode><className>PUBLISHING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000D25Y</classCode><className>SILICON VALLEY, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>GX506</classCode><className>PORTLAND, OR, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS153</classCode><className>OREGON, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

'Every day, in two shifts, a few hundred young people spend their time writing blog posts, tweets, Facebook posts, Vkontakte posts and much more\u2026it is indeed a factory; they manufacture thousands upon thousands of pieces of pro-Russian, anti-American content a day.' Although the Russian IRA is owned by a businessman allied to the Russian government, every government should probably have an IRA-type outfit; much like most governments have their own news agencies and broadcasters.</p><p>The suggestion is not that a government-owned social media agency should engage in some of the negative activities Russia's IRA is accused of. Still, such an agency would probably be the more appropriate public bulwark against the purveyors of fake news and disinformation on social media. It is certainly a better proposition than the potentially free-speech stifling social media regulations being proposed by some African governments and in fact already in practice in Singapore and elsewhere. That said, some regulation of social media has clearly become necessary. The key would be for any regulation to be geared towards incentivizing accurate news reportage. In other words, new media practitioners should be made to have as much fear of punishment as their counterparts in old media. To succeed, the active cooperation of big tech would be required. But would they choose to be part of the solution?</p><p>In practice, considering the robust political lobbying apparatus of American big tech firms, this would be a herculean task. But if African governments and others truly desire a curb on disinformation, it would not be untoward for them to be part of a global effort towards forcing the US Congress' hand, via the United Nations</p><p>Make platforms liable for their content</p><p>Social media platforms are probably conflicted. That is, if you infer correctly from Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff's 2019 book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The fight for a human future at the new frontier of power, where she asserts 'fake news and other forms of information corruption have been perennial features of Google and Facebook's online environments\u2026[with]\u2026countless examples of disinformation that survived and even thrived because it fulfilled economic imperatives'. Stengel corroborates this view: 'The players in this conflict are assisted by the big social media platforms, which benefit just as much from the sharing of content that is false as content that is true.' Even more bluntly, Stengel asserts 'popularity is the measure [social media platforms] care about, not accuracy or truthfulness.' Still, as Zuboff adds, 'they [Facebook  and  others] absolutely have the tools to shut down fake news'. But they have to be willed to do so conscientiously. And there is evidence they do so when prompted by governments.</p><p>Still, in America, where most of the top global social media platforms are headquartered, there is limited incentive for them to combat disinformation. Their complacency stems from the United States' Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996 which provides immunity to social media platforms from being liable for published content. The part of particular interest in that American legislation reads thus: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.' Were this part of the legislation to be modified, it is well-known these platforms are perfectly capable of policing mischievous content with super efficiency. Thus, incentivising them via liability for disinformation might be ideal.</p><p>In practice, considering the robust political lobbying apparatus of American big tech firms, this would be a herculean task. But if African governments and others truly desire a curb on disinformation, it would not be untoward for them to be part of a global effort towards forcing the US Congress' hand, via the United Nations perhaps - not that that has ever successfully forced the Americans to do anything they didn't want to do - towards such a modification. Even so, Stengel sees a way to make changes to the legislation that may likely be acceptable to social media platforms: 'One way to do this is to revise the language of the CDA to say that no platform that makes a good faith effort to fulfil its responsibility to delete harmful content and provide information to users about that content can be liable for the damage that it does.' Still, Stengel adds, 'for all this to work, we need global privacy regulations, a universal definition of disinformation and legal consequences for purveying it.'</p><p>In any case, Singapore is pushing ahead with fighting fake news on its own; albeit it could be argued its intentions are not entirely altruistic. In November 2019, for instance, the Singaporean government ordered Facebook to issue a disclaimer ('Facebook is legally required to tell you that the Singapore government says this post has false information') on a post by a local newspaper that it considered inaccurate. But how many of these orders can it issue? Its progress in this regard is likely to be incremental. A global effort, with America in the lead, under the auspices of the United Nations, would likely be more effective. In the absence of such a global coalition, hard-fought democratic gains around the world would be increasingly eroded; especially in the poor parts of the world, like Africa, where they are mostly needed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NAIJA-NAIJA250220200000503</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NAIJA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9D-5XM1-F00C-621N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465390</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"940\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Naija 247 news Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Naija 247 News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Chinese-owned social media platform says it is working to remove videos of a man apparently taking his own life with a gun and banning users who keep trying to spread the clips through the app. It's the latest example of the ongoing struggle by big tech companies to police their platforms for harmful content amid increasing pressure from regulators. </p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison said eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, Australia's online watchdog, is taking \"strong action\" against what he described as a \"disgraceful video.\" \"Those who run these organizations have a responsibility to those who are watching and particularly when it comes to children,\" Morrison said in a video released by his office. \"My message to those social media companies is, yes, your products are changing the world, but with that comes a great responsibility and you need to be accountable and you need to be responsible for making sure that your product does not harm Australians, and my government will be making sure that we do everything to hold you to account for that,\" he said. Australia last year took extraordinary legislative steps to remove violent content from internet platforms. Social media executives can be imprisoned if their platforms stream real violence under the new laws. The legislation was a response to an Australian gunman who used a helmet-mounted camera to broadcast live on Facebook as he murdered 51 worshippers in two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch. But the eSafety Commissioner's office said TikTok could not be prosecuted under the laws. \"The video is not considered abhorrent violent material -- because it is not violent terrorism, murder or attempted murder, rape, torture or kidnapping,\" the office said in an email. The office is working with social media companies to \"to remove content and monitor the situation,\" Inman Grant said in a statement. \"Social media companies need to use the tools at their disposal to detect and remove this content much more quickly,\" she said. Morrison's criticism of TikTok comes after he distanced Australia from the U.S. stance on the company behind it, ByteDance. President Donald Trump's administration has threatened to ban TikTok by mid-September and ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. business, claiming national security risks due to the Chinese ownership. Morrison told the Aspen Security Forum in the United States last month that TikTok did not compromise Australia's security interests, a move that pleased China. He took the extraordinary step of attacking TikTok in a video a day after the last two Australian journalists working for Australian media left China for fear of detention and the Chinese foreign ministry announced Australian citizen Cheng Lei, a Chinese state media journalist, had been detained because she was \"suspected of carrying out criminal activities endangering China's national security.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROD McGUIRK, CANBERRA, AP</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AP20253368363049.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Autralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MACDTM-131727</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MACDTM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T6-J3B1-JBKF-G00D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468345</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"536\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Macau Daily Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Macau Daily Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Chinese-owned social media platform says it is working to remove videos of a man apparently taking his own life with a gun and banning users who keep trying to spread the clips through the app.  It\u2019s the latest example of the ongoing struggle by big tech companies to police their platforms for harmful content amid increasing pressure from regulators.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison said eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, Australia\u2019s online watchdog, is taking \u201cstrong action\u201d against what he described as a \u201cdisgraceful video.\u201d  \u201cThose who run these organizations have a responsibility to those who are watching and particularly when it comes to children,\u201d Morrison said in a video released by his office.  \u201cMy message to those social media companies is, yes, your products are changing the world, but with that comes a great responsibility and you need to be accountable and you need to be responsible for making sure that your product does not harm Australians, and my government will be making sure that we do everything to hold you to account for that,\u201d he said.

But the eSafety Commissioner\u2019s office said TikTok could not be prosecuted under the laws.  \u201cThe video is not considered abhorrent violent material -\u2013 because it is not violent terrorism, murder or attempted murder, rape, torture or kidnapping,\u201d the office said in an email.
