We expect many diverse organizations to come together to collaborate on key issues,\" said Dr. Hochman. \"We've been talking about 'disruption' in health care for some time, but 2019 will be the year we see real change that measurably improves health, affordability and transparency.\"</p><p>PSJH has a track record of accurate predictions for the health care industry. Last year's top predictions, issued in a news release in January 2018, anticipated a trend in \"non-traditional partnerships.\" Later that month, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase announced the formation of an independent health care company for their employees.  What will be the major health care trends in 2019? Here are PSJH's top 10 predictions for the year.</p><p>1. Diverse coalitions will form to tackle the toughest issues in health care.</p><p>When seven major health care systems, including PSJH, banded together in 2018 to form Civica Rx, a not-for-profit generic drug company to address the national crisis around surging drug prices and shortages, it was a sign of things to come. Watch more nontraditional coalitions among health care organizations and others lift off in 2019 as providers, in particular, assert stronger leadership in areas such as big data, digital innovation and advocacy.</p><p>2. Health system mega-mergers will cool down in 2019.</p><p>After several years of high-profile mega-mergers among health systems, there will be a slowdown in 2019 as newly merged organizations focus on integration and delivering quality and value across scale. Smaller alliances, such as the recent partnership between PSJH and Adventist Health in Northern California, will continue to form at the local level, where community partnerships remain critical.</p><p>3. A potential recession will have a significant impact on health care.</p><p>If warnings of an economic downturn are realized, the impact on health care will be significant. Hospitals already operate on very narrow margins, and a recession could decrease revenue even further. Downgrades by the ratings agencies are likely, and more hospitals may be forced to close, especially smaller, rural facilities.</p><p>4. In the move to the cloud, data security will be the top concern for providers.</p><p>Cloud computing will make it easier for providers to aggregate and leverage data to support more informed clinical decision making and enable predictive analytics in medicine. This fundamental shift will require new partnerships between providers and big tech companies. In these new relationships, providers will serve as leading advocates for ensuring patient data is secure and confidential.</p><p>5. More tech industry talent will join health care.</p><p>More tech experts will choose to make the leap to health care to help develop innovative solutions that will improve health and the delivery of care. PSJH has been a leader in recruiting talent from outside industry, including the recent hiring of Microsoft's B.J. Moore to serve as PSJH's new chief information officer. Expect more personnel movement from tech to health care in the year ahead.</p><p>6. Traditional provider roles will blur as drugstores, insurers offer direct patient care.</p><p>The recent mergers between CVS and Aetna, as well as Cigna and the retail pharmacy Express Scripts, are the latest examples of nontraditional partners coming together to deliver direct patient care. While some consider this a threat to traditional providers, close observers will notice disruption happening in both directions. Providers are also reinventing themselves for the future by expanding into retail, and health and wellness.</p><p>7. The pharmaceutical industry will come under heightened public scrutiny.</p><p>With soaring drug prices and frequent shortages, pharmaceutical companies will feel the heat from consumers, legislators and regulators in 2019. They will be scrutinized, oftentimes publicly and aggressively, on the efficacy of new, high cost medications and biologics the industry is promoting and will face tough questions on the role of Big Pharma in the proliferation of opioids.</p><p>8. Homelessness, suicide and opioids will be strategic priorities for improving health.</p><p>The social factors that affect health will take on greater strategic significance for the major health systems. Expect providers to ramp up community partnerships that address the nation's mental health and addiction crisis, which led to an alarming 117,000 deaths in 2017 due to suicide and opioid misuse. Providers will also partner with communities to tackle homelessness with more urgency and invest in affordable long-term housing options, especially for complex patient populations.</p><p>9. Improving quality and reducing costs in the Medicaid program will be a key focus.</p><p>Medicaid is a critical program and vital safety net for one in five Americans. Recognizing the important role this program plays for a large population, not-for-profit providers will continue to be a strong voice for preserving Medicaid expansion. Providers will also make it a strategic priority to improve the health of the Medicaid population, which will also help reduce the cost of the program.</p><p>10. Uncertainty and volatility in health care policy and regulation will continue.</p><p>After a federal judge in Texas ruled the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, the law will continue to be a hot topic of debate as the case makes its way through the appeals process. Meanwhile, providers will be faced with uncertainty about the future of the ACA, programs like 340B drug pricing, Medicaid and Medicare.</p><p>About Providence St. Joseph Health</p><p>Providence St. Joseph Health is a national, not-for-profit Catholic health system comprising a diverse family of organizations and driven by a belief that health is a human right.

Watch more nontraditional coalitions among health care organizations and others lift off in 2019 as providers, in particular, assert stronger leadership in areas such as big data, digital innovation and advocacy.  2. Health system mega-mergers will cool down in 2019.&lt;br class=\"dnr\" /&gt; After several years of high-profile mega-mergers among health systems, there will be a slowdown in 2019 as newly merged organizations focus on integration and delivering quality and value across scale. Smaller alliances, such as the recent partnership between PSJH and Adventist Health in Northern California, will continue to form at the local level, where community partnerships remain critical.  3. A potential recession will have a significant impact on health care.&lt;br class=\"dnr\" /&gt; If warnings of an economic downturn are realized, the impact on health care will be significant. Hospitals already operate on very narrow margins, and a recession could decrease revenue even further. Downgrades by the ratings agencies are likely, and more hospitals may be forced to close, especially smaller, rural facilities.  4. In the move to the cloud, data security will be the top concern for providers.&lt;br class=\"dnr\" /&gt; Cloud computing will make it easier for providers to aggregate and leverage data to support more informed clinical decision making and enable predictive analytics in medicine. This fundamental shift will require new partnerships between providers and big tech companies. In these new relationships, providers will serve as leading advocates for ensuring patient data is secure and confidential.  5. More tech industry talent will join health care.&lt;br class=\"dnr\" /&gt; More tech experts will choose to make the leap to health care to help develop innovative solutions that will improve health and the delivery of care. PSJH has been a leader in recruiting talent from outside industry, including the recent hiring of Microsoft's B.J. Moore to serve as PSJH's new chief information officer. Expect more personnel movement from tech to health care in the year ahead.  6. Traditional provider roles will blur as drugstores, insurers offer direct patient care.&lt;br class=\"dnr\" /&gt; The recent mergers between CVS and Aetna, as well as Cigna and the retail pharmacy Express Scripts, are the latest examples of nontraditional partners coming together to deliver direct patient care. While some consider this a threat to traditional providers, close observers will notice disruption happening in both directions. Providers are also reinventing themselves for the future by expanding into retail, and health and wellness.  7. The pharmaceutical industry will come under heightened public scrutiny. &lt;br class=\"dnr\" /&gt; With soaring drug prices and frequent shortages, pharmaceutical companies will feel the heat from consumers, legislators and regulators in 2019. They will be scrutinized, oftentimes publicly and aggressively, on the efficacy of new, high cost medications and biologics the industry is promoting and will face tough questions on the role of Big Pharma in the proliferation of opioids.  8. Homelessness, suicide and opioids will be strategic priorities for improving health. &lt;br class=\"dnr\" /&gt; The social factors that affect health will take on greater strategic significance for the major health systems. Expect providers to ramp up community partnerships that address the nation's mental health and addiction crisis, which led to an alarming 117,000 deaths in 2017 due to suicide and opioid misuse. Providers will also partner with communities to tackle homelessness with more urgency and invest in affordable long-term housing options, especially for complex patient populations.  9. Improving quality and reducing costs in the Medicaid program will be a key focus.&lt;br class=\"dnr\" /&gt; Medicaid is a critical program and vital safety net for one in five Americans. Recognizing the important role this program plays for a large population, not-for-profit providers will continue to be a strong voice for preserving Medicaid expansion. Providers will also make it a strategic priority to improve the health of the Medicaid population, which will also help reduce the cost of the program.  10. Uncertainty and volatility in health care policy and regulation will continue.&lt;br class=\"dnr\" /&gt; After a federal judge in Texas ruled the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, the law will continue to be a hot topic of debate as the case makes its way through the appeals process. Meanwhile, providers will be faced with uncertainty about the future of the ACA, programs like 340B drug pricing, Medicaid and Medicare. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN725554520190103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V3X-FRR1-DXCW-D1RB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 3, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Last year's top predictions, issued in a news release in January 2018, anticipated a trend in \"non-traditional partnerships.\" Later that month, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase announced the formation of an independent health care company for their employees. What will be the major health care trends in 2019? Here are PSJH's top 10 predictions for the year. 1. Diverse coalitions will form to tackle the toughest issues in health care. When seven major health care systems, including PSJH, banded together in 2018 to form Civica Rx , a not-for-profit generic drug company to address the national crisis around surging drug prices and shortages, it was a sign of things to come. Watch more nontraditional coalitions among health care organizations and others lift off in 2019 as providers, in particular, assert stronger leadership in areas such as big data, digital innovation and advocacy. 2. Health system mega-mergers will cool down in 2019.After several years of high-profile mega-mergers among health systems, there will be a slowdown in 2019 as newly merged organizations focus on integration and delivering quality and value across scale. Smaller alliances, such as the recent partnership between PSJH and Adventist Health in Northern California , will continue to form at the local level, where community partnerships remain critical. 3.\u00a0A potential recession will have a significant impact on health care.If warnings of an economic downturn are realized, the impact on health care will be significant. Hospitals already operate on very narrow margins, and a recession could decrease revenue even further. Downgrades by the ratings agencies are likely, and more hospitals may be forced to close, especially smaller, rural facilities. 4.\u00a0In the move to the cloud, data security will be the top concern for providers.Cloud computing will make it easier for providers to aggregate and leverage data to support more informed clinical decision making and enable predictive analytics in medicine. This fundamental shift will require new partnerships between providers and big tech companies. In these new relationships, providers will serve as leading advocates for ensuring patient data is secure and confidential. 5.\u00a0More tech industry talent will join health care.More tech experts will choose to make the leap to health care to help develop innovative solutions that will improve health and the delivery of care. PSJH has been a leader in recruiting talent from outside industry, including the recent hiring of Microsoft's B.J. Moore to serve as PSJH's new chief information officer . Expect more personnel movement from tech to health care in the year ahead. 6.\u00a0Traditional provider roles will blur as drugstores, insurers offer direct patient care.The recent mergers between CVS and Aetna, as well as Cigna and the retail pharmacy Express Scripts, are the latest examples of nontraditional partners coming together to deliver direct patient care. While some consider this a threat to traditional providers, close observers will notice disruption happening in both directions. Providers are also reinventing themselves for the future by expanding into retail, and health and wellness. 7.\u00a0The pharmaceutical industry will come under heightened public scrutiny. With soaring drug prices and frequent shortages, pharmaceutical companies will feel the heat from consumers, legislators and regulators in 2019. They will be scrutinized, oftentimes publicly and aggressively, on the efficacy of new, high cost medications and biologics the industry is promoting and will face tough questions on the role of Big Pharma in the proliferation of opioids. 8.\u00a0Homelessness, suicide and opioids will be strategic priorities for improving health. The social factors that affect health will take on greater strategic significance for the major health systems. Expect providers to ramp up community partnerships that address the nation's mental health and addiction crisis, which led to an alarming 117,000 deaths in 2017 due to suicide and opioid misuse. Providers will also partner with communities to tackle homelessness with more urgency and invest in affordable long-term housing options, especially for complex patient populations. 9.\u00a0Improving quality and reducing costs in the Medicaid program will be a key focus.Medicaid is a critical program and vital safety net for one in five Americans. Recognizing the important role this program plays for a large population, not-for-profit providers will continue to be a strong voice for preserving Medicaid expansion. Providers will also make it a strategic priority to improve the health of the Medicaid population, which will also help reduce the cost of the program. 10.\u00a0Uncertainty and volatility in health care policy and regulation will continue.After a federal judge in Texas ruled the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, the law will continue to be a hot topic of debate as the case makes its way through the appeals process.

We expect many diverse organizations to come together to collaborate on key issues,\" said Dr. Hochman. \"We've been talking about 'disruption' in health care for some time, but 2019 will be the year we see real change that measurably improves health, affordability and transparency.\"</p><p>PSJH has a track record of accurate predictions for the health care industry. Last year's top predictions, issued in anews releasein January 2018, anticipated a trend in \"non-traditional partnerships.\" Later that month, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chaseannouncedthe formation of an independent health care company for their employees. \u00a0What will be the major health care trends in 2019? Here are PSJH's top 10 predictions for the year.</p><p>1. Diverse coalitions will form to tackle the toughest issues in health care.When seven major health care systems, including PSJH, banded together in 2018 to formCivica Rx, a not-for-profit generic drug company to address the national crisis around surging drug prices and shortages, it was a sign of things to come. Watch more nontraditional coalitions among health care organizations and others lift off in 2019 as providers, in particular, assert stronger leadership in areas such as big data, digital innovation and advocacy.</p><p>2.Health system mega-mergers will cool down in 2019.After several years of high-profile mega-mergers among health systems, there will be a slowdown in 2019 as newly merged organizations focus on integration and delivering quality and value across scale. Smaller alliances, such as the recent partnership betweenPSJH and Adventist Health in Northern California, will continue to form at the local level, where community partnerships remain critical.</p><p>3.\u00a0A potential recession will have a significant impact on health care.If warnings of an economic downturn are realized, the impact on health care will be significant. Hospitals already operate on very narrow margins, and a recession could decrease revenue even further. Downgrades by the ratings agencies are likely, and more hospitals may be forced to close, especially smaller, rural facilities.</p><p>4.\u00a0In the move to the cloud, data security will be the top concern for providers.Cloud computing will make it easier for providers to aggregate and leverage data to support more informed clinical decision making and enable predictive analytics in medicine. This fundamental shift will require new partnerships between providers and big tech companies. In these new relationships, providers will serve as leading advocates for ensuring patient data is secure and confidential.</p><p>5.\u00a0More tech industry talent will join health care.More tech experts will choose to make the leap to health care to help develop innovative solutions that will improve health and the delivery of care. PSJH has been a leader in recruiting talent from outside industry, including the recent hiring of Microsoft's B.J. Moore to serve asPSJH's new chief information officer. Expect more personnel movement from tech to health care in the year ahead.</p><p>6.\u00a0Traditional provider roles will blur as drugstores, insurers offer direct patient care.The recent mergers between CVS and Aetna, as well as Cigna and the retail pharmacy Express Scripts, are the latest examples of nontraditional partners coming together to deliver direct patient care. While some consider this a threat to traditional providers, close observers will notice disruption happening in both directions. Providers are also reinventing themselves for the future by expanding into retail, and health and wellness.</p><p>7.\u00a0The pharmaceutical industry will come under heightened public scrutiny.With soaring drug prices and frequent shortages, pharmaceutical companies will feel the heat from consumers, legislators and regulators in 2019. They will be scrutinized, oftentimes publicly and aggressively, on the efficacy of new, high cost medications and biologics the industry is promoting and will face tough questions on the role of Big Pharma in the proliferation of opioids.</p><p>8.\u00a0Homelessness, suicide and opioids will be strategic priorities for improving health.The social factors that affect health will take on greater strategic significance for the major health systems. Expect providers to ramp up community partnerships that address the nation's mental health and addiction crisis, which led to an alarming 117,000 deaths in 2017 due to suicide and opioid misuse. Providers will also partner with communities to tackle homelessness with more urgency and invest in affordable long-term housing options, especially for complex patient populations.</p><p>9.\u00a0Improving quality and reducing costs in the Medicaid program will be a key focus.Medicaid is a critical program and vital safety net for one in five Americans. Recognizing the important role this program plays for a large population, not-for-profit providers will continue to be a strong voice for preserving Medicaid expansion. Providers will also make it a strategic priority to improve the health of the Medicaid population, which will also help reduce the cost of the program.</p><p>10.\u00a0Uncertainty and volatility in health care policy and regulation will continue.After a federal judge in Texas ruled the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, the law will continue to be a hot topic of debate as the case makes its way through the appeals process. Meanwhile, providers will be faced with uncertainty about the future of the ACA, programs like 340B drug pricing, Medicaid and Medicare.</p><p>About Providence St. Joseph Health<br/>Providence St. Joseph Health is a national, not-for-profit Catholic health system comprising a diverse family of organizations and driven by a belief that health is a human right.

The following is a brief review of 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2019 marked the completion of Sonasoft's transformation into a world leader in AI and data engineering. The driving force for this transformation was a series of acquisitions. Together, these acquisitions ensure that Sonasoft can offer complete AI solutions for customers in any industry. Looking ahead to 2020, data engineering and AI will be key drivers of revenue expansion for Sonasoft. Central to this will be NuGene, one of the most powerful unified AI platforms in the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unified AI platforms</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recently, unified AI platforms have been in the news. eBay is the latest big tech company to announce that they have developed their own platform in-house. A unified AI platform allows you to apply AI on-demand to any business problem you might have. Previously, each problem required a specific model to be developed by a data scientist. This process can easily take months. These platforms cut this down to days and are able to tackle much more diverse problems.</p><p>Most unified AI platforms take pre-processed data and try to extract narrow features from it. They are inherently biased because a human has filtered the data they see. Furthermore, this data is simply a snapshot in time. The models produced by such a system are fine, but they aren't always as robust as they should be, and in complex scenarios, they can break down. Google DeepMind offers an alternative approach, relying on complex deep learning algorithms to allow it to outperform humans in many tasks. However, DeepMind requires massive computing power that is well beyond the reach of most companies. In contrast, NuGene allows companies of any size to get the benefits of a unified AI platform.</p><p>NuGene stands apart for three reasons. Firstly, it can take in data in any format and understands the importance of time series. This allows it to incorporate historical time trends along with current data. Secondly, it mimics how a human works to learn and solve problems. It looks for patterns in the data, forms hypotheses and then, uniquely, tests these for causation. Finally, it runs thousands of ML models to find the set that gives the most accurate outcome. This means NuGene can solve problems as diverse as planning marketing budgets to maximize ROI to augmenting customer support tools with autonomous intelligent agents or even slashing preventive maintenance costs for heavy industry.</p><p>Data engineering</p><p>Machine learning is a true disruptor in almost every area of business. As a result, we see companies large and small investing heavily in data science, hoping to see the transformative power of AI in their business. The traditional approach was to employ a data science team to solve a specific problem by analyzing the data, identifying possible patterns, and then finding a machine learning model that can spot those patterns in new data.</p><p>One of the key challenges companies face is a shortage of data science expertise. This is where Sonasoft's data engineering consultancy comes into its own. Sonasoft employs a team of over 50 data scientists and engineers with significant industry experience covering data factories, cloud data processing, and data migration. Many companies have huge amounts of legacy data that would be a powerful resource for machine learning, but they are not in a suitable form. Sonasoft's expertise makes it trivial to migrate this data into the cloud, analyze it, and visualize the results in a meaningful way.</p><p>Market update for 2019</p><p>Over the past year, Sonasoft has acquired 3 key companies:</p><p>Hotify Inc. created NuGene, the unified artificial intelligence (AI) platform, which now underpins much of Sonasoft's AI work. NuGene was developed by Ankur Garg, recently appointed Chief of AI at Sonasoft.</p><p>E-Connect Software Inc. is a data engineering and AI consultancy with expertise in data migration, cloud data management, and data integrations. This allows Sonasoft to offer full AI transformation services to their customers.</p><p>OptimAIze is an innovative company focussed on AIOPs (AI operations for IT server management). AIOps is one of the biggest growth areas in enterprise IT, applying AI to improve efficiency and cut operating costs.</p><p>In 2019, the Company procured several significant contracts and POCs.</p><p>* Awarded a contract with a major regional transit system ($350k)</p><p>* Won a contract with a major California School District ($100k)</p><p>* Won a contract with a Fortune 600 Tech Company ($270k)</p><p>* Received several contracts for AI professional consulting services ($650k)</p><p>* Won a key contract to provide AI solutions to Padmini NVA</p><p>* Won a proof of concept (POC) AI project with Delaware Electric Cooperative</p><p>Sonasoft has also entered into key strategic partnerships to enhance its existing data archiving and eDiscovery products.</p><p>Predikly is a Silicon Valley-based data innovation and robotic process automation (RPA) company. The partnership agreement will enable the acceleration of intelligent process automation (IPA) technologies and solutions.</p><p>Trusted Data Solutions is a leader in legacy data management and transformation. The partnership and integration of TDS's Evolve email archive migration solutions provide a trusted and efficient email and data migration path.</p><p>Globanet is a leader in data source and application capture for archiving, compliance, and eDiscovery. The partnership enables Sonasoft to integrate Globanet's Merge1TM into SonaVault Archiving and eDiscovery Software Solution.</p><p>2020 and beyond</p><p>Looking to the future, AI is clearly going to continue to transform business in significant ways. Currently, almost all applications of AI are based on so-called narrow intelligence. That means they rely on machine learning techniques that solve a very specific problem. The next big step is deep learning, where a computer seeks to mimic human-like intelligence using massive deep neural networks. Much research is being done on specialized computer chips that are optimized for this sort of learning. Google DeepMind is leading the pack here, but you can expect to see deep learning becoming far more prevalent over the coming years.</p><p>AI is also expanding into areas that touch our very lives. Many companies are developing products that use AI to diagnose diseases, sometimes outperforming the best human specialists. Other companies are focusing on using AI to help with things like credit scoring, recruitment, and even criminal profiling. This is opening up some ethical conundrums that will probably require legislation to solve. GDPR (the general data protection regulation) already gives EU citizens the right to refuse to allow their data to be used for automated decision making, and companies must tell users if they are intending to do this. Google's parent company, Alphabet, is mired in controversy over the way its Streams App accessed the detailed health records of millions of British citizens. As a result, the chances are that companies will soon have to address the ethics of AI head-on.</p><p>Another related change is towards so-called white-box AI. By their very nature, most AI models are black-box - no one, not even the developer, can tell you exactly what is happening inside. As a result, it's hard to understand whether the system is fair or biased. This courted controversy for the Apple credit card last year when it appeared that men were receiving many times the credit limit available to their wives even when they had shared financial status. One of the biggest sources of bias is the original raw data. So, increasingly, we will see approaches that seek to identify and remove this bias. This is one place where NuGene is ahead of the curve since it can take completely raw data without the need for pre-processing (one of the biggest sources of bias). Whatever the future, Sonasoft will continue to lead the way in AI and data engineering and will ensure they keep up with the very latest trends and legislation.</p><p>The Company plans to continue its aggressive acquisition strategy to grow it's AI and data engineering services and significantly expand its enterprise pipeline throughout 2020, in anticipation of becoming SEC-compliant, and subsequently uplisting to a senior exchange.</p><p>About Sonasoft</p><p>Based in Silicon Valley since 2003, Sonasoft is a public company (SSFT) providing solutions that create significant competitive advantages from data, the most valuable corporate asset in the digital economy. Sonasoft's artificial intelligence solution and software capabilities harness data to enable businesses to accelerate and improve decision making, increase operational efficiency and automate critical processes.</p><p>For more information about Sonasoft, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sonasoft.com\">https://www.sonasoft.com</url></p><p>For more information about Sonasoft's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Solutions, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sonasoft.com/products/artificial-intelligence-ai/\">https://www.sonasoft.com/products/artificial-intelligence-ai/</url></p><p>For investor-specific information, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sonasoft.com/investors\">https://www.sonasoft.com/investors</url>/</p><p>Forward-looking Statements</p><p>This release contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements.

Indeed, many Americans were generally unaware that such threats exist, even though these threats could potentially be more destructive to the country than Sept. 11, 2001, or Pearl Harbor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, U.S. social media - indeed, worldwide social media - remained open to manipulation by malign agents of disinformation. We are still defended by only the thinnest of lines at the Pentagon and within the law enforcement and intelligence communities.</p><p>Last week, our tech titans were a largely unregulated group. If not exactly indifferent to the growing consensus that these members of Big Tech are achieving dangerous concentrations of power and wealth, then at best the companies moved at a snail's pace to convince the public of their good and fair intentions and thus cut off ham-handed and outdated regulation.</p><p>Then, last Monday, reports confirmed that the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and the House Judiciary Committee were launching almost simultaneous offensives against everything represented by the term \"FAANG\" - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. (Disclosure: I own only Amazon stock, and The Washington Post is owned by Amazon's founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos. My views on this issue long predate either purchase.)</p><p>Neither investors nor consumers should be amused. There isn't any indication that any of the would-be regulators have the background to assess the new issues set or, crucially, even care much about the national security implications of either our collective defenses or lack of export controls on our technologies.</p><p>No notice. No public discussion. Just a bum's rush to regulate. Slow down.</p><p>I've argued for a new regulatory regime for Big Tech for years: to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House GOP leaders, to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai and national security adviser John Bolton, and to many others in both houses of Congress. About the only thing Hillary Clinton and I agreed on in our long on-air conversation after the publication of her campaign memoir was the need for everyone to read a different book (\"World Without Mind,\" by Franklin Foer) on the dangers of the new age of artificial intelligence. I don't need to be convinced that there are risks as enormous as an unregulated Manhattan Project out there in the wilds of Big Tech.</p><p>But count me very skeptical that these risks are best addressed and remedied by FTC regulators and lawyers using statutory authorities only remotely connected to the massive problem, or by Justice Department litigators wielding theories of antitrust law that were previously not widely aired, much less debated. There's little danger posed by the newly announced congressional hearings - perhaps even some good. But the suddenness of the collective lurch against Big Tech served most to illuminate how little has been done before to ask what these new technologies are doing to us and exposing us to.</p><p>What is needed, believe it or not, is a select commission. Yes, really: It's the hoariest of old Beltway ruses for doing nothing, but this time it could do immense good. Attorney General William Barr is the right official who ought to impanel a select commission of, say, 15 or so, including the principals or general counsels of three or four of the biggest tech titans, a similar number of the country's best legal minds, senior military thinkers and a dash of academic genius and public intellectuals. Give them six months to a year to provide a comprehensive assessment of risks and regulatory approaches.</p><p>Barr knows that the government rushing in without a plan is in fact a plan for massive and potentially disastrous unintended consequences. It may indeed be that the Justice Department's antitrust division is from where the fashioning of new rules must proceed, or the export control experts at the Treasury Department, or perhaps a new regulatory structure recommended to and enacted by Congress. But this sudden spilling onto the floor of a boiling pot of unknown ingredients and enforcement actions is terrible policy.</p><p>Some thinking first, please. It is a problem of immeasurable consequence. Prudence, not politics, is required.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5cf98ac5e2c13image\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos speaks at the the Amazon re:MARS convention, Thursday, June 6, 2019, in Las Vegas.

'The more that we see senators coming on board, the more we realize that they will probably be able to get that clear Republican vote without having to cross the aisle,' she said. 'The market is expecting that there will be a package of some sort involving tax cuts, if not permanent tax reform.'<br/><br/>The long-awaited White House announcement of who will be the next Fed chair is expected this week, with Jerome Powell, a member of the Fed's Board of Governors, ostensibly the president's choice to replace Janet Yellen.<br/><br/>'He represents a continuation of the careful, gradual approach that was set by Yellen,' Krosby said. 'However, he also believes that we need more regulatory rollback in the financial industry.'<br/><br/>Earnings continue to be an important catalyst for the market and this week will include prominent names: Mondelez, Kellogg, Pfizer, MasterCard, Allergan, Facebook, Kraft Heinz, Starbucks and Apple.<br/><br/>'We've seen how the tech names have taken over the headlines,' Krosby said. 'We'll see if Apple can continue the move with big tech.'<br/><br/>After last week's GDP numbers were better than expected, this week will be punctuated by a deluge of economic data releases including today's Personal Income and Outlays report; Tuesday's Case-Shiller home price index; Wednesday's reports on motor vehicle sales and construction spending; Thursday's Productivity and Costs indicator; manufacturing and service sector reports; factory orders; and Friday's much-anticipated employment report.<br/><br/>To talk to Quincy Krosby about her views of the market, contact Lisa M.

Where are the tears over the Prudential's split from America? Short answer: there aren't any. The big question is why it's taken the insurer so long.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For that, blame the shareholders. If they hadn't idiotically halted 2010's $35.5 billion bid for AIA, the Pru would probably already be an Asia-focused group. Instead, investors kicked off over the inspired deal of ex-boss Tidjane Thiam. The upshot? A decade of lost profits from what would have been a far bigger Asian business, plus a slower break-up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's fallen to Mr Thiam's successor, Mike Wells, to drive through the logic of an Asia/Africa-focused group - even if he did need a push from Dan Loeb, the boss of 5 per cent activist investor Third Point, over US wing Jackson. The UK fund manager M&amp;G was spun off last year: a move that left the US insurer the obvious next target. Now Mr Wells has gone further than he did in March. Not only will he float a minority stake in Jackson, but the end game's \"full separation\".</p><p>That he announced it alongside a swingeing dividend cut, with barely a blink from the market, shows that his 100 meetings with investors paid off. The half-year payout's been cut from an expected 12.28 cents to 5.37 cents, implying a full-year drop from 40 cents to 16 cents. That's a saving of $538 million: cash Mr Wells can use better in Asia.</p><p>As he explained, every $1 invested there generates a $6 profit. He's promising \"sustained double-digit growth\": a pledge backed by the Pru's Asian track record. Over the past decade, it's seen average 15 per cent-a-year growth in embedded value - a metric that broadly tots up the present value of policies - to reach $39.2 billion. Assets under management are up from $69.7 billion to $267 billion.</p><p>Yes, America is the world's biggest retirement savings market. But it can't match those growth rates. Indeed, the Pru's US exit has already started: in June it sold 11 per cent of Jackson to Apollo-backed Athene, valuing the business at $4.5 billion.</p><p>Even so, the Asia focus brings fresh questions. First over the politics. Unlike HSBC, Mr Wells has avoided getting caught up in the US-Sino scrap. But the Pru has a third of its business in Hong Kong and China. Ask if Pru was asked to sign the petition over the new Hong Kong security law and he won't say: \"I appreciate I didn't answer the question but we are not getting into the politics.\" He won't always get away with that.</p><p>Second, it's not just Mr Loeb asking questions over the Pru's 300-strong London HQ. Yes, the UK is home to two fifths of its investors and a deep capital market. But Mr Wells may have to shrink the head office by more than he hopes.</p><p>And, third, he's got to deliver the value he sees. In March 2018 when the Pru unveiled its split from M&amp;G, it was not far shy of a \u00a350 billion group. Today, on shares up 3 per cent to \u00a312.67, it's valued at \u00a333 billion, with M&amp;G at \u00a34.4 billion. Yes, valuations have been hit by a pandemic. But Mr Wells has still got to prove that all these break-ups pay.</p><p>                   Cracking job, Rolls</p><p>Not more fan blade trouble at Rolls-Royce. Will the people of Rome again have to dodge molten engine parts falling from the skies? The Trent 1000 farrago has so far cost the UK manufacturer \u00a32.4 billion, with the Italian episode starring a Norwegian Boeing 787 nicely illustrating the problem.</p><p>And now look: cracks in a different engine. Rolls has admitted that the first five-year check for the Trent XWB-84 has turned up unexpected wear in the intermediate pressure compressor, which sounds painful (report, pages 40-41). This is the engine Rolls makes for the Airbus A350 aircraft, popular with likes of Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa. So are we now in for \"Trent 1000, Take 2\" as Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris put it?</p><p>He's \"convinced otherwise\", even if the latest setback hardly helps a company reeling from the corona crisis. Indeed, Rolls put out its update ahead of an \"airworthiness directive\" from the EU safety regulator: something the company feared could trigger unhelpful \"potential speculation\".</p><p>Still, a key difference with the Trent 1000 is that the problem has been spotted before \"any abnormal in-flight operation\" and that so far it's only been found in 20 of the 650 Trent XWB-84s in service. And Rolls doesn't expect it to cause \"significant customer disruption or material annual cost\". Even so, it's the last thing a company with a junk credit rating needs when it's weighing up a \u00a31.5 billion-plus cash-call. Yes, the shares rose 3 per cent to 273\u00bep. But put that down to the tailwind from the markets.</p><p>                   Trumped-up claim                   </p><p>Speaking of which, here's Donald Trump: \"Big Stock Market Numbers!\" Yes, no doubt the White House incumbent will take credit for the soaraway S&amp;P 500, flirting, albeit briefly, with a record high. Perhaps it's due to his amazing handling of the pandemic, complete with bleach injecting routine.</p><p>Still, it says something when a global slump and a bust-up between the world's two biggest economies can spark such euphoria. The markets are betting on lots of things: a big US stimulus package, a vaccine and that travel's back on with no more national lockdowns.</p><p>Saxo Bank has a more technical explanation. That investors are pricing in a \"new future\" of low interest rates, low growth and big fiscal spending: an environment that boosts the value of equities and particularly reliable Big Tech, which become \"bond proxies\". The Donald'll still claim it's a Trump jump.</p><p>Still, it says something when a global slump and a bust-up between the world's two biggest economies can spark such euphoria.

Professor Pasquale has written a book, The Black Box Society, looking at how data collection has changed the legal debate.</p><p>Artificial intelligence is based on the data but the issue relates more to the quality of the data and how it is used, which in turn changes question of legal liability.</p><p>If a machine makes a mistake who is responsible?</p><p>Pasquale notes the word artificial intelligence has taken on a mythical quality when it is just machines learning based on the data they collect and if they are fed the wrong data it may be trouble.</p><p>Others like Oracle have warned of the competitive impact of the fact Google and Facebook have around 85 per cent of the digital advertising market.</p><p>The adtech space is a hot issue for the platform inquiry as is its effect on mainstream media given they use content free of charge then raise revenues by selling that information to advertisers.</p><p>The media dynamic changes from one based on content quality to a marketplace based on audience identification.</p><p>Through your Android phone, web browsing and web searches Google knows what shops you are visiting and having collected this data it auctions the information to the highest bidder to use to advertise to you. Google then earns money by selling your data to enable companies to pitch their products to you.</p><p>The US Federal Trade Commission is close to finalising a case against Facebook for privacy breaches which, according to The Wall Street Journal, will involve personal pledges from its chief Zuckerberg and a fine of as much as $US5 billion ($7bn). The way data is collected and used takes place in a black box. More transparency is needed, which is precisely the aim of the ACCC study.</p><p>What records tell you A new record on the All Ordinaries is of some psychological value but, as noted several times from an investment fundamentals perspective, it means zero.</p><p>Roughly half the returns from Australian equities come from dividends so the more important index is the accumulation index.</p><p>The S&amp;P 200 accumulation index beat the pre-GFC high back in September 2013, and again has set new highs in the last five months. The point is don't get too excited about the fact the All Ords beat its November 2007 highs, because we have set new records for the last five years or more.</p><p>The accumulation index includes share prices and dividends and is the more appropriate one to chart the success of the market, because of dividend imputation companies pay out a higher proportion of returns in dividends than their overseas comrades.</p><p>The US market, which is driven more on price, also beat its 2007 high in 2013. But it is worth noting that while Australia rallied hard to get to the 2007 high, the US was really just trading at 2000 year levels.</p><p>Record low interest rates should drive equities process higher and Westpac economist Bill Evans hit the tape yesterday saying he expected two more cuts between now and February to take the rate to 0.5 per cent.</p><p>The stockmarket is now trading at 16 times forecast earnings, which is a touch on the high side, but, given where bond yields are, not a major cause for worry.</p><p>AMP's Shane Oliver thinks the S&amp;P 200 will finish this calendar year at 6950 or 3 per cent above present levels. Industrial stocks are trading at a hefty 22 times forecast 2020 earnings.</p><p>Goldman Sachs figures consensus forecast for market earnings per share is for 4.7 per cent for the 2019 financial year doubling to 9 per cent this year.</p><p>Telcos led by Telstra are a big swing factor, tipped to go backwards by 28 per cent in 2019 and up 14 per cent in 2020.</p><p>Resources are the strong card, up 23 per cent in 2019 and 19 per cent for 2020. Banks fell by 0.3 per cent in 2019 and will gain 4 per cent this year according to consensus forecasts.</p><p>Arnott's buyout KKR's purchase of Campbell's International centred on the Arnott's business in Australia will focus on cost cutting and the conversion of its outdated model to the new retail buzz words of \"convenient healthy living\".</p><p>IBIS World figures show the biscuit market in Australia has around 57 players who earn $538m on $780m in revenues.</p><p>The last few years have seen falling revenues and this is expected to continue with the possible exception of exports.</p><p>Just what freedom KKR will have to sell into Asia is not known and typically multinationals like to segment markets for themselves.</p><p>The international division was a relatively small part of the Campbells portfolio, but the Australian division will form the bulk of earnings after the earlier sale of the Danish operations.</p><p>Tim Tams are the standout product as evidenced by the fact Aldi sells them directly, bypassing its usual home brand strategy.</p><p>Campbell's was advised by Goldman Sachs and KKR by Jeffries. The fact a private equity buyer emerged triumphant from what was a hotly contested tells you the sector is flush for cash with relatively few strong targets like this one.Separately, why did Coles sign a long-term deal with its existing consultants Accenture to cut its annual fees?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-577cb744ade211e99787948518683f938134acba2858f3267fdcd79dc4300dd1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-92G1-JD3N-5382-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1206\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In the works since 2015, the directive is set to have a significant impact on the world of banking and fintech, with open banking paving the way for more innovative financial services. However, the benefits it offers to consumers may not be realised if financial institutions are slow to act. What is PSD2?</p><p>Intended to promote \"the development of innovative online and mobile payments, more secure payments and better consumer protection\" PSD2 is designed to \"modernise Europe's payment services\". This particular deadline was for the implementation of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). This intended to introduce more stringent security requirements for electronic payments, known as \"strong customer authentication\", designed to better protect consumers against fraud by offering three layers of authentication such as PIN codes or biometrics. As well as protecting consumers from bad actors, another key focus of PSD2 is encouraging greater competition in banking by opening up banking data through open banking legislation. Third parties will now be able to access banks' application programming interfaces (APIs), so they can use the financial institution's data and functionality to build services. By making information such as bank statements and spending habits available, with permission, it is hoped that customers will have better access to financial services such as money advice services or budgeting apps, helping them to better understand and manage their finances and creating an environment in which fintech innovations will flourish. Adam Prince, Vice President Product Management, Compliance and Brexit at Sage explains that the new regulations have huge potential in making banking not only more secure but also more innovative: \"The introduction of the EU's PSD2 regulation marks the start of a highly positive change for the finance and accounting industries: a move towards a more efficient and secure digital future and more valuable customer service. At its heart, PSD2 is designed to drive innovation for today's digital consumers, all while giving them more control over their data.\" \"A lack of preparedness\"However, the rate at which traditional financial institutions have responded to the regulations \"risks derailing the vision of PSD2\" according to open banking platform Tink, with many third parties \"forced to operate in a poor quality working environment\". Nick Caley, Vice President of Financial Services and Regulatory at ForgeRock said: \"Due to a lack of preparedness, [the] deadline has been pushed back by another 18 months. This is despite a multi-year phased roadmap and readily available technology which enables SCA through multifactor authentication like biometrics. \"This is the latest in a series of shortcomings from banks, who have failed to provide robust APIs for years. The fintech community, who rely on these APIs for their innovations, have been frustrated by the lack of progress. However, the real losers here are the banks' customers. According to\u00c2\u00a0ComputerWeekly, challenger banks in the UK are predicted to triple their customer base next year. Caley believes that the slow pace of innovation among traditional banks could see more consumers vote with their feet by switching: \"While banks drag their feet, rather than racing to implement these changes, consumer expectations are rapidly evolving to the detriment of incumbents. In fact, British challenger banks, known for their customer-centric service, are on track to triple their global customer base to 35 million in a sign of consumers voting with their thumbs for superior service. \"Banks cannot afford to view the extension as an opportunity to kick the security of their digital transformation into the long grass. With fintech and big tech poised for the mass adoption of Open Banking enabled services, there is far more at stake for digital laggards than the scrutiny of the regulator.\" Gavin Brown, Head of Identity at KCOM believes that some companies have focused on \"box ticking\": \u00c2\u00a0\"Although PSD2 compliance has been high-priority in recent months, many companies have focused on ticking the box in order to meet the regulatory timescale rather than implementing optimum authentication systems. Carried out strategically, PSD2 compliance can be a trigger for a wider review of identity management strategies, which will ultimately benefit customers and businesses alike with a smoother, more efficient and secure process. \"For example, some banks may have implemented numerous, divergent stop-gap solutions so that they have something to show the regulator. Technically that makes them compliant, but in practice the results are far from ideal.

In light of the FTC's problems, our government must ensure that the public is protected from technology sector companies that violate privacy protections and abuse access to consumer data.</p><p>Read the report here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://default.salsalabs.org/T215163f6-64e4-498b-b223-f3a68733ff6e/a162f71a-b834-4d22-9ff2-52cc97426d59\">https://default.salsalabs.org/T215163f6-64e4-498b-b223-f3a68733ff6e/a162f71a-b834-4d22-9ff2-52cc97426d59</url>).</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6739466 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6739466</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5Y-NR01-DYG2-R0YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"547\"/><timeReceived>8:12 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 23, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The comment was written and posted on June 1, 2020:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On behalf of more than 500,000 members and supporters of Public Citizen, we offer the following comment in response to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Request for Information (RFI) dated April 1, 2020.</p><p>In brief, we protest the creation of a taskforce with such a breathtakingly inapposite agenda, its inappropriate make-up, its use of public funding, and its opacity.</p><p>Breathtakingly Inapposite Agenda</p><p>The Federal Register notices that these and other public comments received will \"assist the Taskforce on Federal Consumer Financial Law (Taskforce).\" Further, it is explained, \"The Taskforce is an independent body within the Bureau and reports to the Bureau's Director. The Taskforce is charged with developing recommendations on harmonizing, modernizing, and updating the Federal consumer financial laws, as well as identifying gaps in knowledge that should be addressed through research, ways to improve consumer understanding of markets and products, and potential conflicts or inconsistencies in existing regulations and guidance.\"</p><p>Admittedly, the evolution of consumer financial law has been path-dependent; if the task force were parachuting into a new country and charged with establishing legal protections in consumer finance, it might make sense to start from scratch and embark on such an analysis. But this is not a new country.</p><p>Consumer finance protection law derives from years of experiment, from response to an evolving consumer demographic, from evolving technologies, from the back and froth of politics. That's how all laws come to be. Instead, this taskforce is a one-year, unneeded sham exercise by a corporate-captured administration. Whatever product emerges from this taskforce should eventually molder on the dusty shelves where overpriced, neglected government reports are warehoused.</p><p>While it might be useful to marshal experts to address a discrete, urgent problem, such as the need for low interest small dollar loans to be more accessible to low income citizens,/1 the creation of public accounts at the Federal Reserve,/2 or enabling banking through the U.S. Postal Service,/3 this taskforce and the associated RFI address foundational questions about virtually all of consumer finance protection.</p><p>The RFI asks about essentially forms of credit:</p><p>* Automobile financing (credit or lease)</p><p>* Credit cards</p><p>* Credit repair</p><p>* Consumer reporting</p><p>* Debt collection by third parties (collection agencies)</p><p>* Debt collection by creditors (inhouse collections)</p><p>* Debt settlement</p><p>* Deposit accounts (checking or savings)</p><p>* Electronic payments</p><p>* Money transfers</p><p>* Mortgage origination and servicing</p><p>* Prepaid cards</p><p>* Small-dollar loans (installment, payday, vehicle title loans)</p><p>* Student loans and student loan servicing</p><p>The RFI also asks how to approach consumer protection. Should it be through enforcement, or education?</p><p>Surely, any one of these individual items deserve a textbook-sized response.</p><p>The RFI asks for input on \"[h]ow well financial markets are functioning for consumers.\" Again, such a broad and encompassing question demands textbook-length consideration, extensive polling, focus groups, a latitudinal survey, and more. It is simply not possible in 60 days for any thoughtful expert to provide a complete, responsible response. Even with a longer timeframe, given the current COVID-19 pandemic and its associated pressing financial problems facing American families, it would still not be possible for consumer advocates and personal finance experts to provide suitable comment.</p><p>Inappropriate Make-up of Task Force Members</p><p>In addition to the overwhelmingly broad purview of this taskforce RFI , the proposed makeup of the taskforce is also cause for great concern. The foundational, existential questions posed by this RFI are those that should be addressed by the elected representatives of Americans, that is, Congress. Instead, these comments will funnel to a tunnel-minded, ideologically homogenous, unaccountable \"taskfarce\" of fringe agents of corporate interests./4</p><p>Observed Ed Mierzwinski, senior director at US PIRG, \"To my knowledge, none have worked for consumer protection organizations yet all have worked as industry consultants or been aligned with industry views.\"/5</p><p>A quick glance at members' biographies shows the extent of the task force's corporate capture:</p><p>* Dr. J. Howard Beales, III, former Professor of Strategic Management and Public Policy at the George Washington University and former Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission. A Public Citizen report described his curricula vitae this way: \"A conservative economist, Beales directed the FTC's Consumer Protection Bureau between 2001 and 2004 and worked in the bureau for four years in the Reagan administration. Beales consulted for tobacco company R.J. Reynolds and authored a study concluding that ads featuring the Joe Camel character did not encourage children to smoke. Since leaving the FTC, he has primarily worked as a professor at George Washington University. Other corporate clients Beales served in private practice include, according to his curriculum vitae, America Online, Walt Disney Company, Pepsico, American Express, Visa, Exxon Mobil and Primerica.</p><p>More recently, Beales has acknowledged the financial support of his work from the Association of National Advertisers and the Digital Advertising Alliance, a self-regulatory consortium of businesses engaged in online advertising including Amazon, Facebook, IBM, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, Comcast and Yahoo.\"/6</p><p>Bloomberg reported that \"Beales has also provided expert testimony for CashCall, a payday lender, in a 2015 CFPB enforcement action, and served as an expert witness for Think Finance, another payday lender, in the course of its bankruptcy proceedings following the CFPB's case against it.\"/7</p><p>* Dr. Thomas Durkin, Senior Economist (Retired) at the Federal Reserve Board. In a letter challenging the narrow ideological spectrum from which this taskforce was selected, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), noted that \"since retiring from the Federal Reserve Board, Thomas Durkin has partnered with [taskforce chair Todd] Zywicki to pen articles and op-eds advocating for the rollback of financial regulation and in favor of payday loans, or as he called them, 'legal, high-cost' credit options.\"/8</p><p>* William Mc MacLeod, partner of Kelley Drye, former Director, FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection and Bureau of Competition. Noted Sens. Warren and Brown, MacLeod \"also traded in his FTC experience to work at a law firm where he defends corporations from government investigations, and, in his words, has 'resolutely fought against onerous regulations.'\"9</p><p>* L. Jean Noonan, Partner at Hudson Cook, former General Counsel at the Farm Credit Administration, and former Associate Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection's Credit Practice at the Federal Trade Commission. Of Noonan, Sens. Brown and Warren observed, \"Jean Noonan traded in her work at the Federal Trade Commission to work as an attorney at a corporate law firm that represents payday lenders that the Bureau has investigated or sued for ripping off consumers.\"/10</p><p>* Todd J. Zywicki, Professor of Law at George Mason University (GMU) Antonin Scalia Law School, Senior Fellow of the Cato Institute, and former Executive Director of the GMU Law and Economics Center./11</p><p>The aforementioned senators noted, \"Todd Zywicki . . . has called the Bureau a 'tragic failure' and has argued that the 2008 financial crisis was 'not a crisis of consumer protection.' He has been a director of Global Economics Group, a consulting firm hired by Visa, Bank of America, and Citigroup to influence the Bureau and other regulatory agencies. Mr. Zywicki also was paid $500 an hour to help defend . . . a debt relief company . . . from a Bureau investigation. That company eventually shut down after it was caught fabricating evidence, but not before it had scammed consumers out of more than $130 million.\"/12</p><p>Ideology has run the CFPB amok before./13</p><p>Squandering Taxpayer Dollars</p><p>Adding insult, consumers/taxpayers must fund this anti-consumer assault on our protections. Diane Thompson, a former top CFPB official and now an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, told Bloomberg, \"\"This looks like a plan to draft a far-right wing agenda for gutting 40- to 50-year-old consumer protections, on the public's dime.\"/14</p><p>Summarized Bloomberg, \"The task force members' prorated salaries are near the top of the pay scale for the CFPB, an agency frequently criticized by Republican lawmakers for paying its staff more generously than most other federal agencies.\"/15</p><p>Public Citizen filed Freedom of Information Act requests for details of pay for this group, and found \"Zywicki's salary of $142 per hour comes to about $226,944 for full time work at the 200-day maximum he's permitted to work.\"/16</p><p>By statute, the CFPB already maintains four independent advisory committees./17</p><p>Members bring vast expertise to their assignments, engage in rigorous discussion in important topics, and more. The task of the Academic Research Council is to \"provide the Office of Research with technical advice and feedback on research methodologies, data collection strategies, and methods of analysis, including methodologies and strategies for quantifying the costs and benefits of regulatory actions.\" All are unpaid. [It may be noted that unpaid volunteers appointed under the Obama administration, versus those task force members enjoying generous remuneration, have been targets of conservative critics. For example, John Czwartacki, who served as CFPB spokesman under former acting CFPB Director Mick Mulvaney, released a statement responding to complaints by board volunteers whom Mulvaney had just terminated, stating, \"The outspoken members of the Consumer Advisory Board seem more concerned about protecting their taxpayer funded junkets to Washington, DC and being wined and dined by the Bureau than protecting consumers.\"]/18</p><p>For that matter, should Kraninger truly wish to explore foundational issues of consumer financial protection law, she already pays a staff of researchers, policy experts and others who work in offices very near hers. There is no reason to waste taxpayer dollars on this unneeded, duplicative taskforce.</p><p>Legitimacy</p><p>The CFPB appears to be evading the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which is designed to bring transparency and balance to committees like this one.</p><p>The CFPB claims the task force is exempt from FACA because it is an intra-governmental committee./19</p><p>But FACA's exemption for intra-governmental committees would only apply if the task force were composed \"wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time\" federal government employees or officers./20</p><p>CFPB documents, which Public Citizen received in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, show that is not the case here. For instance, none of the task force's members are working full-time for the task force and at least four are in time-limited positions. Indeed, it appears that at least three of the task force members retain full time jobs elsewhere./21</p><p>Sens. Warren and Brown also challenge the task force's legitimacy./22</p><p>Lack of Transparency</p><p>Presumably, the corporate-aligned ideological members of this task force hope to produce a report that pro-business lawmakers can cite when they press their anti-consumer agenda. They will theatrically loft the report in hearings, characterize it as a government report, point to the CFPB brand undoubtedly to be highlighted on the cover, perhaps note that it was produced on a taxpayer-funded commission, and dramatically declare that impartial experts advise thus and such deregulatory move.</p><p>What the taskforce produces will no doubt reflect libertarian ideology, not consumer protection goals. It will reflect the well-known views of its task force members. It will waste taxpayer dollars.</p><p>While none of this can be repaired now, the taskforce must make its deliberations open to the public. Only then can they make even the most tenuous claims that they are considering these foundational questions fairly. Only if the public can see debate, even it would be staged, about alternatives they considered, can this Kraninger project make even a slim claim that it hasn't precooked a recipe.</p><p>The taskforce must hold its meetings in public. Public Citizen wishes and intends to attend these meetings, and we wish access to task force records, including meeting materials and minutes.</p><p>Again, we strongly oppose the existence of this task force--it's conception, the profile of its members, the abuse of public funding, its legitimacy and its apparent opacity.</p><p>For questions, please contact Bartlett Naylor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bnaylor@citizen.org\">bnaylor@citizen.org</email></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Public Citizen</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1/ Payday and Other Small Dollar Loans, CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING (website visited May 27, 2020) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.responsiblelending.org/issues/payday-other-small-dollar-loans\">https://www.responsiblelending.org/issues/payday-other-small-dollar-loans</url></p><p>2/ Andrew Cockburn, Forget Checks, How About Giving Everyone A Federal Reserve Account?

Threatening America's most financially vulnerable, the Kraninger CFPB is in the process of gutting protections for payday loan victims. A former CFPB economist has accused the CFPB leadership of corrupting the research process for that led to undermining the payday victim protection rule fashioned under the Obama administration, according to a memo reported by the New York Times. Behind this corruption, reported American Prospect, was a political appointee named Christopher G. Mufarrige. \"A staff attorney, alleged to have manipulated evidence that led to the gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's payday lending rule, operated a business in Texas for three years whose model has been criticized as predatory, according to records obtained by a watchdog group,\" summarized American Prospect.

That's exactly why tech titans are using their giant bank accounts, army of lobbyists and Washington insider connections to rig the rules in their favor, leaving states and the public with no meaningful recourse, the groups said.</p><p>As has been widely reported, big tech companies are pushing for preemption to avoid having to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), set to take effect in 2020. Their ostensible support for a federal law is actually a red herring - an attempt to \"hit delete on all state data protection laws,\" as Federal Trade Commissioner Rohit Chopra put it.</p><p>In their document, the groups outlined several key reasons why any new federal privacy law must not interfere with states' ability to implement and enforce stronger protections:</p><p>* States are laboratories of democracy in our system of government - able to respond more quickly and more precisely to emerging challenges and test innovative solutions that, if successful, can be adopted nationwide.</p><p>* Local regulators are better positioned than the federal government to recognize which communities are disproportionately impacted and how. Often, they are the first to notice and act when consumers are harmed by reckless and exploitative corporate practices.</p><p>* Any new law - even the strongest law possible - will be out of date within a few years, given the rapid pace of technological change and deliberate efforts by tech companies to outwit and outmaneuver regulators. States can update protections and add new ones more quickly than federal lawmakers, who can take years or decades to act.</p><p>* Stronger state protections can mitigate a systemic crisis, as recent history suggests. If state regulators' hands hadn't been tied by preemption in the 1990s and 2000s, they could have reined in the home lending abuses that led to the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>Tech giants often misleadingly claim that a patchwork of state laws would interfere with their ability to do business, but the reality is that they simply can follow the strongest state law and give consumers everywhere the same robust protections. There's no reason - either technical or financial - that some the most profitable companies in human history should have any problem complying with even a wide variety of high privacy, security and anti-discrimination standards. The truth is that the tech titans don't want to be held accountable by the public, the groups said.</p><p>QUOTES FROM EXPERTS</p><p>\"Given that technology evolves at hyperspeed and usually behind closed doors, any federal law enacted today soon will be out of date. Big Tech knows that preemption in a federal law would allow the industry to get away with continuing business as usual - constant exploitation of consumers' intimate personal information and their civil rights - now and long into the future.\"</p><p>* Kristen Strader, digital rights advocate, Public Citizen</p><p>\"States are the laboratories of democracy and have led the way on privacy and security in the U.S. - all 50 states passed data security laws before Congress was able to. Congress shouldn't step in now to prevent states from protecting the privacy of their residents.\"</p><p>* Christine Bannan, consumer protection counsel, EPIC</p><p>\"The number one demand of the powerful interests demanding a federal privacy law is to preempt the states. Special interests don't want citizens, let alone consumers, to have broad rights against privacy harms or set limits on facial surveillance. Those are just two of the many areas where states are taking the lead, but it is highly unlikely Congress will do anything good.\"</p><p>* Ed Mierzwinski, senior director for consumer programs.

Introduction</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Competition law has long been understood as a variety of public interest law, broadly construed. 2  Whether stemming from its capacity to increase the size of the pie available to all, or specifically to increase access to necessities for the most vulnerable, the task of taming private market power almost inevitably relies upon justifications related to the broader public interest. 3  Yet in a contemporary landscape where even mainstream scholars are calling for an end to capitalism or at least its progressive rethinking, 4  the simple pursuit of an economically oriented understanding of consumer welfare has faced criticism as being both ill-conceived and inadequate. 5  This contribution explores the capacity of EU competition law, in particular, to pursue more specific public interest objectives over and above its established task of \u201cmaking markets work better.\u201d 6 </p><p>The term \u201cpublic interest\u201d is inevitably somewhat nebulous and imprecise. Within the EU, the newly revived debate has been prompted by the prohibition of the proposed <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alstom</emphasis>/<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Siemens</emphasis> merger, 7  a decision heavily criticized by the certain Member States on the basis that it fails to take due account of wider industrial policy considerations. 8  Environmental protection and the desirability of ensuring sustainability in modes of production is another area of focus, 9  chiming with policy debates regarding the necessity to tackle the incipient climate crisis. Similarly, concerns about societal inequality, 10  unfair labor practices, 11  and a host of problems associated with the increasingly pervasive digital economy 12 \u2014from violations of data privacy to the spread of fake news\u2014have made their mark in discussions regarding the optional scope and goals of contemporary competition law. This article adopts an equally expansive definition of public interest, to encompass any application of the competition rules which embraces values that extend beyond the conventional (if disputed) wisdom that \u201cgiven its economic character, competition law aims, in the final analysis, to enhance efficiency.\u201d 13 </p><p>This article focuses on the EU antitrust rules, namely Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Public interest concerns may feed into the enforcement of these rules in multiple ways. Rival economic actors may enter into outwardly restrictive agreements in furtherance of noneconomic public policy objectives, such as the promotion of animal welfare 14  or access to justice. 15  To what extent can these latter goals be taken into account when considering the compatibility of the underlying coordination with Article 101? A dominant undertaking may impose a pricing policy which has the effect of both foreclosing rivals but also of enhancing social inclusion, 16  or conversely one which reflects an economically defensible monopoly profit for successful innovation but nonetheless prevents access for the most socially precarious. 17  The question, again, is whether these wider public interest considerations can feed into the otherwise narrowly tailored assessment of whether the relevant conduct should be classified as abusive under Article 102. Moreover, where other fields of law exist precisely to protect the claimed public interest concerns, such as data protection or consumer protection rules, when might (non)compliance with parallel regulatory requirements be a pertinent antitrust consideration?</p><p>The conventional wisdom is that Articles 101 and 102 focus on the protection of \u201ccompetition as such.\u201d This comparatively expansive concept links to the role played by the competition rules in developing and reinforcing the single market structure but, conversely, does not extend to noneconomic public interest justifications. Yet EU competition law cannot avoid the inconvenient reality that antitrust, if interpreted broadly and without reference to the underlying context, might serve to inhibit or even prohibit large swathes of activity that the average European would consider to be very worthwhile indeed. This article explores this tension, considering both the orthodoxy, but also going beyond it to suggest a variety of ways in which broader public interest concerns may feed in, more obliquely and typically without explicit acknowledgment, to the Commission\u2019s enforcement practice. The resulting legal position is quite distinct from the assumption that public interest concerns are accommodated within the competition rules primarily through an approach of derogating from the application of the latter. Yet, the examples considered are both context-specific and less than all-encompassing in scope, thus demonstrating the continuing difficulty of squaring this ostensibly technocratic, keenly focused field of law with more amorphous and disputed public interest concerns.</p><p>The purpose here is not to argue for or against greater incorporation of public interest considerations within the substantive antitrust analysis, although there is plenty of literature that does precisely this. 18  Rather, the emphasis is on the extent to which such concerns can and have been incorporated within the current EU legal framework, in particular in light of the nominal movement toward a \u201cmore economic approach.\u201d The article is structured as follows. Section II sets out the wider background to the consideration of public interest within EU competition law. Section III outlines the established approach to accommodating such concerns within this context, including recognized derogations to the concept of economic activity, the extent to which public interest can be accounted for in substantive antitrust analysis or included within the exception rules available under Articles 101 and 102, and the possibility of justifying such conduct by reference to the State action defense. Section IV takes a different tack, departing from this conventional narrative to suggest the de facto recognition of public interest concerns in the Commission\u2019s enforcement practice in three areas: public utilities sectors, pharmaceutical markets, and the digital economy. Both the achievements and the limitations of using antitrust law to pursue wider public interest values in these contexts are considered. Section V concludes briefly.</p><h>II. The Broader Context of Public Interest in EU Competition Law</h><p>EU competition law is a complex beast. The same rules apply across what has for most of the EU\u2019s history been an ever-expanding range of national jurisdictions and disparate market circumstances. Additionally, the Court of Justice approved a plurality of goals from the outset, including the development of the internal market 19  and preservation of structural competition in a manner generally considered to reflect Ordoliberal influences. 20  The question of the extent to which EU competition law can and does pursue a wider spectrum of public interest objectives is thus complicated by the complexity of the law itself. This section considers three overarching factors of relevance to the discussion to follow.</p><p>First, EU competition law has, for some time, been undergoing a process of modernization and readjustment. 21  The system long faced criticism that undue emphasis was placed on the protection of competitors at the expense of the wider competition process. Largely in response, the past decade or so witnessed a more fulsome embracing of the so-called more economic approach to antitrust enforcement. 22  The cornerstone of this development has been the Commission\u2019s adoption of an \u201canticompetitive foreclosure\u201d standard as the basis for intervention. 23  While the Court has not (yet) endorsed unequivocally the more economic approach, much of its recent jurisprudence reflects a more nuanced understanding both of the operation of markets and the optimal role for competition law. In particular, the Court has focused its attention principally on behavior that harms competition. 24  In bringing EU law more directly in line with the consumer welfare paradigm, however, the Commission has essentially disclaimed any role for broader public interest considerations. 25 </p><p>On the other hand, this question is being asked in the wider context of a rapidly shifting landscape for EU competition law more generally. Relevant reforms include greater \u201cdecentralization\u201d of enforcement to national competition authorities 26  alongside parallel efforts to encourage a culture of private enforcement; 27  a widespread populist backlash against \u201cneoliberal\u201d Europe generally, with searching questions about \u201cthe future of Europe\u201d 28  as a result; and the increasing rhetorical prominence of the notion that competition law should pursue \u201cfair\u201d market outcomes, without much indication as to how this slogan fits with established and evolving antitrust practice. 29  Each of these developments poses challenges to the more economic approach, and all have a potential role to play in determining the receptiveness of EU competition law to public interest concerns.</p><p>Second, the EU antitrust rules do not exist within a regulatory vacuum, and public interest considerations find purchase to a greater or lesser extent within the broader legal framework that underpins the single market. There is, first, the wider competition landscape, including the State aid rules which constrain the ability of Member States to intervene in domestic economies, albeit with limited derogations for public interest type interventions. 30  The internal market rules, similarly, aim to ensure a level playing field for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and workers, with a default presumption that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">State</emphasis>-imposed barriers to \u201cmarket access\u201d contravene EU law. 31  The fundamental freedoms nonetheless admit of the possibility of departing from this approach to further public interest objectives, 32  an amazingly broad range of which have been recognized 33 \u2014provided, however, that the restriction of competition entailed is proportionate to the legitimate objective pursued. 34 </p><p>What is notable is the consistent manner in which public interest concerns are approached within this regulatory framework. Whether under the State aid rules or the fundamental freedoms, the underlying assumption is that the public interest, broadly construed, is best served through open and undistorted competition. To the extent that particular public interests may conflict with this free-marketeering vision, the latter may yield in defined circumstances. Yet, although EU law is not insensible to public interest considerations, the implication is that such concerns are extraordinary phenomena, a derogation from the norm of the open and competitive internal market. Accordingly, EU law typically responds to the challenge of countervailing public interest concerns, not by accommodating them <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">within</emphasis> its regulatory framework, but by carving out space <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">outside</emphasis> the rules, and imposing more or less demanding requirements on those which seek to rely upon such derogations. 35 </p><p>Finally, there is the difficulty of identifying any precise pan-EU \u201cpublic\u201d interest. Indeed, much of the historic rationale for approaching public interest considerations as derogations stemmed from the fact that, although EU law mandates the universal acceptance of unencumbered competition, there is incomplete harmonization of other regulatory rules. 36  Member States thus continue to pursue a wide spectrum of differing values. Most basically, despite the rhetoric of \u201cever closer union,\u201d in reality there is no single European \u201cdemos.\u201d Instead, as the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">demoicracy</emphasis> concept reflects, EU law is essentially premised on the mutual recognition of discrete identities and not their merger. 37  Yet EU competition law comprises a single set of rules which must be applied, equally and uniformly, across the Member States. To the extent that public interest considerations are allowed a role here, there accordingly may be considerable difficulty in isolating a single consistent understanding of what exactly <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is</emphasis> in the putative public\u2019s interest, with significant scope for competing and conflicting visions. 38  Moreover, and more skeptically, there is often a substantial gulf between what the European public, such as it exists, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">thinks</emphasis> that it wants, and what the Commission thinks that public <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">should</emphasis> want.</p><h>III. The Orthodox Treatment of Public Interest in EU Competition Law</h><p>It is in the context of this multifaceted and somewhat fluid legal framework that our exploration of the orthodox approach to claimed public interest considerations begins. Although assessment under the EU antitrust rules is attuned to the particular \u201clegal and economic context\u201d of a restraint, 39  the existing jurisprudence does not provide any direct avenue by which these rules may, in themselves, be deployed to pursue discrete public interest objectives. As this section explains, to the extent that the latter is pursued by economic operators in a manner that triggers antitrust scrutiny, it is therefore necessary to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">derogate</emphasis> from application of Articles 101 or 102, whether by classifying the conduct as falling outside the scope of \u201ceconomic activity,\u201d by reference to the specific exceptions provided by Article 101(3) or the objective justification concept under Article 102, or by overreaching the competition rules through the exercise of State action.</p><h>A. The Concept of an \u201cUndertaking\u201d</h><p>Articles 101 and 102 apply only to restrictive behavior by \u201cundertakings.\u201d Although the concept was left undefined in the TFEU, the ensuing case law adopted a so-called functional approach, 40  which hinges on the identification of an economic activity carried on by the defendant, 41  namely the provision of goods or services on a relevant market. 42  Conversely, conduct that escapes the definition of economic activity also escapes scrutiny under the antitrust rules. The parameters of the concept of an undertaking thus provide the first potential reprieve for public interest-oriented market behavior.</p><p>At first glance, however, the definition of economic activity is remarkably broad, meaning that only a limited subset of conduct can potentially be exempted on this basis. Both the legal status of the entity and the way in which it is financed are, nominally, irrelevant to its classification as an undertaking. 43  Although the crux of economic activity is the provision of goods or services, it is unnecessary for the defendant to be doing so on a for-profit basis: instead, \u201c[t]he basic test is\u2026whether the entity in question is engaged in an activity which could, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">at least in principle</emphasis>, be carried on by a private undertaking in order to make profits.\u201d 44  The upshot is that, in theory, a wide range of market actors may constitute undertakings and come within the purview of the competition rules, including nonprofit entities, 45  entities created and governed by public law, 46  state companies, 47  and those encumbered with public service obligations that make their operations less competitive than comparable private operators. 48 </p><p>The case law, however, recognizes several broad exceptions to this otherwise all-encompassing definition. The first is where the underlying impetus for the activity is the pursuit of social solidarity, defined as \u201cthe inherently <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">uncommercial</emphasis> act of involuntary subsidization of one social group by another.\u201d 49  Activities benefiting from this exception involve a degree of redistribution 50  and typically relate to social welfare provision administered through quasi-private mechanisms. 51  The second exception arises where, although the activity nominally consists in the provision of (usually) a service, in substance it reflects \u201cthe exercise of official authority,\u201d 52  and so is more properly understood as an application of public power. Activities potentially benefiting from this exception range from air-traffic control services 53  to environmental monitoring checks 54  to the regulation of certain sports. 55  A third exception relates to the so-called false self-employed. 56  Generally, independent contractors constitute undertakings in their own right under EU competition law. 57  Where, however, those individuals are in positions of particular vulnerability and dependence in relation to the purchaser of their services, they may fall outside the definition of an undertaking so as to facilitate, for instance, collective bargaining in pursuit of better working conditions. 58 </p><p>Each of these exceptions evinces a distinct public interest character, whether it is to advance social solidarity, to further nonmarket goals such as public safety or environmental protection, or to safeguard vulnerable workers. In each instance, moreover, successful invocation of the relevant ground for exemption enables the public interest concern to prevail in the event of conflict with the competition rules. Yet in line with the discussion above, the preferred approach is not to seek to embed such considerations within the substantive antitrust analysis, but rather straightforwardly to exclude the latter if necessary, in order to further other, putatively incompatible public interests. In this manner, the competition rules recognize the importance of nonmarket concerns, but seek to protect these primarily through an approach of exclusion rather than accommodation.</p><h>B. Accommodating the Public Interest Within Substantive Antitrust Analysis</h><p>Within the realm of economic activity, the competition rules apply with full force. Under Articles 101 and 102, suspect conduct is subject to an objective assessment of its impact, likely or actual, upon the functioning of effective competition. Article 101 thus requires the identification either of instances of collusion that can be deemed, \u201cby their very nature, harmful to the proper functioning of normal competition,\u201d 59  or of evidence that \u201ccompetition has in fact been prevented, restricted or distorted to an appreciable extent\u201d as a result. 60  The concept of abuse under Article 102 hinges upon the ill-defined notion of \u201crecourse to methods different from those which condition normal competition,\u201d 61  but is similarly aimed, ultimately, at dominant firm behavior which may \u201cimpair genuine, undistorted competition.\u201d 62 </p><p>Substantive antitrust assessment, accordingly, focuses squarely on competition problems that arise from firm behavior. Although recent case law emphasizes the nuanced, context-dependent nature of this exercise, it does not recognize the possibility of excusing restrictive practices on the basis that they nonetheless further other socially valuable goals 63 \u2014or, conversely, of condemning competitive behavior that nonetheless conflicts with such values. Even leaving aside the question of public interest considerations, the Court has been criticized for an almost pathological focus on \u201ccompetition as such,\u201d to the point where overall consumer welfare-enhancing behavior may nonetheless fall foul of the antitrust rules. 64  Against such a background, the challenge of accommodating what are essentially nonmarket public values directly within the assessment framework is clear.</p><p>Under Articles 101 and 102, the subjective intention of defendants is not determinative of the objective characterization of their behavior. In particular, any argument that a defendant may be motivated by \u201cgood\u201d intentions\u2014in the sense that its conduct pursues an outcome directly aligned to broader public interest considerations\u2014is not a factor of relevance when assessing likely or actual impact from a competition perspective. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">BIDS</emphasis>, 65  for instance, the fact that an industry-wide collective reduction in capacity was designed to further industrial policy objectives regarding the development of the Irish agricultural sector was immaterial to its characterization as a restriction of competition by object. 66  The Court in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Slovakian Banks</emphasis> similarly gave short shrift to claims that the impugned collusion was prompted by the necessity to frustrate an unlicensed (and thus presumably unscrupulous) competitor, insofar as this did not negate the arrangement\u2019s inherently anticompetitive nature. 67  In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Deutsche Telekom</emphasis>, which concerned a margin squeeze in the telecommunications sector, the defendant made a loss on providing residential fixed-line access which it cross-subsidized through higher call costs. But so too did its competitors, a pricing structure that was directly attributable to governmental policy to promote cheap line access on social inclusion grounds. Yet, once again, the wider background was deemed irrelevant, so that the defendant was held to breach Article 102 by maintaining an \u201cunfair spread\u201d between wholesale and retail prices in the fixed-line market alone. 68 </p><p>The extent to which a parallel \u201cbad\u201d intention might equate to an anticompetitive one is more complicated. In certain circumstances, the concept of the \u201clegal and economic context\u201d of putatively restrictive behavior may be read sufficiently broadly to take account of breach of other social or legal norms. As cases like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Telekomunikacja Polska</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AstraZeneca</emphasis> demonstrate, 69  the fact that a defendant has violated or acted contrary to the spirit of other regulatory obligations may be considered significant in determining whether the same behavior constitutes an antitrust violation. The ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between carmakers accused of restricting competition in the development of emission cleaning technology similarly suggests that congruent public interest concerns (here, environmental protection) can feed into the determination of whether more novel forms of potentially anticompetitive behavior deserve condemnation as \u201chard-core\u201d restraints. 70 </p><p>Yet the competition jurisprudence suggests a skeptical view of parallel public interests which involve objectives that are clearly distinct from those of open and undistorted competition. Thus, in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Asnef-Equifax</emphasis>, the Court held, uncompromisingly, that a claimed breach of the data protection rules\u2014treated as a fundamental rights issue within EU law 71 \u2014was irrelevant when assessing whether collusion contrary to Article 101 had occurred. 72  In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Siemens/Areva</emphasis>, concerning a noncompete agreement in the nuclear technology sector, the Commission made zero reference to the much-disputed nature of the underlying activity, in a commitment decision that focused solely on ensuring the competitive health of the sector. 73  And remarkably, across the various competition cases involving products that pose a threat to public health, such as alcohol 74  or tobacco, 75  there is little discussion of the fact that the most immediate benefit of greater competition\u2014lower prices\u2014is of dubious value insofar as it facilitates greater consumption. 76  Conversely, this theme has been explored in detail in the free movement case law, most recently in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Scotch Whisky</emphasis>. 77  The latter provides an interesting comparator for the antitrust context, insofar as the State-imposed public health restriction at issue comprised minimum pricing rules for alcohol which, unlike an increase in excise duty, steers any inflated revenues to sellers rather than the exchequer.</p><p>Moreover, even if parallel wrongfulness may augment or confirm the anticompetitive nature of less clear-cut categories of restrictions, it cannot provide a substitute for anticompetitive behavior as such. This is exemplified by the limitations of Article 102. Although undertakings holding significant market power have a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to protect \u201cgenuine undistorted competition,\u201d 78  this notional duty cannot function to compel dominant undertakings to, for instance, switch to more efficient fuel sources, or promote diversity within their workforce. 79  Indeed, it cannot even, in principle, attack \u201cbigness as such,\u201d a revitalized contemporary concern of so-called hipster antitrust. 80  We see further examples of this crucial limitation\u2014that is, the need to anchor competition enforcement within the established framework of the antitrust rules\u2014in relation to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Servier</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook</emphasis> cases, discussed in Section IV.</p><p>Finally, it is important to clarify that even when assessment under the antitrust rules depends on a demonstration of anticompetitive impact, this is an ineffective conduit by which to introduce public interest considerations. In line with the movement toward a more economic approach, there has been a turn away from form-based prohibitions under Articles 101 and 102, with greater emphasis being placed on what the circumstances of a restraint may indicate about its likely or foreseeable effects. The crux of this development, however, is the extent to which detrimental market outcomes can be successfully inferred (or otherwise) merely from the form that allegedly anticompetitive behavior takes, or whether a more involved consideration of the legal and economic context is required. This is distinct from the question of whether (actual or presumed) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">non</emphasis>market effects can be brought to bear in assessing the notional competitive impact of market behavior, which, as discussed above, is in principle impossible within the current framework.</p><h>C. Justifying Anticompetitive Behavior on a Public Interest Basis</h><p>Under Articles 101 and 102, identifying <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">prima facie</emphasis> anticompetitive conduct is merely a first stage in the assessment of legality. Both prohibitions incorporate exception rules which enable defendants to justify their behavior in certain circumstances, and here too questions of broader public interest may be relevant. Article 101 expressly provides for this possibility in its third paragraph, which sets out a fourfold cumulative list of requirements to be satisfied in order for the first paragraph prohibition rule to be declared inapplicable. Although Article 102 provides no such textual basis, the prohibition on abuse of dominance has been interpreted to incorporate the possibility of \u201cobjective justification,\u201d which requires either a demonstration of countervailing efficiencies stemming from the alleged restraint or its objective necessity. 81  Under both provisions, the burden of proof lies with the defendant. The key question is the extent to which these exception rules might be relied upon to exempt anticompetitive behavior on noncompetition-oriented grounds.</p><p>Starting with Article 101(3), the threshold requirement is that the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">prima facie</emphasis> restrictive coordination nonetheless \u201ccontributes to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress.\u201d Earlier case law read this criterion expansively, with the Court accepting that any \u201cconsiderations connected with the pursuit of the public interest\u201d were potentially applicable. 82  A myriad of noncompetition public interests are discernible in older Commission practice, including protection of employment 83  and the environment, 84  and furthering industrial policy 85  and regional development. 86  Yet in tandem with the decentralization of the Article 101(3) exception under Regulation 1/2003, the Commission in its accompanying Guidelines asserted that the first prong of that rule refers only to \u201cobjective economic benefits,\u201d that is to say, \u201cefficiency gains.\u201d 87  While both cost savings and qualitative efficiencies were deemed acceptable, 88  this narrower reading appears to foreclose the possibility of relying upon Article 101(3) to pursue noneconomic public interests. Of course, the Commission does not \u201cmake\u201d EU competition law as such, as the Court has pointed out often quite forcefully. 89  Yet a comparative absence of case law from the Court on the application of the exception rule since the publication of the 2004 Guidelines 90  means that the Commission\u2019s somewhat leftfield approach has remained unchallenged and thus unconfirmed\u2014<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">or</emphasis> refuted. A recent survey of enforcement practice at national level revealed a rather mixed bag, whereby domestic competition authorities have adopted differing views on the extent to which they must and shall follow the Commission\u2019s interpretation. 91  This correlates, arguably, with the dilemma highlighted in Section II regarding the practical impossibility of identifying a single European \u201cpublic\u201d interest here.</p><p>In any event, even if Article 101(3) continues to encompass noneconomic public interests in the more economic era, it requires more than merely identifying such a countervailing concern. Additionally, any consumers \u201cdirectly or likely affected\u201d 92  must receive a \u201cfair share of the resulting benefit.\u201d This criterion may be difficult to satisfy, in particular where certain consumers suffer the immediate detriment (through, for example, higher prices), but society as a whole sees the benefit (through, for example, a cleaner environment). The restraints must also be indispensable\u2014meaning \u201creasonably necessary\u201d 93 \u2014to the underlying legitimate objective and must not entail the risk of long-term harm to the overall competitive process. Again, the difficulty of applying these criteria in the context of noneconomic public interest is that it may require the balancing of \u201cessentially incomparable\u201d 94  phenomena. Whereas one can, fairly readily, assess the overall impact on consumer welfare of behavior that both harms one dimension of efficiency and enhances another, it is more difficult to determine what degree of enhanced private market power is proportionate to secure cleaner air, for instance, or more humane farming practices.</p><p>Although the Court has repeatedly recognized the possibility of invoking objective justification under Article 102, the parameters of this exception are less well defined. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that a claim of objective necessity might be successfully invoked on a public interest basis: for instance, to justify a refusal to continue to supply access to an indispensable but highly polluting input controlled by a dominant firm. 95  Such a scenario is perhaps farfetched, however, and the Commission\u2019s guidance on Article 102 cautions that, normally, it is the task of public authorities to make public interest-oriented determinations of this sort. 96  The second avenue by which a firm may potentially seek to objectively justify its behavior is by demonstrating that any anticompetitive effects \u201cmay be counterbalanced, or outweighed, by advantages in terms of efficiency which also benefit the consumer,\u201d 97  an approach that would appear to exclude noneconomic public interest concerns. 98  A possible explanation for this limitation is that firms acting unilaterally are likely to have less need, or at least less plausible motivation, to depart from normal methods of competition to further nonprofit-oriented public interest objectives. As discussed in Section IV, however, the opposite is not the case, and it will be suggested below that public interest concerns may conversely function to flesh out the amorphous \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d of dominant firms in certain instances.</p><h>D. Overreaching Antitrust in the Public Interest: State Action and Beyond</h><p>Finally, even if behavior is classified as economic activity, is held to be restrictive of competition, and cannot be justified by the defendant(s), a further option is available by which, potentially, to reflect public interest concerns. It was noted in the preceding paragraph that the Commission is generally wary of claims that private undertakings can accurately isolate and enforce the notional \u201cpublic\u201d interest. 99  Conversely, where ostensible private economic activity is in fact required by State regulation, then EU competition law recognizes a defense from liability for the undertakings concerned. 100  Such an exception similarly arises where the extent of existing public regulation within the notional market renders independent competitive conduct impossible, thus similarly precluding <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">anti</emphasis>competitive activity from arising. 101  The \u201cState action\u201d defense thus provides potential cover for economic activity that restricts competition in furtherance of public interest objectives\u2014but only where, crucially, the requisite degree of State involvement is demonstrated.</p><p>The difficulty of relying upon this exception in practice\u2014again, notably, a derogation from the ordinary competition rules\u2014is that the existing jurisprudence interprets the application of the State action defense in an incredibly narrow manner. In short, it is only if the existing regulatory framework removes <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis> scope for freedom of market action from the defendant that the application of the competition rules is excluded. Thus, in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">BIDS</emphasis>, the fact that the collective scheme had been developed and implemented with the express support of the ministry for agriculture was irrelevant to its treatment under Article 101 since the undertakings had entered into it voluntarily. 102  More radically, in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Deutsche Telekom</emphasis>, the wholesale and retail price levels that comprised the margin squeeze were both approved by the sector regulator. Yet the Court refused the application of the State action defense because the defendant nonetheless retained scope to lobby the regulator and seek a variation of the pricing spread. 103  Thus, the fact that the public interest objectives pursued by private parties coincide with public interests recognized by the State, or even that the State approves of and encourages the pursuit of such objectives through private means, cannot in itself serve to immunize private conduct from antitrust scrutiny. There are good reasons for a rigid approach to the State action defense, including the need to avoid its strategic <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mis</emphasis>use. But the upshot is that it is difficult not only to carve space within the EU competition framework for public interest-oriented behavior of a wholly private nature but also for behavior that has a more plausibly public character.</p><p>A further derogation is found in Article 106(2) TFEU, which exempts from application of, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">inter alia</emphasis>, the competition rules the provision by undertakings of \u201cservices of general economic interest\u201d (SGEIs) in certain circumstances. The SGEI concept corresponds broadly to most domestic notions of \u201cpublic service,\u201d 104  and Article 106(2) exception enables Member States to opt-out of elements of the \u201copen and competitive\u201d internal market to achieve defined public interest goals at the national level. 105  What is notable, for our purpose, is that as a derogation from the general application of EU law, Article 106(2) exception should in principle be strictly interpreted. Yet Member States have been given a fairly free hand in determining the categories of service that fall within the SGEI concept in their jurisdiction and are thus immunized from the application of the competition rules. 106  This, arguably, reflects a rather pragmatic choice to accommodate domestic welfare provision with the strictures imposed by EU law, in order to avoid potentially destabilizing conflicts with national governments on this point. 107 </p><h>IV. The Public Interest in Practice in EU Competition Law</h><p>The preceding section described an apparent dichotomy in terms of the treatment of public interest considerations within EU competition law. The substantive rules are largely indifferent to such concerns, beyond the trite assumption that enhancing consumer welfare is in the public interest. Yet if interpreted broadly and without reference to the underlying context, competition law might obstruct large swathes of activity that the average European would consider to be entirely worthwhile. The competition framework deals with this dilemma, largely, by carving out such conduct from the substantive scope of the rules: whether <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ex ante</emphasis> by removing it entirely from the concept of economic activity or through the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ex post</emphasis> deployment of an exception rule or the State action defense. The coverage of these derogations is less than complete, however, meaning that the competition rules still occasionally come into conflict with noneconomic public interest concerns: a position that contributes to the rather unfair characterization of the EU as a \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">liberalisation machine</emphasis>.\u201d 108  Yet, this article\u2019s account has been straightforward: tightly focused competition concerns on the one side and public interest-oriented derogations on the other.</p><p>As this penultimate section demonstrates, however, the reality is more complex. Despite a veneer of technocracy that envelopes contemporary enforcement, antitrust remains a highly political field of law, 109  and the Commission, moreover, an inescapably political entity. 110  Accordingly, even if EU competition law actively disclaims any direct role for public interest considerations within its substantive core, the competition rules can be\u2014and not infrequently <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">are</emphasis>\u2014deployed in a manner that reflects a distinct understanding of how best to advance the public interest, broadly understood. Competition law has two main advantages within the wider framework of EU law in this regard. First, it can be enforced by the Commission acting alone, without positive approval from the Parliament and Council. It thus provides a more effective tool by which to address contentious issues that may struggle to reach the level of consensus required for direct legislative intervention. 111  Second, the competition rules themselves are comparatively wide-ranging and amorphous; if not exactly a \u201cblank cheque\u201d 112  for enforcers, then certainly amenable to progressive development and reinterpretation in light of changing market circumstances. Accordingly, even if it remains necessary, when applying competition law in furtherance of public interest objectives, to make a connection to the functioning of market competition, there is scope to bring the wider context to bear in doing so: what Ezrachi describes as antitrust\u2019s \u201csponge-like\u201d qualities. 113 </p><p>There are two main ways in which broader public interest concerns are manifested in EU-level enforcement. First, there is the mere fact of concentrating recurrent activity in a particular area or in pursuit of particular objectives, which suggests the existence of a distinct \u201cUnion interest.\u201d 114  Three areas of recent focus by the Commission are considered below: liberalizing utilities markets, pharmaceutical markets, and the digital economy. In addition, and more contestably, the theories of harm that have been developed in such cases often demonstrate a progressive, occasionally contentious, approach to the competition rules. As will be explored below, where obvious issues of public interest are at stake, this may provide an impetus toward expansion or innovation in the antitrust context. Thus, although EU competition law is not a vehicle by which the public interest can be pursued directly, public interest concerns may feed into the Commission\u2019s approach to enforcement: resulting in more ambitious (and disputable) theories of harm and often marking a departure from the strict\u2014and restrictive\u2014logic of the \u201cmore economic approach.\u201d</p><p>In the remainder of this section, we consider our three examples in detail. The purpose is more descriptive than normative. The aim is neither to suggest that competition law <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">should</emphasis> be redirected toward the pursuit of noncompetition public interest goals nor that it invariably <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is</emphasis>. It will, however, be argued that the very particular public interest at stake in each example is apparent in the manner in which the Commission has approached its caseload in these areas, and in how the underlying legal rules are developed and expanded as a result. Accordingly, these examples provide a more granular picture of the relationship between competition enforcement and noncompetition public interests than the orthodoxy outlined in the preceding section otherwise suggests.</p><h>A. Competition Law and the Pursuit of Market Liberalization</h><p>The first area where a distinct \u201cpublic interest\u201d flavor to Commission enforcement is discernible is in support of the EU-level liberalization policies which have been pursued, most obviously, in telecommunications and energy markets in the past several decades. The desirability, indeed the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">inevitability</emphasis>, of liberalizing these typically State-owned monopoly sectors has long been a tenet of faith within the Commission, and competition enforcement commingles with increasingly demanding legislative efforts in this sphere. 115  The public interest here has several dimensions. There is, clearly, a public interest in securing cheaper better quality access to objectively necessary services like broadband, electricity, central heating, and public transport. This enhances consumer welfare in general but can also have a significant <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">re</emphasis>distributive impact: lower energy prices can provide market-based solutions to alleviate fuel poverty, for instance, while increased competition in telecommunications may encourage more rapid broadband expansion in underserved geographic regions. Yet this strand of case law also aligns with more dogmatic assumptions regarding the optional development of the internal market: a perception that \u201cthere is no alternative to the liberalisation process.\u201d 116  Accordingly, the focus on liberalized utilities markets also represents a more doctrinaire, disputed view about how such sectors ought to be structured and to function within the internal market. 117  The public interest at stake is thus not merely the desirability of securing cheaper and better services for (the most vulnerable) consumers; it moreover reflects the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">assumed</emphasis> societal value of the fully realized process of economic integration itself. 118 </p><p>The first indicator of a distinct public interest is the sheer weight of cases that have been pursued within the telecommunications 119  and energy 120  sectors. Yet the mere fact that the Commission brings many cases tells us little about its approach to the public interest issues at stake. To understand the latter, it is necessary to consider the sorts of cases being pursued, and how these map onto wider policy concerns. In short, the consistent theme is the extent to which <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">antitrust</emphasis> enforcement has aligned with, and reinforced, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">regulatory</emphasis> process of market liberalization. One sees this perhaps most obviously in the recurrent use of Article 9 case dispositions\u2014which empower the Commission to accept behavioral or structural commitments, such as divestiture remedies, in lieu of findings of breach\u2014in the energy sector, in a manner which arguably serves to compensate for the Commission\u2019s comparative lack of legislative success here. 121  From a substantive antitrust perspective, of greatest interest is the extent to which regulatory concerns have fed into two of the most prominent theories of harm applied in these sectors, namely, refusal to deal and margin squeeze. The frequent application of these theories is unsurprising, given that the sectors under scrutiny involve vertically integrated network utilities with natural monopoly segments. What is more remarkable, however, has been the Commission\u2019s approach to the interpretation and development of the case theories in this context.</p><p>Refusal to deal comprises the denial of access by dominant undertakings to strategically important market segments, in order to exclude competition in adjacent sectors. Under Article 102, claimed refusals are assessed under the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bronner</emphasis> criteria, which require a demonstration of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d to establish abuse. 122  What we see in the liberalization context, in particular, is a willingness to map the antitrust interpretation of exceptionality onto the parameters of the underlying sector-specific regulatory regime\u2014which, as argued above, reflects an essentially ideological understanding of the optimal operation of such markets.</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Telekomunikacja Polska</emphasis>, for instance, the impugned refusal consisted of failure to comply effectively with access obligations under the EU framework for telecommunications liberalization. Although the conduct had been sanctioned by the domestic regulator, the Commission 123  and the Court 124  had little difficulty in construing the regulatory violation, additionally, as an antitrust offense. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ENI</emphasis>, the alleged refusal included failure to anticipate likely <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">future</emphasis> requests for access and expand capacity accordingly, behavior that was conceptualized as \u201cstrategic underinvestment\u201d in the defendant\u2019s gas transport infrastructure. 125  Such an approach similarly has a distinct regulatory flavor, suggesting that the special responsibility of dominant firms extends to forecasting and promoting future market development. More recently, in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Slovak Telekom</emphasis>, 126  the General Court confirmed one of the contentious \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Telefonica</emphasis> exceptions,\u201d 127  to the effect that regulatory supply duties may function a proxy for indispensability, thus negating the need to consider nonduplicability from an antitrust perspective. 128  Moreover, the Court \u201csuggested\u201d that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bronner</emphasis> is irrelevant in situations of constructive refusal. 129  Such an approach makes little sense when measured against the cogent competition policy concerns that motivated the regulatory restraint implicit in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bronner</emphasis> 130  and is at odds with that advocated in the Commission\u2019s own Article 102 guidelines. 131  Yet it was vigorously advanced by the Commission in its earlier infringement decision, and defended by it on appeal. Each of these cases thus ably illustrates how the Commission\u2019s enthusiasm for deploying antitrust to \u201ccorrect\u201d the process of liberalization at Member State level may prompt an expansion of the relevant competition provisions to account for the particularities of the underlying regulatory framework\u2014creating, however, a risk of distortive effects for the competition rules longer term. 132 </p><p>Margin squeeze is the second theory of recurrent application. 133  Given its conceptual proximity to the refusal to deal, this may be expected, and indeed the Commission\u2019s Article 102 guidance assessed margin squeeze as a form of constructive refusal. 134  Starting with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Deutsche Telekom</emphasis>, 135  however, the Commission has treated margin squeeze as a distinct category of abusive behavior, an approach subsequently granted the imprimatur of the Court. 136  A logical but unsensible consequence, confirmed in the reference case of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">TeliaSonera</emphasis>, is that the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bronner</emphasis> criteria do not determine the existence of a margin squeeze. 137  Conceivably, a dominant firm may have an absolute right to deny access to its infrastructure under Article 102; but if it chooses to deal, it becomes subject to a positive duty to ensure a \u201cfair\u201d spread between wholesale and retail prices. Notably, this unsatisfactory state of affairs was actively advocated by the Commission in its intervention in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">TeliaSonera</emphasis>, premised on the (patently spurious) argument that, otherwise, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">any</emphasis> application of Article 102 would be contingent upon identifying an indispensable input. 138  This pared-down legal standard was then applied by the Commission in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Slovak Telekom</emphasis>, where the muddled reasoning of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">TeliaSonera</emphasis> was again deployed to support the \u201csuggestion\u201d that constructive refusals escape the established <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bronner</emphasis> conditions. 139 </p><p>What both strands of case law demonstrate is that, although the Commission may be happy in principle to tie its hands with more demanding assessment criteria in line with the \u201cmore economic approach,\u201d when it comes to actually applying competition law to address anticompetitive behavior in liberalizing markets, it is almost indecently eager to escape these shackles. Moreover, the thrust of the Commission\u2019s approach is that the competition rules coincide precisely with requirements under the liberalization framework. Yet where the Commission disagrees with how the national regulator has interpreted its task of liberalization, defendants receive little credit for having complied with the directions of the latter, as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Deutsche Telekom</emphasis> illustrated. 140  The most obvious takeaway is the extent to which (perceived) public interest considerations may influence both the intensity and the ambition of antitrust enforcement. Yet in the Commission\u2019s eagerness to police the task of liberalization through competition law, there is little consideration of whether the rules emerging represent best practice for the latter discipline as a whole\u2014and in particular, whether these interpretations continue to make sense once removed from the protection of the Commission, and applied by a diverse range of public and private enforcers within the increasingly decentralized EU system.</p><h>B. Competition Law and the Pharmaceutical Sector</h><p>The second area of concentrated enforcement is the pharmaceutical sector. 141  Multiple competing public interests loom large here, summarized by former Competition Commissioner Kroes as impacting both \u201cthe health and finances of Europe\u2019s citizens and governments.\u201d 142  Securing access to necessary medicine for patients has an inescapable public health dimension. Yet in Europe, where the final payer is often the State, access may be less a question of availability and more of cost to straitened public purses. Merely pushing down prices cannot be the sole objective, however. Not only is the pharmaceutical sector highly dependent on costly R&amp;D efforts to generate a pipeline of innovative new products that deliver improvements for patient health. Moreover, the health of the pharmaceutical sector itself raises industrial policy considerations in light of its key role within the EU economy. Thus, there are few obvious answers to competition problems in these markets, as the Commission\u2019s Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry, concluded in 2009, acknowledged. 143 </p><p>The preceding subsection described how public interest considerations underpinned a markedly expansive approach to an established theory of harm (a refusal to deal) in liberalizing market segments. In the pharmaceutical sector, by contrast, the public interests at stake have prompted significant legal innovation, resulting in the recognition of more novel theories that capture particular types of strategic behavior. This subsection considers two: the treatment of \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d agreements and \u201cregulatory gaming\u201d practices. Notably, both police the switch from patent protection to generic competition, and thus align with the balancing of multiple competing public interests in pharmaceutical cases: the end of patent protection marks the end of the period during which originator companies can plausibly claim a legitimate \u201cmonopoly reward\u201d for successful innovation, while the introduction of generic competition usually generates significant downward pricing pressure.</p><p>The term \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d refers to a broad category of agreements pursuant to which generic companies consent to delay or even abandon market entry in exchange for payment from the incumbent originator. 144  Such agreements tend to emerge shortly before successful proprietary medicines come off patent, as originators seek to extend de facto the duration of patent protection\u2014and attendant inflated profits. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lundbeck</emphasis>, decided in 2013, the Commission held for the first time that \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d agreements may violate Article 101. 145  The anticompetitive potential of such arrangements is relatively uncontroversial, 146  and, that same year, the U.S. Supreme Court similarly agreed that \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d may violate Sherman Act \u00a71, following a \u201crule of reason\u201d assessment. 147  What was more unusual about <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lundbeck</emphasis> was that the Commission had proceeded on the basis that relevant restraints comprised object restrictions under Article 101. Yet the \u201cby object\u201d category is, in principle, reserved for only the most obviously, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">inherently</emphasis> harmful forms of coordination. 148  Such a characterization is arguably less clear-cut in the context of \u201cpay-to-delay,\u201d where excluded rivals constitute merely <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">potential</emphasis> competitors at the time of the agreement, where successful entry even absent the arrangement is not a given, where there are (sometimes dubious) intellectual property rights at stake, and where condemnation of the agreement may conflict with the right to effective judicial protection.</p><p>Yet the approach in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lundbeck</emphasis> is easier to support to the extent that the relevant \u201clegal and economic context\u201d of the restraint is read broadly to encompass wider public interest dimensions. This certainly seems to have been the approach of the General Court in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lundbeck</emphasis> in upholding the object characterization, 149  in which it acknowledged and defended the role of generic entry in prompting often-dramatic regulated price cuts in the pharmaceutical sector. 150  It also expressed skepticism about the robustness of certain domestic patents, primly repeating that \u201cit is in the public interest to eliminate any obstacle to economic activity which may arise where a patent was granted in error.\u201d 151  Accordingly, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">contra</emphasis> the argument that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lundbeck</emphasis> is incompatible with the restrictive understanding of the object category endorsed in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cartes Bancaires</emphasis>, 152  the case can instead be seen as a nuanced exposition of the latter approach. Thus, even if, strictly speaking, Article 101 cannot police the protection of human health, the latter may shift our perception of the underlying legal context or render the anticipated economic harm more compelling. While <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lundbeck</emphasis> is on further appeal, 153  the object treatment of \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d has been confirmed by the General Court in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Servier</emphasis>, 154  in which the Commission notably hedged its bets by treating the relevant restraints as restrictions both by object <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and</emphasis> effect. 155 </p><p>The second area of legal innovation involves so-called regulatory gaming. This refers to the exploitation of pro-competitive or neutral governmental regulations, which are misused by private undertakings for exclusionary purposes. 156  The challenge from an antitrust perspective is that, frequently, the defendant\u2019s behavior complies with the letter of the underlying regime, though not its spirit. Thus, regulatory gaming raises questions of the extent to which competition law should second-guess the approach of other regulatory frameworks or attempt to correct putatively \u201cbroken\u201d regimes.</p><p>The most prominent example in EU law arose precisely in the pharmaceutical sector, where AstraZeneca was held to have violated Article 102 through conduct intended to prolong the duration of patent protection for its blockbuster ulcer medicine, Losec. 157  The abusive behavior comprised two prongs. First, the defendant made misrepresentations to national patent authorities, which enabled it to obtain \u201csupplementary protection certificates\u201d (SPCs) which extended patent life. Second, it strategically withdrew marketing authorization for Losec capsules, thus denying generic entrants a piggyback licensing procedure; and in tandem sought to migrate existing patient users to tablet form, which retained patent protection. The difficulty was that such behavior was either permitted by the underlying regulatory regime 158  or implicitly facilitated. 159  Thus, the putative <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">actus reus</emphasis> in each instance was conduct that represented \u201cnormal\u201d business behavior within the market concerned.</p><p>What is notable about <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AstraZeneca</emphasis>, therefore, and where the underlying public interest considerations came to the fore, is the extent to which the existence of the abuse hinged on the defendant\u2019s anticompetitive <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">intention</emphasis> (or \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mens rea</emphasis>\u201d). 160  As explained in Section III, in principle, the antitrust rules depend on an objective determination of the impact on competition, actual or anticipated, of the relevant conduct. Yet although <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AstraZeneca</emphasis> reaffirmed the orthodoxy that anticompetitive intent is not a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">necessary</emphasis> requirement under Article 102, here the defendant\u2019s perceived objectives proved determinative of its abusive behavior. So, for instance, the fact that AstraZeneca exercised its otherwise lawful right to withdraw its marketing authorizations <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">precisely</emphasis> to frustrate generic competition served to transform outwardly ordinary and permissible behavior into an antitrust violation. Yet every firm wishes ultimately to exclude competitors, in the sense of increasing its own market share, hence the limited utility of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mens rea-</emphasis>esque concepts in the antitrust sphere. What thus distinguished <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AstraZeneca</emphasis>, arguably, was the wider context and more profound ramifications of excluding generic competition: in particular, the harmful consequences for national health systems, a concern that was considered in detail in the Commission infringement decision. 161  Much as in the context of \u201cpay-for-delay,\u201d the underlying public interest considerations did not dispense with the need for antitrust assessment, but rather were brought to bear in shaping and justifying an ambitious application of the competition rules.</p><p>Yet the pharmaceutical sector also provides an important reminder of the continuing need to root even a purposive interpretation of the competition rules within the existing legal framework. This is seen in the fate of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Servier</emphasis>, the second decision in which the Commission condemned regulatory gaming. 162  While, as noted, the General Court confirmed the Article 101 aspects, the Article 102 claim fell at the first hurdle, as the Court was unpersuaded of the robustness of the Commission\u2019s market definition exercise. Absent dominance, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Servier</emphasis>\u2019s putatively anticompetitive unilateral behavior was immune from scrutiny, regardless of the public interests at stake. Thus, the soft influence of the public interest has unavoidable limits in the antitrust sphere.</p><h>C. Competition Law and the Digital Economy</h><p>The third and final example is a more recent focus on competition problems within the digital economy. The inescapable rise of Big Tech, coupled with the comparative absence of effective regulation within the digital sphere, has led to urgent calls (often from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">outside</emphasis> the antitrust community) for more aggressive enforcement against the digital giants. 163  In the EU, these challenges are inextricably tied up with the \u201cfairness mantra\u201d 164  associated with the tenure of Commissioner Vestager at DG Competition. In embracing the argument that competition law and policy are directed toward securing \u201ca Europe that gives everyone a fair chance,\u201d 165  Commissioner Vestager has not only aligned this area of EU law with wider policy concerns about the optimal future development of the social market economy. 166  Moreover, the sheer breadth of the fairness concept\u2014including, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">inter alia</emphasis>, the right of \u201call companies\u2014large and small\u2014[to] a fair, fighting chance to succeed on their merits,\u201d 167  \u201cfair pay\u201d 168  for workers, and a duty on undertakings to pay \u201ctheir fair share of tax\u201d 169 \u2014inevitably calls into question the Commission\u2019s commitment to a \u201cmore economic approach,\u201d with its ostensible single-minded focus on behavior that results in anticompetitive foreclosure. 170 </p><p>What is interesting about the themes highlighted by Commissioner Vestager is how these transcend even a \u201cbig is bad\u201d understanding of competition policy. Instead, she has drawn upon a broad range of public interest concerns associated with the emergence of hugely powerful, increasingly ubiquitous, and apparently unregulatable digital platforms. These include data privacy, 171  the increasing pervasiveness of algorithmic decision-making, 172  the problems of adequately taxing digital services, 173  the labor rights of vulnerable workers who provide services through digital platforms, 174  and, ultimately, the threats to the fabric of our democracy that may be posed by the shift from public to private control of large areas of the economy. 175  The fact that such themes plainly go beyond her remit as Competition Commissioner received tacit acknowledgment upon her re-nomination for a second term in September 2019, when Commissioner Vestager was given the additional mandate of securing \u201ca Europe fit for the digital age.\u201d 176  Yet the rhetoric of fairness, even at its most ambitious, is by no means decoupled from the bread and butter of her antitrust enforcer role. Commissioner Vestager has explained the logic as such: [I]f we value an open economy, and a liberal society, we have to show that those values benefit everyone, not just the select few[.] So if we want to show that our society treats everyone fairly, however big or small, we need to prove it in the market. 177  It is in recent enforcement efforts within the digital economy that, arguably, we see these ideas play out most clearly.</p><p>The Commission, of course, has a rich history of robust enforcement within the \u201cnew\u201d economy, including infringement decisions against <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Microsoft</emphasis> in 2004 178  and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Intel</emphasis> in 2009. 179  Both involved the application of well-established rules to more novel market situations\u2014tying and refusal to deal in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Microsoft</emphasis>, exclusive dealing in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Intel</emphasis>\u2014and both culminated in what were, at the time, record-breaking fines for violations of Article 102. These cases may thus be viewed as \u201csetting the scene\u201d for the trio of infringement decisions pursued against Google\u2014<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Shopping</emphasis>, 180  <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Android</emphasis>, 181  and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AdSense</emphasis> 182 \u2014since 2017. Yet these later cases mark a more muscular development of the antitrust rules in several ways, which, we suggest, is inspired in part by a perceived need to address broader public interest concerns.</p><p>First, the most immediately striking feature is the size of the fines imposed: more than \u20ac8 billion in total across the three <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Google</emphasis> decisions, including a record-breaking fine of \u20ac4.34 billion for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Android</emphasis> alone. 183  It is difficult to avoid the impression that these very high fines are a deliberate policy choice, set at such an elevated level precisely to demonstrate the willingness of the Commission to intervene against market actors perceived to pose a threat to the public interest. 184  Such high fines were, moreover, enabled by the policy choice to pursue the cases as Article 7 infringement decisions rather than Article 9 commitments. 185  This was despite overtures toward settlement in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Android</emphasis>, 186  and more remarkably, despite three rounds of ultimately unsuccessful market-testing of proposed commitments in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Shopping</emphasis> (which, however, preceded Commissioner Vestager\u2019s arrival at DG Competition). 187  A similar \u201cpublic interest\u201d dimension is discernible in the Commission\u2019s 2016 determination that Apple was required to repay \u20ac13 billion in uncollected taxes to Ireland for breach of the State aid rules, 188  a decision the Commissioner admitted was motivated by a perceived need to \u201cdo something\u201d within the limited powers available to the Commission to address public anger over tax injustice. 189  Even if the subject matter of these decisions is often far removed from the focus of public anxiety regarding the digital economy, such cases nonetheless perform an important demonstrative function, setting the EU up as \u201cthe determinator,\u201d 190  prepared to rein in Big Tech in the public interest.</p><p>The influence of the public interest is also evident in the emergence of self-preferencing as the most prominent theory of harm in the digital sphere. Self-preferencing refers to situations whereby a digital platform gives \u201cpreferential treatment to one\u2019s own products or services when they are in competition with products and services provided by other entities using the platform.\u201d 191  It was the crux of the prohibited behavior in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Shopping</emphasis>, can arguably be seen as the underlying concern in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Android</emphasis>, 192  and is the subject of on-going investigations involving <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Amazon Marketplace</emphasis> 193  and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Apple iTunes</emphasis>. 194  While in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Shopping</emphasis>, the Commission disclaimed any novelty for self-preferencing as a theory of harm, 195  the case law cited to support its established status fell considerably short. 196  A cynic might also observe that novelty would have been an inconvenient obstacle insofar as the Commission was determined to impose a (then) record-breaking fine. 197  In their report on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Competition Policy for the Digital Era</emphasis>, the Commission\u2019s expert panel on digital markets went even further, arguing for a reverse burden of proof in certain instances whereby the platform would \u201cbear the burden of proving that self-preferencing has no long-run exclusionary effects on product markets.\u201d 198 </p><p>Yet self-preferencing is of interest beyond the mere fact that its novelty demonstrates legal innovation in response to broader public concerns about the digital economy. The theory has a distinct regulatory quality, which chimes with calls for the aggressive application of competition law to provide an ad hoc tool for regulating the digital economy. The Commission\u2019s expert panel thus identified a category of platforms that perform \u201ca rule-setting function,\u201d whereby platforms \u201cact as regulators, setting up the rules and institutions through which their users interact.\u201d 199  In such circumstances, the authors proposed an overarching duty on dominant platforms to ensure that \u201ccompetition on their platforms is fair, unbiased, and pro-users,\u201d 200  a specific application of which is the reverse burden of proof for self-preferencing set out above. 201  The notion that dominant platforms have a positive duty to ensure \u201cfair\u201d outcomes for rivals, through for instance modifying the manner in which they display competing services, has inescapable parallels to more traditional forms of utilities regulation. Yet whereas the latter has typically been contingent upon the existence of bottleneck monopolies that render effective competition otherwise impossible, both the Commission and its expert panel expressly disclaimed any necessary connection between the theory of self-preferencing and the case law on refusal to supply. 202  The focus instead on \u201cstrategic market status\u201d 203  thus aligns with broader academic concerns about the role that digital platforms play as gatekeepers within contemporary markets, and indeed contemporary society more broadly. 204  Similarly, the suggestion to relax the conventional antitrust concern with error cost by erring on the side of prohibiting potentially anticompetitive conduct in concentrated digital markets, 205  is consistent with broader public skepticism about digital market power.</p><p>Accordingly, what we see in the digital economy is how broader public interest concerns feed into discussion of the optimal approach to competition policy, with, moreover, some evidence from recent enforcement practice of the redirection of the latter to provide a more muscular tool to regulate digital dominance. There are, once again, inherent limits to such an approach, typified by the \u201cserious doubts\u201d expressed by the Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court 206  when considering the Bundeskartellamt\u2019s much-debated decision to sanction alleged data protection breaches by Facebook as a violation of the German rules on abuse of market conduct. 207  That is, competition law remains competition law, and thus provides an inapt tool to regulate, for instance, fake news or discriminatory algorithmic decision-making, not merely from a legitimacy but also an effectiveness perspective. But it is indisputable that the arguments being raised transcend purely technical questions of antitrust policy\u2014and it is increasingly difficult to maintain that such concerns are not reflected in at least the tenor of policy debate with respect to the digital economy, if not also the application of the antitrust rules in practice.</p><h>V. Conclusions</h><p>Debates regarding the treatment of public interest under the EU competition rules are caught between several contrasting impetuses. Competition law is focused on ensuring effective market competition, and in the EU, protecting \u201ccompetition as such.\u201d Yet most people would accept that, in the final analysis, markets should serve the wider public interest and not vice versa. It is, accordingly, difficult to maintain that competition law should be applied and developed with its eyes closed to noneconomic public interest concerns. Yet there is often an acute difficulty, at least in the EU, in identifying a single set of legitimate or approved public interests that merit accommodation within the competition framework. Moreover, while this article has focused primarily on the \u201ccentralized\u201d application of the competition rules by the Commission, within an increasingly <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">de</emphasis>centralized enforcement landscape, such public interest claims may not only take on greater urgency but also have greater disruptive or distortive potential.</p><p>This article has argued that it may be inferred from recent enforcement in three distinct segments that the considerations at issue transcended an inflexible concern with \u201ccompetition as such.\u201d The examples surveyed, however, do not tell a clear and consistent story about when and how public interest concerns can and should be accommodated. In the context of the network industries, for example, the Commission has used antitrust enforcement to pursue a rather singular vision of how such markets should be structured and ought to operate. Yet the available empirical evidence suggests that not all consumers are likely to benefit 208  and that the advisability of unbundling policies may vary significantly between different national markets. 209  In the pharmaceutical sector, it is difficult to avoid the suspicion that the root cause of the competition problems discussed above is, in many instances, the poor practices of national patent offices and other domestic regulatory agencies. Thus, competition enforcement, instead, became a kind of \u201cproxy war\u201d in such cases, fought to tackle market problems outside the purview of the Commission\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction. An inescapable paradox of calls for greater intervention in the digital economy, moreover, is the underlying assumption that the public has a set of concerns about firm size which are not expressed in its market behavior: 210  that is, if we the public are so concerned about the omnipresence of the tech giants, then why do we keep <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">using</emphasis> these services when other options are available?</p><p>At its core, EU competition law reflects a persistent, though by no means uncontentious, belief that open and competitive markets, integrated across the Member States, are the best means to further public interest objectives more broadly. But that does not mean, however, that EU competition law is immune to wider public interest concerns. Noncompetition considerations can affect our understanding of how markets work or shape our approach to the derogations that exist within the competition system. Moreover, and perhaps most importantly in practice, the fact that compelling parallel public interests may be at stake can influence the underlying calculus of whether antitrust intervention is merited in a particular instance and how vigorously it should be pursued.</p><p>Yet competition law is not a particularly nimble tool by which to pursue such interests more directly as a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">standalone</emphasis> concern. Competition law can break up cartels that seek to delay green innovation, for instance, or punish dominant drug makers that block access to cheap generic versions of blockbuster medicines. But, conversely, it is an inapt mechanism by which to require firms to invest in sustainability, and there are cogent policy reasons why antitrust is generally reluctant to force generic-level pricing on originator pharma companies during the period of patent protection. Thus, competition law can and should be used to further the public interest, broadly construed, where the latter coincides with its overarching task of promoting beneficial social outcomes through the use of open and effective competition to control private power. But it is not a panacea for all contemporary ills, nor a lazy fallback that can be assumed to absolve other legal disciplines of the need to figure out how best to regulate problems that fall more squarely within their jurisdiction.</p><p>Competition law and the public interest go hand in hand, as the quote that opened this article recognizes. But competition law alone cannot be enough to protect the range of interests that have been invoked in this context. There are, famously, \u201climits of antitrust,\u201d and the extent to which these rules can be deployed in furtherance of noncompetition-oriented yet socially valuable objectives is undoubtedly one such limit. Claims to the public interest are clearly cognizable within the EU competition framework, albeit typically through an approach of carving <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">out</emphasis> such concerns from the application of the rules rather than accounting for noncompetition interests within the substance of the antitrust provisions. Whether the latter would be a good idea, or rather a slippery slope, is a provocative question largely beyond the scope of this article.

Introduction</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Competition law has long been understood as a variety of public interest law, broadly construed. 2  Whether stemming from its capacity to increase the size of the pie available to all, or specifically to increase access to necessities for the most vulnerable, the task of taming private market power almost inevitably relies upon justifications related to the broader public interest. 3  Yet in a contemporary landscape where even mainstream scholars are calling for an end to capitalism or at least its progressive rethinking, 4  the simple pursuit of an economically oriented understanding of consumer welfare has faced criticism as being both ill-conceived and inadequate. 5  This contribution explores the capacity of EU competition law, in particular, to pursue more specific public interest objectives over and above its established task of \u201cmaking markets work better.\u201d 6 </p><p>The term \u201cpublic interest\u201d is inevitably somewhat nebulous and imprecise. Within the EU, the newly revived debate has been prompted by the prohibition of the proposed <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alstom</emphasis>/<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Siemens</emphasis> merger, 7  a decision heavily criticized by the certain Member States on the basis that it fails to take due account of wider industrial policy considerations. 8  Environmental protection and the desirability of ensuring sustainability in modes of production is another area of focus, 9  chiming with policy debates regarding the necessity to tackle the incipient climate crisis. Similarly, concerns about societal inequality, 10  unfair labor practices, 11  and a host of problems associated with the increasingly pervasive digital economy 12 \u2014from violations of data privacy to the spread of fake news\u2014have made their mark in discussions regarding the optional scope and goals of contemporary competition law. This article adopts an equally expansive definition of public interest, to encompass any application of the competition rules which embraces values that extend beyond the conventional (if disputed) wisdom that \u201cgiven its economic character, competition law aims, in the final analysis, to enhance efficiency.\u201d 13 </p><p>This article focuses on the EU antitrust rules, namely Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Public interest concerns may feed into the enforcement of these rules in multiple ways. Rival economic actors may enter into outwardly restrictive agreements in furtherance of noneconomic public policy objectives, such as the promotion of animal welfare 14  or access to justice. 15  To what extent can these latter goals be taken into account when considering the compatibility of the underlying coordination with Article 101? A dominant undertaking may impose a pricing policy which has the effect of both foreclosing rivals but also of enhancing social inclusion, 16  or conversely one which reflects an economically defensible monopoly profit for successful innovation but nonetheless prevents access for the most socially precarious. 17  The question, again, is whether these wider public interest considerations can feed into the otherwise narrowly tailored assessment of whether the relevant conduct should be classified as abusive under Article 102. Moreover, where other fields of law exist precisely to protect the claimed public interest concerns, such as data protection or consumer protection rules, when might (non)compliance with parallel regulatory requirements be a pertinent antitrust consideration?</p><p>The conventional wisdom is that Articles 101 and 102 focus on the protection of \u201ccompetition as such.\u201d This comparatively expansive concept links to the role played by the competition rules in developing and reinforcing the single market structure but, conversely, does not extend to noneconomic public interest justifications. Yet EU competition law cannot avoid the inconvenient reality that antitrust, if interpreted broadly and without reference to the underlying context, might serve to inhibit or even prohibit large swathes of activity that the average European would consider to be very worthwhile indeed. This article explores this tension, considering both the orthodoxy, but also going beyond it to suggest a variety of ways in which broader public interest concerns may feed in, more obliquely and typically without explicit acknowledgment, to the Commission\u2019s enforcement practice. The resulting legal position is quite distinct from the assumption that public interest concerns are accommodated within the competition rules primarily through an approach of derogating from the application of the latter. Yet, the examples considered are both context-specific and less than all-encompassing in scope, thus demonstrating the continuing difficulty of squaring this ostensibly technocratic, keenly focused field of law with more amorphous and disputed public interest concerns.</p><p>The purpose here is not to argue for or against greater incorporation of public interest considerations within the substantive antitrust analysis, although there is plenty of literature that does precisely this. 18  Rather, the emphasis is on the extent to which such concerns can and have been incorporated within the current EU legal framework, in particular in light of the nominal movement toward a \u201cmore economic approach.\u201d The article is structured as follows. Section II sets out the wider background to the consideration of public interest within EU competition law. Section III outlines the established approach to accommodating such concerns within this context, including recognized derogations to the concept of economic activity, the extent to which public interest can be accounted for in substantive antitrust analysis or included within the exception rules available under Articles 101 and 102, and the possibility of justifying such conduct by reference to the State action defense. Section IV takes a different tack, departing from this conventional narrative to suggest the de facto recognition of public interest concerns in the Commission\u2019s enforcement practice in three areas: public utilities sectors, pharmaceutical markets, and the digital economy. Both the achievements and the limitations of using antitrust law to pursue wider public interest values in these contexts are considered. Section V concludes briefly.</p><h>II. The Broader Context of Public Interest in EU Competition Law</h><p>EU competition law is a complex beast. The same rules apply across what has for most of the EU\u2019s history been an ever-expanding range of national jurisdictions and disparate market circumstances. Additionally, the Court of Justice approved a plurality of goals from the outset, including the development of the internal market 19  and preservation of structural competition in a manner generally considered to reflect Ordoliberal influences. 20  The question of the extent to which EU competition law can and does pursue a wider spectrum of public interest objectives is thus complicated by the complexity of the law itself. This section considers three overarching factors of relevance to the discussion to follow.</p><p>First, EU competition law has, for some time, been undergoing a process of modernization and readjustment. 21  The system long faced criticism that undue emphasis was placed on the protection of competitors at the expense of the wider competition process. Largely in response, the past decade or so witnessed a more fulsome embracing of the so-called more economic approach to antitrust enforcement. 22  The cornerstone of this development has been the Commission\u2019s adoption of an \u201canticompetitive foreclosure\u201d standard as the basis for intervention. 23  While the Court has not (yet) endorsed unequivocally the more economic approach, much of its recent jurisprudence reflects a more nuanced understanding both of the operation of markets and the optimal role for competition law. In particular, the Court has focused its attention principally on behavior that harms competition. 24  In bringing EU law more directly in line with the consumer welfare paradigm, however, the Commission has essentially disclaimed any role for broader public interest considerations. 25 </p><p>On the other hand, this question is being asked in the wider context of a rapidly shifting landscape for EU competition law more generally. Relevant reforms include greater \u201cdecentralization\u201d of enforcement to national competition authorities 26  alongside parallel efforts to encourage a culture of private enforcement; 27  a widespread populist backlash against \u201cneoliberal\u201d Europe generally, with searching questions about \u201cthe future of Europe\u201d 28  as a result; and the increasing rhetorical prominence of the notion that competition law should pursue \u201cfair\u201d market outcomes, without much indication as to how this slogan fits with established and evolving antitrust practice. 29  Each of these developments poses challenges to the more economic approach, and all have a potential role to play in determining the receptiveness of EU competition law to public interest concerns.</p><p>Second, the EU antitrust rules do not exist within a regulatory vacuum, and public interest considerations find purchase to a greater or lesser extent within the broader legal framework that underpins the single market. There is, first, the wider competition landscape, including the State aid rules which constrain the ability of Member States to intervene in domestic economies, albeit with limited derogations for public interest type interventions. 30  The internal market rules, similarly, aim to ensure a level playing field for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and workers, with a default presumption that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">State</emphasis>-imposed barriers to \u201cmarket access\u201d contravene EU law. 31  The fundamental freedoms nonetheless admit of the possibility of departing from this approach to further public interest objectives, 32  an amazingly broad range of which have been recognized 33 \u2014provided, however, that the restriction of competition entailed is proportionate to the legitimate objective pursued. 34 </p><p>What is notable is the consistent manner in which public interest concerns are approached within this regulatory framework. Whether under the State aid rules or the fundamental freedoms, the underlying assumption is that the public interest, broadly construed, is best served through open and undistorted competition. To the extent that particular public interests may conflict with this free-marketeering vision, the latter may yield in defined circumstances. Yet, although EU law is not insensible to public interest considerations, the implication is that such concerns are extraordinary phenomena, a derogation from the norm of the open and competitive internal market. Accordingly, EU law typically responds to the challenge of countervailing public interest concerns, not by accommodating them <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">within</emphasis> its regulatory framework, but by carving out space <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">outside</emphasis> the rules, and imposing more or less demanding requirements on those which seek to rely upon such derogations. 35 </p><p>Finally, there is the difficulty of identifying any precise pan-EU \u201cpublic\u201d interest. Indeed, much of the historic rationale for approaching public interest considerations as derogations stemmed from the fact that, although EU law mandates the universal acceptance of unencumbered competition, there is incomplete harmonization of other regulatory rules. 36  Member States thus continue to pursue a wide spectrum of differing values. Most basically, despite the rhetoric of \u201cever closer union,\u201d in reality there is no single European \u201cdemos.\u201d Instead, as the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">demoicracy</emphasis> concept reflects, EU law is essentially premised on the mutual recognition of discrete identities and not their merger. 37  Yet EU competition law comprises a single set of rules which must be applied, equally and uniformly, across the Member States. To the extent that public interest considerations are allowed a role here, there accordingly may be considerable difficulty in isolating a single consistent understanding of what exactly <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is</emphasis> in the putative public\u2019s interest, with significant scope for competing and conflicting visions. 38  Moreover, and more skeptically, there is often a substantial gulf between what the European public, such as it exists, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">thinks</emphasis> that it wants, and what the Commission thinks that public <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">should</emphasis> want.</p><h>III. The Orthodox Treatment of Public Interest in EU Competition Law</h><p>It is in the context of this multifaceted and somewhat fluid legal framework that our exploration of the orthodox approach to claimed public interest considerations begins. Although assessment under the EU antitrust rules is attuned to the particular \u201clegal and economic context\u201d of a restraint, 39  the existing jurisprudence does not provide any direct avenue by which these rules may, in themselves, be deployed to pursue discrete public interest objectives. As this section explains, to the extent that the latter is pursued by economic operators in a manner that triggers antitrust scrutiny, it is therefore necessary to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">derogate</emphasis> from application of Articles 101 or 102, whether by classifying the conduct as falling outside the scope of \u201ceconomic activity,\u201d by reference to the specific exceptions provided by Article 101(3) or the objective justification concept under Article 102, or by overreaching the competition rules through the exercise of State action.</p><h>A. The Concept of an \u201cUndertaking\u201d</h><p>Articles 101 and 102 apply only to restrictive behavior by \u201cundertakings.\u201d Although the concept was left undefined in the TFEU, the ensuing case law adopted a so-called functional approach, 40  which hinges on the identification of an economic activity carried on by the defendant, 41  namely the provision of goods or services on a relevant market. 42  Conversely, conduct that escapes the definition of economic activity also escapes scrutiny under the antitrust rules. The parameters of the concept of an undertaking thus provide the first potential reprieve for public interest-oriented market behavior.</p><p>At first glance, however, the definition of economic activity is remarkably broad, meaning that only a limited subset of conduct can potentially be exempted on this basis. Both the legal status of the entity and the way in which it is financed are, nominally, irrelevant to its classification as an undertaking. 43  Although the crux of economic activity is the provision of goods or services, it is unnecessary for the defendant to be doing so on a for-profit basis: instead, \u201c[t]he basic test is\u2026whether the entity in question is engaged in an activity which could, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">at least in principle</emphasis>, be carried on by a private undertaking in order to make profits.\u201d 44  The upshot is that, in theory, a wide range of market actors may constitute undertakings and come within the purview of the competition rules, including nonprofit entities, 45  entities created and governed by public law, 46  state companies, 47  and those encumbered with public service obligations that make their operations less competitive than comparable private operators. 48 </p><p>The case law, however, recognizes several broad exceptions to this otherwise all-encompassing definition. The first is where the underlying impetus for the activity is the pursuit of social solidarity, defined as \u201cthe inherently <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">uncommercial</emphasis> act of involuntary subsidization of one social group by another.\u201d 49  Activities benefiting from this exception involve a degree of redistribution 50  and typically relate to social welfare provision administered through quasi-private mechanisms. 51  The second exception arises where, although the activity nominally consists in the provision of (usually) a service, in substance it reflects \u201cthe exercise of official authority,\u201d 52  and so is more properly understood as an application of public power. Activities potentially benefiting from this exception range from air-traffic control services 53  to environmental monitoring checks 54  to the regulation of certain sports. 55  A third exception relates to the so-called false self-employed. 56  Generally, independent contractors constitute undertakings in their own right under EU competition law. 57  Where, however, those individuals are in positions of particular vulnerability and dependence in relation to the purchaser of their services, they may fall outside the definition of an undertaking so as to facilitate, for instance, collective bargaining in pursuit of better working conditions. 58 </p><p>Each of these exceptions evinces a distinct public interest character, whether it is to advance social solidarity, to further nonmarket goals such as public safety or environmental protection, or to safeguard vulnerable workers. In each instance, moreover, successful invocation of the relevant ground for exemption enables the public interest concern to prevail in the event of conflict with the competition rules. Yet in line with the discussion above, the preferred approach is not to seek to embed such considerations within the substantive antitrust analysis, but rather straightforwardly to exclude the latter if necessary, in order to further other, putatively incompatible public interests. In this manner, the competition rules recognize the importance of nonmarket concerns, but seek to protect these primarily through an approach of exclusion rather than accommodation.</p><h>B. Accommodating the Public Interest Within Substantive Antitrust Analysis</h><p>Within the realm of economic activity, the competition rules apply with full force. Under Articles 101 and 102, suspect conduct is subject to an objective assessment of its impact, likely or actual, upon the functioning of effective competition. Article 101 thus requires the identification either of instances of collusion that can be deemed, \u201cby their very nature, harmful to the proper functioning of normal competition,\u201d 59  or of evidence that \u201ccompetition has in fact been prevented, restricted or distorted to an appreciable extent\u201d as a result. 60  The concept of abuse under Article 102 hinges upon the ill-defined notion of \u201crecourse to methods different from those which condition normal competition,\u201d 61  but is similarly aimed, ultimately, at dominant firm behavior which may \u201cimpair genuine, undistorted competition.\u201d 62 </p><p>Substantive antitrust assessment, accordingly, focuses squarely on competition problems that arise from firm behavior. Although recent case law emphasizes the nuanced, context-dependent nature of this exercise, it does not recognize the possibility of excusing restrictive practices on the basis that they nonetheless further other socially valuable goals 63 \u2014or, conversely, of condemning competitive behavior that nonetheless conflicts with such values. Even leaving aside the question of public interest considerations, the Court has been criticized for an almost pathological focus on \u201ccompetition as such,\u201d to the point where overall consumer welfare-enhancing behavior may nonetheless fall foul of the antitrust rules. 64  Against such a background, the challenge of accommodating what are essentially nonmarket public values directly within the assessment framework is clear.</p><p>Under Articles 101 and 102, the subjective intention of defendants is not determinative of the objective characterization of their behavior. In particular, any argument that a defendant may be motivated by \u201cgood\u201d intentions\u2014in the sense that its conduct pursues an outcome directly aligned to broader public interest considerations\u2014is not a factor of relevance when assessing likely or actual impact from a competition perspective. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">BIDS</emphasis>, 65  for instance, the fact that an industry-wide collective reduction in capacity was designed to further industrial policy objectives regarding the development of the Irish agricultural sector was immaterial to its characterization as a restriction of competition by object. 66  The Court in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Slovakian Banks</emphasis> similarly gave short shrift to claims that the impugned collusion was prompted by the necessity to frustrate an unlicensed (and thus presumably unscrupulous) competitor, insofar as this did not negate the arrangement\u2019s inherently anticompetitive nature. 67  In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Deutsche Telekom</emphasis>, which concerned a margin squeeze in the telecommunications sector, the defendant made a loss on providing residential fixed-line access which it cross-subsidized through higher call costs. But so too did its competitors, a pricing structure that was directly attributable to governmental policy to promote cheap line access on social inclusion grounds. Yet, once again, the wider background was deemed irrelevant, so that the defendant was held to breach Article 102 by maintaining an \u201cunfair spread\u201d between wholesale and retail prices in the fixed-line market alone. 68 </p><p>The extent to which a parallel \u201cbad\u201d intention might equate to an anticompetitive one is more complicated. In certain circumstances, the concept of the \u201clegal and economic context\u201d of putatively restrictive behavior may be read sufficiently broadly to take account of breach of other social or legal norms. As cases like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Telekomunikacja Polska</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AstraZeneca</emphasis> demonstrate, 69  the fact that a defendant has violated or acted contrary to the spirit of other regulatory obligations may be considered significant in determining whether the same behavior constitutes an antitrust violation. The ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between carmakers accused of restricting competition in the development of emission cleaning technology similarly suggests that congruent public interest concerns (here, environmental protection) can feed into the determination of whether more novel forms of potentially anticompetitive behavior deserve condemnation as \u201chard-core\u201d restraints. 70 </p><p>Yet the competition jurisprudence suggests a skeptical view of parallel public interests which involve objectives that are clearly distinct from those of open and undistorted competition. Thus, in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Asnef-Equifax</emphasis>, the Court held, uncompromisingly, that a claimed breach of the data protection rules\u2014treated as a fundamental rights issue within EU law 71 \u2014was irrelevant when assessing whether collusion contrary to Article 101 had occurred. 72  In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Siemens/Areva</emphasis>, concerning a noncompete agreement in the nuclear technology sector, the Commission made zero reference to the much-disputed nature of the underlying activity, in a commitment decision that focused solely on ensuring the competitive health of the sector. 73  And remarkably, across the various competition cases involving products that pose a threat to public health, such as alcohol 74  or tobacco, 75  there is little discussion of the fact that the most immediate benefit of greater competition\u2014lower prices\u2014is of dubious value insofar as it facilitates greater consumption. 76  Conversely, this theme has been explored in detail in the free movement case law, most recently in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Scotch Whisky</emphasis>. 77  The latter provides an interesting comparator for the antitrust context, insofar as the State-imposed public health restriction at issue comprised minimum pricing rules for alcohol which, unlike an increase in excise duty, steers any inflated revenues to sellers rather than the exchequer.</p><p>Moreover, even if parallel wrongfulness may augment or confirm the anticompetitive nature of less clear-cut categories of restrictions, it cannot provide a substitute for anticompetitive behavior as such. This is exemplified by the limitations of Article 102. Although undertakings holding significant market power have a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to protect \u201cgenuine undistorted competition,\u201d 78  this notional duty cannot function to compel dominant undertakings to, for instance, switch to more efficient fuel sources, or promote diversity within their workforce. 79  Indeed, it cannot even, in principle, attack \u201cbigness as such,\u201d a revitalized contemporary concern of so-called hipster antitrust. 80  We see further examples of this crucial limitation\u2014that is, the need to anchor competition enforcement within the established framework of the antitrust rules\u2014in relation to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Servier</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook</emphasis> cases, discussed in Section IV.</p><p>Finally, it is important to clarify that even when assessment under the antitrust rules depends on a demonstration of anticompetitive impact, this is an ineffective conduit by which to introduce public interest considerations. In line with the movement toward a more economic approach, there has been a turn away from form-based prohibitions under Articles 101 and 102, with greater emphasis being placed on what the circumstances of a restraint may indicate about its likely or foreseeable effects. The crux of this development, however, is the extent to which detrimental market outcomes can be successfully inferred (or otherwise) merely from the form that allegedly anticompetitive behavior takes, or whether a more involved consideration of the legal and economic context is required. This is distinct from the question of whether (actual or presumed) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">non</emphasis>market effects can be brought to bear in assessing the notional competitive impact of market behavior, which, as discussed above, is in principle impossible within the current framework.</p><h>C. Justifying Anticompetitive Behavior on a Public Interest Basis</h><p>Under Articles 101 and 102, identifying <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">prima facie</emphasis> anticompetitive conduct is merely a first stage in the assessment of legality. Both prohibitions incorporate exception rules which enable defendants to justify their behavior in certain circumstances, and here too questions of broader public interest may be relevant. Article 101 expressly provides for this possibility in its third paragraph, which sets out a fourfold cumulative list of requirements to be satisfied in order for the first paragraph prohibition rule to be declared inapplicable. Although Article 102 provides no such textual basis, the prohibition on abuse of dominance has been interpreted to incorporate the possibility of \u201cobjective justification,\u201d which requires either a demonstration of countervailing efficiencies stemming from the alleged restraint or its objective necessity. 81  Under both provisions, the burden of proof lies with the defendant. The key question is the extent to which these exception rules might be relied upon to exempt anticompetitive behavior on noncompetition-oriented grounds.</p><p>Starting with Article 101(3), the threshold requirement is that the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">prima facie</emphasis> restrictive coordination nonetheless \u201ccontributes to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress.\u201d Earlier case law read this criterion expansively, with the Court accepting that any \u201cconsiderations connected with the pursuit of the public interest\u201d were potentially applicable. 82  A myriad of noncompetition public interests are discernible in older Commission practice, including protection of employment 83  and the environment, 84  and furthering industrial policy 85  and regional development. 86  Yet in tandem with the decentralization of the Article 101(3) exception under Regulation 1/2003, the Commission in its accompanying Guidelines asserted that the first prong of that rule refers only to \u201cobjective economic benefits,\u201d that is to say, \u201cefficiency gains.\u201d 87  While both cost savings and qualitative efficiencies were deemed acceptable, 88  this narrower reading appears to foreclose the possibility of relying upon Article 101(3) to pursue noneconomic public interests. Of course, the Commission does not \u201cmake\u201d EU competition law as such, as the Court has pointed out often quite forcefully. 89  Yet a comparative absence of case law from the Court on the application of the exception rule since the publication of the 2004 Guidelines 90  means that the Commission\u2019s somewhat leftfield approach has remained unchallenged and thus unconfirmed\u2014<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">or</emphasis> refuted. A recent survey of enforcement practice at national level revealed a rather mixed bag, whereby domestic competition authorities have adopted differing views on the extent to which they must and shall follow the Commission\u2019s interpretation. 91  This correlates, arguably, with the dilemma highlighted in Section II regarding the practical impossibility of identifying a single European \u201cpublic\u201d interest here.</p><p>In any event, even if Article 101(3) continues to encompass noneconomic public interests in the more economic era, it requires more than merely identifying such a countervailing concern. Additionally, any consumers \u201cdirectly or likely affected\u201d 92  must receive a \u201cfair share of the resulting benefit.\u201d This criterion may be difficult to satisfy, in particular where certain consumers suffer the immediate detriment (through, for example, higher prices), but society as a whole sees the benefit (through, for example, a cleaner environment). The restraints must also be indispensable\u2014meaning \u201creasonably necessary\u201d 93 \u2014to the underlying legitimate objective and must not entail the risk of long-term harm to the overall competitive process. Again, the difficulty of applying these criteria in the context of noneconomic public interest is that it may require the balancing of \u201cessentially incomparable\u201d 94  phenomena. Whereas one can, fairly readily, assess the overall impact on consumer welfare of behavior that both harms one dimension of efficiency and enhances another, it is more difficult to determine what degree of enhanced private market power is proportionate to secure cleaner air, for instance, or more humane farming practices.</p><p>Although the Court has repeatedly recognized the possibility of invoking objective justification under Article 102, the parameters of this exception are less well defined. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that a claim of objective necessity might be successfully invoked on a public interest basis: for instance, to justify a refusal to continue to supply access to an indispensable but highly polluting input controlled by a dominant firm. 95  Such a scenario is perhaps farfetched, however, and the Commission\u2019s guidance on Article 102 cautions that, normally, it is the task of public authorities to make public interest-oriented determinations of this sort. 96  The second avenue by which a firm may potentially seek to objectively justify its behavior is by demonstrating that any anticompetitive effects \u201cmay be counterbalanced, or outweighed, by advantages in terms of efficiency which also benefit the consumer,\u201d 97  an approach that would appear to exclude noneconomic public interest concerns. 98  A possible explanation for this limitation is that firms acting unilaterally are likely to have less need, or at least less plausible motivation, to depart from normal methods of competition to further nonprofit-oriented public interest objectives. As discussed in Section IV, however, the opposite is not the case, and it will be suggested below that public interest concerns may conversely function to flesh out the amorphous \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d of dominant firms in certain instances.</p><h>D. Overreaching Antitrust in the Public Interest: State Action and Beyond</h><p>Finally, even if behavior is classified as economic activity, is held to be restrictive of competition, and cannot be justified by the defendant(s), a further option is available by which, potentially, to reflect public interest concerns. It was noted in the preceding paragraph that the Commission is generally wary of claims that private undertakings can accurately isolate and enforce the notional \u201cpublic\u201d interest. 99  Conversely, where ostensible private economic activity is in fact required by State regulation, then EU competition law recognizes a defense from liability for the undertakings concerned. 100  Such an exception similarly arises where the extent of existing public regulation within the notional market renders independent competitive conduct impossible, thus similarly precluding <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">anti</emphasis>competitive activity from arising. 101  The \u201cState action\u201d defense thus provides potential cover for economic activity that restricts competition in furtherance of public interest objectives\u2014but only where, crucially, the requisite degree of State involvement is demonstrated.</p><p>The difficulty of relying upon this exception in practice\u2014again, notably, a derogation from the ordinary competition rules\u2014is that the existing jurisprudence interprets the application of the State action defense in an incredibly narrow manner. In short, it is only if the existing regulatory framework removes <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis> scope for freedom of market action from the defendant that the application of the competition rules is excluded. Thus, in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">BIDS</emphasis>, the fact that the collective scheme had been developed and implemented with the express support of the ministry for agriculture was irrelevant to its treatment under Article 101 since the undertakings had entered into it voluntarily. 102  More radically, in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Deutsche Telekom</emphasis>, the wholesale and retail price levels that comprised the margin squeeze were both approved by the sector regulator. Yet the Court refused the application of the State action defense because the defendant nonetheless retained scope to lobby the regulator and seek a variation of the pricing spread. 103  Thus, the fact that the public interest objectives pursued by private parties coincide with public interests recognized by the State, or even that the State approves of and encourages the pursuit of such objectives through private means, cannot in itself serve to immunize private conduct from antitrust scrutiny. There are good reasons for a rigid approach to the State action defense, including the need to avoid its strategic <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mis</emphasis>use. But the upshot is that it is difficult not only to carve space within the EU competition framework for public interest-oriented behavior of a wholly private nature but also for behavior that has a more plausibly public character.</p><p>A further derogation is found in Article 106(2) TFEU, which exempts from application of, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">inter alia</emphasis>, the competition rules the provision by undertakings of \u201cservices of general economic interest\u201d (SGEIs) in certain circumstances. The SGEI concept corresponds broadly to most domestic notions of \u201cpublic service,\u201d 104  and Article 106(2) exception enables Member States to opt-out of elements of the \u201copen and competitive\u201d internal market to achieve defined public interest goals at the national level. 105  What is notable, for our purpose, is that as a derogation from the general application of EU law, Article 106(2) exception should in principle be strictly interpreted. Yet Member States have been given a fairly free hand in determining the categories of service that fall within the SGEI concept in their jurisdiction and are thus immunized from the application of the competition rules. 106  This, arguably, reflects a rather pragmatic choice to accommodate domestic welfare provision with the strictures imposed by EU law, in order to avoid potentially destabilizing conflicts with national governments on this point. 107 </p><h>IV. The Public Interest in Practice in EU Competition Law</h><p>The preceding section described an apparent dichotomy in terms of the treatment of public interest considerations within EU competition law. The substantive rules are largely indifferent to such concerns, beyond the trite assumption that enhancing consumer welfare is in the public interest. Yet if interpreted broadly and without reference to the underlying context, competition law might obstruct large swathes of activity that the average European would consider to be entirely worthwhile. The competition framework deals with this dilemma, largely, by carving out such conduct from the substantive scope of the rules: whether <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ex ante</emphasis> by removing it entirely from the concept of economic activity or through the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ex post</emphasis> deployment of an exception rule or the State action defense. The coverage of these derogations is less than complete, however, meaning that the competition rules still occasionally come into conflict with noneconomic public interest concerns: a position that contributes to the rather unfair characterization of the EU as a \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">liberalisation machine</emphasis>.\u201d 108  Yet, this article\u2019s account has been straightforward: tightly focused competition concerns on the one side and public interest-oriented derogations on the other.</p><p>As this penultimate section demonstrates, however, the reality is more complex. Despite a veneer of technocracy that envelopes contemporary enforcement, antitrust remains a highly political field of law, 109  and the Commission, moreover, an inescapably political entity. 110  Accordingly, even if EU competition law actively disclaims any direct role for public interest considerations within its substantive core, the competition rules can be\u2014and not infrequently <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">are</emphasis>\u2014deployed in a manner that reflects a distinct understanding of how best to advance the public interest, broadly understood. Competition law has two main advantages within the wider framework of EU law in this regard. First, it can be enforced by the Commission acting alone, without positive approval from the Parliament and Council. It thus provides a more effective tool by which to address contentious issues that may struggle to reach the level of consensus required for direct legislative intervention. 111  Second, the competition rules themselves are comparatively wide-ranging and amorphous; if not exactly a \u201cblank cheque\u201d 112  for enforcers, then certainly amenable to progressive development and reinterpretation in light of changing market circumstances. Accordingly, even if it remains necessary, when applying competition law in furtherance of public interest objectives, to make a connection to the functioning of market competition, there is scope to bring the wider context to bear in doing so: what Ezrachi describes as antitrust\u2019s \u201csponge-like\u201d qualities. 113 </p><p>There are two main ways in which broader public interest concerns are manifested in EU-level enforcement. First, there is the mere fact of concentrating recurrent activity in a particular area or in pursuit of particular objectives, which suggests the existence of a distinct \u201cUnion interest.\u201d 114  Three areas of recent focus by the Commission are considered below: liberalizing utilities markets, pharmaceutical markets, and the digital economy. In addition, and more contestably, the theories of harm that have been developed in such cases often demonstrate a progressive, occasionally contentious, approach to the competition rules. As will be explored below, where obvious issues of public interest are at stake, this may provide an impetus toward expansion or innovation in the antitrust context. Thus, although EU competition law is not a vehicle by which the public interest can be pursued directly, public interest concerns may feed into the Commission\u2019s approach to enforcement: resulting in more ambitious (and disputable) theories of harm and often marking a departure from the strict\u2014and restrictive\u2014logic of the \u201cmore economic approach.\u201d</p><p>In the remainder of this section, we consider our three examples in detail. The purpose is more descriptive than normative. The aim is neither to suggest that competition law <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">should</emphasis> be redirected toward the pursuit of noncompetition public interest goals nor that it invariably <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is</emphasis>. It will, however, be argued that the very particular public interest at stake in each example is apparent in the manner in which the Commission has approached its caseload in these areas, and in how the underlying legal rules are developed and expanded as a result. Accordingly, these examples provide a more granular picture of the relationship between competition enforcement and noncompetition public interests than the orthodoxy outlined in the preceding section otherwise suggests.</p><h>A. Competition Law and the Pursuit of Market Liberalization</h><p>The first area where a distinct \u201cpublic interest\u201d flavor to Commission enforcement is discernible is in support of the EU-level liberalization policies which have been pursued, most obviously, in telecommunications and energy markets in the past several decades. The desirability, indeed the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">inevitability</emphasis>, of liberalizing these typically State-owned monopoly sectors has long been a tenet of faith within the Commission, and competition enforcement commingles with increasingly demanding legislative efforts in this sphere. 115  The public interest here has several dimensions. There is, clearly, a public interest in securing cheaper better quality access to objectively necessary services like broadband, electricity, central heating, and public transport. This enhances consumer welfare in general but can also have a significant <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">re</emphasis>distributive impact: lower energy prices can provide market-based solutions to alleviate fuel poverty, for instance, while increased competition in telecommunications may encourage more rapid broadband expansion in underserved geographic regions. Yet this strand of case law also aligns with more dogmatic assumptions regarding the optional development of the internal market: a perception that \u201cthere is no alternative to the liberalisation process.\u201d 116  Accordingly, the focus on liberalized utilities markets also represents a more doctrinaire, disputed view about how such sectors ought to be structured and to function within the internal market. 117  The public interest at stake is thus not merely the desirability of securing cheaper and better services for (the most vulnerable) consumers; it moreover reflects the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">assumed</emphasis> societal value of the fully realized process of economic integration itself. 118 </p><p>The first indicator of a distinct public interest is the sheer weight of cases that have been pursued within the telecommunications 119  and energy 120  sectors. Yet the mere fact that the Commission brings many cases tells us little about its approach to the public interest issues at stake. To understand the latter, it is necessary to consider the sorts of cases being pursued, and how these map onto wider policy concerns. In short, the consistent theme is the extent to which <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">antitrust</emphasis> enforcement has aligned with, and reinforced, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">regulatory</emphasis> process of market liberalization. One sees this perhaps most obviously in the recurrent use of Article 9 case dispositions\u2014which empower the Commission to accept behavioral or structural commitments, such as divestiture remedies, in lieu of findings of breach\u2014in the energy sector, in a manner which arguably serves to compensate for the Commission\u2019s comparative lack of legislative success here. 121  From a substantive antitrust perspective, of greatest interest is the extent to which regulatory concerns have fed into two of the most prominent theories of harm applied in these sectors, namely, refusal to deal and margin squeeze. The frequent application of these theories is unsurprising, given that the sectors under scrutiny involve vertically integrated network utilities with natural monopoly segments. What is more remarkable, however, has been the Commission\u2019s approach to the interpretation and development of the case theories in this context.</p><p>Refusal to deal comprises the denial of access by dominant undertakings to strategically important market segments, in order to exclude competition in adjacent sectors. Under Article 102, claimed refusals are assessed under the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bronner</emphasis> criteria, which require a demonstration of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d to establish abuse. 122  What we see in the liberalization context, in particular, is a willingness to map the antitrust interpretation of exceptionality onto the parameters of the underlying sector-specific regulatory regime\u2014which, as argued above, reflects an essentially ideological understanding of the optimal operation of such markets.</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Telekomunikacja Polska</emphasis>, for instance, the impugned refusal consisted of failure to comply effectively with access obligations under the EU framework for telecommunications liberalization. Although the conduct had been sanctioned by the domestic regulator, the Commission 123  and the Court 124  had little difficulty in construing the regulatory violation, additionally, as an antitrust offense. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ENI</emphasis>, the alleged refusal included failure to anticipate likely <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">future</emphasis> requests for access and expand capacity accordingly, behavior that was conceptualized as \u201cstrategic underinvestment\u201d in the defendant\u2019s gas transport infrastructure. 125  Such an approach similarly has a distinct regulatory flavor, suggesting that the special responsibility of dominant firms extends to forecasting and promoting future market development. More recently, in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Slovak Telekom</emphasis>, 126  the General Court confirmed one of the contentious \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Telefonica</emphasis> exceptions,\u201d 127  to the effect that regulatory supply duties may function a proxy for indispensability, thus negating the need to consider nonduplicability from an antitrust perspective. 128  Moreover, the Court \u201csuggested\u201d that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bronner</emphasis> is irrelevant in situations of constructive refusal. 129  Such an approach makes little sense when measured against the cogent competition policy concerns that motivated the regulatory restraint implicit in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bronner</emphasis> 130  and is at odds with that advocated in the Commission\u2019s own Article 102 guidelines. 131  Yet it was vigorously advanced by the Commission in its earlier infringement decision, and defended by it on appeal. Each of these cases thus ably illustrates how the Commission\u2019s enthusiasm for deploying antitrust to \u201ccorrect\u201d the process of liberalization at Member State level may prompt an expansion of the relevant competition provisions to account for the particularities of the underlying regulatory framework\u2014creating, however, a risk of distortive effects for the competition rules longer term. 132 </p><p>Margin squeeze is the second theory of recurrent application. 133  Given its conceptual proximity to the refusal to deal, this may be expected, and indeed the Commission\u2019s Article 102 guidance assessed margin squeeze as a form of constructive refusal. 134  Starting with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Deutsche Telekom</emphasis>, 135  however, the Commission has treated margin squeeze as a distinct category of abusive behavior, an approach subsequently granted the imprimatur of the Court. 136  A logical but unsensible consequence, confirmed in the reference case of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">TeliaSonera</emphasis>, is that the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bronner</emphasis> criteria do not determine the existence of a margin squeeze. 137  Conceivably, a dominant firm may have an absolute right to deny access to its infrastructure under Article 102; but if it chooses to deal, it becomes subject to a positive duty to ensure a \u201cfair\u201d spread between wholesale and retail prices. Notably, this unsatisfactory state of affairs was actively advocated by the Commission in its intervention in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">TeliaSonera</emphasis>, premised on the (patently spurious) argument that, otherwise, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">any</emphasis> application of Article 102 would be contingent upon identifying an indispensable input. 138  This pared-down legal standard was then applied by the Commission in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Slovak Telekom</emphasis>, where the muddled reasoning of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">TeliaSonera</emphasis> was again deployed to support the \u201csuggestion\u201d that constructive refusals escape the established <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bronner</emphasis> conditions. 139 </p><p>What both strands of case law demonstrate is that, although the Commission may be happy in principle to tie its hands with more demanding assessment criteria in line with the \u201cmore economic approach,\u201d when it comes to actually applying competition law to address anticompetitive behavior in liberalizing markets, it is almost indecently eager to escape these shackles. Moreover, the thrust of the Commission\u2019s approach is that the competition rules coincide precisely with requirements under the liberalization framework. Yet where the Commission disagrees with how the national regulator has interpreted its task of liberalization, defendants receive little credit for having complied with the directions of the latter, as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Deutsche Telekom</emphasis> illustrated. 140  The most obvious takeaway is the extent to which (perceived) public interest considerations may influence both the intensity and the ambition of antitrust enforcement. Yet in the Commission\u2019s eagerness to police the task of liberalization through competition law, there is little consideration of whether the rules emerging represent best practice for the latter discipline as a whole\u2014and in particular, whether these interpretations continue to make sense once removed from the protection of the Commission, and applied by a diverse range of public and private enforcers within the increasingly decentralized EU system.</p><h>B. Competition Law and the Pharmaceutical Sector</h><p>The second area of concentrated enforcement is the pharmaceutical sector. 141  Multiple competing public interests loom large here, summarized by former Competition Commissioner Kroes as impacting both \u201cthe health and finances of Europe\u2019s citizens and governments.\u201d 142  Securing access to necessary medicine for patients has an inescapable public health dimension. Yet in Europe, where the final payer is often the State, access may be less a question of availability and more of cost to straitened public purses. Merely pushing down prices cannot be the sole objective, however. Not only is the pharmaceutical sector highly dependent on costly R&amp;D efforts to generate a pipeline of innovative new products that deliver improvements for patient health. Moreover, the health of the pharmaceutical sector itself raises industrial policy considerations in light of its key role within the EU economy. Thus, there are few obvious answers to competition problems in these markets, as the Commission\u2019s Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry, concluded in 2009, acknowledged. 143 </p><p>The preceding subsection described how public interest considerations underpinned a markedly expansive approach to an established theory of harm (a refusal to deal) in liberalizing market segments. In the pharmaceutical sector, by contrast, the public interests at stake have prompted significant legal innovation, resulting in the recognition of more novel theories that capture particular types of strategic behavior. This subsection considers two: the treatment of \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d agreements and \u201cregulatory gaming\u201d practices. Notably, both police the switch from patent protection to generic competition, and thus align with the balancing of multiple competing public interests in pharmaceutical cases: the end of patent protection marks the end of the period during which originator companies can plausibly claim a legitimate \u201cmonopoly reward\u201d for successful innovation, while the introduction of generic competition usually generates significant downward pricing pressure.</p><p>The term \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d refers to a broad category of agreements pursuant to which generic companies consent to delay or even abandon market entry in exchange for payment from the incumbent originator. 144  Such agreements tend to emerge shortly before successful proprietary medicines come off patent, as originators seek to extend de facto the duration of patent protection\u2014and attendant inflated profits. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lundbeck</emphasis>, decided in 2013, the Commission held for the first time that \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d agreements may violate Article 101. 145  The anticompetitive potential of such arrangements is relatively uncontroversial, 146  and, that same year, the U.S. Supreme Court similarly agreed that \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d may violate Sherman Act \u00a71, following a \u201crule of reason\u201d assessment. 147  What was more unusual about <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lundbeck</emphasis> was that the Commission had proceeded on the basis that relevant restraints comprised object restrictions under Article 101. Yet the \u201cby object\u201d category is, in principle, reserved for only the most obviously, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">inherently</emphasis> harmful forms of coordination. 148  Such a characterization is arguably less clear-cut in the context of \u201cpay-to-delay,\u201d where excluded rivals constitute merely <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">potential</emphasis> competitors at the time of the agreement, where successful entry even absent the arrangement is not a given, where there are (sometimes dubious) intellectual property rights at stake, and where condemnation of the agreement may conflict with the right to effective judicial protection.</p><p>Yet the approach in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lundbeck</emphasis> is easier to support to the extent that the relevant \u201clegal and economic context\u201d of the restraint is read broadly to encompass wider public interest dimensions. This certainly seems to have been the approach of the General Court in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lundbeck</emphasis> in upholding the object characterization, 149  in which it acknowledged and defended the role of generic entry in prompting often-dramatic regulated price cuts in the pharmaceutical sector. 150  It also expressed skepticism about the robustness of certain domestic patents, primly repeating that \u201cit is in the public interest to eliminate any obstacle to economic activity which may arise where a patent was granted in error.\u201d 151  Accordingly, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">contra</emphasis> the argument that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lundbeck</emphasis> is incompatible with the restrictive understanding of the object category endorsed in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cartes Bancaires</emphasis>, 152  the case can instead be seen as a nuanced exposition of the latter approach. Thus, even if, strictly speaking, Article 101 cannot police the protection of human health, the latter may shift our perception of the underlying legal context or render the anticipated economic harm more compelling. While <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lundbeck</emphasis> is on further appeal, 153  the object treatment of \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d has been confirmed by the General Court in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Servier</emphasis>, 154  in which the Commission notably hedged its bets by treating the relevant restraints as restrictions both by object <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and</emphasis> effect. 155 </p><p>The second area of legal innovation involves so-called regulatory gaming. This refers to the exploitation of pro-competitive or neutral governmental regulations, which are misused by private undertakings for exclusionary purposes. 156  The challenge from an antitrust perspective is that, frequently, the defendant\u2019s behavior complies with the letter of the underlying regime, though not its spirit. Thus, regulatory gaming raises questions of the extent to which competition law should second-guess the approach of other regulatory frameworks or attempt to correct putatively \u201cbroken\u201d regimes.</p><p>The most prominent example in EU law arose precisely in the pharmaceutical sector, where AstraZeneca was held to have violated Article 102 through conduct intended to prolong the duration of patent protection for its blockbuster ulcer medicine, Losec. 157  The abusive behavior comprised two prongs. First, the defendant made misrepresentations to national patent authorities, which enabled it to obtain \u201csupplementary protection certificates\u201d (SPCs) which extended patent life. Second, it strategically withdrew marketing authorization for Losec capsules, thus denying generic entrants a piggyback licensing procedure; and in tandem sought to migrate existing patient users to tablet form, which retained patent protection. The difficulty was that such behavior was either permitted by the underlying regulatory regime 158  or implicitly facilitated. 159  Thus, the putative <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">actus reus</emphasis> in each instance was conduct that represented \u201cnormal\u201d business behavior within the market concerned.</p><p>What is notable about <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AstraZeneca</emphasis>, therefore, and where the underlying public interest considerations came to the fore, is the extent to which the existence of the abuse hinged on the defendant\u2019s anticompetitive <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">intention</emphasis> (or \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mens rea</emphasis>\u201d). 160  As explained in Section III, in principle, the antitrust rules depend on an objective determination of the impact on competition, actual or anticipated, of the relevant conduct. Yet although <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AstraZeneca</emphasis> reaffirmed the orthodoxy that anticompetitive intent is not a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">necessary</emphasis> requirement under Article 102, here the defendant\u2019s perceived objectives proved determinative of its abusive behavior. So, for instance, the fact that AstraZeneca exercised its otherwise lawful right to withdraw its marketing authorizations <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">precisely</emphasis> to frustrate generic competition served to transform outwardly ordinary and permissible behavior into an antitrust violation. Yet every firm wishes ultimately to exclude competitors, in the sense of increasing its own market share, hence the limited utility of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mens rea-</emphasis>esque concepts in the antitrust sphere. What thus distinguished <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AstraZeneca</emphasis>, arguably, was the wider context and more profound ramifications of excluding generic competition: in particular, the harmful consequences for national health systems, a concern that was considered in detail in the Commission infringement decision. 161  Much as in the context of \u201cpay-for-delay,\u201d the underlying public interest considerations did not dispense with the need for antitrust assessment, but rather were brought to bear in shaping and justifying an ambitious application of the competition rules.</p><p>Yet the pharmaceutical sector also provides an important reminder of the continuing need to root even a purposive interpretation of the competition rules within the existing legal framework. This is seen in the fate of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Servier</emphasis>, the second decision in which the Commission condemned regulatory gaming. 162  While, as noted, the General Court confirmed the Article 101 aspects, the Article 102 claim fell at the first hurdle, as the Court was unpersuaded of the robustness of the Commission\u2019s market definition exercise. Absent dominance, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Servier</emphasis>\u2019s putatively anticompetitive unilateral behavior was immune from scrutiny, regardless of the public interests at stake. Thus, the soft influence of the public interest has unavoidable limits in the antitrust sphere.</p><h>C. Competition Law and the Digital Economy</h><p>The third and final example is a more recent focus on competition problems within the digital economy. The inescapable rise of Big Tech, coupled with the comparative absence of effective regulation within the digital sphere, has led to urgent calls (often from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">outside</emphasis> the antitrust community) for more aggressive enforcement against the digital giants. 163  In the EU, these challenges are inextricably tied up with the \u201cfairness mantra\u201d 164  associated with the tenure of Commissioner Vestager at DG Competition. In embracing the argument that competition law and policy are directed toward securing \u201ca Europe that gives everyone a fair chance,\u201d 165  Commissioner Vestager has not only aligned this area of EU law with wider policy concerns about the optimal future development of the social market economy. 166  Moreover, the sheer breadth of the fairness concept\u2014including, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">inter alia</emphasis>, the right of \u201call companies\u2014large and small\u2014[to] a fair, fighting chance to succeed on their merits,\u201d 167  \u201cfair pay\u201d 168  for workers, and a duty on undertakings to pay \u201ctheir fair share of tax\u201d 169 \u2014inevitably calls into question the Commission\u2019s commitment to a \u201cmore economic approach,\u201d with its ostensible single-minded focus on behavior that results in anticompetitive foreclosure. 170 </p><p>What is interesting about the themes highlighted by Commissioner Vestager is how these transcend even a \u201cbig is bad\u201d understanding of competition policy. Instead, she has drawn upon a broad range of public interest concerns associated with the emergence of hugely powerful, increasingly ubiquitous, and apparently unregulatable digital platforms. These include data privacy, 171  the increasing pervasiveness of algorithmic decision-making, 172  the problems of adequately taxing digital services, 173  the labor rights of vulnerable workers who provide services through digital platforms, 174  and, ultimately, the threats to the fabric of our democracy that may be posed by the shift from public to private control of large areas of the economy. 175  The fact that such themes plainly go beyond her remit as Competition Commissioner received tacit acknowledgment upon her re-nomination for a second term in September 2019, when Commissioner Vestager was given the additional mandate of securing \u201ca Europe fit for the digital age.\u201d 176  Yet the rhetoric of fairness, even at its most ambitious, is by no means decoupled from the bread and butter of her antitrust enforcer role. Commissioner Vestager has explained the logic as such: [I]f we value an open economy, and a liberal society, we have to show that those values benefit everyone, not just the select few[.] So if we want to show that our society treats everyone fairly, however big or small, we need to prove it in the market. 177  It is in recent enforcement efforts within the digital economy that, arguably, we see these ideas play out most clearly.</p><p>The Commission, of course, has a rich history of robust enforcement within the \u201cnew\u201d economy, including infringement decisions against <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Microsoft</emphasis> in 2004 178  and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Intel</emphasis> in 2009. 179  Both involved the application of well-established rules to more novel market situations\u2014tying and refusal to deal in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Microsoft</emphasis>, exclusive dealing in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Intel</emphasis>\u2014and both culminated in what were, at the time, record-breaking fines for violations of Article 102. These cases may thus be viewed as \u201csetting the scene\u201d for the trio of infringement decisions pursued against Google\u2014<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Shopping</emphasis>, 180  <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Android</emphasis>, 181  and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AdSense</emphasis> 182 \u2014since 2017. Yet these later cases mark a more muscular development of the antitrust rules in several ways, which, we suggest, is inspired in part by a perceived need to address broader public interest concerns.</p><p>First, the most immediately striking feature is the size of the fines imposed: more than \u20ac8 billion in total across the three <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Google</emphasis> decisions, including a record-breaking fine of \u20ac4.34 billion for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Android</emphasis> alone. 183  It is difficult to avoid the impression that these very high fines are a deliberate policy choice, set at such an elevated level precisely to demonstrate the willingness of the Commission to intervene against market actors perceived to pose a threat to the public interest. 184  Such high fines were, moreover, enabled by the policy choice to pursue the cases as Article 7 infringement decisions rather than Article 9 commitments. 185  This was despite overtures toward settlement in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Android</emphasis>, 186  and more remarkably, despite three rounds of ultimately unsuccessful market-testing of proposed commitments in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Shopping</emphasis> (which, however, preceded Commissioner Vestager\u2019s arrival at DG Competition). 187  A similar \u201cpublic interest\u201d dimension is discernible in the Commission\u2019s 2016 determination that Apple was required to repay \u20ac13 billion in uncollected taxes to Ireland for breach of the State aid rules, 188  a decision the Commissioner admitted was motivated by a perceived need to \u201cdo something\u201d within the limited powers available to the Commission to address public anger over tax injustice. 189  Even if the subject matter of these decisions is often far removed from the focus of public anxiety regarding the digital economy, such cases nonetheless perform an important demonstrative function, setting the EU up as \u201cthe determinator,\u201d 190  prepared to rein in Big Tech in the public interest.</p><p>The influence of the public interest is also evident in the emergence of self-preferencing as the most prominent theory of harm in the digital sphere. Self-preferencing refers to situations whereby a digital platform gives \u201cpreferential treatment to one\u2019s own products or services when they are in competition with products and services provided by other entities using the platform.\u201d 191  It was the crux of the prohibited behavior in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Shopping</emphasis>, can arguably be seen as the underlying concern in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Android</emphasis>, 192  and is the subject of on-going investigations involving <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Amazon Marketplace</emphasis> 193  and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Apple iTunes</emphasis>. 194  While in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Shopping</emphasis>, the Commission disclaimed any novelty for self-preferencing as a theory of harm, 195  the case law cited to support its established status fell considerably short. 196  A cynic might also observe that novelty would have been an inconvenient obstacle insofar as the Commission was determined to impose a (then) record-breaking fine. 197  In their report on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Competition Policy for the Digital Era</emphasis>, the Commission\u2019s expert panel on digital markets went even further, arguing for a reverse burden of proof in certain instances whereby the platform would \u201cbear the burden of proving that self-preferencing has no long-run exclusionary effects on product markets.\u201d 198 </p><p>Yet self-preferencing is of interest beyond the mere fact that its novelty demonstrates legal innovation in response to broader public concerns about the digital economy. The theory has a distinct regulatory quality, which chimes with calls for the aggressive application of competition law to provide an ad hoc tool for regulating the digital economy. The Commission\u2019s expert panel thus identified a category of platforms that perform \u201ca rule-setting function,\u201d whereby platforms \u201cact as regulators, setting up the rules and institutions through which their users interact.\u201d 199  In such circumstances, the authors proposed an overarching duty on dominant platforms to ensure that \u201ccompetition on their platforms is fair, unbiased, and pro-users,\u201d 200  a specific application of which is the reverse burden of proof for self-preferencing set out above. 201  The notion that dominant platforms have a positive duty to ensure \u201cfair\u201d outcomes for rivals, through for instance modifying the manner in which they display competing services, has inescapable parallels to more traditional forms of utilities regulation. Yet whereas the latter has typically been contingent upon the existence of bottleneck monopolies that render effective competition otherwise impossible, both the Commission and its expert panel expressly disclaimed any necessary connection between the theory of self-preferencing and the case law on refusal to supply. 202  The focus instead on \u201cstrategic market status\u201d 203  thus aligns with broader academic concerns about the role that digital platforms play as gatekeepers within contemporary markets, and indeed contemporary society more broadly. 204  Similarly, the suggestion to relax the conventional antitrust concern with error cost by erring on the side of prohibiting potentially anticompetitive conduct in concentrated digital markets, 205  is consistent with broader public skepticism about digital market power.</p><p>Accordingly, what we see in the digital economy is how broader public interest concerns feed into discussion of the optimal approach to competition policy, with, moreover, some evidence from recent enforcement practice of the redirection of the latter to provide a more muscular tool to regulate digital dominance. There are, once again, inherent limits to such an approach, typified by the \u201cserious doubts\u201d expressed by the Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court 206  when considering the Bundeskartellamt\u2019s much-debated decision to sanction alleged data protection breaches by Facebook as a violation of the German rules on abuse of market conduct. 207  That is, competition law remains competition law, and thus provides an inapt tool to regulate, for instance, fake news or discriminatory algorithmic decision-making, not merely from a legitimacy but also an effectiveness perspective. But it is indisputable that the arguments being raised transcend purely technical questions of antitrust policy\u2014and it is increasingly difficult to maintain that such concerns are not reflected in at least the tenor of policy debate with respect to the digital economy, if not also the application of the antitrust rules in practice.</p><h>V. Conclusions</h><p>Debates regarding the treatment of public interest under the EU competition rules are caught between several contrasting impetuses. Competition law is focused on ensuring effective market competition, and in the EU, protecting \u201ccompetition as such.\u201d Yet most people would accept that, in the final analysis, markets should serve the wider public interest and not vice versa. It is, accordingly, difficult to maintain that competition law should be applied and developed with its eyes closed to noneconomic public interest concerns. Yet there is often an acute difficulty, at least in the EU, in identifying a single set of legitimate or approved public interests that merit accommodation within the competition framework. Moreover, while this article has focused primarily on the \u201ccentralized\u201d application of the competition rules by the Commission, within an increasingly <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">de</emphasis>centralized enforcement landscape, such public interest claims may not only take on greater urgency but also have greater disruptive or distortive potential.</p><p>This article has argued that it may be inferred from recent enforcement in three distinct segments that the considerations at issue transcended an inflexible concern with \u201ccompetition as such.\u201d The examples surveyed, however, do not tell a clear and consistent story about when and how public interest concerns can and should be accommodated. In the context of the network industries, for example, the Commission has used antitrust enforcement to pursue a rather singular vision of how such markets should be structured and ought to operate. Yet the available empirical evidence suggests that not all consumers are likely to benefit 208  and that the advisability of unbundling policies may vary significantly between different national markets. 209  In the pharmaceutical sector, it is difficult to avoid the suspicion that the root cause of the competition problems discussed above is, in many instances, the poor practices of national patent offices and other domestic regulatory agencies. Thus, competition enforcement, instead, became a kind of \u201cproxy war\u201d in such cases, fought to tackle market problems outside the purview of the Commission\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction. An inescapable paradox of calls for greater intervention in the digital economy, moreover, is the underlying assumption that the public has a set of concerns about firm size which are not expressed in its market behavior: 210  that is, if we the public are so concerned about the omnipresence of the tech giants, then why do we keep <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">using</emphasis> these services when other options are available?</p><p>At its core, EU competition law reflects a persistent, though by no means uncontentious, belief that open and competitive markets, integrated across the Member States, are the best means to further public interest objectives more broadly. But that does not mean, however, that EU competition law is immune to wider public interest concerns. Noncompetition considerations can affect our understanding of how markets work or shape our approach to the derogations that exist within the competition system. Moreover, and perhaps most importantly in practice, the fact that compelling parallel public interests may be at stake can influence the underlying calculus of whether antitrust intervention is merited in a particular instance and how vigorously it should be pursued.</p><p>Yet competition law is not a particularly nimble tool by which to pursue such interests more directly as a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">standalone</emphasis> concern. Competition law can break up cartels that seek to delay green innovation, for instance, or punish dominant drug makers that block access to cheap generic versions of blockbuster medicines. But, conversely, it is an inapt mechanism by which to require firms to invest in sustainability, and there are cogent policy reasons why antitrust is generally reluctant to force generic-level pricing on originator pharma companies during the period of patent protection. Thus, competition law can and should be used to further the public interest, broadly construed, where the latter coincides with its overarching task of promoting beneficial social outcomes through the use of open and effective competition to control private power. But it is not a panacea for all contemporary ills, nor a lazy fallback that can be assumed to absolve other legal disciplines of the need to figure out how best to regulate problems that fall more squarely within their jurisdiction.</p><p>Competition law and the public interest go hand in hand, as the quote that opened this article recognizes. But competition law alone cannot be enough to protect the range of interests that have been invoked in this context. There are, famously, \u201climits of antitrust,\u201d and the extent to which these rules can be deployed in furtherance of noncompetition-oriented yet socially valuable objectives is undoubtedly one such limit. Claims to the public interest are clearly cognizable within the EU competition framework, albeit typically through an approach of carving <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">out</emphasis> such concerns from the application of the rules rather than accounting for noncompetition interests within the substance of the antitrust provisions. Whether the latter would be a good idea, or rather a slippery slope, is a provocative question largely beyond the scope of this article. What is clear, however, is that competition law <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">can</emphasis> be part of the solution when it comes to addressing broader societal problems that extend beyond competition policy as such, but it would be naive to think that it is the only or optimal solution here.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGEABX-1011770003603X20912883</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGEABX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D4-0K81-JBMY-H05N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470049</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"12280\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Sage Publications, Inc.

They also lead to data breaches and loss of individuals' control over personal information. Existing enforcement mechanisms fail to hold data processors accountable and provide little-to-no relief for privacy violations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The privacy principles outline four concepts that any meaningful data protection legislation should incorporate at a minimum:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Privacy protections must be strong, meaningful, and comprehensive.</p><p>* Data practices must protect civil rights, prevent unlawful discrimination, and advance equal opportunity.</p><p>* Governments at all levels should play a role in protecting and enforcing privacy rights.</p><p>* Legislation should provide redress for privacy violations.</p><p>These public interest privacy principles include a framework providing guidelines for policymakers considering how to protect the privacy of all Americans effectively while also offering meaningful redress. They follow three days of Federal Trade Commission hearings about big data, competition, and privacy as well as the comment deadline on \"Developing the Administration's Approach to Privacy,\" a request for comment from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration as the agency works to develop privacy policy recommendations for the Trump Administration, and ongoing work at the National Institute for Standards and Technology to develop a privacy risk framework.</p><p>The groups urge members of Congress to pass privacy legislation that ensures fairness, prevents discrimination, advances equal opportunity, protects free expression, and facilitates trust between the public and companies that collect their personal data.</p><p>New America's Open Technology Institute, Public Knowledge, Access Humboldt, Access Now, Berkeley Media Studies Group, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, Center for Democracy &amp;#38; Technology, Center for Digital Democracy, Center for Media Justice, Center on Privacy &amp;#38; Technology at Georgetown Law, Color of Change, Common Cause, Common Sense Kids Action, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Customer Commons, Demand Progress, Free Press Action Fund, Human Rights Watch, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Media Alliance, Media Mobilizing Project, National Association of Consumer Advocates, National Consumer Law Center, National Consumers League, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Oakland Privacy, Open MIC (Open Media and Information Companies Initiative), Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, Public Citizen, U.S. PIRG, and United Church of Christ, OC Inc. signed the principles. Additional local and national privacy advocates are encouraged to sign on.</p><p>The following can be attributed to Eric Null, Senior Policy Counsel at New America's Open Technology Institute:</p><p>\"For decades, privacy regulation has favored the company over the user -- companies set their own rules and users are left to fend for themselves. Worse, companies have even discriminated based on protected classes through algorithmic decision-making. Comprehensive privacy legislation must disrupt this status quo. Legislation that follows the public interest privacy principles will better protect users and give users more control over their data.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Allie Bohm, Policy Counsel at Public Knowledge:</p><p>\"It is imperative that any comprehensive privacy legislation reflect the concerns, interests, and priorities of actual human beings. Today, consumer protection, privacy, and civil rights groups come together to articulate those interests, priorities, and concerns. Importantly, these principles address the many harms people can experience from privacy violations and misuse of personal data, including enabling unfair price discrimination; limiting awareness of opportunities; and contributing to employment, housing, health care, and other forms of discrimination.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Amie Stepanovich, U.S. Policy Manager at Access Now:</p><p>\"From Europe to India to Brazil, data privacy legislation is becoming the norm around the world, and people in the United States are getting left behind. It is long past time that our legislators acted to protect people across the country from opaque data practices that can result in its misuse and abuse, and any acceptable package must start with these principles.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Josh Golin, Executive Director at Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood:</p><p>\"What big tech offers for 'free' actually comes at a high cost -- our privacy. Worst of all is how vulnerable kids are tracked online and then targeted with manipulative marketing. This has to stop. We need laws that will empower parents to protect their children's privacy.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Joseph Jerome, Policy Counsel at Center for Democracy &amp;#38; Technology:</p><p>\"Debates about national privacy laws focus on how companies should implement Fair Information Practices. The operative word is 'fair.' When it comes to how companies collect, use, and share our data, too many business practices are simply unfair. Federal law must go beyond giving consumers more notices and choices about their privacy, and we think it is time for legislators in Congress to flip the privacy presumption and declare some data practices unfair.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Katharina Kopp, Director of Policy at Center for Digital Democracy:</p><p>\"To this day, U.S. citizens have had to live without effective privacy safeguards. Commercial data practices have grown ever more intrusive, ubiquitous and harmful. It is high time to provide Americans with effective safeguards against commercial surveillance. Any legislation must not only effectively protect individual privacy, it must advance equitable, just and fair data uses, and must protect the most vulnerable among us, including children. In other words, they must bring about real changes in corporate practices. We have waited long enough; the time is now.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Laura Moy, Executive Director at Center on Privacy &amp;#38; Technology at Georgetown Law:</p><p>\"Americans want their data to be respected, protected, and used in ways that are consistent with their expectations. Any new legislation governing commercial data practices must advance these goals, and also protect us from data-driven activities that are harmful to society. We need privacy to protect us from uses of data that exclude communities from important opportunities, enable faceless brokers to secretly build ever-more-detailed profiles of us, and amplify political polarization and hate speech.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Yosef Getachew, Director of Media and Democracy Program at Common Cause:</p><p>\"An overwhelming majority of Americans believe they have lost control over how their personal information is collected and used across the internet ecosystem. Numerous data breaches and abuses in data sharing practices, which have jeopardized the personal information of millions of Americans, have validated these fears. Our current privacy framework no longer works, and the lack of meaningful privacy protections poses a serious threat to our democracy. Companies can easily manipulate data to politically influence voters or engage in discriminatory practices. These principles should serve as a baseline for any comprehensive privacy legislation that guarantees all Americans control over their data.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to James P. Steyer, CEO and Founder, at Common Sense:</p><p>\"Any federal legislation should provide for strong baseline protections, particularly for the most surveilled and vulnerable generation ever -- our kids. These principles reflect that as privacy, consumer, and civil rights advocates, we only want federal legislation that will move the ball forward in terms of protecting kids, families, and all of us.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Linda Sherry, director of national priorities at Consumer Action:</p><p>\"Our country has floundered far too long without strong federal regulations governing data collection, retention, use and sharing. These privacy principles, developed by a coalition of leading consumer, civil rights and privacy organizations, are offered as a framework to guide Congress in protecting consumers from the many harms that can befall them when they are given little or no choice in safeguarding their data, and companies have few, if any, restrictions on how they use that information.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Susan Grant, Director of Consumer Protection and Privacy at Consumer Federation of America:</p><p>\"We need to move forward on data protection in the United States, from a default that allows companies to do what they want with Americans' personal information as long as they don't lie about it, to one in which their business practices are aligned with respect for privacy rights and the responsibility to keep people's data secure.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Katie McInnis, Policy Counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy division of Consumer Reports:</p><p>\"As new data breaches are announced at an alarming rate, now is the time to protect consumers with strong privacy laws. We need laws that do more than just address broad transparency and access rights. Consumers deserve practical controls and robust enforcement to ensure all of their personal information is sufficiently protected.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Gaurav Laroia, Policy Counsel at Free Press Action Fund:</p><p>\"The public has lost faith in technology companies' interest and ability to police their own privacy and data usage practices. It's past time for Congress to pass a strong law that empowers people to make meaningful choices about their data, protects them from discrimination and undue manipulation, and holds companies accountable for those practices.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to David Brody, Counsel &amp;#38; Senior Fellow for Privacy and Technology at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law:</p><p>\"Protecting the right to privacy is essential to protecting civil rights and advancing racial equity in a modern, Internet-focused society. Privacy rights are civil rights. Invasive profiling of online activity enables discrimination in employment, housing, credit, and education; helps bad actors target voter suppression and misinformation; assists biased law enforcement surveillance; chills the free association of advocates; and creates connections between hateful extremists exacerbating racial tensions.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Tracy Rosenberg, Executive Director at Media Alliance:</p><p>\"After a flood of data breaches and privacy violations, Americans overwhelmingly support meaningful protections for their personal information that are not written by, for and in the interests of the data collection industry. These principles start to define what that looks like.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Francella Ochillo, Vice President of Policy &amp;#38; General Counsel at National Hispanic Media Coalition:</p><p>\"For years, tech platforms have been allowed to monetize personal data without oversight or consequence, losing sight of the fact that personal data belongs to the user. Meanwhile, Latinos and other marginalized communities continue to be exposed to the greatest risk of harm and have the fewest opportunities for redress. The National Hispanic Media Coalition joins the chorus of advocates calling for a comprehensive regulatory framework that protects a user's right to privacy and access as well as the right to be forgotten.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to JP Massar, Organizer at Oakland Privacy:</p><p>\"We must not only watch the watchers, and regulate the sellers of our information. We must begin to unravel the information panopticon that has already formed. This is a start.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Robert Weissman, President at Public Citizen:</p><p>\"Internet privacy means control. Either we get to control our own lives as lived through the Internet, or the Big Tech companies do. That's what is at stake in whether the U.S. adopts real privacy protections.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Ed Mierzwinski, Senior Director for Consumer Programs at U.S. PIRG:</p><p>\"The big banks and the big tech companies all say that they want a federal privacy law, but the law that their phalanx of lobbyists seeks isn't designed to protect consumers. Instead, it's designed to protect their business models that treat consumers as commodities for sale; it fails to guarantee that their secret sauce big data algorithms don't discriminate; it eliminates stronger and innovative state laws forever and it denies consumers any real, enforceable rights when harmed. We can't allow that.\"</p><p>You may view the privacy principles for more information.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6516105 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6516105</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TR7-D761-DYG2-R463-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2202\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 13, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The e-book operates as a guide for addressing the challenges posed by the power of digital platforms.  Many Americans now wonder how they can reassert control over their lives after ceding so many decisions about our economy and our public discourse to private actors. These individuals manage digital platforms that now permeate every aspect of our lives. </p><p>In this e-book, Feld explains both how we got here and what we can do about it. He evaluates a wide variety of policy solutions and provides a road map to regulating digital platforms inspired by economics, social policy, the history of communications regulation, and antitrust law. His e-book aims to show policymakers how they can both preserve competition and empower individual platform users in the huge swath of our economy now referred to as \u201cBig Tech.\u201d  In the e-book, Feld defines digital platforms as a service that:      Is accessed via the internet;     Is at the center of a two-sided or multi-sided market where at least one side is open to the general public  and allows the public to play multiple roles;     Enjoys specific types of powerful network effects.  He explains the need for a \u201cDigital Platform Act\u201d and for an agency specifically charged to regulate digital platforms on an ongoing basis. He proposes a new method of assessing a platform\u2019s dominance for purposes of new regulation. He also addresses questions around content moderation rights and responsibilities for companies that have found themselves policing the new public square, all while preserving the best things about digital platforms for their users.  An expert agency over digital platforms can analyze and study the market to determine when regulation or enforcements are needed, including if:      Dominant digital platforms should be required to offer interconnection to competitors through open APIs to break down network effects that lock in users.     Dominant digital platforms should be prohibited from self-preferencing and some types of discrimination. An agency can monitor and enforce this through \u201cblack-box testing,\u201d protecting details of proprietary algorithms.     There should be restrictions on acquisitions by dominant digital platforms, including non-horizontal acquisitions usually less scrutinized by antitrust agencies.     Certain platforms that collect data from competitors (or potential competitors defined broadly) should be limited in how they can use their competitor\u2019s data.  The e-book will be available free under a Creative Commons license and may be accessed here.  \u201cIt is time for the government to step in and defend our fundamental values so that digital platforms continue to benefit the public,\u201d Feld explains, \u201calthough antitrust law seeks to protect competition, antitrust alone is not enough -- what we really need is a regulator properly equipped to go further by affirmatively promoting competition through policymaking.\u201d The e-book argues that a \u201cDigital Platform Act\u201d establishing a new federal agency to regulate digital platforms is the best next step and provides a framework for getting there.  The following can be attributed to Harold Feld, Senior Vice President at Public Knowledge:  \u201cIn a world where tech companies remain extremely popular but are also in the news daily due to concerns about their impact on our society, I wrote this book to offer a way forward. In the book, I provide a comprehensive framework that places our enduring values and consumers at the center of decision making -- not corporate profits or economic \u2018efficiencies.\u2019 We are still years away from passing comprehensive legislation. This book is not the text of a needed law, but the way to get to the laws we need.  \u201cTo get to the laws that both protect society and continue to allow innovation, we must have a public policy conversation that accomplishes two contradictory things. On the one hand, we must find ways to constrain the power of Silicon Valley giants to make fundamental decisions on how our economy works and how our democracy works, rebalancing it toward empowering and protecting average users. At the same time, we cannot act in blind panic of policymaking that threatens to undermine the benefits digital platforms provide or does ourselves and our economy even greater harm than living with the status quo.\u201d  The following can be attributed to Marshall Steinbaum, Fellow at the Roosevelt Institute:  \u201cThe assumption that an unregulated digital marketplace both protects users from exploitation and fosters competition has been disproved by decades of experience with telecommunications deregulation and lax antitrust policy. The tech sector shows us the result of that policy choice: unaccountable middlemen make a killing because they don\u2019t have to follow the rules that govern everyone else in the economy.  \u201cFeld\u2019s book offers a way forward to re-assert the importance of public power as a counterweight to corporate power: regulation in the public interest, restructuring where existing business models are inimical to it. This publication offers a comprehensive guide to policymakers who recognize that something is wrong with the way tech currently works and are searching out policy options for what to do about it.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN1012796020190509</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2R-YH31-DXCW-D315-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 9, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The e-book operates as a guide for addressing the challenges posed by the power of digital platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many Americans now wonder how they can reassert control over their lives after ceding so many decisions about our economy and our public discourse to private actors. These individuals manage digital platforms that now permeate every aspect of our lives. In this e-book, Feld explains both how we got here and what we can do about it. He evaluates a wide variety of policy solutions and provides a road map to regulating digital platforms inspired by economics, social policy, the history of communications regulation, and antitrust law. His e-book aims to show policymakers how they can both preserve competition and empower individual platform users in the huge swath of our economy now referred to as \"Big Tech.\"</p><p>In the e-book, Feld defines digital platforms as a service that:</p><p>* Is accessed via the internet;</p><p>* Is at the center of a two-sided or multi-sided market where at least one side is open to the general public and allows the public to play multiple roles;</p><p>* Enjoys specific types of powerful network effects.</p><p>He explains the need for a \"Digital Platform Act\" and for an agency specifically charged to regulate digital platforms on an ongoing basis. He proposes a new method of assessing a platform's dominance for purposes of new regulation. He also addresses questions around content moderation rights and responsibilities for companies that have found themselves policing the new public square, all while preserving the best things about digital platforms for their users.</p><p>An expert agency over digital platforms can analyze and study the market to determine when regulation or enforcements are needed, including if:</p><p>* Dominant digital platforms should be required to offer interconnection to competitors through open APIs to break down network effects that lock in users.</p><p>* Dominant digital platforms should be prohibited from self-preferencing and some types of discrimination. An agency can monitor and enforce this through \"black-box testing,\" protecting details of proprietary algorithms.</p><p>* There should be restrictions on acquisitions by dominant digital platforms, including non-horizontal acquisitions usually less scrutinized by antitrust agencies.</p><p>* Certain platforms that collect data from competitors (or potential competitors defined broadly) should be limited in how they can use their competitor's data.</p><p>The e-book will be available free under a Creative Commons license and may be accessed here.</p><p>\"It is time for the government to step in and defend our fundamental values so that digital platforms continue to benefit the public,\" Feld explains, \"although antitrust law seeks to protect competition, antitrust alone is not enough -- what we really need is a regulator properly equipped to go further by affirmatively promoting competition through policymaking.\" The e-book argues that a \"Digital Platform Act\" establishing a new federal agency to regulate digital platforms is the best next step and provides a framework for getting there.</p><p>The following can be attributed to Harold Feld, Senior Vice President at Public Knowledge:</p><p>\"In a world where tech companies remain extremely popular but are also in the news daily due to concerns about their impact on our society, I wrote this book to offer a way forward. In the book, I provide a comprehensive framework that places our enduring values and consumers at the center of decision making -- not corporate profits or economic 'efficiencies.' We are still years away from passing comprehensive legislation. This book is not the text of a needed law, but the way to get to the laws we need.</p><p>\"To get to the laws that both protect society and continue to allow innovation, we must have a public policy conversation that accomplishes two contradictory things. On the one hand, we must find ways to constrain the power of Silicon Valley giants to make fundamental decisions on how our economy works and how our democracy works, rebalancing it toward empowering and protecting average users.

An FTC investigation means there is particular conduct by the company that the agency is interested in, and that the agency is examining that conduct to determine if it violates antitrust law.</p><p>\"Today, we learned that the FTC is currently investigating Facebook's conduct for whether it may or may not be violating antitrust law. Unlike other recent stories about a broad antitrust review into digital platforms generally, this is a concrete step that indicates the agency has begun a standard investigation process for Facebook's conduct.</p><p>\"If the FTC finds a violation of the antitrust laws, we expect the agency to take quick action to impose an appropriate remedy. Whether or not that is the result of this specific investigation, we still need comprehensive platform legislation to fully address the competitive problems in this space.</p><p>\"It's important that the Congressional investigation into competition in digital platforms continues to be a focus of attention to ensure that all competitive concerns are being addressed.\"</p><p>\"For more information on antitrust law, read \"Decoding Antitrust Law: A Primer for Advocates.\" To learn more about how Public Knowledge thinks Big Tech should be regulated, please view \"The Case for the Digital Platform Act.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>11R-Swain-6800859 11R-Swain</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6800859</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN6-1JB1-JC11-112S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"269\"/><timeReceived>9:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Investigating Big Tech's Impact on Small Business\" will urge Congress to set necessary safeguards that balance providing a stable and competitive environment for small businesses with preserving the valuable features of digital platforms for consumers.</p><p>Without these critical safeguards, digital platforms may engage in anticompetitive behavior that stifles small businesses and raises prices for consumers. But even without anticompetitive intent, giant digital platforms run the risk of creating unanticipated and disastrous impacts on the small businesses dependent on them. Antitrust law is not enough to promote a level playing field for small businesses.</p><p>The following is an excerpt from the testimony:</p><p>\"No one can doubt that digital platforms, including 'big tech' platforms such as Google, Amazon, and social media platforms such as Facebook, have created enormous opportunities for small businesses. Not only have these services allowed small businesses to extend their existing reach, but they have also created exciting new opportunities for entirely new small businesses.</p><p>\"At the same time, the dominance of a handful of massive companies in online retail, online search, online video, and social media creates enormous problems for small businesses. . . For example, there have been repeated reports that Amazon harvests information from third-party vendors to develop competing products. In 2017, the European Commission antitrust authority found that Google violated EU antitrust laws by favoring its affiliated content in its 'Google shopping' service.</p><p>\"Importantly, however, small businesses that use digital platforms as necessary inputs for their businesses can face enormous costs and barriers to entry even when they do not compete against the platform. Giant platforms, lacking competition and focused on maximizing their own revenue and preserving their own quality of service, can cause havoc with small businesses through poorly implemented decisions or imposing cumbersome and expensive processes. For example, rivals have been known to sabotage each other on platforms such as Amazon and YouTube with fake complaints, forcing small businesses to undertake expensive and complicated appeals processes. Changes in monetization policies or search algorithms can cause small businesses -- through no fault of their own -- to experience a sudden unanticipated drop in revenue.</p><p>\"In other words, giant platforms present a danger to small businesses not simply when they deliberately try to put them at a disadvantage. Like the proverbial bull in the china shop, giant digital platforms are simply incapable of controlling how even their rational business decisions can have unanticipated and disastrous impacts on the small businesses dependent on them.</p><p>\"[Today,] I discuss important reforms Congress should consider to protect small businesses in cyberspace comparable to those they enjoy today in the physical world. While we must increase antitrust enforcement and improve antitrust law, we must also recognize the limits of antitrust law.\"</p><p>You may view the full testimony here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publicknowledge.org/documents/harold-feld-testimony-before-small-business-committee/\">https://www.publicknowledge.org/documents/harold-feld-testimony-before-small-business-committee/</url>).

Why? Americans don't think Silicon Valley is trustworthy enough to self-monitor and do the right thing.Americans want more regulations on companies like YouTube, Twitter and Google.Specifically, Americans look at stories like the Russia meddling of U.S. elections and the proliferation of so-called 'fake news,' and say: We need government to control this stuff. </p><p>Axios[1] has the story: A majority of Americans are now concerned that the government won't do enough to regulate how U.S. technology companies operate, according to an Axios-SurveyMonkey poll. Across the board, concern about government inaction is up significantly \u2014 15 percentage points \u2014 in the past three months. Why it matters: That's a seismic shift in the public's perception of Silicon Valley over a short period of time. It shows how worried Americans are about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but it also reflects a growing anxiety about the potentially addictive nature of some of the tech companies' products, as well as the relentless spread of fake news on their platforms. What's changed: In a previous Axios-SurveyMonkey poll in November, just after Facebook, Google and Twitter testified before Congress, only about four in 10 Americans were concerned that the government wouldn't do enough to regulate the tech companies. Now that number has jumped to 55%. Notably, 45% of Republicans \u2014 who are usually skeptical about government regulation \u2014 share the concern that government won't do enough. Independents showed the biggest shift with an increase of 20 percentage points. There's other bad news for the tech companies, too: More than eight in 10 \u2014 including big majorities across party lines \u2014 blame the technology companies for not doing more to safeguard their platforms against election interference. When asked whether social media does more to help promote democracy and free speech or does more to hurt democracy and free speech, most Americans (55%) now say social media does more to hurt democracy and free speech than it helps. The good news: There's no letup in the widespread public sentiment that technology has had a positive effect on society. More than seven out of 10 Americans share that view. And 82% say the success of U.S. tech companies has been good for the economy. The big picture: In response to growing scrutiny in Washington, major tech firms are leaning heavily on the consistent positive views of the tech industry. They often tout the fact that consumers love their free, innovative products that have become staples of every day life. But these numbers show that more people are trying to square their affinity for the companies' services with the downsides that have become so much more visible in the past year. As those concerns bubble up to policy makers, regulation of some sort \u2014 even in narrowly tailored areas \u2014 seems like less of a long shot than it did at the end of 2017. Methodology: The online survey was conducted by SurveyMonkey from February 21-23, 2018 among 3,574 adults in the United States. They were selected from the nearly 3 million people who take surveys on the SurveyMonkey platform each day. The modeled error estimate for the full sample is 2.5 percentage points.

Yet we must first get on the same page across the breadth of issues. That's what this report aspires to do,\" Earl J. Wilkinson says in report's foreword.</p><p>\"We hear the daily developments, we hear the country-by-country and commission-by-commission stories, but nobody to date has wrapped their arms around the issues - both good and bad,\" Wilkinson added in a statement to the Star.</p><p>The INMA initiative was overseen by a blue-ribbon committee consisting of Damian Eales of News Corp Australia, Espen Egil Hansen of Aftenposten/Schibsted, Maribel Perez Wadsworth of the USA Today Network/Gannett and John Boynton, Torstar president and CEO, and publisher of the Toronto Star.</p><p>Building on the survey, conducted last spring, the report is based on dozens of interviews and analyses of regulatory developments. The committee hopes it will provide a much-needed roadmap for publishers to navigate increasingly complex and integrated digital relationships.</p><p>\"We are an industry of local companies that can't act globally. But there is no geographical nuance in the issues we face,\" says Boynton. \"The issues we face in Canada are the issues that publishers face everywhere.\"</p><p>For example, the World Association of News publishers condemned Google in September for announcing that it will not pay publishers in France for search results as a result of a copyright law that comes into force this fall. The law means large platforms such as Facebook, Google and YouTube must pay for content beyond short extracts of work.</p><p>Google says, instead, they will block any results from European newspapers in France unless those papers grant free use of their content.</p><p>\"This stance is not only disrespectful of the French government, it is also against a law that will soon be applicable in the entire territory of the European Union,\" said the publishers' association in a statement.</p><p>Platforms aggregating, but not paying for content has also been a bone of contention for publishers globally. They have long been lobbying for more transparency in the algorithms that the digital giants use to determine what comes up high in a search.</p><p>At stake is the way countries around the world, including Canada access their information and culture. A lack of local news and investigative journalism means citizens are less informed about their world. And that has implications for democracy.</p><p>\"There needs to be more oversight by government because market forces won't be able to fix most of these issues,\" says Torstar's Boynton. \"That includes algorithms that determine what people see, whether it's Canadian or foreign content. It's something that ultimately determines what people's business models will be and which Canadian companies survive.\"</p><p>Whitehead, the former editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, says the public first started to really become conscious of the impact of big tech during the Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2018, where the British firm harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users to target in political advertising.</p><p>Since then, 2019 has been a watershed year for the number of investigations into big tech. The Canadian government's own inquiry and report due this January looks into updating outdated laws to regulate platforms.</p><p>Significantly for the publishing industry, lawmakers are also understanding the importance of quality journalism to democracy and are leading inquiries into the impact of the big platforms on news media.</p><p>\"News and journalism are different to many other commercial activities in that they benefit both the individual and also society as a whole,\" Australian Competition and Consumer Competition chair Rod Sims said in a report this year. \"It is vital that media businesses are not disadvantaged through the exercise of market power or other mechanisms that make it difficult for them to compete on their merits.\"</p><p>The U.S. News Media Alliance estimated that Google alone made $4.7 billion in 2018 from publishers through its search engine. Google has denied that figure, but there is no doubt that the search engine, along with Facebook, takes the lion's share of the digital advertising market.</p><p>\"The regulation of the digital platforms is bigger than one country or even a region such as Europe can effectively handle,\" says Whitehead. \"With so many countries setting up their own antitrust investigations, the plans to co-ordinate the regulator responses across their research efforts and prosecutions will prove critical.\"</p><p>INMA, which is not a lobby group, is trying to connect the dots not only for its 11,000 members at 700 news media companies in 70 countries, but also for the consumers of news.</p><p>\"I think finally people are starting to take notice and regulators are now seeing how important the issues are when it comes to the platforms,\" says Boynton. \"The public should rightfully be shocked at what's going on.\"</p><p>Based on the INMA survey, potential solutions to improving the publisher-platform relationship centre on three approaches:</p><p>Direct action by platforms, such as prioritizing subscription content and introducing mechanisms to distinguish quality journalism;</p><p>Changes in law where regulators would create a level playing field on a host of issues including taxation and copyright;</p><p>And solutions involving collective bargaining where publishers could negotiate with big platforms on payment for content.</p><p>But more research and work needs to be done, according to the report, which describes itself as a potential playbook to help publishers turn their \"wish lists into action.\"</p><p>\"Ideally, we hope that we can work things out and co-exist together and that it's mutually beneficial,\" says Boynton. &amp;#8220;I'm hoping that someone realizes within the big platforms that in the long term the best play is to have a business relationship with publishers that is ultimately good for both sides.\"</p><p>Over the next week, the Star will outline, in more detail, seven key issues identified in How to Decode the Publisher-Platform Relationship as the most concerning to publishers.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

Yet we must first get on the same page across the breadth of issues. That's what this report aspires to do,\" Earl J. Wilkinson says in report's foreword.</p><p>\"We hear the daily developments, we hear the country-by-country and commission-by-commission stories, but nobody to date has wrapped their arms around the issues - both good and bad,\" Wilkinson added in a statement to the Star.</p><p>The INMA initiative was overseen by a blue-ribbon committee consisting of Damian Eales of News Corp Australia, Espen Egil Hansen of Aftenposten/Schibsted, Maribel Perez Wadsworth of the USA Today Network/Gannett and John Boynton, Torstar president and CEO, and publisher of the Toronto Star.</p><p>Building on the survey, conducted last spring, the report is based on dozens of interviews and analyses of regulatory developments. The committee hopes it will provide a much-needed roadmap for publishers to navigate increasingly complex and integrated digital relationships.</p><p>\"We are an industry of local companies that can't act globally. But there is no geographical nuance in the issues we face,\" says Boynton. \"The issues we face in Canada are the issues that publishers face everywhere.\"</p><p>For example, the World Association of News publishers condemned Google in September for announcing that it will not pay publishers in France for search results as a result of a copyright law that comes into force this fall. The law means large platforms such as Facebook, Google and YouTube must pay for content beyond short extracts of work.</p><p>Google says, instead, they will block any results from European newspapers in France unless those papers grant free use of their content.</p><p>\"This stance is not only disrespectful of the French government, it is also against a law that will soon be applicable in the entire territory of the European Union,\" said the publishers' association in a statement.</p><p>Platforms aggregating, but not paying for content has also been a bone of contention for publishers globally. They have long been lobbying for more transparency in the algorithms that the digital giants use to determine what comes up high in a search.</p><p>At stake is the way countries around the world, including Canada access their information and culture. A lack of local news and investigative journalism means citizens are less informed about their world. And that has implications for democracy.</p><p>\"There needs to be more oversight by government because market forces won't be able to fix most of these issues,\" says Torstar's Boynton. \"That includes algorithms that determine what people see, whether it's Canadian or foreign content. It's something that ultimately determines what people's business models will be and which Canadian companies survive.\"</p><p>Whitehead, the former editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, says the public first started to really become conscious of the impact of big tech during the Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2018, where the British firm harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users to target in political advertising.</p><p>Since then, 2019 has been a watershed year for the number of investigations into big tech. The Canadian government's own inquiry and report due this January looks into updating outdated laws to regulate platforms.</p><p>Significantly for the publishing industry, lawmakers are also understanding the importance of quality journalism to democracy and are leading inquiries into the impact of the big platforms on news media.</p><p>\"News and journalism are different to many other commercial activities in that they benefit both the individual and also society as a whole,\" Australian Competition and Consumer Competition chair Rod Sims said in a report this year. \"It is vital that media businesses are not disadvantaged through the exercise of market power or other mechanisms that make it difficult for them to compete on their merits.\"</p><p>The U.S. News Media Alliance estimated that Google alone made $4.7 billion in 2018 from publishers through its search engine. Google has denied that figure, but there is no doubt that the search engine, along with Facebook, takes the lion's share of the digital advertising market.</p><p>\"The regulation of the digital platforms is bigger than one country or even a region such as Europe can effectively handle,\" says Whitehead. \"With so many countries setting up their own antitrust investigations, the plans to co-ordinate the regulator responses across their research efforts and prosecutions will prove critical.\"</p><p>INMA, which is not a lobby group, is trying to connect the dots not only for its 11,000 members at 700 news media companies in 70 countries, but also for the consumers of news.</p><p>\"I think finally people are starting to take notice and regulators are now seeing how important the issues are when it comes to the platforms,\" says Boynton. \"The public should rightfully be shocked at what's going on.\"</p><p>Based on the INMA survey, potential solutions to improving the publisher-platform relationship centre on three approaches:</p><p>Direct action by platforms, such as prioritizing subscription content and introducing mechanisms to distinguish quality journalism;</p><p>Changes in law where regulators would create a level playing field on a host of issues including taxation and copyright;</p><p>And solutions involving collective bargaining where publishers could negotiate with big platforms on payment for content.</p><p>But more research and work needs to be done, according to the report, which describes itself as a potential playbook to help publishers turn their \"wish lists into action.\"</p><p>\"Ideally, we hope that we can work things out and co-exist together and that it's mutually beneficial,\" says Boynton. \"I'm hoping that someone realizes within the big platforms that in the long term the best play is to have a business relationship with publishers that is ultimately good for both sides.\"</p><p>Over the next week, the Star will outline, in more detail, seven key issues identified in How to Decode the Publisher-Platform Relationship as the most concerning to publishers.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

Yet we must first get on the same page across the breadth of issues. That's what this report aspires to do,\" Earl J. Wilkinson says in report's foreword.</p><p>\"We hear the daily developments, we hear the country-by-country and commission-by-commission stories, but nobody to date has wrapped their arms around the issues - both good and bad,\" Wilkinson added in a statement to the Star.</p><p>The INMA initiative was overseen by a blue-ribbon committee consisting of Damian Eales of News Corp Australia, Espen Egil Hansen of Aftenposten/Schibsted, Maribel Perez Wadsworth of the USA Today Network/Gannett and John Boynton, Torstar president and CEO, and publisher of the Toronto Star.</p><p>Building on the survey, conducted last spring, the report is based on dozens of interviews and analyses of regulatory developments. The committee hopes it will provide a much-needed roadmap for publishers to navigate increasingly complex and integrated digital relationships.</p><p>\"We are an industry of local companies that can't act globally. But there is no geographical nuance in the issues we face,\" says Boynton. \"The issues we face in Canada are the issues that publishers face everywhere.\"</p><p>For example, the World Association of News publishers condemned Google in September for announcing that it will not pay publishers in France for search results as a result of a copyright law that comes into force this fall. The law means large platforms such as Facebook, Google and YouTube must pay for content beyond short extracts of work.</p><p>Google says, instead, they will block any results from European newspapers in France unless those papers grant free use of their content.</p><p>\"This stance is not only disrespectful of the French government, it is also against a law that will soon be applicable in the entire territory of the European Union,\" said the publishers' association in a statement.</p><p>Platforms aggregating, but not paying for content has also been a bone of contention for publishers globally. They have long been lobbying for more transparency in the algorithms that the digital giants use to determine what comes up high in a search.</p><p>At stake is the way countries around the world, including Canada access their information and culture. A lack of local news and investigative journalism means citizens are less informed about their world. And that has implications for democracy.</p><p>\"There needs to be more oversight by government because market forces won't be able to fix most of these issues,\" says Torstar's Boynton. \"That includes algorithms that determine what people see, whether it's Canadian or foreign content. It's something that ultimately determines what people's business models will be and which Canadian companies survive.\"</p><p>Whitehead, the former editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, says the public first started to really become conscious of the impact of big tech during the Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2018, where the British firm harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users to target in political advertising.</p><p>Since then, 2019 has been a watershed year for the number of investigations into big tech. The Canadian government's own inquiry and report due this January looks into updating outdated laws to regulate platforms.</p><p>Significantly for the publishing industry, lawmakers are also understanding the importance of quality journalism to democracy and are leading inquiries into the impact of the big platforms on news media.</p><p>\"News and journalism are different to many other commercial activities in that they benefit both the individual and also society as a whole,\" Australian Competition and Consumer Competition chair Rod Sims said in a report this year. \"It is vital that media businesses are not disadvantaged through the exercise of market power or other mechanisms that make it difficult for them to compete on their merits.\"</p><p>The U.S. News Media Alliance estimated that Google alone made $4.7 billion in 2018 from publishers through its search engine. Google has denied that figure, but there is no doubt that the search engine, along with Facebook, takes the lion's share of the digital advertising market.</p><p>\"The regulation of the digital platforms is bigger than one country or even a region such as Europe can effectively handle,\" says Whitehead. \"With so many countries setting up their own antitrust investigations, the plans to co-ordinate the regulator responses across their research efforts and prosecutions will prove critical.\"</p><p>INMA, which is not a lobby group, is trying to connect the dots not only for its 11,000 members at 700 news media companies in 70 countries, but also for the consumers of news.</p><p>\"I think finally people are starting to take notice and regulators are now seeing how important the issues are when it comes to the platforms,\" says Boynton. \"The public should rightfully be shocked at what's going on.\"</p><p>Based on the INMA survey, potential solutions to improving the publisher-platform relationship centre on three approaches:</p><p>Direct action by platforms, such as prioritizing subscription content and introducing mechanisms to distinguish quality journalism;</p><p>Changes in law where regulators would create a level playing field on a host of issues including taxation and copyright;</p><p>And solutions involving collective bargaining where publishers could negotiate with big platforms on payment for content.</p><p>But more research and work needs to be done, according to the report, which describes itself as a potential playbook to help publishers turn their \"wish lists into action.\"</p><p>\"Ideally, we hope that we can work things out and co-exist together and that it's mutually beneficial,\" says Boynton. \"I'm hoping that someone realizes within the big platforms that in the long term the best play is to have a business relationship with publishers that is ultimately good for both sides.\"</p><p>Over the next week, the Star will outline, in more detail, seven key issues identified in How to Decode the Publisher-Platform Relationship as the most concerning to publishers.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

Policymakers around the world, including India, are looking into making fairer rules and changing the system</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, a study by Virginia-headquartered industry association for newspapers, the News Media Alliance (NMA), estimated that Google may have earned approximately $4.7 billion in 2018 in search advertising revenue through links to news content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That number was significant. It brought into sharper focus questions on internet giants' business practices, not just in the US and Europe, but also Australia and India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the heart of the tension between publishers and Big Tech \u2014 a term used to describe large technology companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, among others \u2014 is control over content, including news, distribution and monetisation, especially through the advertising technology (ad tech) stacks Big Tech currently owns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google, some publishers say, owns the entire supply (and demand) chain for ad tech, and they structure it in a way that disincentivises companies from working with any third-party products.</p><p>The company disagrees. \u201cThere is a significant amount of technology disruption right now,\u201d says Kate Bedoe, Google's head of news partnerships in Asia-Pacific, in a telephonic interaction with ET. \u201cOur own products are better when there is a vibrant, healthy and thriving ecosystem, and that's why we launched our Digital News Initiative. We structure our relationship in a way that we do better when news does better. We make money and grow when news makes money and grows.\u201d</p><p>She adds, \u201cThere is a lot of complexity (in Google's advertising practices), but the fundamentals haven't changed. There is a marketplace or an exchange that happens between advertisers and audiences. Our role is really as a technology provider to facilitate that in a digital environment.\u201d Facebook did not respond to ET's questions.</p><p>These practices, publishers say, are central to Big Tech cornering a lion's share \u2014 52.1% in 2019, according to an estimate by market research company eMarketer \u2014 of the $130-billion digital advertising business in the US, and its similar dominance elsewhere.</p><p>In India, the 'duopoly' of digital advertising \u2014 Google and Facebook \u2014 has a combined market share of 68%, as per a 2018 SeekingAlpha report. Indian digital advertising business, a January 2019 report by Dentsu Aegis Network says, will reach $3.6 billion (?24,920 crore) by 2021, growing at a CAGR of 31.96%.</p><p>\u201cNever before in the world \u2014through no company, government or group of governments \u2013 has power and control been concentrated in the hands of a single company\u2026 (No one) has control over the world as Google has,\u201d says Anant Goenka, executive director, Indian Express group. He's also in charge of the company's digital division. \u201cThey not just control the demand and supply, but also the marketplace. Today, no matter which business you are in, you have to build your business keeping Google in mind,\u201d says Goenka.</p><p>The Economic Times competes with The Financial Express, also part of the Indian Express group.</p><p>The end result is the sheer dominance of two companies \u2014 more Google than Facebook \u2014 in the search and advertising market, partly due to network effects, which, in turn, create high entry barriers, as the European Commission noted in 2017.</p><p>While announcing a \u20ac4.2-billion fine on Google in 2018 for abusing its dominance in the search engine market, European Commission wrote, \u201cThe more consumers use a search engine, the more attractive it becomes to advertisers. Profits generated can then be used to attract even more consumers. Similarly, the data a search engine gathers about consumers can, in turn, be used to improve results.\u201d</p><p>Two questions are critical. How does this dominance work? What can be done to create a fairer market?</p><p>Understanding Google's ad tech stack is a complex exercise. There are three areas of concern around Google's control of this supply chain, according to various publishers ET spoke to as part of research for this story. They requested strict anonymity, as they are not authorised to speak to the media.</p><p>First, attribution. In order to target ads with Google (and the same applies to Facebook as well), an app must use their software development kits (SDKs).When an advertiser measures performance, Google and Facebook analytics tools will tell them how many \u201cconversions\u201d (or, installs) come from their ads on Big Tech platforms.</p><p>However, in case a user clicks on more than one ad before converting, Google counts that as a conversion by it alone, as per its policies. For instance, a user sees an ad from Google to download a streaming app. He clicks on the app but doesn't download it. Two weeks later, the user sees another ad, say on The Times of India website, which says \u201cWatch IPL\u201d on this streaming app. If the user now clicks and downloads the app, Google's ad tools, used by most advertising buyers, credit the conversion to Google and not The Times of India.</p><p>The Times of India website is published by Times Internet Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bennett Coleman and Company Ltd, which also owns The Economic Times.</p><p>\u201cGoogle and Facebook have built their attribution tools in a way that favours their own ad platforms,\u201d says a publisher aware of how Google's ad stack works. The publisher explains, \u201cAttribution is the means through which money earned from the advertiser is fairly and judiciously shared between various advertising platforms that have contributed to the sale/advertiser's goal. Unfortunately, in the ad tech ecosystem, there have been systematic efforts from Google (and Facebook) to almost disable attribution, that is, nobody else can attribute other than them.\u201d</p><p>Naveen Tewari, cofounder and chief executive, InMobi group, says, \u201cFrom the advertisers' point of view, the industry thrives because of them. They are the ones who write the cheque, which becomes revenue for downstream participants in the industry. Advertisers spend their money not only on walled gardens such as Google or Facebook but also on other platforms such as InMobi.\u201d</p><p>He adds, \u201cHowever, despite fueling the industry, advertisers don't have a complete and accurate view of the customer because of a lack of access to data. This is mainly because walled gardens are able to use their scale and control of data, to attribute the success of the platform to themselves.\u201d In a way, Tewari explains, this is similar to football, where the goalkeeper could have made the initial move in a goal-scoring effort with many players in between, but it is the striker who gets the credit. \u201cOnly when one has a view of the complete move, does one get the accurate picture,\u201d he adds.</p><p>The second area of concern is interconnectivity of Google's ad tech products. In the ad tech ecosystem, the advertising buyer and publisher are represented by publisher-side and demandside platforms. The market dynamics between these essentially dictates how open and free the market is.</p><p>However, Google, publishers say, supplies both sides of the spectrum. DoubleClick (the server that manages the process of delivering ads to websites or apps) and integrated AdX (Google's programmatic ad exchange where people bid for ads) are tools for publishers to run ads and monetise their inventory.</p><p>This fact was incidentally noted by News Corp in its submissions to Australia's competition commission in March. It wrote, \u201cSince Google's integrated ad tech services operate along the entire ad tech supply chain, and on both advertiser and publisher sides of the market, it creates the potential for anti-competitive conduct; for example, there have been allegations that Google is manipulating DoubleClick to favour its own ad intermediation services.\u201d</p><p>All third parties, in essence, are dependent on Google, as the entire chain \u2014 analytics, search and ad platforms \u2014 is owned by Google.</p><p>The publisher quoted earlier in the story adds, \u201cCurrently, there exists opacity and bias in how publisher-side solutions (provided by Google) operate with Google's advertiser-side platforms. This is inherently anti-competitive, as it does not allow third-party solution providers to have the same ease of integration and efficiency with publishers who use Google's advertising ecosystem.\u201d</p><p>Equally, third-party advertising networks get secondary access to inventory on AdX. In effect, as the publisher explains, Google tells publishers to \u201cdeploy the AdX unit to get revenues and while it allows you to intermediate other networks, AdX takes the best inventory and gives secondary inventory to other companies.\u201d TIL also owns and runs Columbia, a leading ad network in Asia-Pacific.</p><p>Google, Tewari feels, has to open its stack up to create a level playing field. \u201cEvery publisher ends up having their stack and therefore, there are challenges because it is not open and also, the dominance they're doing from so many different directions is a challenge,\u201d he says, before adding, \u201cIt's not just us. The publishers face it, the advertisers face it, and platforms like us are facing it.\u201d</p><p>The fundamental issue, those from the platform side such as Tewari feel, is around data. \u201cBasically, that means they don't let the data leave them. They're not letting you become smarter as much as you should \u2014 it's like what happened on your platform is with them (Google and Facebook) and not with you. So, you are not able to utilise all of it.\u201d</p><p>PUBLISHER OR NOT?</p><p>Third, Google is also one of the largest publishers online, though it refuses to call itself one.</p><p>It has sites like Google.com, YouTube and Gmail, all of which sell banner ads. But the question is if these Google-owned sites get preferential access or \u201cself-preference\u201d to its advertising solutions over other exchanges and sell-side platforms, given the size of these sites and the market share of the advertising solutions.</p><p>The publisher quoted above says, \u201cThis preferred access to Google-owned sites gives an unfair advantage to advertising solutions as they now have much larger scales and user understanding, as these solutions track their behaviour on these large sites.\u201d</p><p>The company is even slowly controlling the demand chain for content, especially in India, where they're publishing content themselves \u2014 election results, cricket scores and stock market updates. \u201cGoogle needs to stop getting into every avenue available,\u201d says Goenka, before adding, \u201cNow having learnt user behaviour, it is becoming a publisher and competing by selling its own ads, ending up controlling who gets to see those ads. It's the last piece in their puzzle.\u201d</p><p>Google's Bedoe, however, says that first and foremost, Google is a technology company, \u201cand most importantly, a very user-centric technology company.\u201d</p><p>She adds, \u201cOur job is to make sure users get the answers to the questions they have from the most trusted and authoritative sources, as quickly as possible. There are quick, fact-based answers to some questions \u2014 like \u201cWhat is the temperature?\u201d or \u201cWhat is the score?\u201d but the news is not just quick fact-based answers but about who, what, why and how \u2014 and that is what makes one trust a news organisation over another.\u201d</p><p>In a statement, a spokesperson for TIL said, \u201cInnovation is at the heart of the digital economy and our ecosystem thrives most in an environment that encourages competition. As digital advertising becomes a critical form of marketing, there should be transparency and neutrality on the platforms that connect buyers and sellers, so the best offerings get a fair chance of succeeding.\u201d</p><p>REGULATION OF DIGITAL ADVERTISING?</p><p>Executives from the digital advertising industry say the time has come for regulation on the lines of traditional advertising, with a monitoring mechanism in place.</p><p>\u201cDigital advertising is run using old rules. India has not done much around digital ad regulation and that's not helping the industry at large,\u201d said Jessie Paul, chief executive, Paul Writer Strategic Advisory, a Bengaluru-based marketing advisory firm.</p><p>Tewari of InMobi group adds, \u201cWalled gardens thrive because they are not only able to control the data they generate but are able to do it at scale. However, this data really belongs to consumers. I firmly believe regulators need to step in and provide a framework that lets consumers own their data and be in control of who, meaning platforms, they want to share the data with.\u201d</p><p>Besides, those like Tarun Wadhwa, chief executive of strategy and advisory firm Day One Insights, feel there is also a need for Google to be more transparent. \u201cGoogle has massive tentacles across the Web. Google and Facebook store user data. They have advantages and they are years ahead,\u201d he says, before adding, \u201cHow Google ranks pages, information, connects with users and gets ads is done via an opaque algorithm. They extract power and money from their software tools.\u201d</p><p>Paul adds, \u201cThere's no transparent way to verify you are getting what you were promised. Most advertising is based on platform providers' tools and these are not shared; neither do they encourage third-party tools. There's a need for a strong mechanism to monitor advertising.\u201d</p><p>But beyond calls for the regulation of digital advertising, publishers such as The Indian Express' Goenka feel that if nothing else, Google should \u201cincrease the proportion of revenue that goes to the end publisher.\u201d Equally, he believes Google must pay for all data that the publisher is giving the Google marketplace. \u201cFor instance, I have a price comparison story on Express Drive, saying which car to buy \u2014 a Hyundai i10 or a Maruti Swift \u2014 the Google ad network serves him ads of both cars wherever he goes. That is based on user behaviour on the publisher's end. Why should they not pay us for the data generated by us?\u201d</p><p>The fact of the matter, Goenka adds, is that Google was just \u201csmarter than anyone else in investing resources in building a digital advertising ecosystem, but it also stands to lose if the publisher ecosystem diminishes.\u201d</p><p>He says, \u201cAs publishers, we create content that has engagement. With the sheer volume of content the top 5 publishers in India create \u2014 around 800 URLs a day each (4,200 new URLs/day collectively) \u2014 even if half the number is duplicated, nearly 2,000-2,500 new pieces of content are being created every day by publishers who control 50% of the market.\u201d</p><p>Realistically, publishers say they are merely seeking a \u201clevel playing field\u201d so the digital advertising ecosystem doesn't end up becoming a monopoly.</p><p>The publisher quoted earlier feels there is a need for both Google and Facebook to expose impression-level data or smart data (how many times the ad has been served and seen, who saw the ads, etc) to third-party platforms and decouple it from the Google stack, besides making it available for all players in the ad tech ecosystem. \u201cCurrently, this is clearly an unfair environment for other players to exist. Without other options, this could lead to the global advertising industry quickly becoming a single option monopoly,\u201d he says, adding that Google must also ensure all privileges it provides to its own products and platforms are equally provided to other advertising solutions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTEP-0_4_24072019002001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMX-HDK1-JB3N-T3TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382887</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

It\u2019s the companion to a House bill that Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline and Georgia Republican Doug Collins introduced this spring.</p><p> \u201cAt the heart of this bill is helping newspapers survive amid shrinking circulations and massive layoffs,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement. \u201cGoogle and Facebook now control the news kingdom. They\u2019ve pitted themselves against newspapers in a David-and-Goliath battle in which newspapers don\u2019t have a stone to throw much less a slingshot to put it in. The readers are the true losers as newsrooms empty out across this country. Google and Facebook aren\u2019t just companies. They\u2019re countries. We can\u2019t allow them to bully newspapers out of business.\u201d</p><p> Klobuchar added that \u201cwithout honest and trusted journalists reporting around the world and here at home, what is out of sight truly becomes out of mind \u2014 but we\u2019re seeing more and more independent and local news outlets close as \u2018fake news\u2019 rises. It\u2019s more important than ever that we protect the free press and establish an even playing field for negotiation with online platforms. Our bipartisan legislation will improve the quality and accessibility of reporting and ensure that journalists are able to continue their critical work.\u201d</p><p> Though the news publishers lobby faces major hurdles to turning the legislation into law, the effort is part of a larger campaign to make the group, known until 2016 as the Newspaper Association of America, relevant in an age when most people get their news on screens, not on newsprint.</p><p> David Chavern, a longtime K Street insider formerly with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, took over the group in late 2015 and has set about a transformation.</p><p> \u201cI have worked hard to basically change everything about the organization that can be changed and to reorient it to really try to fight for a digital future for news publishing,\u201d Chavern said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a better deal from the platforms if we hope to survive.\u201d</p><p> The platforms are primarily Google, Facebook and other big technology companies.</p><p> If lobbying revenue is any indication, it\u2019s an unfair fight.</p><p> The News Media Alliance reported spending about $385,000 on federal lobbying during the first three months of this year, while Google and Facebook both disclosed shelling out nearly $3.4 million in the same period. In all of last year, the alliance spent $1.8 million on federal lobbying, according to congressional lobbying disclosures. Google reported $21.2 million for 2018, while Facebook dished out $12.6 million.</p><p> A Google spokeswoman declined comment. A Facebook spokesman did not provide comment.</p><p> But a blog post by the Computer and Communications Industry Association stated in response to the idea: \u201cAntitrust exemptions are rarely granted because consumers lose when competitors collude.\u201d</p><p> The CCIA added in its post that while the News Media Alliance \u201cargues that leading tech services are unfairly competing as a \u2018duopoly,\u2019 ... experts at the Technology Policy Institute and The Adam Smith Institute, among others, have argued newspaper publishers must adapt to changing markets, not collude.\u201d</p><p> Chavern said his team circulated draft legislation in the last Congress, making a case for legislative intervention. While the government can\u2019t regulate the news media, he said, big tech companies somewhat do by controlling the distribution, the ad revenue and data on readers.</p><p> Michael Klingensmith, publisher and CEO of the Star Tribune Media Co. in Minneapolis, said he\u2019s been involved in the association for 10 years and credits Chavern with bringing together a disparate collection of news executives.</p><p> \u201cWe really have sort of coalesced around this issue of being able to more effectively deal with the big platform companies like Google and Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we all have in common.\u201d</p><p> The House and Senate legislation would give news publishers a temporary 48-month reprieve from existing antitrust laws, allowing them to band together to negotiate.</p><p> \u201cWe\u2019ll take what we can get,\u201d Klingensmith said, adding it should be long enough to make a difference.</p><p> Chavern, who said four years should be long enough to build a longer-term and sustainable business of online news, expects to testify at a forthcoming hearing in the House Judiciary panel\u2019s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, which Cicilline chairs.</p><p> \u201cThis bill will provide a much-needed lifeline to local publishers who have been crushed by Google and Facebook,\u201d Cicilline said about his bill in a news release.</p><p> As for the News Media Alliance, Chavern said that in addition to changing its name, he\u2019s also upped the focus on lobbying and advocacy. The alliance also launched a political action committee, which donated less than $1,000 in the 2018 election cycle to Collins, a sponsor of the House measure, according to federal election records.</p><p> The alliance\u2019s revenue has declined in recent years to $7.3 million, according to the group\u2019s 2017 IRS Form 990, from $8.4 million in its 2015 Form 990. But its total assets were up to $22.5 million in the 2017 disclosure from about $20.7 million in 2015 one.</p><p> \u201cWe\u2019ve become much sharper edged,\u201d Chavern said.</p><p> That\u2019s not unique to the news lobby, either. The trade association sector itself is in the throes of disruption as members flee and groups consolidate.</p><p> \u201cThe News Media Alliance as a trade association is no different than any other trade association in Washington, in 2019,\u201d K Street headhunter Ivan Adler said. \u201cThey must focus on bringing value to their members, otherwise they will become irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>     CQ Roll Call is not a member of the News Media Alliance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SWTREC-4504820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SWTREC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9H-1PB1-JBCN-40M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1012\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Stephens Media Group, LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

South Korea says it was a new type of missile and poses a military threat.</p><p>Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. This is EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: Good morning. Good morning to all of you. I'm Dave Briggs. Thursday, July 25th. 4:00 a.m. right here in New York and in Puerto Rico, and that's where we begin this morning, with breaking news overnight.</p><p>Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello announcing he will resign.</p><p>That set off wild celebrations in the streets of San Juan. The embattled governor releasing a video confirming he will step down on August 2nd.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. RICARDO ROSSELLO, PUERTO RICO (through translator): Despite having the mandate of the people who elected me democratically, today I feel that remaining in this position represents a difficulty to continue the success that's been reached.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: The streets of the capital have been jammed with protesters for days. Puerto Ricans demanding Rossello leave office over a series of leaked group chats that included homophobic and sexist language and joked about Hurricane Maria victims.</p><p>We get more this morning from Rafael Romo in San Juan.</p><p>RAFAEL ROOM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: David, Christine, an explosion of joy, singing, shouting, dancing people here in old San Juan after they learned Governor Ricardo Rossello will be resigning his position effective August 2nd at 5:00 in the afternoon.</p><p>You can see how people have been celebrating after they heard the news and the reality is that they have been here protesting on a daily basis for the last 12 days because they said they have lost all trust in their governor and the reality is that Governor Ricardo Rossello didn't really have too many options.</p><p>He was facing what would have been a very embarrassing impeachment process. He had already lost many members of his cabinet and it was becoming very difficult for him to govern the island. In announcing his resignation he said that he had dedicated all his time in the governor's office to help the people of Puerto Rico especially when two hurricanes hit the island in 2017, that he had also worked for women's rights and also to improve the financial situation of the island, but the reality was that there was not a whole lot that the governor could do to convince these people that he should stay as governor of Puerto Rico.</p><p>Dave and Christine, back to you.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK. Terrific reporting there.</p><p>Now to the nation's capital and the Mueller hearing. A lot of tense moments, but not much to change any minds. During Robert Mueller's appearance on Capitol Hill. But above all the impeachment talk, the political spin and legal battles, the special counsel's most important message was clear. Russia interfered and the Trump campaign did not refuse the help. Moscow is still trying to influence American democracy and Americans should be aware and concerned.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MUELLER: It wasn't a single attempt. They're doing it as we sit here and they expect to do it during the next campaign. I hope this does not become the new normal, but I fear it is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: House Democrats now plotting their next move. In a closed- door meeting last night, they pressed leadership about impeachment. Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants to let the legal battles play out but she says she is open to more detailed talks about impeachment, something she has resisted so far.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You've said that there is no point in moving part with an impeachment inquiry because Republicans control the Senate. It's going to die in the Senate. Is that no longer your chief concern?</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I have never longed said that. If we have a case for impeachment, that's the place we will have to go. The fact that why I'd like it to be a strong case is because I don't -- is based on the facts. The stronger our case is, the worst the Senate will look for just letting the president off the hook.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[04:05:03] ROMANS: CNN legal analyst Laura Coates says House Democrats already have the information they need to move on impeachment if they choose.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURA COATES, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Let's just say it, the book was better than the movie today, OK? We all agree. It was better than the movie, but now we're putting form over substance. It was already there. All the information you would need to actually bring it to life, it's already in the actual report. The idea of kicking the can down the road to say, hey, will this be enough now? Essentially it's like a \"Wizard of Oz\" moment here, ladies and gentlemen. You already had the power to go home all along, Congress. Are you going to exercise it or are you not?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: That's good.</p><p>BRIGGS: That's good.</p><p>ROMANS: In his hours of testimony Mueller rarely took the bait from Democrats, but he did have some damaging things to say about President Trump. He reiterated, contrary to the president's claims, Mr. Trump was never exonerated.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): So the report did not conclude that he did not commit obstruction of justice, is that correct?</p><p>MUELLER: That is correct.</p><p>NADLER: And what about total exoneration? Did you actually totally exonerate the president?</p><p>MUELLER: No.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Mueller essentially said the president lied in some of his written answers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. VAL DEMINGS (D-FL): Director Mueller, isn't it fair to say that the president's written answers were not only inadequate and incomplete because he didn't answer many of your questions but where he did his answers showed that he wasn't always been truthful?</p><p>MUELLER: There -- I would say generally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: The special counsel also objected to the candidate Trump welcoming help from WikiLeaks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL): \"This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove,\" Donald Trump, October 31st, 2016. \"Boy, I love reading those WikiLeaks,\" Donald Trump, November 4th, 2016.</p><p>How do you react to that?</p><p>MUELLER: Well, it's -- problematic is an understatement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: For weeks Democrats argued that having Mueller testify on camera would bring his dry 448-page report to life. Instead there was an awful lot of this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MUELLER: I direct you to the report. I rely on the report. I send you back to the report. I can't beyond what's in the report. I am not going to get into that. I can't get into the discussions on that. I can't get into it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Mueller deferred or declined to answer questions 206 times. That performance had President Trump declaring victory.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATE: I think Robert Mueller did a horrible job, both today and with respect to the investigation. The Democrats lost so big today. Their party is in shambles right now. They are a mess. This was a devastating day for the Democrats.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: \"INSIDE POLITICS\" anchor John King explains why Trump was so confident.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR, INSIDE POLITICS: I think he's happy today because you do not have that viral movie trailer moment of Robert Mueller looking directly into a camera and saying something in 15 or 20 seconds that the Democrats can spread around the world about there's a case for you to impeach or I would have, you know, indicted if I could have but I was stuck. He didn't say any of those things.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: CNN's Marshal Cohen now joining us live from Washington.</p><p>Nobody knows the Russia investigation better.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: Good to see you on this day, sir.</p><p>MARSHAL COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.</p><p>BRIGGS: Look, obviously the book is often better than the movie, as Christine Romans often tells me. They didn't need a blockbuster movie, Marshal. They simply needed an audio book. Why was Robert Mueller unwilling to provide that?</p><p>COHEN: We've been wondering that basically since his very first answer yesterday. You take a look at his style, his record, the culture clash there that was on the stage, right? Where you've got someone from a different generation with an honor code. When the Justice Department told him, don't talk about this, don't talk about that, and he basically said, OK. Whatever you want. Even though time and time again he refused to answer questions that he could have answered.</p><p>There were times when he said. I'm not going to tell you. I'm not going to say that. And then we just opened up the report and found the information right in there. So it's not like there was a legal basis to some of this. I think a lot of it comes down to his style and his unwillingness to become that made-for-TV political campaign ad.</p><p>BRIGGS: He was unwilling to read his own report as Ted Lieu tried to press him, just simply read one sentence. It wasn't just style, it was substance. He did not want to provide anything.</p><p>ROMANS: This is a guy who -- I mean, his 88 previous appearances, you know, on Capitol Hill, and we had a mashup of them yesterday. He's not the kind of guy who falls for the optics.</p><p>BRIGGS: No.</p><p>ROMANS: He just isn't. That's not his style, right?</p><p>[04:10:02] COHEN: It's sort of the opposite of the grandstander. You know, we saw a lot of grandstanding in hearings --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>COHEN: -- over the years about 2016 and 2016 candidates. It was -- I don't know exactly what the opposite of a grandstander is but that was yesterday. And also at times he seemed frankly a bit unfamiliar with his 448-page report. His aides were routinely pointing him in the right direction of what to look at. He asked lawmakers to repeat their questions many, many times throughout the day and he didn't seem to have that, you know, ability to have that recall of obscure things in the report that you generally might expect from the author of the report.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes. That's what I thought stood out. You have a more in- depth knowledge of these 448 pages than seemingly the author of this report, but let's move on to the impact of this and is the impeachment movement dead? Everyone seemingly said, yes, it has to be dead. But then Jackie Speier from California said this late last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JACKIE SPEIER (D-CA): I think that the speaker is softening to the idea of an impeachment inquiry to begin. I don't know that the numbers of members are at a critical mass yet, but I do think it's growing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Growing? Did they see a different hearing than the rest of the country?</p><p>COHEN: I'm not sure that a single lawmaker came out in support. I haven't totally been keeping track of all the numbers.</p><p>ROMANS: Sure.</p><p>COHEN: But I haven't -- if you're looking for a flood gate opening, that didn't happen. Democrats, by the latest count, they'd still need to double and then some.</p><p>BRIGGS: Right.</p><p>COHEN: The number of Democrats who support impeachment, forget about the Republicans. They have a long, long way to go on that front, but maybe in Speaker Pelosi's eyes this was more of a box checking procedure.</p><p>ROMANS: Sure.</p><p>COHEN: You can't possibly support impeachment before you hear from the special counsel even though he gave us somewhat lackluster and shaky performance at times. Maybe for the speaker it was just a box checked that now they can move onto the next fight and they've got more fights.</p><p>ROMANS: Well, and there's -- I mean, there's an election. I mean, if Democrats really believe that they have a constitutional obligation to impeach Trump, if they really believe that he obstructed justice, you're running out of time, right? Because you've got an election. Or you believe that you go to -- let the voters decide what they really think about the whole process.</p><p>COHEN: Right. That's kind of the James Comey position, right? He always said, don't impeach him. Beat him at the ballot box. You know, there's probably a lot of Democrats that think you can do both, frankly. The Republicans tried to impeach Bill Clinton.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>COHEN: In 1998, 1999 --</p><p>ROMANS: Also in a very good economy.</p><p>COHEN: In a great economy and then the Republicans won the presidency a year later. So they didn't seem to suffer any major consequences for that impeachment.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>COHEN: You know, for the people -- for the Democrats out there that want this, they're probably shaking their heads saying look, it's in the report, there is damning evidence in the report. It's true. But the optics didn't really tell you that yesterday.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right. Let's get to the substance when you come back in about 20 minutes and ask you about ongoing Russian interference.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: Perhaps the most important part of yesterday's hearings.</p><p>Marshall, see you in just a bit.</p><p>COHEN: You bet.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, breaking news from just moments ago from Sweden. American rapper ASAP Rocky is being charged with assault following a confrontation in Stockholm last month. Swedish prosecutors say the rapper who has been detained since July 3rd will remain in custody until the trial. Various celebrities and President Trump have called for his release. The president told Sweden's prime minister he would personally vouch for the rapper's bail or an alternative. A spokesman says Mr. Trump was told the Swedish government will not try to influence the judicial process. By the way, Sweden has no bail system.</p><p>BRIGGS: A historic heat wave coming up. We'll talk about it in Europe. Triple-digit temperatures, even threatening the fire-damaged roof of the cathedral at Notre Dame.</p><p>[04:18:48] ROMANS: Welcome back. Tension on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea firing two projectiles as uncertainty grows over the future of nuclear talks between the United States and the Kim regime.</p><p>Will Ripley is tracking the latest developments live from CNN Center for us -- Will.</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Christine, this is the latest chapter in what we've seen as this kind of selective escalations on the part of the North Korean, I believe, to try to get the attention of President Trump at a time that diplomacy has once again stalled.</p><p>Remember back in May North Korea launched a couple of short-range missiles. Now they've launched a couple of more what South Korea believes are a new type of short-range missile. One traveled just under 300 miles, the other traveled around 500 miles. And these are the kind of missiles that experts say could potentially carry nuclear warheads, pose a threat to tens of millions of people in South Korea where by the way 28,000 U.S. troops are also stationed.</p><p>Now this missile test always a signal, of course, from Kim Jong-un comes just a couple of days after North Korea released these photos of Kim inspecting a perhaps missile capable submarine. North Korea has been trying to perfect its submarine-launched ballistic missile technology.</p><p>All of this is essentially North Korea trying to let the United States know what could happen if they don't get what they want, which is sanctions release sooner rather than later.</p><p>[04:20:03] The problem is diplomacy, any communication between the U.S. and North Korea has essentially ground to a halt. Nothing has happened since President Trump made history when he stepped on the North Korean soil at the Demilitarized Zone a number of weeks ago because the working level discussions haven't resumed and the North Koreans are not expected to meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Bangkok next week. They have been hoping that maybe that's when the working level talks would resume. Now there's nothing on the calendar. But what North Korea is doing is testing more missiles.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Will Ripley for us this morning. Thank you so much, Will.</p><p>BRIGGS: Relentless, record-breaking heat is gripping Europe. Widespread alerts warnings now being issues in western, central, even northeastern Europe. Temperatures expected to top 102 degrees Fahrenheit today in the U.K. The hottest temperature ever recorded there is 101.3 back in 2003. The sweltering heat also threatening Notre Dame's vaulted ceiling. It was ravaged as you'll remember by fire on April and it's still saturated with water that was used to put out the flames. The cathedral's chief architect is concerned the scorching temps could dry the ceilings too quickly causing them to shift.</p><p>All right, ahead, could your next package be delivered via drone? UPS looking to expand its delivery options.</p><p>[04:25:18] ROMANS: Facebook has been criticized for not doing better, for not regulating itself better. There's been scandal after scandal from hate speech to privacy, and criticism over the spread of fake news, especially during national elections. And now the social network is going to pay for it.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission announced a $5 billion settlement with Facebook Wednesday. Nearly 30 times the $168 million fine Dish Network paid back in 2017. The deal comes a day after the Justice Department announced the launch of a wide-ranging anti-trust probe of big tech.</p><p>In a Facebook post CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook will restructure its approach to privacy. He said the company is going to set a completely new standard for our industry. The settlement also covers Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp and could set the mold for a wave of further action by policy makers as they look to rein in the most powerful players in Silicon Valley. The settlement still needs to be approved by a judge.</p><p>BRIGGS: What can brown do for you? In the sky. UPS says it's looking to expand drone deliveries. The shipping giant seeking approval from the FAA to launch a subsidiary to focus on drones. UPS Flight Forward would allow it to fly beyond the line of sight at night and within an unlimited number of operators. Right now operations are limited to delivering medical samples in North Carolina. Tech giants Google and Amazon are also revving up their own drone delivery programs.</p><p>That would make the Romans house awfully busy with all the deliveries you have each week.</p><p>ROMANS: I know. I know.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BRIGGS: A lot of drones coming to New Jersey.</p><p>ROMANS: It's like a superhighway. A superhighway.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right. Ahead, a big change in Puerto Rico with some breaking news. The governor will resign amid scandal. The announcement sending thousands into the streets.</p><p>ROMANS: Democrats searching for a way forward on impeachment.

The stock was able to recover most of its losses, but still managed to lose 7 5/16, or 6.5%, to 105 3/4.

The company announced that China approved its urine test for the HIV-1 strain of the virus that causes AIDS.

TheStreet.com Internet Sector index was up 3, or 0.4%, to 805.\u00a0</p><p> Emulex dropped 57% on what the data network company confirms was a phony press release. The release, which appeared on the Internet around the time of the opening bell, claimed Emulex would restate fourth-quarter earnings to a loss from a profit, and that regulators were probing accounting irregularities. The release also claimed Emulex executives were stepping down. The company said the release was \"totally bogus.\"\u00a0</p><p>Emulex reopened recently and recovered most of its misbegotten losses. The stock lately was down 4 11/16, or 4%, to 108 1/2 in furious trading.\u00a0</p><p> That was the biggest excitement of the session. Other than that, there was some light profit-taking, as traders booked some profits from this week's rally.\u00a0</p><p> Among stocks on the upside, shares of E.piphany (EPNY:Nasdaq) were up 5.2%. Credit Suisse First Boston put out a note saying that the company's third quarter was \"tracking strong.\" Analyst Brent Thill said he expected some new deals to be announced after the third quarter.\u00a0</p><p> PurchasePro (PPRO:Nasdaq) was up 14.2%. Prudential Securities analyst Tim Getz put out a note saying the company was undervalued. Getz indicated that PurchasePro trades at 9.2 times its estimated 2001 gross profits, compared to 25.5 times for B2B companies on average. Prudential has done underwriting for PurchasePro.\u00a0</p><p> Elaine Yager, senior technical analyst and vice president with Herzog Heine Geduld, said although rallies have been on light volume, the ability of the semiconductor index to turn up so abruptly in August after being beaten down in July has set the tone on the upside.\u00a0</p><p> \"It's summertime, it's vacation time and cash on the sidelines could be a feature on the upside over the next two weeks,\" she said. Investors know well that the September/October period can be \"brutal\" for stocks, according to Yager. So she expects selectivity and knowing one's company will be of the utmost importance.\u00a0</p><p> Yager also said that a downturn of any significance, in terms of price, could be \"short and sweet\" relative to time due to the \"January effect\" coming earlier and earlier. (The January effect refers to the buying of stocks that have been downtrodden in the past year and have suffered most from tax-loss selling.) Many mutual funds close their books in October. At this time, Yager sees the immediate target for Nasdaq being the buy-stops at the 4289 reaction peak set July 17. She said the market would need a whole new rash of buyers to sustain upside action above there.<br/>\u00a0<br/>11:09 a.m.: Nasdaq Struggling in Early Action\u00a0</p><p>The Nasdaq may struggle to hold above the 4000 level.

Shares of Internet consulting firm Razorfish (RAZF:Nasdaq) were down 12.2% after the resignation of President Michael Pehl. There were mixed notes on the resignation from research houses. While noting that they have a \"high degree of confidence\" in Chief Operating Officer J.P. Maheu, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown downgraded the stock to buy from strong buy.\u00a0</p><p>Deutsche Banc analyst Mark Annolfo wrote that the announcement \"was abrupt and leaves some management gap.\" He indicated that the resignation could also stimulate turnover among former I-Cube personnel over the next few quarters, though he also notes that voluntary turnover at Razorfish over the last four quarters has been at or below 12%, a rate he said is impressive. Razorfish bought I-Cube last year.\u00a0</p><p>But others suggested any weakness in the stock as a result of the resignation could be a buying opportunity. Credit Suisse First Boston said the impact of the resignation was to \"perception\" not fundamentals. Analyst Mark Wolfenberger said the announcement could weigh on the stock because the company recently denied speculation of Pehl's departure. He reiterated a strong buy rating on the stock. Credit Suisse First Boston has done underwriting for Razorfish.\u00a0</p><p>Sycamore Networks (SCMR:Nasdaq) was down 4.9% despite beating earnings estimates. The fiber optics network equipment company reported earnings of 8 cents a share, beating the 6-cent profit estimate.\u00a0</p><p>Analysts at Lehman Brothers said the company had a \"breakthrough quarter\" and reiterated their $200 year-end price target on the stock. Analyst Steven Levy wrote that while Sycamore continues to trade at \"lofty valuations, even on a price to revenues multiple analysis,\" he felt that the valuation could be justified \"due to the continued significant outperformance of the financial results, strong product offering, and extremely open-ended nature of the intelligent optical access, switching, and core transport markets. Lehman has done underwriting for Sycamore.\u00a0</p><p>Finally, DoubleClick (DCLK:Nasdaq) was up 8%, continuing its impressive run this week. Analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston put out a somewhat cautious note on the stock, questioning whether the stock was \"back from the dead\" or it was seeing a \"dead cat bounce.\" While noting that the stock has had some near-term catalysts that drove it 26% higher in the past two sessions and that he has been positive on the stock for the long-term, analyst Rich Petersen suggests that the online advertising agency is not out of the woods, yet.While noting that the sector was heading toward a seasonally strong quarter for advertising, \"the outcome for the pivotal month of September is still fuzzy.\" He concludes by writing that \"we are not sure this is quite the point to back the truck up, but things certainly are looking up for the advertising sector as a whole and DoubleClick in particular.\" He reiterated a strong buy rating and $75 price target. Credit Suisse First Boston has not done underwriting for DoubleClick.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#1054760#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4127-3S60-00MP-T3T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1420\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2000 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>August 25, 2000 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0INTEL CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0MICROSOFT CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>\u00a0EGGHEAD.COM INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0THESTREET INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0NET TECH INTERNATIONAL INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0TECTONIC NETWORK INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0QLOGIC CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>\u00a0RAMBUS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>CSCO (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0INTC (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0MSFT (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0TST (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0QLGC (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>\u00a0RMBS (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0NAICS334210 TELEPHONE APPARATUS MANUFACTURING\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0SIC3663 RADIO &amp;

They're only interested in keeping the tech giants as big employers.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And so on.</p><p>It's been a running theme in chunks of the European data privacy industry, especially in German-speaking areas.</p><p>There was more last week, where the topic was tackled by the European desk at Politico. The underlying theme was familiar: the Irish DPC is perceived as being either too tardy, unmotivated or insufficiently resourced to take timely action against the tech giants for privacy breaches. Justice delayed is justice denied. And it is now \"make or break\" for the Irish regulatory body.</p><p>I've heard a different view in recent times from some privacy and industry professionals I respect.</p><p>Most of it boils down to a common thread - if the DPC is pulled along at the pace its critics crave, its decisions will have holes, lack certainty and will be far more likely to be appealed. While the body blow to Facebook or Google or Twitter would be satisfying from an optics perspective, it would be a hollow victory.</p><p>Those very companies may end up avoiding actual enforcement for years longer, while other industry players would look at proceedings and decide there was less merit in simply accepting the initial decision.</p><p>This is a criticism sometimes levelled against the British counterpart of the Irish data protection office, which has been accused of moving too quickly on some headline fines.</p><p>It's very hard to prove or disprove this theory, as we haven't yet had a major decision against a big tech player in Ireland, yet. Helen Dixon's office has indicated the decisions are on the way fairly imminently. Even then, further consultation periods with the entities involved are still likely, even if only for a few weeks.</p><p>But for what it's worth, the most senior privacy officials in the top tech companies privately say that the more methodical and comprehensive the paperwork, the less likely they are to appeal, even if the fine is a big one.</p><p>Cynics on this point are unlikely to accept such a theory. To them, corporate Zuckerberg is dead serious about this, even though company executives here pointed out to me late last week that the move to start this won't initially apply to Ireland's near-5,000 Facebook workers. (So that huge office expansion in Dublin 4, with room for up to 10,000 people, is still on.) But if it proves effective in the US, it can only be a matter of time before it's introduced here.</p><p>Is it logical that two people working for the same company should be paid differently depending on where they rent or buy? Remember, this pay differentiation will only apply to 'remote' workers, not 'flexible' workers (office some days, home other days) or workers who turn up normally to the central office.</p><p>Still, in Ireland it would effectively mean a company subsidy for living in Dublin 4 or 6. Such things aren't that unusual in some industries. The concept is established in London, for instance, where a whole swathe of white-collar workers get bumped up pay to allow for London rents.</p><p>But as a structural pay grade in a tech company, it's a very interesting debut.</p><p>This is especially so because other companies will surely follow in Facebook's footsteps.</p><p>Where firms like Zuckerberg's and Sundar Pichai's (Google) go, hundreds more traditional corporations follow.</p><p>Personally, I'm ambivalent about working from home: I like the physical distinction that a workplace brings. I also find that there's energy in physical presence that is very hard to replicate remotely, no matter how high a resolution your Zoom call is.</p><p>And the cultural element of presence is underrated, too. Seasoned, experienced workers may be comfortable getting on with things, because they know what they need to do and how they need to interact with colleagues. But for younger ones, workflow culture can be essential. We all scoff at the peccadilloes and absurdities of some parts of office life, but it's still mostly a productive environment.</p><p>And yet it is now clear that a very sizeable number of people are not only willing, but eager to work from home.</p><p>\"I never want to see the office again,\" is how a media colleague put it to me last week when I asked how he was getting on with work at home.</p><p>Maybe he'll fancy a job in Facebook in a few years' time.</p><p>privacy chiefs are algorithmically-fuelled vampire capitalists who only seek to wring every last drop of blood from a process. Then again, these are the same commentators who have been arguing for almost 15 years that tech multinationals will leave Ireland any day now. And that they have no interest whatsoever in 'the talent', that it is purely an offshore tax play, a giant con.</p><p>In terms of what happens next, it does look very likely that the Irish DPC will issue at least one major fine this year. But maybe not because the mob is baying for it, but because the cases merit it.</p><p>Facebook works it out FACEBOOK'S 'remote working' new deal is a fascinating one. You'll get paid according to where you live.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg says that up to around half of the company will be working from home permanently within five to 10 years.</p><p>But if you base yourself miles away from a pricey rental area, you'll be paid less.</p><p>Seems fair, right?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SINDIR-160200857</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SINDIR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6000-VRX1-JCBW-N4CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">333993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58258\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 24, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Teams would scramble to find the most effective ways to punch out opposing superstars, or to protect their own. They might bring on \"designated punchers,\" better at throwing right hooks than hook shots. Statistics nerds would try to calculate whether teams should use their punches early or late in the game, or to estimate how quickly punched players could recover. On TNT, Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal would debate whether a coach should have used all of their permissible punches to deck LeBron James, or saved some punches to level his supporting cast. Taunting would be refined to an art form, as players tried to bait the other team into wasting valuable punches. Contract clauses would reward not only points, rebounds, and assists, but also a player's effectiveness in knocking out opposing superstars. Instead of trying to raise its field-goal percentage, a successful team might be focused on punching Stephen Curry.</p><p><br/>Some might cheer, but most true basketball lovers and many NBA players and coaches would find this rule offensive, and certainly dangerous. Yet as long as NBA competition was structured to allow a few punches a game, there would be little room for anyone to abstain. Teams that would race straight to the bottom-those best at knocking out Curry or James-would have a serious leg up in pursuit of NBA championships. Any coach or player who tried unilaterally to resist the use of violent punching would be putting their team at a serious competitive disadvantage. And those who advocated for disallowing punching would no doubt be accused of overregulating and reducing the freedom to compete in the NBA.<br/>This article is adapted from Gene Sperling's book <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Dignity-Gene-Sperling/dp/1984879871\">Economic Dignity</url>.<br/>Absurd? Perhaps so, but this thought experiment about the NBA offers important insights into how we should structure market competition in our nation. Do the rules and incentives we design reward the winners of a race to the bottom? Or do they allow for equally vigorous competition that promotes what I have termed economic dignity: the capacity for all of us to care for family, pursue potential and purpose, and participate in the economy without domination and humiliation-not only in our roles as workers, but also as consumer and business competitors?<br/>Consider three basic principles that ring true whether in the NBA or the economy as a whole. First, all forms of competition are structured by policy. In our current political dialogue, free-market proponents often approach any discussion of structuring or regulating markets as if it would constitute disruption of some natural state, like a child throwing a rock into a completely calm pond, creating ripples in an otherwise pure free market. Yet, just like in professional sports, the nature of competition is always driven by the rules of the game. The decision to allow or penalize punching is a choice, just like any other. Conservatives often equate less regulation with more competition, as in the Trump administration's simplistic notion that any new regulation-no matter its virtue-can only be justified if it is paired with the repeal of two others. Yet even the oft-called father of free-market competition, Adam Smith, based his argument that the \"invisible hand\" of the individual pursuit of self-interest in free competitive markets will benefit the common good not on a premise of no regulation, but precisely on the crucial assumption that policy makers would structure markets to prevent their distortion or domination by governmental or private-sector monopolies.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/10/americas-monopoly-problem/497549/?utm_source=feed\">Derek Thompson: America's monopoly problem</url>]<br/>Second, our choices are often more about what type of competition we promote than whether we will unleash or squelch it. While free-market purists argue that regulation creates less competition, often regulation determines whether competition will reward performance that promotes our values or if it will reward harmful or destructive behavior. The NBA regulates punching through technical and flagrant fouls, ejections, and fines, but this hardly reduces competition in the league. Instead, it shapes competition around who is the best at three-point shooting, play making, and defense, rather than who is best at punching Steph Curry. Whenever exploitation, misinformation, and deception are permitted in an industry, new regulations that prevent such behavior will often be portrayed by industry critics as limiting competition-but they are better seen as ensuring vigorous but fair competition. Structuring markets to reward competition principally on quality, price, and performance, and not race-to-the-bottom behavior, leads competitive actors to focus on delivering better products and services to consumers and society, without fear that dignified treatment of workers, consumers, and the environment will jeopardize their competitive advantage.<br/>Some market purists argue that consumer standards which limit race-to-the-bottom competition are unnecessary: The market will self-correct, with new entrants pushing out the unscrupulous. Yet that theory fails in practice, both for new entrants and individual employees. If competitors show dramatic profit margins or lower prices through exploitation, that can block the economic viability of new entrants or existing companies seeking to compete on the high road. When everyone has to play by high-road rules, competition does not die; instead, it shifts, and the winners are those who excel at providing needed goods and services-or are the best three-point shooters.<br/>Third, never structure markets in ways that punish virtuous behavior. If the NBA allowed punching, teammates and fans would see any player or coach who chose to abstain as disloyal, not fiercely committed to winning games. When the rules of competition are structured to allow such violence, Gandhi-like behavior looks like unilateral disarmament. Coaches would pull aside conscientious objectors and tell them that, while their values are admirable, as long as other teams are punching the players have no choice but to do the same.<br/>We see parallels in market after market. Where companies can achieve lower costs and higher market share through predatory or abusive behavior that reduces social well-being and economic dignity, the companies and their employees that race fastest and farthest toward the bottom win, and those that might wish to compete on a higher ground are too often undercut and punished in the market. In 2006, before the financial crisis, there was likely little room for a virtuous mid-level bank employee to refuse to make reckless subprime loans, since the market was structured to reward his competitors and peers at his own company for race-to-the-bottom competition.<br/>Few markets reflect all three principles for market structure as poignantly as the for-profit higher-education market, which is completely shaped by and dependent on government. Efforts to regulate for-profit schools are inevitably met with special-interest-group howls of limiting market competition, but there is no market so dependent on and intertwined with government as for-profit higher education. Half of all for-profit colleges derive more than 70 percent of their revenues from Pell grants or government-backed loans. Without those taxpayer dollars, there would likely not be a real for-profit education industry.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/why-for-profit-education-fails/501140/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Why for-profit education fails</url>]<br/>The only legitimate rationale for supporting a for-profit higher-education industry with taxpayer dollars would be that for-profit competition truly helps more people pursue their potential and sense of purpose, thereby increasing their economic dignity. But instead, this market has been structured to reward enrollment, regardless of results or performance. Schools are usually guaranteed payment from the federal government when a student enrolls, regardless of the institution's quality, competence, or value. When a student is lured into enrolling in a for-profit program, the school gets paid. If that program fails to deliver any education of value, the loss is borne by the student and the taxpayers.<br/>Sound familiar? This is precisely the formula that contributed to the subprime housing crisis. Once the secondary markets were willing to buy even the shadiest of mortgages and stamp them with AAA ratings, the actors who originated mortgages were going to get fully paid no matter what. The government might lose because it was guaranteeing investors; the borrowers might have massive debt and could even lose their homes, down payments, and credit. But once the loan was originated, the bank got paid-no risk, no skin in the game.<br/>In the for-profit education sector, this structure led to schools competing on the basis of marketing and deception, not educational quality. In 2009, for-profit colleges spent nearly 25 percent of all revenue on marketing, advertising, recruiting, and admissions staffing, compared to less than 1 percent for nonprofit colleges. A       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/for_profit_report/ExecutiveSummary.pdf\">Senate report</url> found that to keep enrollments growing, for-profit colleges engaged in unscrupulous tactics concerning the costs, reputation, and accreditation of the school. The results? Only       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_326.10.asp\">20 percent</url> of college students at four-year for-profits graduated from the institution they started at within six years, compared with 60 percent of those who attended nonprofit colleges and universities. In 2008-09,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/for-profit-college-recruiters-documents_n_820337\">more than half</url> of students dropped out in their first year of the program at 16 large for-profits. For-profit college students default on their student loans at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-looming-student-loan-default-crisis-is-worse-than-we-thought/\">nearly four times</url> the rate of those who attend public programs.<br/>The Obama administration started the important process of establishing a set of rules to hold low-quality institutions accountable, measuring whether their students were able to obtain \"gainful\" employment that would enable them to repay their student loans. This was only a first step toward refocusing competition on results that didn't go nearly far enough, but it still proved too much for the Trump administration, which lost no time in rolling back the rules-and reopening the race to the bottom.<br/>The current structure of the for-profit higher-education industry discourages virtue. By prioritizing enrollment over results, policy makers have ensured that executives who might aspire to put students first can only survive if they can prove to the market that they can achieve a reputational advantage. But in the absence of regulations that would produce clear and easily accessible consumer information on which schools are helping students pursue their potential, and which ones force them into horrible debt for little benefit, that sort of advantage is difficult to achieve.<br/>Perhaps if we succeed in securing free tuition at public schools and a major expansion of slots in quality two- and four-year colleges, for-profit education will die out and the issue will become irrelevant. But if there is going to be any case for a for-profit higher-education sector, the government needs to have zero tolerance for predatory practices and punishing debt, and must structure rules and economic incentives to ensure that the winners of the fierce competition are those institutions that help their students launch rewarding careers and prioritize the pursuit of personal potential. Government must assure such high-road competition in for-profit higher education, or get out of subsidizing it altogether.<br/>These issues are not restricted to for-profit education. Indeed, the three principles of market structure are also exemplified by the basic question: What is the purpose of a corporation? The current default assumption is that its ultimate purpose is to maximize shareholder value. Calls for a broader corporate purpose are often seen as disruptive meddling with free markets. But that's ridiculous. After all, the very capacity to organize as a corporation-with the special legal benefit of being able to raise funds without any investor liability-is a privilege that exists solely due to laws passed by democratic legislatures. It is not a principle that is deeply rooted in our history, or even in our legal traditions. As scholars like       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/RI_EndingShareholderPrimacy_workingpaper_201902-1.pdf\">Lenore Palladino</url> and the late       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/575153/the-shareholder-value-myth-by-lynn-stout/\">Lynn Stout</url>, the journalist       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/binyamin-appelbaum/the-economists-hour/9780316512329/\">Binyamin Appelbaum</url>, and others have noted, the idea of shareholder primacy only became dominant during the 1970s as part of the rise of free-market economic ideologies pushed by the economist Milton Friedman and others in the Chicago School.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/09/nicolas-lemann-binyamin-appelbaum-economics/594718/?utm_source=feed\">Read: How economists' faith in markets broke AMerica</url>]<br/>It is a positive development that the Business Roundtable recently       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans\">called for</url> a more \"modern standard for corporate responsibility\" that reflects \"a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders,\" including not just shareholders but also workers, local communities, and the environment. However, we should nonetheless recognize that without actual laws requiring or at least promoting broader economic and environmental goals, corporate concern for stakeholders will be uneven and subject to the excuse that good corporate behavior will be punished because competitors can still take a lower road. Yes, there are occasionally companies like Costco that, out of some combination of corporate culture and a sense of how worker loyalty contributes to long-term market value, pay higher wages and benefits than competitors like Walmart. But only a significant increase in the minimum wage will help the workers in the much bigger pool of companies that would otherwise claim that an individual company alone raising its minimum wage would lead to competitive disadvantage.<br/>Maximizing shareholder value also defies the principle that we should not structure markets to punish virtuous behavior. Take the case of short-termism and stock buybacks. The appropriate outrage over the level of corporate stock buybacks recently reached new heights when people learned that the airline industry, which just got a $50 billion bailout, used       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-16/u-s-airlines-spent-96-of-free-cash-flow-on-buybacks-chart\">96 percent</url> of its free cash flow over the past decade on stock buybacks. That's tens of billions spent on boosting share prices and effectively raising executive compensation, as opposed to investing in operations, or improving salaries for workers, or saving for a downturn. Worse still, when this buyback obsession becomes the norm in industry after industry, a company that seeks to do the right thing by eschewing buybacks in favor of long-term investments that promote jobs and growth is likely to be punished by short-term investors for breaking the buyback expectation.<br/>And despite the Business Roundtable statement, as former Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme CourtLeo Strine       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2576389\">said</url>, if a corporate executive or board \"is treating an interest other than stockholder wealth as an end in itself ... he is committing a breach of fiduciary duty.\" Ask Craigslist founder Craig Newmark, who was successfully sued for saying he was putting consumer service above monetizing the website. If a CEO made the candid admission in the middle of the current COVID-19 crisis that they were going to keep all their  workers employed solely because they were putting their workers first regardless of shareholder value, they would be a folk hero, perhaps even the subject of a Netflix movie. Yet the precise reason for such adoration-that they explicitly did it for the welfare of the workers and surrounding community alone-would be damning evidence in a lawsuit. This is a classic case of markets being structured in such a way that virtue will not go unpunished.<br/>The need to structure competition so that companies are forced to compete on the high road is on full display with the recently enacted Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The $660 billion program is essentially a national exercise in throwing a financial life preserver to small businesses drowning in the middle of an unprecedented crisis. You might assume that banks-including some that signed on to the Business Roundtable statement-would not first ask who was a loyal and lucrative client before deciding who would survive this 100-year flood. Yet, without clear rules requiring financial institutions to take all applicants, even in a national crisis banks resorted to business-as-usual competition that was hardly high road. At JPMorgan Chase, wealthy clients with more than $10 million in assets at the bank received \"concierge treatment,\" and nearly all who applied received the \"small business\" loans, while one out of every 15 retail banking clients that applied for loans got them, The New York Times       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/business/sba-loans-ppp-coronavirus.html\">reported</url>. Experts       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/women-minority-business-owners-paycheck-protection-program-loans/\">believe</url> that roughly 95 percent of black-owned businesses and 91 percent of Latino-owned businesses have been completely shut out of the program because they don't have strong established relationships with banks and tend to be smaller, less lucrative clients.<br/>Or consider the consequences of how government has structured markets through antitrust law. Experts like Barry Lynn, Lina Khan, and Tim Wu have been portrayed as being outside the mainstream for suggesting that antitrust enforcement should be structured to promote values larger than consumer welfare. Yet it is entirely appropriate-based on our history, values, and desire for increased competition-to structure policies to ensure against monopolists being able to use sheer market power to dominate and humiliate smaller competitors in ways that defy our values of economic dignity. This is certainly more faithful to the experiences that motivated our antitrust laws than prioritizing price efficiency.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/09/meritocracys-miserable-winners/594760/?utm_source=feed\">Daniel Markovits: How life became an endless, terrible competition</url>]<br/>Ida Tarbell, the muckraker whose expos\u00e9s on John D. Rockefeller helped inspire Teddy Roosevelt's efforts to break up Standard Oil, was deeply motivated by her experience as a 14-year-old, when she saw her father's financial ruin and his best friend's suicide caused not by fierce competition, but by their humiliation and domination due to the sheer brute force of Rockefeller forcing those competitors to sell their operations to him at cut-rate prices. They were tactics of force, possible only because the market structure at the time permitted Rockefeller to unfairly leverage his control over what Wu has called a \"key economic network\" of its time-the railroads.<br/>This example has relevance for us today. No one doubts that, like railroads, big tech companies in many ways improve people's lives with their services. Yet our existing market rules allow them to exploit dependency on their critical digital networks and platforms to use significant pressure-not superior innovation-to dominate potential competitors.

None of these examples represent fierce competition based on who designs better products. Instead, they are about the power to force concessions due to the leverage that comes from control over a key economic network of our time.<br/>While any new regulatory structure or set of market rules will inevitably bring forth howls that policy makers are stomping on competition and leading us to socialism, this should not obscure that the question will remain not whether to regulate markets, but what kind of markets we wish to have. Do we want a market capitalism in which financial rewards flow to those who create dignified work and invest in the dignified treatment of customers and clients, or one that is structured to drag everyone down into a race to the bottom?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-punchingstephcurry611410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YW8-R6K1-JCG7-V0M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3385\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STUART VARNEY, CO-HOST: Tonight on MONEYLINE, a punishing sell- off hits Wall Street: nearly $200 billion in value wiped out, the Dow's worst session in months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WILLOW BAY, CO-HOST: Fueling fear in the markets: oil prices, spiking higher once again.  How much of a threat is sky-high oil to the global economy?</p><p>VARNEY: And, billions of consumers have been served, but investors are feeling very unsatisfied.  The bottom line on McDonalds.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE.  Reporting tonight from Los Angeles, Willow Bay; and from New York, Stuart Varney.</p><p>BAY: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to MONEYLINE.  I'm Willow Bay.</p><p>VARNEY: And I'm Stuart Varney.  It was a big day in the markets, but first we have a breaking story for you, and that breaking news involves AT&amp;T.</p><p>The company has been under intense pressure recently to jump- start the stock, one of the worst Dow performers this year; and management has been considering all its options, some of them quite dramatic.</p><p>Now the \"Financial Times\" is reporting that AT&amp;T is in serious talks with British Telecom about one of those options: combining two of their divisions to create brand new, stand-alone companies.</p><p>Let's go right to Richard -- to Robert Thomson of the \"Financial Times\" with all the details -- Robert.</p><p>ROBERT THOMSON, \"FINANCIAL TIMES\": Stuart, that's right.  This is an extraordinary deal between two telecom titans.  Essentially, AT&amp;T and BT are in serious negotiations about spinning off their business service division, their cellular division, and then each concentrating on their domestic markets.</p><p>So two would become four.</p><p>VARNEY: So they would combine wireless, combine business services and then spin off both, is that correct?</p><p>THOMSON: That's correct, that's what they're negotiating at the moment.  And one of the things that, particularly, BT is interested in is the market reaction to these talks, and news of these talks.</p><p>It was, essentially, AT&amp;T who dialed up BT and said, we need to do a deal.  Both companies' share prices have been down 50 percent this year.  Incremental increases in business is not going to make the difference that the market wants.</p><p>VARNEY: It sounds a little like there might be some desperation in the air, given what's happened to both companies' stock price this year.</p><p>THOMSON: Well, BT, this year, has already announced a restructuring which didn't go down well, and I think executives at both companies, AT&amp;T in particular, realize they have to do something dramatic.</p><p>And AT&amp;T and BT getting together is definitely dramatic.</p><p>VARNEY: If these combinations take place, and the spinoffs take place, doesn't that amount to the break up of AT&amp;T as we know it?</p><p>THOMSON: Absolutely, and to the break-up of BT as we know it. So these two companies, which have really been emblematic of each country's telecoms industry, would be something completely different.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, but Robert, AT&amp;T and BT have a joint venture already.  I believe it is called Concert.  How's that going?</p><p>THOMSON: That's correct, Stuart; and it's going very poorly.</p><p>They really haven't concentrated on the international business market.  They haven't been committed to the project.  BT has already set up almost a competitor company, which is focusing on business services.</p><p>Essentially, these two companies are now saying, we have to have a proper commitment.  We have to compete in a market that's both lucrative and ultra-competitive, and they way to do that is by blending our strengths.</p><p>VARNEY: Robert Thomson, the \"Financial Times\" reporting the story, thank you very much, Robert.</p><p>Now, AT&amp;T's stock did edge higher today, but that's little consolation for investors.  The stock has gotten slammed over the past year, it's down nearly 50 percent from its 52-week high -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, our other top story tonight: a crushing session on Wall Street.  Investors plagued by the fear of soaring oil prices and slumping corporate profits.</p><p>Tech stocks, in particular, took it on the chin, even though industry bellwether Oracle released profits last night that beat expectations.  The blue chip tech names accounted for a third of the Dow's 160-point loss today, its worst point drop since late July.  The index lost more than 293 on the week.</p><p>And on the Nasdaq, Oracle was a major contributor to a big tumble, the index losing more than 78 to close at 3,835.  For the week, the Nasdaq fell for than 3 1/2 percent.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell 15, about 1 percent.  Its weekly loss: more than 28 points.</p><p>Today's sell-off came despite some stellar news on inflation: the Consumer Price Index taking its first monthly retreat in 14 years. But that news did nothing to inspire a rally in the bond pits.  The 10-year note fell 13/32, the yield at 5.84 percent.  The 30-year issue fell more than a full point for the second day in a row.  The yield there?  5.90 percent.</p><p>So what was behind today's market rout?  In part, fear that the world's biggest economy may be headed for a hard landing.</p><p>Let's check in with Terry Keenan with more on that and a look at the day's big movers -- Terry.</p><p>TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Willow, if this week's market seemed as confusing as it was difficult, that's because, increasingly, many of the assumptions that had gone unquestioned here have been held up for examination this week.</p><p>Chief among them, a conviction that the Federal Reserve has successfully engineered a soft landing.  With oil prices rising above $36 a barrel today, there is growing anxiety that the economy will slow down too much, and that's what hit the tech stocks and the economically sensitive names today.</p><p>Let's look at the damage report for the Dow, starting with two of the Dow's big tech components.</p><p>Hewlett Packard being hammered again today.  It has had only one winning session so far this month and is more than 30 percent off of its high of 155.</p><p>And take a look at Microsoft, trading at 64 3/16, it's just a couple dollars away from a new multi-year low -- that stock down 45 percent year-to-date.</p><p>J.P. Morgan also feeling the heat, as you can see, there, a big decline for that stock, as did G.E. lose ground today in very heavy trading.</p><p>Oil the only bright spot among the Dow 30, as Exxon Mobil moved to a new high on that spike in oil prices.</p><p>With many of the economically sensitive stocks under pressure, no surprise that losers swamped winners here by a 17 to 10 margin. Volume was the heaviest in weeks, options expiration the reason why. And taking a look at where the big money was coming and going today: Nortel Networks continues to pull out of its early-September slump.  Corning, though, down 2 3/8, and Lucent fractionally lower.</p><p>Chase lost more than $1, and you saw that impact on J.P. Morgan. Citigroup also weaker, down nearly a buck.  Some of the story stocks that we're following for you tonight include Xerox.  It was up on some takeover speculation reported in the latest edition of \"Business Week.\"</p><p>Bank One getting an underperform as BankAmerica securities initiates coverage.  Warren Buffett, by the way, has been nibbling on that stock of late.  Pentair a stand-out loser on the session, warning that third quarter earnings will disappoint.</p><p>And, finally, Carnival Cruise Lines getting a nice pop after its main competitor, Premier Cruise Lines went into receivership; and, Willow, after a week like this, we could probably all use a cruise -- the Dow down more than 2 1/2 percent.</p><p>BAY: Only good news about the week, Terry: it's over.</p><p>Terry Keenan, thanks.</p><p>September is living up to its reputation as the cruelest month for stocks, especially for technology stocks.</p><p>The Nasdaq has plunged nearly nine percent so far this month, while the Dow is down just 2.5 percent.  And today it was some of the biggest and most important tech stocks on Wall Street that got beaten up the most.</p><p>John Metaxas joins us now with a roundup of all the Nasdaq action -- John.</p><p>JOHN METAXAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, of course the catalyst today was Oracle and, as one analyst said to me today, you had the look pretty deep into Oracle's numbers to find something to get angry about.  Well, that's what Wall Street did today, focusing not on the fact that they beat expectations, not on the fact that they announced the two-for-one stock split, which generally is viewed positively, but on weakness in their applications-software segment.</p><p>And this was the result: Oracle down 7.8 percent on the day, setting the tone for the entire Nasdaq.  Helping to pull the other big cap stocks down with it.</p><p>Intel losing 3.7 percent on the day.  The semiconductor sector was down 3 percent as a whole.  In fact, every sector here was substantially lower on the day.</p><p>It wasn't all negative on the earnings front: Adobe beat expectations yesterday with their results.  They announced a two-for- one stock split, Merrill Lynch raised their earning estimate and reiterated a buy rating on the stock.  This stock reacted as you would expect when a company has good news. But on the other side, we had earning warnings from PSI Net, hammering that stock.  A warning from Anadigics, that stock down 16 percent on the day.</p><p>If there was any ray of sunshine, it was the performance of Cisco systems; down below $60 early in the day, it rallied in the afternoon to close with a strong gain.  Some think as Cisco goes, so goes the Nasdaq, maybe there's a ray of hope.</p><p>John Metaxas reporting from the Nasdaq market site.</p><p>VARNEY: Aside from the tech tremors, concerns about oil swept in today to rattle the markets.</p><p>After a few days of relative calm, oil prices came surging back with a vengeance today.  Light sweet crude touched a new 10-year high, ending up $1.85 at $35.92 a barrel.</p><p>Susan Lisovicz joins us now to help answer the critical question: What is driving oil higher?  Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Stuart, the situation is so dire President Clinton today said he's considering tapping into the nation's strategic oil reserve.</p><p>Both man and nature are to blame for the latest spike in oil prices.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(voice-over): A tropical storm brewing in the Gulf of Mexico, a vital oil-producing region, is only one culprit in the latest spike in crude prices.</p><p>Traders also fear renewed threats from Iraq, which has accused neighboring Kuwait of stealing oil from its fields.  Such talk preceded Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the Gulf War.</p><p>But the escalating price of oil has already caused much tension in Europe, where trucker protests have spread beyond Britain, France and Belgium to Spain, Ireland and Poland; and there is increasing uncertainty in the oil trading pits about forecasts that say things could get much worse before they get better.</p><p>FADEL GHEIT, FAHNESTOCK AND COMPANY: We should be ready for $40 oil soon, we're only $4 away from here, we're going into the weekend; and if or when Iraq, for any reason, stops producing oil, I think people should be looking for $50 oil, not $40 oil.</p><p>LISOVICZ: These projections come the same week that OPEC agreed to boost output by 800,000 barrels a day starting in October.  But when oil prices still moved higher, the cartel said it could raise output again.  But that still doesn't erase the consequences if oil suddenly stopped flowing from Iraq.</p><p>JOHN LICHTBLAU, CHAIRMAN, PETROLEUM INDUSTRY RESEARCH FOUNDATION: If Iraq does take any action, military action, it would immediately be cut off all exports.  If that's the case, there's a problem, because the world has very little spare capacity.</p><p>LISOVICZ: Analysts say OPEC is now pumping more oil than it has at any time in the past 20 years and that only Saudi Arabia has any spare production capacity.  President Clinton says he sees no immediate threat to the U.S. economy.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISOVICZ: But the U.S. Labor Department says consumer inflation, the Federal Reserve's key reason for raising interest rates, could worsen substantially this month because of the sharp increase in oil prices -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Susan Lisovicz, thanks very much -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, still to come on MONEYLINE, what's next for techs? Forget Nasdaq 5000 or even 4000.  We'll ask one strategist why the tech index could be headed all the way back to 3000.</p><p>Plus, the ongoing problems facing Ford Motor, the very latest in the tire recall and whether its shares are a buy, hold or sell.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Checking tonight's \"MONEYLINE Movers,\" Red Hat lost more than 4.  Several brokerages downgraded the Linux player today on concerns of future revenue growth.  That despite the company reporting a narrower-than-expected second quarter loss late yesterday.</p><p>Pentair plunged nearly 7 3/4.  Its a maker of power tools and electrical equipment.  It warned today that its third quarter earnings would be significantly lower than expected.</p><p>Siebel Systems gained almost 4 1/4.  J.P. Morgan started coverage of the customer service software maker today with a buy rating and a $115 price target.</p><p>And Juniper Networks gained almost 3.  UBS Warburg repeated its buy rating today and upped its price target to $250.</p><p>A few stocks making big moves after the bell tonight, for a look at all the late action, we go now to the CNNfn newsroom, where Amanda Lang is standing by -- Amanda.</p><p>AMANDA LANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Net2Phone is on the rise in after-hours trading and pretty decent volume, too.  It's gaining more than 2 1/2, this because of reports it will team with Cisco to form a company for Internet telephony.  That's one the watch on Monday when that announcement is expected.</p><p>American Management Systems not so lucky.  This company thinks slower revenue is going to hurt it's third quarter.  that has the stock down about 3 1/2 in after-hours trading.  Third-quarter earnings are expected to be 28-33 cents now, not the 47 cents analysts have been looking for.</p><p>And Autobytel the opposite problem.  Better revenue is going to push that company to a better third quarter and full year.  This company is rising after-hours.  It's trading now up at 5 3/4.</p><p>And finally, AT&amp;T, \"FT\" reported that it may be merging with British Telecom.  That stock is rising after hours but in very light trade, so likely that announcement will have more affect in regular trading on Monday.</p><p>Back to Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: And that is Amanda Lang.</p><p>Bridgestone/Firestone officials today filed depositions in the first defective tires case against the company scheduled to go to trial.  Ford Motor also faces a number of lawsuits because of those tire troubles.  But analysts are optimistic, after hearing from the company's chief executive in New York this morning.</p><p>Kelli Arena reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ford CEO Jacques Nasser told Wall Street analysts today what he told lawmakers in Washington earlier this week.</p><p>JACQUES NASSER, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, FORD MOTOR: We know this is a Firestone tire issue, not a vehicle issue.</p><p>ARENA: Even so, Ford told analysts in New York that its Firestone tire recall problems will affect the company's results for the rest of the year.  Most auto analysts have already lowered estimates for the second quarter.</p><p>DAVID GARRITY, DRESDNER KLEINWORT BENSON: Our present estimate is about 50 cents a share.  We're staying with that.  We had brought it down yesterday more because of the impact of the petrol crisis over in Europe.</p><p>ARENA: If second quarter earnings do fall below 54 cents a share, it would be the first time in 17 quarters Ford has not seen a gain.  But Wall Street sees Ford's problems as temporary.  For example, Ford lost about $100 million because it shut down three plants to make tires available for the recall.  Those plants will reopen Monday.</p><p>SCOTT MERLIS, WASSERSTEIN PERELLA: This stock is a buy because there's $20 billion in cash.  The Explorer's doing well, and the Ford is returning cash to the shareholders.  And they have a great product plan going forward, and the new Explorer looks very strong.  And the new Explorer should do well, just like the old Explorer.</p><p>ARENA: Other reasons analysts are optimistic includes Ford's $5 billion stock buy-back program. It's also in the news that Ford took off -- took their table -- took their bid off the table for DaewooMotor in Korea.  Investors will probably look at that well from the standpoint that Daewoo was making losses.</p><p>ARENA: Ford will continue to face some negative publicity.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ARENA: On Monday, safety regulators are expected to release a new death and injury toll, the result of tire failures.  Congress is also expected to schedule at least one more hearing on the issue -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: That's Kelli Arena in Washington.  Thank you, Kelli.</p><p>May I just clarify the story about AT&amp;T and BT.  The \"Financial Times\" is reporting that the wireless operations of those two companies could be merged and then spun off, also the business services businesses of both of those two companies could be merged and spun off.  That is a report according to \"Financial Times.\"</p><p>Let's get back to Ford now because it may still face pressure over the tire debacle.  But how much long-term impact will there be?</p><p>We're joined now by David Bradley, auto analyst at J.P. Morgan, who attended today's Ford meetings.</p><p>David, welcome to the program.</p><p>DAVID BRADLEY, J.P. MORGAN: Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: Ford has a $5 billion stock buyback program.  It's just withdrawn from its association with Daewoo, could save it billions of dollars, the stock's close to a 52-week low.  Where's that stock going?</p><p>BRADLEY: It'll be at $30 in the next two weeks would be my guess, and it may go higher after that.  I think this is a great opportunity.  The stock's been knocked down by $5 because of this debacle with the tire recall.  It's lost $8 billion of its market cap, $8 billion of its value.  The cost of this recall is going to be a small fraction of that, hence there's a big upside.  And they're launching a buyback program just at the right moment, when the stock is really very cheap, they can get a lot of stock by it.</p><p>VARNEY: Do you think Ford is getting the better of this battle with Firestone in a public relations sense, in a judicial sense, a regulatory sense as well?</p><p>BRADLEY: I think they are at the margin, but they're suffering a lot as well.  They're not getting a lot of credit in the public arena, and I don't know if it doesn't get worse before it gets better because we got documents submitted today.  Those will start leaking out next week of who knew what and when.  And there could be all kinds of public relations issues with Ford. But the issue is the consumer who buys a car doesn't care about all that.  They want the best-looking car, the best performance at the best price.  And that may very well be a Ford Explorer, and that's what they're going to buy.  So Ford's earnings aren't going to be materially affected by this.</p><p>VARNEY: Absent this problem, absent this dispute, what does Ford look like as a stand alone motor company?  Is it in good shape?</p><p>BRADLEY: I think Ford is the strongest financial -- financially, the strongest of the Big 3 auto companies, and it's had the best marketshare trends and the best track record, and I think that's the one to own right now.</p><p>VARNEY: Do you think Jacques Nasser's job is at stake here?</p><p>BRADLEY: I don't think so.  Obviously, his style overall has been very aggressive.  That ruffles a lot of feathers.  His appearances in Congress, in front of the Congress, have created some controversy.  But he's -- I didn't think he's in trouble in the short run.</p><p>VARNEY: To summarize, you think that Ford stock is at $30 a share in about two weeks?</p><p>BRADLEY: That's my opinion.</p><p>VARNEY: David Bradley, J.P. Morgan, thanks so much for joining us, sir.</p><p>BRADLEY: Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, still to come, the debate over the presidential debates continues.  We'll bring you the latest in the \"MONEYLINE News Digest.\"</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Turning to news outside the business world, Joie Chen joins us from the CNN Center in Atlanta with the \"MONEYLINE News Digest\" -- Joie.</p><p>JOIE CHEN, CNN ANCHOR: Good evening, Willow, thanks.</p><p>The presidential candidates have agreed to debate three times, but their advisers are having trouble working out the details now. Aides to Al Gore and George W. Bush met in Washington today to discuss formats and moderators.  At the end of the day, they had no agreement and said they would continue to talk tomorrow.  An aide to Gore said the two sides were considering different formats, including making one debate a town-hall meeting, and using a talk show setting for another. Out campaigning today, Bush was in the key state California, where polls show him running behind Democrat Gore now.  He talked about education reform at an elementary school in San Diego, and then addressed a rally marking POW/MIA Recognition Day.</p><p>Education was also on Mr. Gore's agenda.  He visited Howard University in Washington.  Gore promised that if elected he would make going to college more affordable.</p><p>At the White House today, President Clinton hosted India's Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.  Clinton praised Vajpayee for a moratorium on further nuclear testing and said that he welcomed a warming of relations between the United States and India.</p><p>Also today, New York's Mayor Rudy Giuliani says he is feeling fine after a hospital procedure to treat his prostate cancer. Giuliani had radioactive seed implantation, which he said was the best treatment for him at this stage of his disease.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI (R), NEW YORK CITY: The process is an excellent one.  It's a good one.  I went through it with remarkably little pain or discomfort -- no discomfort really.  And that's been true throughout.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHEN: Giuliani dropped out of the New York Senate race against Hillary Clinton in April, shortly after he was diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>These are some of the top stories of the day.  Join us for more news on \"THE WORLD TODAY,\" coming up at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 Pacific -- Willow and Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, thank you, Joie.</p><p>In tonight's \"Tech Watch,\" another dot.com handing out pink slips.  Web portal AltaVista said today it's cutting 225 jobs.  That is one-quarter of its workforce.  The company also said it's getting out of the media networking business.  It's going to focus on its search technology.  The moves are part of a major restructuring plan to help it achieve profitability.  It postponed its initial public offering back in April.  AltaVista is majority-owned by Internet incubator CMGI, and on today's news CMGI lost nearly 2 1/2 points -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, coming up on MONEYLINE, trouble in the bond pits: why positive signs on inflation couldn't keep Treasury prices out of the doghouse.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Ahead in our next half hour, more details from the \"Financial Times\" on possible link-ups between units of AT&amp;T and BT.</p><p>VARNEY: Plus, tallying the damage: We'll look at which stocks got hit the hardest in today's Wall Street wipeout.</p><p>BAY: And we'll assess the impact of resurgent oil prices not just on stocks but on the economy.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's headlines, tech stocks take a drubbing, undercut by concerns over the revenue stream at Oracle.</p><p>And oil prices shoot to the highest levels since the Gulf War as the White House warns Iraq about renewed tension in the Mideast.</p><p>Plus, the golden arches may be a global icon of American fast food, but sagging sales have made investors sick to their stomachs. The \"Bottom Line\" at McDonald's.</p><p>VARNEY: And we have a major telecom story, courtesy of \"The Financial Times.\" The FT is reporting that AT&amp;T and British Telecom are in advanced talks toward a major restructuring.</p><p>The two firms would combine their wireless operations into a separate stand-alone company and would do the same with their business service units.  AT&amp;T and BT would each hold on to its domestic consumer operations.  All told it would create four distinct companies out of the two current firms.  The FT reporting the moves as an effort to boost their sagging share prices: AT&amp;T down about 37 percent this year.</p><p>BAY: Our other top story tonight: Just when you thought September couldn't get any worse for your portfolio, guess again. Techs tumble on Wall Street, taking a huge bite out of both the Dow and the Nasdaq.  The Dow industrials posting its biggest one-day loss since July.  The blue chip average now back below that key 11000 level.</p><p>Tech and financial stocks the biggest drag on the Dow today.  The industrials down more than 160 points to close at 10,927.  The Dow losing more than 2 1/2 percent for the week.</p><p>The Nasdaq had an even worse session today, in percentage terms. The tech heavy index sank more than 2 percent, down 78 points, to close at 3,835.  For the week, the Nasdaq is down more than 3 1/2 percent.</p><p>Today's sell-off spread to the S&amp;P 500 index as well: that down 15 points to 1,464.</p><p>Checking some of the day's biggest losers, Dow component Hewlett- Packard lost more than three and is down more than 9 percent this week alone.  Fellow Dow component J.P. Morgan lost more than six.</p><p>On the Nasdaq, Oracle fell more than 6 1/2 despite yesterday's better-than-expected profit report.  Chip stocks also lower: PMC Sierra sank more than eight and Broadcom fell 4 1/2 -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, Willow.  Today capped off a turbulent week for those chip stocks, turbulent indeed, but semiconductors weren't the only group hurting on the Nasdaq.</p><p>Allan Chernoff joins us now with more on what's behind all this tech trouble -- Allan.</p><p>ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT: OK, Stuart.</p><p>We're still hearing many money managers talking up their favorite tech stocks.  And surely there are investors following that advice, buying on the dips.  But this week, it seemed every time bidders pushed tech stocks up, a flood of sellers overwhelmed them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(voice-over): Bad enough that the Nasdaq took a hit this week. Even worse, the pattern of the decline: Monday, a rally that failed; yet another failure on Tuesday; a 44 point gain on Wednesday but Thursday's big rally fell apart; and Friday was a loser from the opening bell.</p><p>PHILIP ROTH, MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER: The normal pattern in the market is for the intraday pattern to be in the direction of the trend.  So if the trend is up, the daily pattern tends to be up down up.  If the trend is weak, the daily pattern will be down up down.  So a poor close is a sign of a weak trend.</p><p>CHERNOFF: The trend is so weak that Roth believes the Nasdaq could fall another 700 points, back to its lows of May before regrouping late this year.</p><p>Earnings anxiety is also weighing on many Nasdaq stocks.  Bank of America this week sparked worries that Intel may have slowed production of the Pentium III chip.  Intel wouldn't comment, but the stock and the entire sector took a hit.</p><p>Then Oracle's battering Friday, down 8 percent even though the software giant delivered better-than-expected profits.  The market's response created a sense that leading tech stocks may be overpriced.</p><p>Some money managers argue even corporate executives are losing faith.</p><p>COURTNEY SMITH, ORBITEX GROUP OF FUNDS: We've also got record- setting insider selling, particularly in the tech sector.  And finally, we're seeing also a significant amount of institutional selling in these markets because I think the institutions believe that tech stocks are overvalued.</p><p>CHERNOFF: The week's biggest losers among Nasdaq big caps: BMC Software, down 19 percent, fiber optic firm Metromedia Fiber, telecom service provider MCLeodUSA, Intel, and NextLink Communications.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: So far this month the Nasdaq is down 8.8 percent. That is very close to the unofficial definition of a correction on Wall Street, a 10 percent loss.  It also means the bulk of the Nasdaq's 11 1/2 percent gain during August is now gone -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Ouch, that hurts.  Allan Chernoff, thanks very much -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, also under pressure recently: bond prices, the 30- year bond plummeting the past two sessions, down more than two full points, and that has pushed long-term interest rates to their highest levels since July.</p><p>The yield on the 30-year Treasury now above that of a 10-year note.  The 30-year bond sinking nearly one and a quarter today, pushing the yield up to 5.90 percent.  Even the noninflation news couldn't help the long bond today.  The Consumer Price Index fell unexpectedly last month, dropping for the first time in more than a decade.</p><p>Ceci Rodgers has more from Chicago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CECI RODGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A sharp drop in energy costs in early August was responsible for the surprise drop in overall consumer prices last month.  The Consumer Price Index fell 1/10 of a percent for the first time in 14 years.  But core inflation rose 2/10, in-line with expectations.</p><p>Rising airfares as well as higher prices for prescription drugs, housing and apparel pushed up the core rate.</p><p>ROBERT BRUSCA, ECOBEST CONSULTING: This is a little bit like getting a bigger-than-expected package and a much prettier wrapping and a huge bow, but you open it up and it's exactly what you thought you were going to get.</p><p>RODGERS: Economists pointed to a continued acceleration of services costs, which make up about 60 percent of the CPI.  Rising medical care costs were the main culprit.  Economists said the Federal Reserve will be closely watching that trend.</p><p>PAUL KASRIEL, NORTHERN TRUST COMPANY: As we say in Chicago, wait until next year.  Well, we don't have to wait until next year.  Let's wait until next month, and I think the CPI will be sending a much different message than it did for the August data.</p><p>RODGERS: Bond traders looked past the August CPI numbers and focused instead on surging oil prices, sending long-term Treasuries sharply lower for a second day.  But the main impetus was a massive shift out of long bonds as investors re-evaluated the chances for a lasting budget surplus.</p><p>BILL HORNBARGER, AG EDWARDS: There's talk about tax cuts and more spending, and people are thinking maybe the buyback program is not going to be as aggressive in the years ahead depending on the outcome of the election.  I think that's also weighing on the long end of the yield curve.</p><p>RODGERS: As a result, the yield curve for 10- and 30-year Treasuries turned positive for the first time since January.</p><p>(on camera): With oil prices soaring, there's little relief from inflation worries even as the government's reports on wholesale and consumer prices show little upward pressure in August.</p><p>Ceci Rodgers, CNN Financial News, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: Coming up, oil prices soar again, shaken by a threat from the past.  Could tensions in the Gulf send crude prices into the stratosphere?</p><p>We'll be back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Oil prices surged again today, touching fresh 10-year highs as long-simmering tensions in the Mideast boiled over.  Iraq accused Kuwait of pumping too much petroleum from fields along their shared border.  Kuwait denied the charge, but it was precisely this issue that preceded Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, and the tensions prompted the U.S. government to warn Baghdad that American forces would defend any threat to Kuwait.</p><p>The news, however, sent light sweet crude prices shooting up $1.85 a barrel.  A powerful reaction to that from some major oil stocks: ExxonMobil jumped 3 3/4 and hit a new 52-week high, Texaco rose 2 1/2, Chevron gained nearly three, BP Amoco and Royal Dutch also ended higher.</p><p>BAY: But the effect of oil prices on the overall market was hardly so positive.</p><p>Terry Keenan has been following the fallout -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: Well, Willow, oil has been going up and the euro has beeng going down since the start of 1999.  But this was the week that the markets finally began to stand up and take notice of both those trends.  In fact, Wall Street has been pretty blase about oil's relentless run all year, lulled by the perception that $30-dollar-a- barrel oil wasn't here to stay.</p><p>Well, that all changed this last week.  With crude now hovering around $36 a barrel, up from just $10 in late 1998, there is growing anxiety about the impact on the U.S. economy.  Alan Sinai, a global economist at Primark Decision Economics, estimates that the oil-price shock is equivalent to a $100 billion tax increase.  And that, combined with the six interest-rate hikes from the Fed over the last year, could mean that the Fed's soft-landing will finish with a thud.</p><p>Indeed, that was what the market was saying today, as investors piled out of the technology and cyclical stocks and into the oil issues.  The Amex oil index tonight closing at a new high, as investtors are finally embracing the idea that higher oil prices may stick.  Now, as for the tech stocks, why was there so much selling there?  Well, there was a lot of talk today that while a soft-landing might not be felt much among the new-economy names, a harder landing would truly take the wind out of some of these high-priced stocks.</p><p>About the only bright spot investors could point to today on the Nasdaq was a heavy calendar of events next week that could pump some of these names.  On the docket, we have an analysts' meeting for Amazon an eBay, Monday and Tuesday, respctively -- then later on in the week, the SG Cowen tech conference, Prudential's Internet and telecom conference, and the Lehman Brothers' wireless conference.</p><p>Look for a lot of hype from those events.  But whether it can stem the very negative sentiment on the Nasdaq, that's another story -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Terry, we'll wait and see -- Terry Keenan, at the Big Board, thanks.</p><p>VARNEY: Now, just ahead: Is Nasdaq 3000 right around the corner?  We will talk to one veteran market-watcher who thinks the tech sell-off still has a way to go.</p><p>And that's next on MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's \"MONEYLINE Focus,\" we take an in-depth look at today's tech sell-off.  The Nasdaq fell into the red again today, topping off a volatile month so far in which the tech-heavy index has plunged more than 8 percent.  So, how much worse can it get?  Our next guest predicts the Nasdaq will hit 3000 before year's-end, a level we haven't seen since last November.  He's Bill Meehan, market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.</p><p>Bill, welcome.</p><p>BILL MEEHAN, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Thanks, Willow.</p><p>BAY: So I gather you think if we are headed towards 3000, we are going to have more weeks like this one.  Why?</p><p>MEEHAN: Well, we have great expectations built into most of the tech leadership.  Technically, we have seen some major breakdowns. Earlier in the week, we tested the 61.8 percent Fibanochi (ph) retracement of the early-August to early-September move.  So we have the Nasdaq breaking down, basically, in most of its leadership.</p><p>BAY: So we actually heard Allen report about this -- this pattern, as you alluded to, of sort of these failed rallies.  What's that telling you about the sentiment?  You're on that trading floor everyday.</p><p>MEEHAN: Well, sentiment, you know, is getting a little bit more dreary, but only anecdotally.  This current week, we saw Investors Intelligence report 50 percent of newsletter writers are still bullish.  And that increased over the last week.  And I didn't catch this week's number from the American Association of Independent Investors.  But last week, the percentage of bears was only 8 percent. I don't recall single digits before.</p><p>BAY: And you think that's way too optimistic?</p><p>MEEHAN: Yeah, I think so.  More and more people have bought into this notion of a era, or a new economy -- or Internet economy.  And I think we have to have prices readjusted downward.</p><p>BAY: Because the fact of the matter is -- what you're suggesting -- is that techs are not vulnerable to a slowdown?</p><p>MEEHAN: Well, many people thought that was the case.  But I think we are in the beginning process of showing that that certainly isn't.  Clearly, only new-area economy stocks don't sell among themselves.  And if we do have a slowdown in the economy, it will impact these stocks.</p><p>BAY: All right, now, I know that you have some advice.  When you talk about techs, you say stay out of semiconductors.  Why, the easy money has been made there?</p><p>MEEHAN: I think the easy money has been made there.  By historical measurements, they are trading at very high price-to- earnings multiples, discounting no cyclicality whatsoever.  You're going to see a lot of capacity come on board next year.  We're already seeing DRAM prices decline.</p><p>BAY: And you suggest, though, that investors might want to take a look at some other names.  One of them is Qualcomm.  Why, because of that good news out of China?</p><p>MEEHAN: Well, there was partially that.  But really, the reason to own Qualcomm was never just because they had such a dominant position in Korea, which hurt them, and not because they were going to do a deal with China immediately.  It's the technology underlying it. And last year, it got ridiculously valued.  I think it makes more sense now for long-term investors and technlogy sector, which you don't want to completely abandon.</p><p>BAY: OK, Bill Meehan, thanks for joining us tonight on MONEYLINE.</p><p>MEEHAN: My pleasure, Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Thank you, Willow.</p><p>Next on MONEYLINE: one of the worst Dow performers this year. We'll have the \"Bottom Line\" on McDonalds: a fast food landmark faltering.  What exactly is troubling the golden arches?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Now, the \"Bottom Line,\" our regular Friday feature inside one company facing a critical challenge.  Tonight, it's McDonald's; The fast food chain is without a doubt one of the world's best-known brands.  But that global scope leaves McDonald's prey to currency issues, with the company just this week warning that the weak euro would hurt its profits.  But the currency issue is just one threat to McDonald's, a stock hovering near two-year lows.</p><p>Peter Viles now has the \"Bottom Line.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's a scene repeated five times a day, usually outside the United States. McDonald's opens a new restaurant adding to the 28,000 it already has, more than half of them abroad.  Expansion is the key to McDonald's growth, the main reason that over the past 15 years it has usually delivered for investors.</p><p>Over that time, McDonald's shares gained 647 percent, just slightly trailing the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>STACY JAMAR, BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES: In a lot of ways, I think of McDonald's as a factory that knows how to churn out restaurants.</p><p>VILES: But lately McDonald's has stumbled, particularly overseas.  Same-stores outside the United States fell 2 percent in August.  Domestic sales have been soft as well, and the stock is 42 percent below its peak reached last November.</p><p>The question for investors: Has the stock fallen so far it's now a cheap way to invest in the global economy?  Analyst Mark Kalinowski.</p><p>MARK KALINOWSKI, SALOMONSMITH BARNEY: I do think it's a very attractive valuation at this level, selling at about 16 times next year's earnings estimate of $1.69 a share.  We haven't seen McDonald's trade at these level for about two years.</p><p>VILES: But with the weak euro cutting into profits in Europe, analyst Stacy Jamar downgraded the stock this week.</p><p>JAMAR: The concerns that I am increasingly having is that the same-store sales numbers they're turning in from around the world are mediocre.</p><p>VILES (on camera): There's nothing mediocre in the story of how McDonald's was built, and it's a story that should give hope to entrepreneurs of any age, because the man who built this company, Ray Kroc, was 52 years old when he started.</p><p>Dick and Mack McDonald opened the first drive-in San Bernardino, California in 1948.  Six years later, salesman Ray Kroc of Illinois took note of how many of his milkshake mixers the restaurant was buying.  He bought the franchise rights and built McDonald's into a global powerhouse, 5,000 outlets by the late '70s, when some thought McDonald's was as big as it would ever get.</p><p>JAMAR: During the '70s, way before I was following this group, people apparently were saying every month that McDonald's is saturated, it can't grow anymore in the U.S., can't do it, can't do it.</p><p>Well, in 1970, the average American -- all men, women and children spent just over $3 at McDonald's per year.  Last year, it was $69.  So the thing that's changed is we eat more fast food than we used to.</p><p>VILES: Like Coca-Cola, McDonald's is now a global brand that works hard for every percentage point of growth.  Revenue growth, driven by those five new stores a day, has averaged 8 percent over the past four years.  Earnings growth has averaged 9 percent.  The main problem now in the U.S. has been a lack of hot promotions that draw children to the restaurant.</p><p>Internationally, McDonald's faces a host of problems, the weak euro, a new consumption tax in Australia, soft consumer spending in Japan and Brazil, and high gas prices everywhere, which function as a tax on consumers.</p><p>But there are positives here as well.  CEO Jack Greenberg has improved the relationship between McDonald's and its franchisees. Wall Street considers the company's new made-for-you cooking system a modest hit, and consumers appear to agree.  McDonald's has held its lead in the perennial burger wars, with 43 percent of the U.S. Burger market: more than double Burger King's share and more than triple Wendy's share.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES: One challenge for McDonald's as the biggest fast-food chain is responding to smaller and more nimble competitors. McDonald's recently hired a consulting firm that uses military planning strategies to help big corporations become faster and more flexible -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: With nearly 30,000 restaurants worldwide, surely you could make the case that now in some markets they're saturated.</p><p>VILES: Perhaps getting there in North America, but analysts really believe there's a lot of room for this company to grow in Asia, in Latin America and the rest of the globe.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, Peter Viles, thanks very much -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, up next, \"Ahead of the Curve\": some of what you need to know before those markets open again on Monday.  You are watching MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Checking some of what could move the markets next week, look for a new batch of earnings.  Starting the week off, retailer Circuit City.  The company warned it would miss second-quarter estimates last week.  Also reporting, Wall Street heavyweights Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and tech giant CMGI. On the economic front, look for housing starts for August and international trade for July.  Also on Monday, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan speaks before the American Bankers Association on banking supervision.</p><p>And to stay a step ahead of the markets, tune into \"AHEAD OF THE CURVE\" every day at 5:00 a.m. Eastern right here on CNN.</p><p>And MONEYLINE wants to hear from you. Send us your comments, questions and feedback by e-mail to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyline@cnn.com\">moneyline@cnn.com</email>.  </p><p>VARNEY: And this programming note: some exciting things we'll be bringing you next week and beyond.  Monday night, we talk with Mark Moody-Stuart.  He is the chairman of the world's second-largest oil and gas company, Royal Dutch Shell: that as oil prices hit 10-year highs.</p><p>Also starting Monday and each night for the next two weeks, we'll introduce you to a stock-picking star.  In a rough year for the markets, these fund managers have delivered double-digit returns.  Who they are and which stocks they're buying now, we're going to tell you.</p><p>And next week, a three-part investigative series on \"Family Business: The Mob on Wall Street.\" How well do you know your broker? A disturbing look at crime, corruption and lifesavings lost.</p><p>BAY: That is MONEYLINE for this Friday.  I'm Willow Bay in Los Angeles.</p><p>VARNEY: And I'm Stuart Varney.

In September, that 15 percent of top global banks rolled out at least one full scale, commercial blockchain product that year, with the figure expected to increase to 65 percent by 2019. Consequently, the adoption rate is expected to rise at an even quicker pace in 2018, as more traditional institution and FinTech giants continue to find ways to implement the innovative technology into their operating procedures. Demand for the blockchain, best known for supporting bitcoin, is growing so much that it will be one of the largest users of capacity in 2018 at more than rented out by IBM to other companies around the globe, said the panel. As one of the first big companies to recognize the technology's promise, IBM has contributed to an open source effort. </p><p>IBM has even encouraged startups to try the blockchain on its cloud for free, creating opportunities for both small businesses and large corporations attempting to innovate. As a result, the technology has garnered interest from big tech and financial multinationals alike. In early November, startup company announced that it now has over 60 clients, including Microsoft and Intel, actively using its blockchain platform, also known as a distributed ledger technology, to store vast amounts of data across a network of computers around the world, rather than on one local server. In its announcement, R3 added that more than 100 banks, insurance firms, regulators and trade associations have signed on to collaborate as members, a further sign of growing acceptance. Essentially, the blockchain enables companies and individuals doing business with each other to record transactions securely. Its strength lies in its trustworthiness, explained the panel, as it is impossible to reverse or change what has been recorded. I can also hold infinitely more documents and data than traditional database storage, allowing businesses for more nuances insights and analysis. Almost six in 10 large corporations are considering using blockchain, according to a survey of 400 executives, managers and tech staff. The technology is increasingly being tested or used by companies including Wal Mart and Visa to streamline supply chain, speed up payments and store records. Within five years, digital distributed ledgers will be utilized by 55 percent of companies with more than 1,000 employees. is the world's first socially and environmentally conscious cryptocurrency.

The International Business Machine Corps. (IBM) reported in September, 2017 that 15 percent of top global banks rolled out at least one full scale, commercial blockchain product that year, with the figure expected to increase to 65 percent by 2019. Consequently, the adoption rate is expected to rise at an even quicker pace in 2018, as more traditional institution and FinTech giants continue to find ways to implement the innovative technology into their operating procedures. Demand for the blockchain, best known for supporting bitcoin, is growing so much that it will be one of the largest users of capacity in 2018 at more than 60 data centers rented out by IBM to other companies around the globe, said the Pura panel. </p><p>As one of the first big companies to recognize the technology's promise, IBM has contributed to an open source effort. IBM has even encouraged startups to try the blockchain on its cloud for free, creating opportunities for both small businesses and large corporations attempting to innovate. As a result the technology has garnered interest from big tech and financial multinationals alike. In early November, startup company R3 announced that it now has over 60 clients, including Microsoft and Intel, actively using its blockchain platform, also known as a distributed ledger technology, to store vast amounts of data across a network of computers around the world, rather than on one local server. In its announcement, R3 added that more than 100 banks, insurance firms, regulators and trade associations have signed on to collaborate as members, a further sign of growing acceptance. Essentially, the blockchain enables companies and individuals doing business with each other to record transactions securely. Its strength lies in its trustworthiness, explained the Pura Cryptocurrency[2] panel, as it is impossible to reverse or change what has been recorded. I can also hold infinitely more documents and data than traditional database storage, allowing businesses for more nuances insights and analysis. Almost six in 10 large corporations are considering using blockchain, according to a Juniper Research survey of 400 executives, managers and tech staff. The technology is increasingly being tested or used by companies including Wal Mart and Visa to streamline supply chain, speed up payments and store records. Within five years, digital distributed ledgers will be utilized by 55 percent of companies with more than 1,000 employees. Pura Cryptocurrency[3] is the world's first socially and environmentally conscious cryptocurrency. As an international digital currency, it liberates users to transact with anyone in the world directly, privately and instantly across a peer-to-peer network that is secured by the blockchain. As a conscious cash movement for the common good, ten percent of all PURA created is contributed to PURAPlanet, a treasury trust dedicated to fund and track sustainable, environmental, and social projects around the globe.
