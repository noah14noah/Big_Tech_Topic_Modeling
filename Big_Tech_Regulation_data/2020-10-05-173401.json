Legislation should be introduced to address harmful online material. The CBC should be advertising free. And a government tax credit to support local journalism should not just be extended, but also applied to broadcast media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those were among the recommendations in a highly anticipated report released by a legislative review panel Wednesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In response, the government said it would move swiftly on the suggested reforms. Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave him direction to table legislation in the government's first year and \"we will follow through on this promise.</p><p>\"Our goal is simple - to make the system more equitable than it is right now,\" he said. \"The technological changes that we have seen have made it so that our system doesn't work anymore.\"</p><p>Guilbeault said a measure like charging the GST on streaming services such as Netflix could be imposed soon, noting that Trudeau \"talked about probably the next budget, so this is something we can move very quickly.\"</p><p>Currently, only Quebec and Saskatchewan require at least the provincial sales taxes to be collected on streaming services. The report urges that the GST/HST be applied \"equitably\" to services provided by foreign online providers, saying it \"would eliminate the disadvantage to competing Canadian providers.\"</p><p>The six-member panel was created in 2018 by the Liberals with a mandate to modernize antiquated broadcasting and media laws. Its 235-page report, titled \"Canada's Communications Future: Time To Act,\" contains 97 recommendations and is infused with a sense of urgency.</p><p>\"The need for this work has never been more urgent,\" panel chair Janet Yale told a news conference.</p><p>\"The pace of change is dizzying, the opportunities unprecedented and the risks - to our privacy as consumers, to our cultural sovereignty as a country, and to our economic competitiveness - are significant,\" she said.</p><p>The panel steered clear of the controversial taxes on digital platform providers such as Google and Facebook that are now the subject of international debate and even diplomatic tensions. France's plan to impose a digital tax on the American tech giants prompted Washington to threaten retaliatory tariffs. The Liberals' election platform proposed a three per cent tax on the revenue that such companies generate in the country and Guilbeault said Wednesday that Canada continues to discuss that issue with other countries.</p><p>However, the panel did say that online streaming companies such as Netflix, Apple TV and Disney+ should be required to contribute to Canadian content, a requirement that had long been sought by many Canadian producers and the media industry.</p><p>\"Culturally, the framework must ensure that Canada's creators continue to have the means for Canadian stories to be told and discovered in a world of so many choices,\" said the report. \"Netflix and other online streaming services would be required to devote a portion of their program budgets to Canadian programs.\"</p><p>Yale doubted that the proposed requirement would drive up costs for the streaming services. \"We do not think this is something that would be passed onto consumers or result in higher prices,\" she said.</p><p>\"If you benefit from operating in the Canadian system, you should contribute. It's a simple principle.\"</p><p>Significant recommendations include a remake of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to give the regulator more teeth and a bigger mandate in dealing with the digital giants. That would include giving the CRTC the power to impose spending requirements on media content providers and \"discoverability,\" or how content is displayed on a website.</p><p>But one expert said the new powers and responsibilities proposed for the regulatory agency would be \"wholly inappropriate,\" and likely run afoul of Canada's obligations under trade agreements and the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression.</p><p>\"I've got huge concerns with the massive regulatory structure that this envisages,\" said Michael Geist, a professor at the University of Ottawa. \"It's really unprecedented to see this level of regulation.</p><p>\"They want give the regulator huge powers to determine what ... the website looks like, what content they provide,\" he said. \"If it were to be implemented, it would be subject to challenge on a number of grounds and quite frankly the government ought to reject them.\"</p><p>But the report's recommendations won endorsement from others, such as the Directors Guild of Canada, ACTRA and the Canadian Media Producers Association.</p><p>Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, an advocacy group, applauded the panel's vision for the CBC with an expanded mandate for more Canadian content, a long-term commitment of federal funding and an end to all commercial advertising within five years.</p><p>\"I would say it is ambitious but appropriately so,\" said Daniel Bernhard, the group's executive director.</p><p>\"We have this absurd situation in Canada where our government policy has allowed foreign tech companies to basically asphyxiate Canadian media,\" Bernhard said. \"This blueprint is really what is necessary to ensure that our own cultural conversation and democratic conversation can survive.\"</p><p>Recognizing the importance of local news in a democracy, the panel also recommended that the $595 million journalism labour tax credit be extended beyond its five-year mandate which started in January 2019, \"in order to strengthen the capacity of news organizations over the long term.\"</p><p>It also says that the credit, which has mainly benefited print media, should be applied to news on all platforms, including broadcasting.</p><p>Crucially, the panel says that an uneven playing field exists between social media platforms such as Facebook and news media organizations, a tilt that should be corrected.</p><p>\"As a result of the imbalance in their bargaining power, news content creators are unable to individually negotiate terms over the use of their content by social media platforms,\" says the panel.</p><p>Newspaper publishers have long called for more information behind the closely guarded algorithms that the digital giants use to determine what articles are most read. This information, says the panel, could be made public to the publishers.</p><p>\"We believe that the best way to address misinformation and fake news is to have accurate, trusted and reliable sources of news,\" Yale said.</p><p>In terms of privacy and data breaches, the panel called on the federal government to harness the power of their collective agencies, such as the office of the privacy commissioner, to examine the scope of the problem.</p><p>That review should examine \"the use of Big Data by dominant online platform providers and potential threats to privacy, competition, consumer protection, cultural sovereignty, democratic institutions, and taxation, and make recommendations on legislation.\"</p><p>The panel also examined the role of advanced networks such as 5G. It did not go into whether Huawei equipment should be used in Canadian networks, which the United States says is a security risk.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

Legislation should be introduced to address harmful online material. The CBC should be advertising free. And a government tax credit to support local journalism should not just be extended, but also applied to broadcast media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those were among the recommendations in a highly anticipated report released by a legislative review panel Wednesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In response, the government said it would move swiftly on the suggested reforms. Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave him direction to table legislation in the government's first year and \"we will follow through on this promise.</p><p>\"Our goal is simple - to make the system more equitable than it is right now,\" he said. \"The technological changes that we have seen have made it so that our system doesn't work anymore.\"</p><p>Guilbeault said a measure like charging the GST on streaming services such as Netflix could be imposed soon, noting that Trudeau \"talked about probably the next budget, so this is something we can move very quickly.\"</p><p>Currently, only Quebec and Saskatchewan require at least the provincial sales taxes to be collected on streaming services. The report urges that the GST/HST be applied \"equitably\" to services provided by foreign online providers, saying it \"would eliminate the disadvantage to competing Canadian providers.\"</p><p>The six-member panel was created in 2018 by the Liberals with a mandate to modernize antiquated broadcasting and media laws. Its 235-page report, titled \"Canada's Communications Future: Time To Act,\" contains 97 recommendations and is infused with a sense of urgency.</p><p>\"The need for this work has never been more urgent,\" panel chair Janet Yale told a news conference.</p><p>\"The pace of change is dizzying, the opportunities unprecedented and the risks - to our privacy as consumers, to our cultural sovereignty as a country, and to our economic competitiveness - are significant,\" she said.</p><p>The panel steered clear of the controversial taxes on digital platform providers such as Google and Facebook that are now the subject of international debate and even diplomatic tensions. France's plan to impose a digital tax on the American tech giants prompted Washington to threaten retaliatory tariffs. The Liberals' election platform proposed a three per cent tax on the revenue that such companies generate in the country and Guilbeault said Wednesday that Canada continues to discuss that issue with other countries.</p><p>However, the panel did say that online streaming companies such as Netflix, Apple TV and Disney+ should be required to contribute to Canadian content, a requirement that had long been sought by many Canadian producers and the media industry.</p><p>\"Culturally, the framework must ensure that Canada's creators continue to have the means for Canadian stories to be told and discovered in a world of so many choices,\" said the report. \"Netflix and other online streaming services would be required to devote a portion of their program budgets to Canadian programs.\"</p><p>Yale doubted that the proposed requirement would drive up costs for the streaming services. \"We do not think this is something that would be passed onto consumers or result in higher prices,\" she said.</p><p>\"If you benefit from operating in the Canadian system, you should contribute. It's a simple principle.\"</p><p>Significant recommendations include a remake of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to give the regulator more teeth and a bigger mandate in dealing with the digital giants. That would include giving the CRTC the power to impose spending requirements on media content providers and \"discoverability,\" or how content is displayed on a website.</p><p>But one expert said the new powers and responsibilities proposed for the regulatory agency would be \"wholly inappropriate,\" and likely run afoul of Canada's obligations under trade agreements and the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression.</p><p>\"I've got huge concerns with the massive regulatory structure that this envisages,\" said Michael Geist, a professor at the University of Ottawa. \"It's really unprecedented to see this level of regulation.</p><p>\"They want give the regulator huge powers to determine what ... the website looks like, what content they provide,\" he said. \"If it were to be implemented, it would be subject to challenge on a number of grounds and quite frankly the government ought to reject them.\"</p><p>But the report's recommendations won endorsement from others, such as the Directors Guild of Canada, ACTRA and the Canadian Media Producers Association.</p><p>Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, an advocacy group, applauded the panel's vision for the CBC with an expanded mandate for more Canadian content, a long-term commitment of federal funding and an end to all commercial advertising within five years.</p><p>\"I would say it is ambitious but appropriately so,\" said Daniel Bernhard, the group's executive director.</p><p>\"We have this absurd situation in Canada where our government policy has allowed foreign tech companies to basically asphyxiate Canadian media,\" Bernhard said. \"This blueprint is really what is necessary to ensure that our own cultural conversation and democratic conversation can survive.\"</p><p>Recognizing the importance of local news in a democracy, the panel also recommended that the $595 million journalism labour tax credit be extended beyond its five-year mandate which started in January 2019, \"in order to strengthen the capacity of news organizations over the long term.\"</p><p>It also says that the credit, which has mainly benefited print media, should be applied to news on all platforms, including broadcasting.</p><p>Crucially, the panel says that an uneven playing field exists between social media platforms such as Facebook and news media organizations, a tilt that should be corrected.</p><p>\"As a result of the imbalance in their bargaining power, news content creators are unable to individually negotiate terms over the use of their content by social media platforms,\" says the panel.</p><p>Newspaper publishers have long called for more information behind the closely guarded algorithms that the digital giants use to determine what articles are most read. This information, says the panel, could be made public to the publishers.</p><p>\"We believe that the best way to address misinformation and fake news is to have accurate, trusted and reliable sources of news,\" Yale said.</p><p>In terms of privacy and data breaches, the panel called on the federal government to harness the power of their collective agencies, such as the office of the privacy commissioner, to examine the scope of the problem.</p><p>That review should examine \"the use of Big Data by dominant online platform providers and potential threats to privacy, competition, consumer protection, cultural sovereignty, democratic institutions, and taxation, and make recommendations on legislation.\"</p><p>The panel also examined the role of advanced networks such as 5G. It did not go into whether Huawei equipment should be used in Canadian networks, which the United States says is a security risk.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

Time now for a business update from the Fox Business Network. Here's Connell McShane.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: All right, markets are lower this morning. I'm going to start with a business alert on those markets. First, the futures here in the United States have been trending down. We're down 40 points on the Dow Futures this morning. One of the big stories that's been hanging over these markets is the foreclosure mess. Investors worried about what could happen to bank earnings if there is a foreclosure freeze. And we're down across the board there on the futures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Europeans stocks have also been declining on their morning session. And we're still down in Paris, but now London has turned it around, just slightly higher, almost changed. The Dax in Frankfurt has also turned higher, after being down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So we kick off a busy week for earnings this morning. Citigroup is expected to report its numbers; six cents a share in profit expected for the third quarter. Revenue expected to be about 21 billion dollars.</p><p>Now, bank stocks -- we referenced this when we updated the markets -- have been hammered recently, on all of those wars about a potential foreclosure freeze.</p><p>Two big tech names reporting after the bell today. IBM reports and so does Apple.</p><p>Now, here's some other top stories: still no deal between News Corp and Cablevision. Fox was taken off the air for Cablevision subscribers in New York and Philadelphia in a dispute over fees. It means viewers missed the baseball playoffs and also Sunday football, even losing out on the Fox Business Network. News Corp, the parent company of this network.</p><p>Now regulators seizing three banks in Kansas and Missouri on Friday. So that raises the total number of U.S. banks closed this year to 132. Premier Bank, West Bridge Bank and Trust, and Security Savings Bank the late casualties of mounting loans and the struggling economy. Those banks have been closed this year and -- the number of banks closed this year now compared to last year is higher.</p><p>So still seeing a number of bank closures around the country.</p><p>Another economic adviser is leaving the Obama administration. This time it is Alan Krueger, who was a top economics official at the Treasury Department. He's been an advisor to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and he is headed back to Princeton University, where he's a professor. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting this story late on Friday, and now the administration has confirmed that Krueger indeed is leaving.</p><p>Christina Romer, Larry Summers, Peter Orszag, all members of the president's economic team who left the administration recently.</p><p>All right, let's look at commodities here this morning to see where oil and gold are trading. Gold has been declining. It's down ten bucks even there at 1,362 an ounce, after the recent gains in last few weeks. Oil 81 bucks a barrel, so it's also down by 17 cents. So the dollar is a little stronger this morning, the commodities a little bit slower. Stocks are also moving down.</p><p>We'll stay on top of all that. Coming up in this hour, Bo Dietl, always fun, will be on with the I-Man. That is a little after 6:30 Eastern time. All this as IMUS IN THE MORNING gets started right here and right now, on the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY MOHR, ACTOR: My favorite part of -- he did I great job. And you don't see reviewers get this type of room for sprawling copy like this. It was refreshing to read. The best part, I thought, of the whole thing that AO Scott, in today's \"New York Times,\" about \"Hereafter\" was when he said Billie, played by Jay Mohr, that was incredible.</p><p>IMUS: You know, I did note, as long as you brought that up, he didn't make any observation about the competence of your performance.</p><p>MOHR: No --</p><p>IMUS: or lack of it.</p><p>MOHR: You are wrong, Don, if I can calm you Don. Very few can. He said -- I'll put it up here. \"Matt Damon's ability to receive messages from the dead loved ones of anyone he touches once made him a nice living. But despite the pleas of his entrepreneurial brother\" parentheses \"Jay Mohr,\" end parentheses, \"George has chosen a life of obscurity and manual labor.\"</p><p>See, you have to be able to read the subtext, Imus. He could have just said the brother, and put like Jim Brewer or Colin Quinn. But instead, he put me. He could have put anyone there.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you are in this movie.</p><p>MOHR: Let's not split atoms here.</p><p>IMUS: And Colin Quinn is not in movie. He's on Broadway.</p><p>MOHR: That'd be bizarre. Shut up, stupid. All of a sudden, Colin Quinn is in a Clint Eastwood movie. Oh, my God. Somewhere, you know -- what the hell are we doing here, Jesus.</p><p>That would be amazing to see Colin Quinn in a Clint Eastwood movie.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: Well, if you live in Manhattan, as Warner Wolf does, you don't have to worry about Cablevision, because Time Warner -- but I live in Connecticut, which is served by Cablevision. Here we got Terry Bradshaw and all of that coming, and they got all football coming, got baseball. Come on.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, PROGRAM ENGINEER: So you're fine.</p><p>IMUS: No, I wasn't. Not if you have Cablevision, you're not.</p><p>MCCORD: No, you're not. Believe me.</p><p>IMUS: You know what I had, Warner?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: I know, DirecTV.</p><p>IMUS: DirctTV.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: Signed up this morning. Man, because if I would have missed that game, I would have been on the phone to Rupert. Maybe not. Cavuto, I guess. Somebody. Anyway, well, the jets were luck to win.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, they were.</p><p>WOLF: Well, big interference penalty at the end.</p><p>IMUS: That was a joke. Well, it was interference, but --</p><p>WOLF: They wouldn't have called it unless the guy pulled the receiver's face mask. That was it.</p><p>IMUS: Right. So then the Jets, of course, scored. Texas went into Nebraska, into Lincoln, and beat them. And they finally put the -- they took T-stupid out -- well, he's not stupid. They took T-Magic out, and but Zach Lee back in, but they put him in too late.</p><p>WOLF: Too late.</p><p>IMUS: So Colts managed to win last night.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, they did.</p><p>IMUS: But they were lucky.</p><p>WOLF: Man.</p><p>IMUS: Come on.</p><p>WOLF: Come on.</p><p>IMUS: And the Giants won last night.</p><p>WOLF: No, the Phillies won.</p><p>IMUS: That is what I meant. They beat the Giants. What did I say?</p><p>WOLF: You got it.</p><p>IMUS: You know why I said that, Warner? Because I'm an idiot. I should leave this to you.</p><p>Anyway, Warner will have all the sports. Charles is going to have news. Bo Dietl coming up. And man, Jeanette Walls and, of course, Big Foot comes in and says, you know, we used to have her on the program once in a while. I said, really? When we were at MSNBC, I guess she was -- she was a gossip of something.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Entertainment reporter.</p><p>IMUS: Entertainment Reporter. She wrote \"The Glass Castle,\" which is a memoir of her life. And it has been a best-seller since it was published,. a memoir. And then she wrote \"Half Broke Horses,\" which -- I read them both. I just finished \"Half Broke Horses\" over the weekend. It is so good, it is stupid.</p><p>And so, we'll talk to her. I mean, \"Half Broke Horses\" -- she writes it in the voice of her grandmother, who grew up on a ranch about 20 miles from the ranch I grew up on in northern Arizona. And she writes -- it is so skillfully written. It's one of those deals. I mean, if you were -- if I were to tell you that the entertainment reporter at some dopey cable channel could write like this, you would just say get out of here. Leave the room. It's like Will James with good grammar.</p><p>MCCORD: Get out of my face.</p><p>IMUS: Man, it is so good, it's ridiculous. And then from the dark side, Frank Rich. And Frank, of course -- how is Frank going to explain \"the New York Post\" endorsing Andrew Cuomo? Well, he'll have -- he'll spin that some way, so... Did you read it this weekend, Bernard.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: No, I did not.</p><p>IMUS: I did and I couldn't tell you, if you held a gun on me, what it was -- I might be able to.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>MCCORD: It was -- it was a rant, nearly.</p><p>IMUS: Whining about something.</p><p>MCCORD: About everything political.</p><p>IMUS: Dig debate tonight between Carl Paladino and Andrew Cuomo. And Carl Paladino will be here this morning.</p><p>MCCORD: Excellent.</p><p>IMUS: So we'll talk to him.</p><p>MCCORD: Good.</p><p>IMUS: Connell McShane and Dagen are here, of course. Bernie, Lou Rufino, Warner Wolf. And Charles has the news. What's going on, Charles?.</p><p>MCCORD: Politics, I-Man. November may be coming too soon for the Democrats. As he campaigned last night at the huge rally in Ohio, the president acknowledged that his party faces a tough fight come the elections. Quickly now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Just like you did in 2008, you can defy the conventional wisdom. Everybody said, no, you can't. And in 2008 you showed them, yes, we can.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: That must have been at Ohio University, right?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, it was. Yes. Speaking before a cheering crowd, there; 35,000 was the estimate at the university. Mr. Obama again accusing Republicans of siding with special interests, such as insurance companies and Wall Street banks.</p><p>Meanwhile, the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans in the first midterms of the president's term is no myth, and his party could suffer hugely in a couple of weeks because of it. Just half of those who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 say they will definitely show up November 2nd. Two thirds of those who voted for McCain last election say they are certain, though, that they are going to vote next month.</p><p>IMUS: You know, those figures that you just gave -- I mean, you just -- it is stupid.</p><p>MCCORD: Just polling, I-Man.</p><p>IMUS: But I mean they change minute by minute.</p><p>MCCORD: You are absolutely right.</p><p>IMUS: We have this guy Scott Rasmussen. Do you know who he is, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Of course.</p><p>IMUS: We're going to have him on tomorrow, see what he has to say. So today is Chuck Berry's birthday. How old do you think Chuck is?</p><p>MCCORD: Chuck Berry is -- unbelievably is 85 years old today -- 85 years old.</p><p>IMUS: You must have looked or something. He's 84.</p><p>MCCORD: No, I didn't look. No, I didn't look. Why did you say -- OK.</p><p>IMUS: When I was in high school in Preston, Arizona, I saw him, Fats Domino, the Platters, Little Richard, Laverne Baker all in the same show.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, my god.</p><p>IMUS: Like two bucks.</p><p>MCCORD: That's history.</p><p>IMUS: That duck walk thing.</p><p>MCCORD: An historical event.</p><p>IMUS: Warner, time for a little sports. Well, let me do Connell first and then we'll do sports. A little business news here from Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-Man. I guess the big local business story you already mentioned at the top of the show, the dispute between News Corp and Cablevision. But imagine the outrage from people this morning when they realized they can't see the I-Man, much less football and baseball over the weekend.</p><p>IMUS: Another reason to get that DirecTV.</p><p>MCSHANE: I know. I have Verizon Fios at home. But no update on that. Just yet.</p><p>IMUS: I'll be darned.</p><p>MCSHANE: I don't know why I mentioned that. We'll keep following that one.</p><p>IMUS: Probably get it for nothing, now that you mentioned it. Cut you some slack on that bill.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, no, definitely paying the bills.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>MCCORD: Out there copping it off the pole.</p><p>IMUS: Got Rex Walls -- he's dead, unfortunately -- Jeanette's father to hot wire it for you.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, definitely not doing that. Another sign of the tough financial times; donation to charities have gone down, or at least they did last year. There were some new numbers that are out this morning; donation dropped by 11 percent last year. And that is actually the biggest decline we have seen in 20 years. So we have that.</p><p>As for the markets this morning, futures are a little bit lower again today. And, an oil and gold are also moving down, at least so far.</p><p>IMUS: Thank you, Connell. Twelve minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time for a little sports now. And here with that is Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Good morning, I-man. So the Jets go five and one, beat the Broncos, 24-20. Winning touchdown set-up, a huge fourth down interference called at the Bronco two.</p><p>IMUS: You know, the funniest thing, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: What?</p><p>IMUS: I was watching the Patriots, who came back and beat the Ravens, by the way -- they were luck to win that. And then they had a shot up in the owner's box there at Foxboro. And Rex Ryan was up there high-fiving a bunch of people in the box.</p><p>WOLF: Rex Ryan.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, it wasn't -- I turned it on, it wasn't him. It was Bob Craft. But he has gotten so fat -- oh, man...</p><p>WOLF: Couldn't tell the difference.</p><p>IMUS: Bob, come on, baby.</p><p>MCCORD: He's eating that cheese.</p><p>IMUS: God, he's fat. I mean, he's just so fat 00 and I always like to see fat white guys the high-fiving.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>IMUS: All right, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Vikings beat the Cowboys, 24-21. So the Cowboys dropped to one and four.</p><p>IMUS: That is a mess down there.</p><p>LEE RUFINO, \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\": How great is that!</p><p>IMUS: What, that 50 billion dollar stadium --</p><p>RUFINO: And they suck! And they suck. .</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>WOLF: The rams, you know, they won only two games all last year. They won their third yesterday.</p><p>IMUS: Beat somebody pretty good, right?</p><p>WOLF: Upset the Chargers. Chargers have now lost to the Raiders and the Rams, back-to-back.</p><p>IMUS: That ain't right.</p><p>WOLF: No. Ben Roethlisberger returned; three touchdown passes, Steelers beat the Browns. But the Browns finally have a quarterback. Colt McCoy started, 23 for 33, 281 yards. He's their guy.</p><p>IMUS: From Texas. I know that kid can play.</p><p>WOLF: Yes. Giants held on and beat the Lions, 28-20. The Eagles beat the Falcons, 31-17. Now this was funny. Andy Reid told Michael Vick to stay in the clubhouse during the game, because in case Kevin Colb had a bad game, he didn't want the fans yelling we want Vick. Colb Carl was 23 for 29, 326 yards and three touchdowns. So they asked Reid, I-Man, after the game, if Michael Vick was still his number one quarterback.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDY REID, EAGLES HEAD COACH: Yeah. Yeah. As long as us guys want him to play, we'll play him.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's your starting quarterback?</p><p>REID: I told you he was before. Yes, he's our starting quarterback, yeah.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Andy Reid -- 49ers, Seahawks and Texans win. The two overtime games, the Dolphins beat the Packers and the Patriots winning on the field goal by Gastowsky (ph). And last night Colts beat the Redskins, 27-24. They had almost 500 yards.</p><p>And tonight, the Titans will beat --</p><p>IMUS: The problem was the Redskins had a shot, but McNabb threw that interception.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, they gave him a shot, surprisingly. Peyton Manning threw three passes incomplete with 2:42, rather than running out the clock.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Who is coaching that team?</p><p>WOLF: That's Mike McCarthy. No, Colts -- No. No, that's Giant -- that is Jim Caldwell.</p><p>IMUS: You have been spending too much time in the tanning booth, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Real quick to baseball...</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>IMUS: Do that again.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE)</p><p>IMUS: That's great, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: The Phillies beat the Giants, six to one. So that series is tied. And tonight, Cliff Lee will beat the Yankees, allowing only one earned run and five hits.</p><p>IMUS: See, that is what everybody thinks.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Everybody has been afraid of game three. Oh, God, we have to face Cliff Lee. Here's my prediction --</p><p>WOLF: What is it?</p><p>IMUS: Yankees six, Rangers two.</p><p>WOLF: Six runs off Cliff Lee.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: Come on, I-Man.</p><p>IMUS: He won't make it past the sixth inning, fifth inning.</p><p>WOLF: Fifth inning?</p><p>IMUS: Yes, out.</p><p>WOLF: I have to write that down. Cliff Lee after five out.</p><p>IMUS: Happy birthday to Chuck Berry.</p><p>(NEWS BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: Twenty two minutes after the hour here on TH IMUS IN THE MORNING, brought to you by Mohegan Sun.

I just I was so overcome by the music, and the people and the place. And Levon is frankly the nicest person I have ever met on this planet. And I just -- you throw your hands up in the air and sing Hallelujah. It was just one of those moments.</p><p>IMUS: Did you or Rollo do anything that I will now have to call Barbara, Levon or Sandy and apologize for?</p><p>MCDOWELL: : I was on my best behavior. Jonas was on his best behavior. He had laryngitis.</p><p>IMUS: Who would Jonas be?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Rollo had laryngitis, so that is always a good thing. I kept my shoes on. I was a lady. And -- although I did... What did you just do?</p><p>IMUS: I said, did you keep your pants on? I apologize for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, no, no, that is a valid question, actually.</p><p>IMUS: You had some spare drawers with you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I did ride up there in our beat up old Land Rover with curlers in my hair, so I would have good loft when we got there. And Jonas was on the verge of letting me get out of the car with them still in my hair. But we averted that disaster because he's a good man. But it was -- I thanked everybody for let meeting come up.</p><p>IMUS: What's going on in business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I get all overcome and I get teary-eyed.</p><p>IMUS: Get under come now and do some business news.</p><p>MCDOWELL: My morning, you know, the whole thing, anyway. Stupid kicks ass, we know that. Specifically, \"Jackass 3D.\" It pulled in 50 million dollars in the weekend box office. That is a record take for an October movie opening. That is all you need to know. Somebody getting hit in the face, with a giant flour covered hand, that's what people want to watch.</p><p>IMUS: Just two people think that -- two people at my house think that is funny, Me and Wyatt.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is hilarious. And despite all the horrible reviews, 50 million dollars. That is a huge take for any movie, particularly one that -- well, somebody gets strapped into a Port-a-John and vaulted into the air.</p><p>IMUS: It is 25 after the hour. Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, sir.</p><p>IMUS: Time for a little briefing from Bernard McGuirk, sponsored by PC Richard and Son. Good morning, Bernard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The election, of course, a little over two weeks away and understandably, it got very ugly out there over the weekend. The McCains, dad -- John McCain and Meghan McCain were at it. First Meghan McCain with Christiane Amanpour on ABC yesterday killing Christine O'Donnell.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: Barbara Boxer is the most bitter --..</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF JOHN MCCAIN: Christine O'Donnell is making a mockery of running for public office. She has no real history, no real success in any kind of business. And what that says to my generation is one day you can just wake up and run for Senate, no matter how lack of experience you have. And it scares me for a lot of reasons.</p><p>And I just know in my group of friends it just turns people off, because she is seen as a nut job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: A nut job, wow. Run for Senate no matter what lack of experience you have. Sounds like she could have been describing the president, but it was Christine O'Donnell. And Senator McCain was out --</p><p>IMUS: That's kind of a stretch for you just to take a whack at the president. So -- in your --..</p><p>MCGUIRK: No experience.</p><p>IMUS: This crusade you are on to bash our president. He's having a hard time. And you know why he's having a hard time? Because he has no idea what he's doing. At least you ought to cut him some slack.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Michelle to the rescue.</p><p>IMUS: Hope that Obama 2.0 just doesn't bankrupt us. Well, we already are bankrupt. Whatever, go ahead.</p><p>MCGUIRK: So, anyway, John McCain was out in California campaigning for Carly Fiorina, who is running to try to dethrone Senator Boxer out there. And had some harsh words about Senator Boxer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCAIN: Barbara Boxer is the most bitterly partisan, most anti- defense senator in the United States Senate today. I know that because I have had the unpleasant experience of having to serve with her.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Straight talk.</p><p>IMUS: Back to that now that he doesn't have to run for anything.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Maureen Dowd got in on the action, chief. She had a column yesterday.</p><p>IMUS: I read it, I couldn't recite a word of it. I couldn't tell what it was like at gunpoint, so you tell me.</p><p>MCGUIRK: She apparently is suffering from Sarah Palin envy. And she was hating on all the strong Republican women candidates out there.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, I read it. She took a cheap shot at the governor of Arizona. I thought that was gratuitous when she said she was sitting out in the sun -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- and got a tan or something, and then she was afraid the governor was going to arrest her. She was at Hoover Dam.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's right, making a citizen's arrest.</p><p>IMUS: That is just stupid.</p><p>MCGUIRK: It went on to resorting to stereotypes to describe these Republican candidates, as Republican mean girls, \"grown up versions of those teenage tormenters, who would steal your boyfriend, spray paint your locker, and just for good measure, spread rumors that you were pregnant.\"</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, in any case, Dana Perino wrote a column responding. Her column was entitled \"Mean Maureen.\" And she said it must be hard to be that angry all the time. Two can play that game, sister. And so it's just getting ugly out there.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Dana Perino and Maureen Dowd going at it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, Dana Perino responded directly to Maureen Dowd.</p><p>IMUS: Somehow we ought to be able to mine that for something, right? Twenty eight minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. The great Sam Moore is going to be here tomorrow. He's in town for something. I got an e-mail from his wife. Sam is on the Imus Ranch Record two, What is the date today, Lou?</p><p>RUFINO: Eighteenth.</p><p>IMUS: It will be out in a few days, the 26th. It has been in the top 100 at Amazon for a couple weeks now and it's not even out. But he sings - - you heard the record he did on the Imus Record.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, I have, \"I Hope to Shout.\"</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, he'll be here tomorrow for -- I don't know I don't think he's going to sing. Sam is just hard to deal with. But he was -- I only had to submit about 300 songs to get him to do this. But then when he did it -- do you have it, Lou?</p><p>RUFINO: Give me a second.</p><p>IMUS: When he did it, he went down to Nashville and he had and Kyle Lenning (ph) did it. And I mean, they -- it was a country song, used to be a country song, you know.</p><p>MCCORD: Hit it out of the park.</p><p>IMUS: It was the number one country song, a way long time ago. So, do you have it yet, Lou?</p><p>RUFINO: No, hold on.</p><p>IMUS: You don't.</p><p>RUFINO: I'll tell you.</p><p>IMUS: These computers are so slow. And now the wheels are coming off the program.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, the Imus Ranch Record will be out.</p><p>MCCORD: It's worth waiting for.</p><p>IMUS: On the 26th, and this is Sam Moore from that record.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: I'm not afraid of living, and I'm not afraid of dying, I'm just afraid we'll going to go five minutes without talking about me.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Fearless talk radio. IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update, from the FOX Business Network, here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Here comes your latest \"FOX Business Minute.\" And another sign of tough financial times, charitable donations down 11 percent last year, worst decline in 20 years since the Chronicle of Philanthropy began to keep track this. The reports throughout the day choose the United Way and the Salvation Army continue to dominate the rankings despite the declines in 2009.</p><p>Now, at the same time, put it up, sales of luxury goods are rebounding, the free recession levels sales of designer clothes to wealthy Americans and newly rich Chinese helping to fuel a stronger than expected rebound in this category. Studies out from Bane and Company, it shows global sales expected to surge by 10 percent this year, at $235 billion, following a disastrous 2009.</p><p>And Ford Motor Company denying media reports that it plans to sell its 11 percent stake in Mazda. Fords spokesman says, the company does not comment on speculation about its stake but the company's relationship with Mazda has not changed. Japanese newspaper reporting over the weekend that partners of Mazda are in talks now to buy Ford shares and a decision likely to be made by the end of the year.</p><p>All right. Quick look at the futures as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues, here, the Dow futures, down 32 points, on FOX Business, the power to prosper.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: What time is the party?</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, at 6:00 p.m., it would be great to see you there. You and Charles.</p><p>IMUS: I wonder what time we should plan on arriving.</p><p>MCCORD: Well, you don't want to arrive right at 6:00, you know, a few minutes after...</p><p>IMUS: So, 6:00 until when?</p><p>MCSHANE: Actually, it will be late until whenever, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: It's one of those kinds of parties.</p><p>MCCORD: Open ended.</p><p>MCSHANE: I believe, it's 6:00 to 10:00 p.m. You can come around 7:00, 7:15.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>MCSHANE: We'll see you there, all right?</p><p>IMUS: When we walk in the door, you know who will be behind us?</p><p>MCSHANE: Who?</p><p>IMUS: Jesus.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: All right, it is 23 until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio, all over the country, on the FOX Business Networkall over the world.

Well, congratulations on Jeannette Walls.</p><p>IMUS: No, no, leave her alone.</p><p>DIETL: You know what? Your mother, father, out on the street, sucking on some dumpster, I'll be damned, if you physically don't go out and pick them up. I said, yes, nice book, Jeannette, go out there and pick them up, I don't care if they are loony or toony, you go pick them up, you bring them home, have a nice turkey dinner for them, cook for them, take care of them and, they mentally go off the end of the rope, you got to be there.</p><p>IMUS: They did all that.</p><p>DIETL: Yes, right. Give me, yes, she wrote two freaking books, that what she did. And idiots like you read them and believe this garbage, go help your mom out there, my mother was alive I helped her, I had four women taking care of her and I didn't pay my doctors -- before a woman took care of her.</p><p>IMUS: That's fine. But, I mean, maybe I'm presenting -- you need to, you need to read the books.</p><p>DIETL: You know what that is? That's what people like you got no life, read these freaking books and go to la, la land, really, life is out there, things are hot, these books are...</p><p>IMUS: I know all about that.</p><p>DIETL: Go take care of your mother and father, Jeannette Walls, whatever your name is, don't write books about it, take care of them.</p><p>IMUS: I know that.</p><p>DIETL: You want to write books, I can write all the books of the world about my defunctation (ph) of my life, you know what, it is all about taking charge of your life, and if you have a mother and father left, go take care of them.</p><p>IMUS: I at one time was homeless, as you know, so, nobody have given me anything.

All these morons, all they got to do Sunday afternoon, oh, they worry about reading books, I have to worry about making a payroll every Friday.</p><p>IMUS: So, anyway, she's in her car, she's in Park Avenue, she's a big time entertainment reporter and she's driving down the street, and she sees her mother rummaging through a dumpster. And so, she scoots down in the cab.</p><p>DIETL: Yes. Heights.</p><p>IMUS: Goes back to her apartment.</p><p>DIETL: That was a real good move. Great move, or she just tell the chauffer, just keep driving, don't stop for that light. Come on, Don, think about it, yes, read the book very up and down, you know what life is about? Life is about pelts, it's like that stuff that comes out of the...</p><p>IMUS: You know, you need to understand the family dynamic.</p><p>MCCORD: The context.</p><p>IMUS: And the context. She wasn't ignoring her. There wasn't anything they could do.</p><p>DIETL: \"The New York Times\" best-seller, because people like you, that is all you read, that garbage. Read about life, man, read about people, read about those Vietnam veterans there who are living homeless out there. Let's help them, let's spend a few more billion dollars, give them some housing.</p><p>IMUS: I agree, but one doesn't have anything to do...</p><p>DIETL: Yes, it does, because people like you, waste your time reading that garbage. When you should be out there with the reality of life, there are people who are going bankrupt, every day.</p><p>IMUS: Then, I just read \"Born to Run\" which is a great book, you know, you should be going barefoot.</p><p>DIETL: Yes, I know, but that's a good thing, a guy told me, remember those stupid things with the toes.</p><p>IMUS: Yes -- and the five fingers...</p><p>DIETL: I may be going barefoot soon the way this economy is going.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, so, I want you to give me your shoes, I'll hold them for you.

Everybody, if you're a lesbian, if you're gay, live your life.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTLETT: Don't shove my face in it.</p><p>DIETL: You know, Paladino, tonight you going to take on Cuomo tonight?</p><p>BARTLETT: Between the spray can and the tie, I mean...</p><p>DIETL: You are a...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DIETL: That is not spray tan.

China says the U.S. may be unfairly supporting its own green industry.

Get out!</p><p>ANNOUNCER: IMUS, IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Here's what happens when -- here's Charles McCord explains -- here's the thing about Dagen, she walked into the restroom here at FOX...</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: ...barefoot, and here's what happens when you flush the toilet, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: When you flush a toilet, unseen is a cloud of microscopic droplets that are emitted by the flush and you get this cloud that you don't even realize, nobody does, and it is unfortunate, because the droplets all settle to the floor.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, that is why you should always close the...</p><p>MCCORD: Close the lid if a toilet has a lid and regrettably the toilets here do not.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Number one, I was at the sink. Number two...</p><p>IMUS: Well no, you're walking on the floor in the bathroom, you are not getting this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, number two, you didn't know this, but if possible, if the door opens out, I always open the door with my feet, because I don't want to touch the handle. And I also flush the toilet, with my shoes. So my feet have been a lot of places. So, probably...</p><p>IMUS: Oh, I bet that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. And number three, my feet are not the only bare thing on my body that have been in a public restroom in my time on earth. So, I'm not really worried about it. You know, I still can see, I don't have any open sores right now. So, I'm OK.</p><p>MCCORD: They've all healed up.</p><p>IMUS: Charles peed in the sink once.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: I dispute that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I've done that, too.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Who hasn't?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Gosh. You know, what?</p><p>IMUS: Nothing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hanging your bare ass over the side of the bowl.</p><p>IMUS: No, no, no, blah blah blah.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update, from the Fox Business Networkhere's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: And here's your latest look at the markets here, 7:00 Eastern Time, we have been down in the futures ahead of the open on Wall Street, it remains lower by 36 points on Dow futures with NASDAQ and S&amp;P futures also declining.</p><p>And let's over go to Europe this morning where things have been a little bit better. We are down -- we're up in -- in London, down in Paris and -- and up in Frankfurt, so a mixed picture there. The thought of more foreclosures has been hanging -- or foreclosure freeze and what have you, and the talk of that and the markets has been kind of hanging over things and that's hurt the banking stocks in recent days. We'll see if that carries into the new week of trading.</p><p>But it will be a busy one for earnings; that will probably be the focus of -- of Wall Street this week. Citigroup expected to report its profit this morning and expecting a profit last quarter of six cents a share and revenue of about $21 billion; so Citi stock up a little ahead of the number.</p><p>And two big tech names will also report today both after the bell: IBM and Apple, and here's Apple, the sales expected of $19 billion for Apple and the stock trading almost $316 a share this morning. So the gains continue there.</p><p>Now, other top stories that we have for you, the White House says it continues to say it's not in favor of a nationwide freeze on home foreclosures. Shaun Donovan the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, saying, quote, \"A national blanket moratorium on all foreclosure sales would do far more harm than good.\"</p><p>Some Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, supporting a temporary freeze on foreclosures; he worries about a freeze and what it would do to earnings have been what's been hurting those bank stocks that we referenced there a few minutes ago.</p><p>And still no deal between News Corp and Cablevision. Fox Network taken off the air for Cablevision's subscribers in New York and Philadelphia in a dispute over fees. It means viewers missed the baseball playoffs and Sunday football as well even losing out on the Fox Business Network. Now, News Corp is the parent company of this network.</p><p>And just moments ago, Hasbro, reported a third quarter profit of $1.09 a share, the revenue there, $1.3 billion, both numbers beating Wall Street estimates from the toy company which says it continues to believe it will be able to grow a revenue and earnings per share for the full year 2010, Hasbro in with its earnings this morning.</p><p>Again, we're still waiting for Citigroup and we'll have that number as soon as it comes out.</p><p>Now, let's go to commodities, to see where oil and gold had been trading. The oil price is around $81, gold has been declining here this morning, in fact it's down by more than $10, $1,361 for an ounce of spot gold.</p><p>And later on in the hour, the author, Jeannette Walls will be on with Imus to talk about her new book. So stay tuned for that and a whole a lot more as the IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues here on the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Have you ever e-mailed or texted a picture of your penis to anyone?</p><p>JAY MOHR, ACTOR: I have -- I have not.</p><p>IMUS: Ok. Why -- why somebody would do that, thinking, I don't know, what the reaction is going to be, do you have any idea?</p><p>MOHR: I have no idea why? And, it's odd, both sides, they're like culpable in being strange and acting oddly, in my opinion. I mean, to take a picture of your crank and send it to people you've got to have a screw loose, I mean, that's -- that's you're first clue that Colonel Moss (ph) is a bad guy.</p><p>But, to save it for two years and -- and then claim sexual harassment. It's kind of harassment when it happens, not two years later, just think that that lady walked around with Brett Favre's -- football in her phone for two years, you know.</p><p>There's just some things that you get rid of, you know? If somebody sends you like, a clown porn --</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MOHR: -- you just throw it away, the second the DVD arrives, you go, this is -- this has been a horrible mistake and you've got to toss that.</p><p>I was at a Knicks game and I was sitting next to Justin Tuck of the New York Giants. And he's a house. And, my friend, who is a comic, as a joke took a picture of himself while he was using the restroom and he sent it to me on my phone. And I'm sitting next to Justin Tuck of the Giants and I look at my phone and I see this disgusting photo. And like a moron I look at Justin Tuck and I go, look what my friend just sent me a picture of, look at this. Justin Tuck gets up and switched seats.</p><p>And I -- and my first response is like, wow, he's up tight and then I came home and told my wife and she goes -- no, you can't show other men pictures of strangers' penises and expect them to keep their seat next to you at Madison Square Garden. That's a very strange way to behave and I went, well, ok.</p><p>So, keeping that in mind, Brett Favre is a moron --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, NEWSMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: One of the ten best books according to the \"New York Times\" -- I'm glad Bo is not here. You know he's actually pretty good, he can be. One of the ten best books of 2009, \"Half Broke Horses\", Jeannette Walls.</p><p>MCCORD: Ok.</p><p>IMUS: And it's out in paperback and we're going to talk with her this morning. And of course, she also wrote the \"Glass Castle\", which is a memoir. This is -- she describes is a true life novel and the reason she does, it's about her grandmother and her parents and her, but it's -- because I guess she couldn't reconcile certain facts and stuff but she writes it in her grandmother's voice and it's -- is really magnificent.</p><p>And I should be wearing a pink tie, I keep saying that, shouldn't I? It's like hanging out with Frank Rich.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh that tie will do.</p><p>IMUS: Well, what's wrong with this tie?</p><p>MCCORD: Nothing.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, so she's coming up, we'll talk to her. And then I'm going to post on Imus.com the 15 best books that I read this year. That you can then -- I don't know when we're going to that, today or maybe tomorrow or sometime and you can click on them and buy them at Amazon, I believe.</p><p>MCCORD: Excellent.</p><p>IMUS: And the Imus Cattle Ranch for Kids with Cancer gets a percentage of that.</p><p>MCCORD: More, more excellent. Ok.</p><p>IMUS: And then you can also go to Imus.com and click on the Imus Ranch Record 2 and that goes to -- and then the ranch gets money for that.</p><p>MCCORD: Come on.</p><p>IMUS: And that will be out, October 26th, another week or something like that.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So anyway, Jeannette Walls is coming up and then later on this morning, from the dark side, the hater, his panties -- his little panties is all in a knot yesterday.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And Frank Rich, he'll be on. And we're going to talk to Frank about -- first thing I'll do is I mention AO Scott who reviewed \"The Hereafter\" -- and what a magnificent -- because all of these various writers, and I know a lot of them, they -- except Pete Hamill but the rest of them, they hate it when you mention some of the other writers.</p><p>MCCORD: You see them flinch.</p><p>IMUS: Lupica, you can see his jaw line, he's such grinding his teeth.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And wants to call his dad -- that he robbed out. All right, seven after the hour. So Bernie is coming up, Dagen and Connell --</p><p>MCCORD: I'll take you out.</p><p>IMUS: -- and Lou Rufino is in and of course, the great Warner Wolf and last night Warner --</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: -- the Phillies won. Right?</p><p>WOLF: They won 6-1, Oswalt, eight innings, three hits.</p><p>IMUS: And then the Colts, their Donald McMahon (ph) if he hadn't to thrown that interception they might have lost.</p><p>WOLF: Well, it was 27-24 and inexplicably, the Colts rather than just try to rundown the clock threw three incompletes and gave the Redskins the ball back.</p><p>IMUS: And then a couple of other big upsets, the Cowboys lost.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And went to --</p><p>WOLF: 1-4.</p><p>IMUS: Yes and college football, a couple of great games. Man, what's going to happen, when Auburn and LSU this weekend, right?</p><p>WOLF: That's a big game.</p><p>IMUS: And the number 9, against 7 or whatever it is.</p><p>WOLF: Yes well, Auburn is now number 4.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, they are?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Who is number one this time?</p><p>WOLF: Well, number one this week --</p><p>IMUS: Because Ohio State lost.</p><p>WOLF: That's right. Ohio State drops from 1 to 10.</p><p>IMUS: Oh man.</p><p>WOLF: And Oklahoma number one; Oregon number 2, without playing.</p><p>IMUS: And Texas went into Lincoln, Nebraska and beat them, Nebraska was number 5.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So --</p><p>WOLF: Well, they dropped to 14.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man. Oh man this is a -- so all of the sports coming up and let's start with Chuck in the news -- Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: A couple of things that we didn't get to last hour, I-Man. First of all, Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be hiding close to each other in houses in northwest Pakistan according to a senior NATO official who remains anonymous because of the sensitive nature of he's talking about.</p><p>IMUS: What? Like a little cul de sac. Or what?</p><p>MCCORD: He know -- not exactly but he says nobody in al Qaeda is living in a cave. Rather the top leadership is believed to be living in relative comfort as he described it.</p><p>IMUS: Oh it's great and millions of people in this country are losing their homes and these two bastards got a nice pad, get the hell out of here.</p><p>MCCORD: Bingo, downtown, J.D., Imus they are protected by locals and some members of the Pakistani Intelligence Services, although Pakistan has repeatedly denied protecting members of the al Qaeda leadership based on that.</p><p>And a French official is calling this a real threat from al Qaeda, the Interior Minister says Saudi Intelligence Services warning of a potential attack by an al Qaeda group against Europe and in particular, France, latest in a series of alerts now to put French Security Forces and others on high alert.</p><p>And in this country the 20-year-old Jordanian man who got caught in an FBI sting, thought he was going to blow up a Dallas skyscraper and the whole thing was a set up. He is expected to be sentenced, scheduled today, Federal Court, Dallas just blocks away from the 60 story office tower he had targeted.</p><p>And then, also in Texas, more soldiers expected on the witness stand, for the second week of a hearing to determine whether Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan will actually go to trial for last year's deadly shootings at Fort Hood.</p><p>And reaching out in particular to young people, we're told, to African-Americans, to women as he tries to energize those constituencies, Ohio State University yesterday, President Obama, urging an enthusiastic crowd of 35,000 to overcome the cynicism of our politics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And if they take over Congress, the other side has already promised to roll back health reforms so that insurance companies can go back to deny you coverage when you get sick. They want to roll back Wall Street reforms so that taxpayers can be on the hook for the next bailout.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: So there you go, Mr. Obama, Delaware, Massachusetts --</p><p>IMUS: Obamacare, Bernie is right. Taxes going up --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Taxes going up, grandma going down.</p><p>MCCORD: Getting ready to head out, at mid-week he goes to Portland, Oregon, Seattle and San Francisco on Thursday.</p><p>IMUS: Who is running the country?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCCORD: Los Angeles and Las Vegas on Friday and Minneapolis next Saturday.</p><p>IMUS: All right, 11 after the hour, here is Jeannette Walls' five favorite songs, \"Bird on a Wire\", Leonard Cohen.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: \"Leaboys Lassie\", Mary Black; \"Landslide\", not the original, but the one by the Dixie Chicks, which was a good record; \"Where I Go\", Natalie Merchant; \"What a Wonderful World\", Louie Armstrong. It's not a horrible list.</p><p>By the way I got 150 finalists for the song contest, with thousands of entries.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Except they were sent to me in an XL format that we can't print out so they have to work that out, Leslie or somebody before I can go through and pick a winner.</p><p>MCCORD: Ok.</p><p>IMUS: And 100 runners up.</p><p>All right, with a little Fox Business Networkbusiness report, here is Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-Man, it's a busy week for corporate earnings to see how much money the companies are making --</p><p>IMUS: I have the hiccups, if you don't mind.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh just stop eating everything.</p><p>MCSHANE: You have what?</p><p>IMUS: Well, there's a --</p><p>MCSHANE: Hiccups?</p><p>IMUS: I'm starving to death.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh please.</p><p>IMUS: Well, not starving. I'm sorry, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: You should be, yes. So we have a busy week for corporate earnings here.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I am.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good. Citigroup is going to report in the next hour or so.</p><p>IMUS: I'm not doing anything.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, Citigroup will be reporting in the next hour or so and then IBM reports after the bell tonight, and so does Apple. Do you know how much Apple stock price is these days, I-Man, $316 per share of Apple, it's up about 50 percent this year.</p><p>IMUS: And now the Sirius --</p><p>MCSHANE: Why am I hitting my mike?</p><p>IMUS: That's fine, now the Sirius Satellite XM deal is up to a buck and change?</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's flying high.</p><p>MCCORD: On the way.</p><p>IMUS: We've to get up to what I bought it for, $5.17.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh man.</p><p>MCCORD: We're on our way.</p><p>IMUS: It's 12 minutes after the hour.</p><p>All right, time for sports and here with that is Warner Wolf sports, sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Good morning Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Good morning, I-Man. Baseball playoffs last night, the Phillies beat the Giants, 6-1 Oswald, eight innings three hits, Jimmy Rollins (ph) three runs and double in the seventh and broke open so the series is tied, 1-1.</p><p>IMUS: And is that Yankee game tonight, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: Tonight at 8:10.</p><p>IMUS: Oh man, what's the Monday night football game?</p><p>WOLF: The Monday night football game is the Titans and the Jags.</p><p>IMUS: Oh who cares about that?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh come on.</p><p>IMUS: I'm watching baseball.</p><p>WOLF: Turn your sets off now.</p><p>IMUS: Now, yes.</p><p>WOLF: The Titans will win that game, by the way, 24-21, on Rob Varona's (ph) 33-yard-field goal with three seconds left.</p><p>IMUS: Oh ok.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Exciting.</p><p>WOLF: So Texas and the Yanks tonight at 8:00. You realize, of course, if Ron Washington, the manager had used the setup man and the closer in game one with that 5-2 lead, Texas could be up 2-0.</p><p>IMUS: And well, they're not.</p><p>WOLF: Last night -- no they're not.</p><p>IMUS: They're not are they?</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: And tonight they'll be down 2-1.</p><p>WOLF: Who will be?</p><p>IMUS: The Texas Rangers.</p><p>WOLF: Oh I don't think so. Cliff Lee will beat the Yankees.</p><p>IMUS: Oh no, they won't -- Yankees, 6-2.</p><p>WOLF: 6-2?</p><p>IMUS: 6-2, Cliff Lee.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Leaves in the 5th.</p><p>IMUS: Leaves in the 5th.</p><p>WOLF: Oh, man. Come on, I-Man.</p><p>IMUS: Come turn your set on now.</p><p>WOLF: All right, last night the Colts beat the Redskins and the Colts had almost 500 yards rushing (INAUDIBLE) and total offense. Ben Roethlisberger returned from suspension, threw three touchdown passes. Steelers win and Patriots won in overtime. Kevin Cobb (ph) was great yesterday for the Eagles and after the game Andy Reid said Michael Vick is my quarterback.</p><p>The Jets go 5-1, they could be 10-1 because of the schedule. The Giants won and Cowboys dropped to 1-4, losing to the Vikings. And Jerry Jones said Wade Phillips is still my coach.</p><p>IMUS: Oh yes. He's getting it done.</p><p>WOLF: At least until the end of the year and the Dolphins beat the Packers, 23-20.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, back to the Texas-Nebraska game, did you watch that?</p><p>WOLF: No, I didn't. But I know about it --</p><p>IMUS: Nebraska -- they must have dropped ten passes. I mean, they should have easily won the game, by the way. I was happy Texas won but man.</p><p>WOLF: So that would explain Taylor Martinez's poor game.</p><p>IMUS: Well, and Zach Lee, too. Taylor is a freshman and -- Zach lee is a good quarterback, and why he wasn't -- why the coaches take him -- who knows why they do stuff like that. Anyway, Warner continues, I'm sorry Warner.</p><p>WOLF: And it was out of bound on the third play.</p><p>IMUS: Dope.</p><p>WOLF: And finally, I-man, wrap it up here. Brett Favre will meet with Commissioner Roger Goodell tomorrow here in New York.</p><p>IMUS: To talk about his wiener.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WOLF: That's right. He'll have to explain his moonlighting career as an amateur photographer.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Quarter after the hour -- thank you very much, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Thank you.</p><p>IMUS: Jeannette Walls (ph) is coming up. Bernie first, then Dagen. This is one of Jeannette Walls' five favorite songs, Natalie Merchant.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Are you looking for an investment opportunity but not sure where to start? You already ruled out getting into a -- cooking up meth in your basement? Why not get involved in what Inc Magazine has named one of the fastest growing companies in America -- Planet Fitness.</p><p>Planet Fitness is a gym that attracts the average guy. You do not need to be a muscle head to work out at a Planet Fitness. You don't need to be a muscle head to buy into one, either. All you need is to want to turn a quick profit with a company that knows how to do that.</p><p>Planet Fitness will set up your gym, develop a marketing strategy. It has a track record of putting up some big numbers, Chuck. How does an average of $1.7 million a year in sales sound?</p><p>MCCORD: Excellent.</p><p>IMUS: How about an average of $573,000 in profit.</p><p>MCCORD: Deal with that.</p><p>IMUS: The economy is a little shaky but this company is not. You can get your wallet in shape and get yourself in shape, too, have all your friends work out at the gym. Go to planetfitness.com and try to get this thing going, planetfitness.com. Do that, come on.</p><p>MCSHANE: Back with your latest \"Fox Business Minute\", the White House continues to say it's not in favor of a nationwide freeze on home foreclosures. Shaun Donovan, who's the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development said, quote, \"a national blanket moratorium on all foreclosure sales would do far more harm than good.</p><p>Now there are some Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid who have been supporting it, a temporary freeze on foreclosures.</p><p>Today is the day that the banks will have to report to the Treasury Department how they will fix any foreclosure problems, so, we'll stay on top of that story.</p><p>Now let's go to the markets here and look at some numbers. Here in the U.S., the stock index futures have been lower throughout the morning, down 41 points on Dow futures, as we speak. Over in Europe, this morning, stocks have been looking a little bit better or not as bad. Mixed picture, up in London and up in Frankfurt, Germany at the bottom of the screen, though Paris is still a little bit lower.</p><p>Quick look at commodities this morning as the gold price has been declining. It's down almost $12. And oil is right around $81 a barrel.</p><p>All this as the IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues, right now on Fox Business, the power to prosper.</p><p>Three superstars, they had a new store -- more often than they change the commercial.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Jeannette Walls is coming up. We're going to talk to that girl about her book, \"Half Broke Horses\", one of the best books of 2009, according to \"The New York Times\", and many other people. She wrote, of course, \"The Glass Castle\", which still is on the New York Times best- seller list and has been for -- since it came out.</p><p>And she used to be an entertainment reporter over there at the MSNBC, Big Foot told me this morning when we were there. And Big Foot said we had her on a couple ties, like I would remember that. I mean that had nothing to do with Jeannette. I don't know who was on the 6:00 hour this morning.</p><p>So, anyway time for a little business news and here with that is Dagen McDowell. Did you read \"Half Broke Horses\"?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I did not.</p><p>IMUS: Did you read \"The Glass Castle\".</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. And frankly it is one of the best memoirs I have ever read.</p><p>IMUS: Why?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because, she tells the story from the viewpoint of herself as she's growing up. So, when she's a child she doesn't realize how strange her family life is that she is living and it is kind of told with the awe and wonderment of a child and then you kind of grow with her.</p><p>IMUS: One of the great first pages I ever read, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. About seeing her mother --</p><p>IMUS: Going through her death. MCDOWELL: Yes. And Bo Dietl is wrong about that, he should read the book before he starts yelling and turning red in the face talking about it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Generally it would be helpful if \"Half Broke Horses\" should have come out first because you meet her mother and father when they were children raised on the ranch out there in northern Arizona. About maybe 20 miles from the ranch I grew up on. Oh no, it's a great book.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can't wait to read it.</p><p>IMUS: You want this copy?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. I'll come down and get it.</p><p>IMUS: No, no, we'll send somebody up with it. We have a restraining order keeping you off this floor.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I was well behaved at the ramble, though, time of my life. Levon is the best.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Well I'll talk to -- I got an e-mail from Sandy or Barbara or somebody discussing how you were.</p><p>Anyway what's going on in business?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, thanks to everybody.</p><p>\"Wall Street Journal\", just look at the headlines, front page of the \"Wall Street Journal\", Facebook in privacy breach. Based on an investigation done by the newspaper, many of the most popular apps, applications on the site have been transmitting, identifying information, people's names, even their friends' names, to many dozens of advertising and Internet tracking sites, outside of the service.</p><p>We're talking about the top ten applications including Farmville that people use on Facebook, have been transmitting user IDs to these outside companies. It's a black eye, egg on the face of Facebook. They're going to have to figure out how to stop it. Are you listening?</p><p>IMUS: Yes, I was, of course. I didn't know when you were done.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now, I'm done.</p><p>IMUS: Nobody ever knows, you go into one of those insane rants of yours or some goober deal.</p><p>MCGUIRK: How about when she stopped talking?</p><p>IMUS: Well, that too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm going to say, \"Back to you, Don.\"</p><p>IMUS: Who won the stupid car race?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jamie McMurray won the race. It has been a really good year for him even though he didn't make the chase, but --</p><p>IMUS: What was the point of winning the race, now?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, hell, Jimmie Johnson came in third. Jesus, just go home.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty-five after the hour.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm just waiting for somebody to wreck him in the next few races.</p><p>IMUS: Time for a briefing from Bernard McGuirk, sponsored by PC Richard and Son, having their 101st birthday party, now 63 super stores for PC Richard and Son. What is up, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, ugliness is what's up, chief. This guy, Nick Canon, is a mediocre rapper or whatever. He's married to Mariah Carey, basically his claim to fame. Anyway, he was doing a comedy show and Chelsea Handler tweeted -- she just heard Nick Canon starting a comedy tour -- \"Who's going to do the comedy.\"</p><p>Well this guy got angry and he wrote back tasteless and then she responded, she tweeted a picture of grape soda and the caption, \"Nick Canon, please drink this before you tweet me again.\" Well he shot back that everybody knows Chelsea Handler had sex with the head of E! for her show, so when it is cancelled, does he get residual hiney for the reruns. Except he didn't use the H word, he used something else. And she looked like she got hit in the face with a bag of hot nickels (ph).</p><p>Why do all these angry, ugly white trash folks want a beef with me and he's talking about Eminem and Howard Stern and Mariah Carey. That saga continues.</p><p>And over the weekend, chief, Barbara Billingsley passed away. She was the mom on \"Leave it to Beaver\" and the catch phrase of course was, \"Ward, I'm worried about the Beaver.\" And, of course, that took on a whole new meaning in the '70s, with the help of you. And the rest of, you know, that ilk back then.</p><p>But anyway, forget all that, yes. That's right. Forget all -- she had a bit part in the funniest movie ever made. She's trying to help a stewardess understand some -- on this movie, \"Airplane\" she's trying to help the stewardess understand what some black guys were saying and she couldn't make it out and went like this:</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can I get you something?</p><p>(INAUDIBLE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry, I don't understand.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Stewardess, I speak jive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He said that he's in great pain and wants to know if you can help him.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Would you tell him to just relax and I'll be back as soon as I can with some medicine.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She says hang loose, blood. She going to get you (INAUDIBLE) meds --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Big mama, my mama no raise no dummy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: There you go, rest in peace, Barbara Billingsley.</p><p>IMUS: Well, God bless her.</p><p>Twenty-seven after the hour, almost 28 after the hour, Jennifer -- Jeannette Walls, Jennifer is not going to be with us, Jeannette is, though. Jeannette Walls, \"Half Broke Horses\" out in paperback now, she's next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the FOX Business Network. Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: And here comes your latest \"FOX Business Minute\" as we have two mergers to tell you about this morning. Northeast Utilities buying Enstar, a $4 billion deal in stock. The buying company will serve about half the customers in New England. Also, St. Jude buying AGA Medical, $1.2 billion. The deal adds to St. Jude's cardiovascular division. So those deals are in.</p><p>And just moments ago, Halliburton in with its earnings. Third quarter operating profit that missed the Wall Street estimate when you take out all the one-time items. Revenues though coming in ahead of expectations for Halliburton.</p><p>Also, Hasbro reporting a third quarter profit of $1.09, revenue $1.3 billion. Both of those numbers beat the street's estimates. So the toy company, Hasbro, is out.</p><p>We're waiting for Citigroup to come out. Six cents a share is the expectation from analysts. $21 billion in revenue. So we'll have that number as soon as it's released. And then two big ones after the bell from the world of technology, IBM and Apple. Apple stock price this morning has been trading above $315 per share.</p><p>All right. Now, let's go to the numbers here and show you the futures. Down 41 point on Dow futures ahead of the open on Wall Street. Nasdaq and S&amp;P futures are also declining as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues on FOX Business, the power to prosper.</p><p>ERIC BOLLING, FOX BUSINESS NETWORKCORRESPONDENT: Hi, I'm Eric Bolling from \"Follow the Money.\" We're focusing on our risks to our most precious resource, water. Foreign nations are coming in to buy our water supply. French and German companies are siphoning off huge amounts of it, spreading lots of money around to do it. That's on \"Follow the Money\" tonight at 8:00.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Thirty-three minutes past the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the radio all over the country and on the FOX Business Network.</p><p>Well, potentially, Charles, all over the world this portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING is sponsored by Valley National Bank, serving the business community since 1927. A little whiney Frank Rich, all in a twit. Well, he's probably happy this morning and that the \"New York Post\" has endorsed Andrew Cuomo so he won't be totally ready to kill himself.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: And he's coming up next hour. But right now, please welcome the author of the \"The Glass Castle\" which sold three million books.</p><p>MCCORD: Jesus.</p><p>IMUS: Translated into 24 languages. And her sequel to that, not sequel, but was -- well, it is, sort of. Actually, a prequel, Chuck.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: \"Half Broke Horses\" which one was of the 10 best books of 2009 is now out in paperback, the author of both of those is on the horn now, Jeannette Walls. Good morning, Miss Walls, how are you?</p><p>JEANNETTE WALLS, AUTHOR (via telephone): Good morning, I'm great. How are you today?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm good except Big Foot was telling me, Tom Bowman, that we had you on a couple of times and we were at MSNBC, I think --</p><p>WALLS: That's right. In my previous life, you did.</p><p>IMUS: Of course, I can't remember who was on this program Friday, but --</p><p>WALLS: Well, I was probably pretty forgettable, so that's fine.</p><p>IMUS: So where are you living now?</p><p>WALLS: I live in rural Virginia now, north of Charlottesville.</p><p>IMUS: So, first I want to talk about \"Half Broke Horses\" and I've got to make a really sincere effort to not make this about me. But I grew up on a ranch called \"The Willows,\" which was about 20 miles, I think, the best I can figure from the ranch where your grandmother was.</p><p>WALLS: Really?</p><p>IMUS: And so I spent a great deal of time in bars in Seligman and Ash Fork. My uncle used to be the chief of police there.</p><p>WALLS: No kidding.</p><p>IMUS: Kingman used to have -- before they put I-40 through, it was about 50 miles of dirt road either from Seligman or from Kingman to \"The Willows\" ranch and you have to go, if you went from Kingman, you'd go to Hackberry first.</p><p>WALLS: Hackberry, right.</p><p>IMUS: And where your grandmother taught school.</p><p>WALLS: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And then you'd go to the ranch and so on and then, there were a bunch of Indians, named Imus, who were down at Pete Springs, Arizona where your grandmother was --</p><p>WALLS: Yes. She taught in Peach Springs. That's right.</p><p>IMUS: So enough of that. Did you --</p><p>WALLS: Oh, my gosh, we could be related.</p><p>IMUS: Well, they say we all are. Did you go back and visit any of these places?</p><p>WALLS: I sure did. It's beautiful and it's a little isolated, but it's really beautiful.</p><p>IMUS: Now, had I-40 been through there when you went back? What was I-40 there when you went back?</p><p>WALLS: Yes, it was. I went back -- well, after I finished writing the book, for the first time I went back. I brought my mom back and we went to the 180,000 acre ranch where she grew up.</p><p>IMUS: Is your mom still alive?</p><p>WALLS: Oh, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, she is.</p><p>WALLS: She's going to outlive us all.</p><p>IMUS: And where is she now?</p><p>WALLS: She lives out back behind me now in the -- we put on airs and call it the vinyl cottage, but it's a mobile home. But she's, you know, she was homeless for years.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, I know. One of the great opening pages that I always applied to Dan Jenkins first place test to any book I want to read. According to Dan if you can get by the first page. The opening of the \"The Glass Castle\" tell me about that.</p><p>WALLS: Well, I used to write about celebrities for a living. I used to live in Manhattan and one day I was going to some fabulous party and I glanced out the window and saw a homeless woman rooting through the garbage and I realized it was my mom. I got together with her a couple of days later and I said mom, what the heck am I supposed to tell people when they asked me about you? And she looked at me like I was knucklehead and asked her a stupid question, and she said tell the truth. So I did and I wrote the book.</p><p>IMUS: So your mother and father were living on the streets of New York.</p><p>WALLS: Yes, they were.</p><p>IMUS: And there was nothing you could do about it.</p><p>WALLS: I tried to help them. I gave them offers. But they were free spirits and they thought I'd really sold out and lost my values by living on Park Avenue and writing about celebrities. A couple of years ago, five years ago I moved down to Virginia and my mother had been living in an abandoned building for a while. She was a squatter.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>WALLS: And the building caught on fire so she was back on the streets. And I got her to come live down here. At first she kept on resisting me then I told her I was thinking of getting horses and could really use the help and she said I'll be right there. And it's been pretty amazing. You know, she's 76 years old and still rides horses.</p><p>IMUS: You know, it's kind of interesting, having read both of your books, if I were going to recommend to people how to read them, I'd read \"Half Broke Horses\" first.</p><p>WALLS: Really.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Because you get to meet your parents as children.</p><p>WALLS: Well, the reason I wrote \"Half Broke Horses\" is because so many people after reading -- having read \"Glass Castle\" were bewildered by mom. They said why would somebody who has a college education and the resources to live a normal wife, why would they choose this life of chaos. And I'd start explaining to them a little bit about my mother's childhood and they would say, your next book should be about your mother. And it ended up being about my grandmother. And since I couldn't interview grandma and had to take everything third and fourth hand, I called it fiction, but it was as close to the truth as I could get it.</p><p>IMUS: And you wrote it in her voice.</p><p>WALLS: I did, I originally intended to write it about mom and tried to write it in her voice, but mom kept saying, you know, my grandmother was the one who was really interesting, plus I'm a lot more like my grandmother than I'm like my mother. And I found it a lot easier to write it in my grandma's voice than in my own.</p><p>IMUS: Did you ever read any Will James?</p><p>WALLS: No.</p><p>IMUS: One of the great western artists ever, different from Frederick Graham (ph) or Charlie Rosen (ph), those people, but he was a real -- you would love, absolutely love \"The Lone Cowboy\" or \"Smoky The Cow Horse\" or - -</p><p>WALLS: OK, I'm writing these down right now.</p><p>IMUS: The first one to read is \"The Lone Cowboy,\" Will James.</p><p>WALLS: OK, you got it.</p><p>IMUS: Because and I don't want to sound like I'm sucking up to you, I don't know for what reason, but \"Half Broke Horses\" is so skillfully and wonderfully well written, that is like Will James with good grammar, so --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLS: Bless your heart, thank you so much. My gosh, I'm blushing. Thank you.</p><p>IMUS: But Will James, his books are just magnificent. And he was a fairly famous artist in the early 1900s and through -- but he was a real bronco rider and, in fact, when your grandmother rode, she rode from where to Red River, Arizona. Tell me about that.</p><p>WALLS: Well, it was during the First World War, and she was 15 years old and hadn't graduated from high school. But there was a shortage of teachers and if you could pass a test, then you could become a teacher even if you didn't have a college education.</p><p>So she passed the test and got on her little pony and rode 500 miles by herself to her first teaching job in Red River, Arizona. And after that, just go from little remote Arizona town, one to the next, until the war was over and she got booted and have to move back home. And she was -- she was a tough old broad, and I say that with great affection.</p><p>You know, she was a horse-breaking hooch selling card-playing gun-toting school teacher and she just really did what needed to be done and didn't complain about it and wasn't shy about it. A lot of people who read the book said, well, she was sort of hard, wasn't she? Well, of course, she was hard. You had to be hard back then.</p><p>IMUS: We're talking with Jeannette Walls, the author of, well, first, \"The Glass Castles\" and now on paperback, one of the best books of 2009, according to the \"New York Times,\" \"Half Broke Horses\". And what did your mother say about your grandmother in terms of whether she thought she loved her or --</p><p>WALLS: Well, that's a really good question. I think that -- that's a really good question. You're the first person who's ever asked me that.</p><p>I think that Lily was not the softest, most loving mom in the world. And she -- she was somebody who tamed the horses and tamed the land and tamed all her school kids and I think that my mother was the only creature she ever encountered who she couldn't tame. And I think she found my mother very frustrating. And I think that that's one of the reasons that mom led sort of a chaotic life that she did. She kept on rebelling against the structure and rules that Lily kept tried to impose on her.</p><p>IMUS: A really horrific scene is down there at the bottom of the Grand Canyon where they have the Indians and your mother -- I mean, your grandmother, what did she do with your mother?</p><p>WALLS: Well, she's -- grandma -- mom went swimming with the Havasupai. She had a few clothes on, not a whole lot but the school superintendent was there and my grandmother was afraid that her job would be jeopardized.</p><p>IMUS: The school officials there in Arizona wanted to go done to where the Havasupai lived at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and rode that trail down there. Well, I used to be a mule guide, by the way, for a while.</p><p>WALLS: No.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, rode those, well, they rode horses down. That's not unusual. Anyway --</p><p>WALLS: It is one of the most gorgeous places on this planet.</p><p>IMUS: So the school officials were going to try to bring Jesus or order or something to the Havasupai, right?</p><p>WALLS: Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: So they got your mother to take them down there.</p><p>WALLS: And my mother just fell in love with the place. She thought it was one of the most gorgeous places she'd ever seen and wanted to live like the Havasupai did and the school officials were appalled that she kept on mingling with the Havasupai including going swimming with them at night. And so Lily just wailed the tar out of her. And around that time, mom resolved that if she ever had children she would never impose rules on them, would never punish them and would let them do pretty much as they pleased. And that's the way I was raised.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I got the -- in a sense maybe I read too much into it, but that one event really changed the way your mother thought about everything.</p><p>WALLS: No, I think you nailed it. That was a real turning point for mom. And after that, she just, she wanted a life of freedom. She wanted to get away from Lily. It was a sort of horrific event, and freedom became more important to mom after that than her physical comfort.</p><p>IMUS: When you were growing up with -- sounded to me like -- did you realize you were in this tornado?</p><p>WALLS: Not at first, no. At first, I thought all people lived like we did. Then I started noticing that people pointed at us a lot. And I don't think it was out of admiration.</p><p>Dad was absolutely brilliant though about being able to put a positive spin on it, you know. Most kids would be complaining in your situation, but since you're so tough and resilient it doesn't bother you and that doesn't give you a whole lot of room out. So in dad's credit and mom's credit, they were both very high spirited and they put a really high emphasis on reading and education and having an adventure. But I did not realize, probably until we moved to southern West Virginia, a little place without heat and running water or anything like that, we went hungry a lot of the time. I think until then I didn't realize how truly bad it was.</p><p>IMUS: I don't want to sound like a jerk, although sometimes I have difficult time avoiding so. But it's one to write entertainment news about Lindsay Lohan or whoever is hot at the time, but what made you think you could do this?</p><p>WALLS: I didn't. My husband hogtied me to the desk and said you are writing this story. I was deeply ashamed of my past. And all the time I lived in New York City, pretty much nobody asked me about it. And this one guy was the one person who kept saying, your past, how come you never talk about your past and how come whenever I ask you you change the topic? So I sort of fessed up to him and he just, from that moment he kept pressuring me to write it. And I was terrified. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to be ridiculed and humiliated. It just goes to show you I'm sort of on a campaign to get people to talk about their past or confront it. You don't have to write a whole memoir, but I just think a lot of people are going around thinking that because they had a whacky childhood there's something wrong with them.</p><p>IMUS: It's so skillful and so eloquently well written it's like you had a copy of Elmore Leonard's \"Ten Rules of Writing\" in one hand, but just really a great gift. Well, good for you.</p><p>WALLS: Thank you so much.</p><p>IMUS: So, I certainly didn't make the connection between, you know, the babe at MSNBC talking about Brad Pitt and the woman who wrote this.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Man, are you kidding me? So good for you. I'm happy for you.</p><p>WALLS: Well, thank you very much. It's been quite a whirlwind. I did not expect it. And you know, the irony, some people would say hypocrisy chasing other people's secrets while hiding my own didn't escape me and it was this -- but I was terrified and I feel like an idiot now.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you shouldn't.</p><p>WALLS: Thank you.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Thank you very much, Jeanette.</p><p>WALLS: Thank you. My pleasure, thank you.</p><p>IMUS: Jeannette Walls, \"Half Broke Horses\" it's so good. It's just --</p><p>MCCORD: Fascinating.</p><p>IMUS: And I thought, well, maybe it's because it's all about where I grew up, you know? But it's not, it's far more than that. If I can try to remove myself from it, which would be difficult, but oh, my God, it's a great book. I mean, it's just stupid, stupid great.</p><p>And another great book, by the way, is \"Born to Run,\" the whole running thing.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes. And laying all these running energies right at the foot of Nike. Oh, man. So, anyway, great stuff. I'm going to post the 15 best books and another presumptuous act of mine, the 15 best books of 2010 that I read at Imus.com and you can buy them. And I think Amazon gives part of the money to the ranch.</p><p>MCCORD: Perfect.</p><p>IMUS: Or Barnes &amp; Noble, whoever it is. Just go to Imus.com and click on the book and same with the Ranch Record, which should be out next week.</p><p>Eleven minutes until the hour.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCSHANE: Here's another market check for you on FOX Business. Futures have been lower this morning. Some worries about the foreclosure freeze or the potential of one that's hurt bank stocks in recent days. Showing the European markets right now. Mixed picture there. Up in London. Paris is down and up in Frankfurt. But our futures lower ahead of the open on Wall Street.</p><p>There they are. Down 45 on Dow futures. Nasdaq and S&amp;P futures also declining.</p><p>And another sign of the tough financial times, charitable donations falling 11 percent last year. Actually the worst decline in 20 years since the chronicle of philanthropy began to keep track of this. The report due out today shows United Way and Salvation Army continue to dominate the rankings despite these declines in 2009.</p><p>At the same time, luxury sales, the luxury sales of luxury goods are rebounding. Those are this year's numbers though. They're coming back to pre-recession levels. Sales of designer clothes to wealthy Americans and newly rich Chinese people helping to fuel a stronger than expected rebound. A study out from Bain &amp; Company shows global sales are expected to surge by 10 percent this year to more than $245 billion following what they're also was a disastrous 2009.</p><p>And \"Jackass 3D\" tops the weekend box office. Johnny Knoxville and his jackass gang taking their latest big screen collection of crazy stunts and antics, well, to another dimension, as you can see there. \"Jackass 3D\" opened with $15 million. It soared past the debuts of their first two movies according to studio estimates.</p><p>The action comedy \"Red\" was second place for the weekend. That was just $22.5 million. And \"Social Network\" dropping to third and 11 million. \"Jackass 3D\" rules at the box office for the weekend.</p><p>Here's commodities. $81 oil this morning. Down by four cents. Gold is down almost $12, so we're seeing some decline there at 1,360 an ounce as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues here on FOX Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: Coming up on five until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, please welcome now to the program, Reverend Jesse Jackson who's going to rhyme the times and we've got time for fuzzy wuzzy.</p><p>TONY POWELL, AS REVEREND JESSE JACKSON: All right, here we go.</p><p>IMUS: All right.</p><p>POWELL: Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear not a beaver, but still they mourned the loss of the woman who played June Cleaver. (INAUDIBLE) was an overachiever. This sitcom mom did (INAUDIBLE. She left us at a tender age of 9 and 4. As sad as it is for Wally and the Beave, time we all must leave. To the Boon (ph) family, I say keep up alive and thanks for that woman who learned to speak jive.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Coming up next hour, Frank Rich whining about, well, just FOX and everything else.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IMUS: Dagen, have you ever had anybody do that to you?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORKCORRESPONDENT: What? Send me a --</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A photo of their winus (ph)?</p><p>IMUS: No, no. Well, I guess not.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What?</p><p>Well, this guy apparently had it on the cell phone and showed it to her.</p><p>MCCORD: Evidently he -- this person says that he had shown her other innocuous photos on his cell phone.</p><p>IMUS: My dog, my fish.</p><p>MCCORD: Right. And so --</p><p>IMUS: Here's my winus (ph).</p><p>MCCORD: So when he said, hey, come, do you want to see this? And it was - - or at least it was a winner. his-- or at least it was a wiener. I don't know that it was his.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It defeats -- it defeats the purpose of taking a photo of your winus. Because if you show it to the woman while she's in front of you, then she's still going to laugh. You want to text it to her and e-mail it to her so you don't see the expression on her face when she sees it for the first time.</p><p>IMUS: It is 11 after the hour.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: I don't know.</p><p>MCCORD: It's reasonable.</p><p>IMUS: That's reasonable.</p><p>RUFINO: That's an important criteria when you're sending pictures of your penis, I guess.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, sure.</p><p>RUFINO: I hope I don't see her face.</p><p>MCCORD: But Bishop Long is not named specifically in the suit.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know we have rules.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, right. I almost violated --</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the Fox Business Network. Here is Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, we're going to go straight to some breaking earnings news here in a moment, looking at the market, as we get the Citigroup numbers coming in. Stock futures have been lower ahead of those numbers this morning. Citi's just reporting right now what looks like a number of eight cents per share for continuing operations. There's another number of seven cents per share, which would both -- on both counts be better than expected, in terms of their bottom line earnings that have just come in from Citigroup, because the Wall Street expectation was for a number of six cents per share.</p><p>So it looks it's better than expected. And from continuing operation, Citi with eight cents per share. Revenue of 20.7 billion dollars. That might be a touch light of the 21 billion dollar estimate. The revenue number from Citi last quarter 20.7 billion dollars.</p><p>There's the stock price, 3 dollars 99 cents is the pre-market bid, meaning it's indicated to open higher once the Wall Street trading session begins,. But again, Citigroup a net income of seven cents per share. And that -- when you work it out excluding certain items from continuing operation, eight cents per share. It's better than expected for the big bank that made two billion dollars in profit in its last quarter, even though the revenue looks like it's a little bit light.</p><p>We'll have more on Citigroup here throughout the day on Fox Business. But that's one of the big earnings reports today. After the bell, we'll get Apple and IBM. A busy week for earnings and Citigroup has just kicked it off as the first major company to report.</p><p>Now, the White House, in other news this morning, continued to say it's not in favor of a nationwide freeze on home foreclosures. Shaun Donovan is the secretary of Housing and Urban Development saying, \"a national blanket moratorium on all foreclosures sales would do far more harm than good.\" Some Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, are supporting a temporary freeze on foreclosures. Worries about a freeze and what it would do to earnings have been hurting bank stocks of late.</p><p>Still no deal in place between News Corp and Cablevision. The Fox Network was taken off the air for Cablevision subscribers in New York and Philadelphia in a dispute over fees. It means viewers missed the baseball playoffs and missed Sunday NFL football. Now viewers even losing out on the Fox Business Network. News Corp is the parent company of this network.</p><p>Earlier this morning, Hasbro, the toy company, with a third quarter profit reported at 1.09 per share, revenue 1.3 billion for Hasbro, better than expected on both counts. It says it will continue to believe -- or it does continue to believe it will be able to grow revenue and earnings per share for the full year 2010. That from the toy maker Hasbro.</p><p>All right, now you're caught up to date on our top stories here at Fox Business. The oil price 81 dollars -- check some more numbers for you. Gold around 1,360. Gold down by 12 dollars this morning.</p><p>Later in the hour, Imus is going to talk to Frank Rich from the \"New York Times.\" There's that and much more straight ahead as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues on Fox Business, the power to prosper.</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\": Good morning I-Man. I just want to let everyone know that the woman who fainted at my speech the other day in West Virginia is fine. And despite Imus's idiotic suggestion, she did not die. I don't leave dead bodies in my wake. That's Hillary's deal.</p><p>Speaking of dead bodies, according to the \"New York Daily Record,\" although she's single and chaste at 41, back in college, Christine O'Donnell was quite the little slut, you know, ankle burns from her earrings. But unfortunately, that tunnel is currently closed for renovations, I guess. Boy did I ever come late to that party.</p><p>And speaking of parties, the Tea Baggers two most famous candidates are her and Carl Paladino? These are the people you're banking on to get your country back, locked box Monica Lewinsky and homophobe Abe Vigota. Although I understand Ms. O'Donnell given that political races are really just glorified beauty pageants. But Carl Paladino, he ain't even going to win Miss Congeniality. I mean, when he debates Cuomo, it will be Nixon/Kennedy all over again.</p><p>Remember Nixon's sweaty lip? That's what Paladino is, a great big sweaty lip. That is one ugly dude. I bet when he masturbates, his hand tries to fake being asleep. I was flipping through the channels the other night. I came across his campaign ad. For a second, I thought Zackerly was back hosting \"Creature Feature.\" He's like the gubernatorial candidate of the undead. Tell me this guy doesn't look like he feasts on brains.</p><p>After watching Christine O'Donnell debate Chris Coons, it sure seemed like Paladino sucked hers out of her head. If she had 10 fewer IQ points, she'd be Sarah Palin, because she is hot. In fact I'd like to send her a cell phone photo of my penis. That would make her faint, I bet you.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING</p><p>IMUS: I was telling Reverend Jackson and Carl Paladino that I gained three pounds, so I weigh 153. And I can't wear my clothes. I had to -- my jeans have so much starch in them I had to lie down to put them on this morning. What did you say to those -- .</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\": A pair of those ice tongs and --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man. Five minutes after the hour, Frank Rich is coming up. We'll talk to him. Carl Paladino is here. And any big news stories, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>MCCORD: First of all, the election may be rushing at the Democrats a little too fast.</p><p>IMUS: That's not a big news story.</p><p>MCCORD: All right. How about Osama bin Laden and one of his top lieutenants living in caves -- are not living in caves, but rather in houses in northwest Pakistan, according to a senior NATO official who couldn't be named.</p><p>IMUS: As I pointed out, we've got millions of people in this country who have lost their homes.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: And these bastard living on a cul-de-sac there in wherever.</p><p>MCCORD: Hanging out with their SUVs and --</p><p>IMUS: And lattes. You can't make that up. Anyway, a big debate here in New York here tonight between Andrew Cuomo and Carl Paladino. And here to set the stage for at that is mister -- you've got to stop staring at me like that.</p><p>BARTLETT: It's like a train wreck. I can't take my eyes off you.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Anyway, here is Carl Paladino. Good morning, Mr. Paladino.</p><p>BARTLETT: Tonight, Hofstra University, the time has come for someone with half a mine to take control of this state. That half a mind is me. Tonight I finally get the chance to debate my opponent who is nothing more than a whore. I'm not referring to Andrew Cuomo. I'm referring to independent candidate Christine Davis, the madame for Eliot Spitzer's skanky call girl.</p><p>Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I believe New York should keep its prostitutes out of public office and put them back where they belong, in cheap short stay motels servicing their elected officials. Ultimately, New York only has one choice, a seasoned political veteran or an unstable businessman with no experience.</p><p>Here is how Cuomo and I are different: Andrew Cuomo says he smoked pot in his younger days, I never smoked pot. I sold pot, because I'm a businessman. I have no problem with gays, but I don't like gay marriage. So gays don't like me.</p><p>Andrew Cuomo likes gays. Gays like Andrew Cuomo. Of course, he's a pretty boy. Whereas I resemble Bee Arthur trick or treating as Frankenstein's monster. Andrew is Al Pacino in the \"Godfather,\" I'm Freddo. And like Freddo says in Part II, \"I'm smart, not like everyone says, not dumb, smart. And I want respect. Unlike my opponent, I do not plan to let issues get in the way tonight. And when the evening is over, everyone will have no doubt who is the best man for the governor of New York. It's as plain as the nose on your face. And that nose is me.</p><p>IMUS: Do you -- do you like sometimes -- when artists perform places, they plant plants in the audience, you know, to either clap or request stuff or in this case laugh. So, did you hire Reverend Jackson to come out here and.</p><p>BARTLETT: I've got a couple of things on him.</p><p>IMUS: I bet. Here is Chuck with the news. Good morning, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: Good morning, I-Man. And some of the top stories include the head of France's petroleum industry says there are a few weeks worth of fuel reserves available as French oil workers defy the government's demand that they go back to work. Striking workers piling up tires, setting them on fire in front of a refinery in east Paris today. The unions escalating the fight against the government plan to raise the retirement age in France from 60 to 62.</p><p>But the people don't like that, 60 to 62.</p><p>And Osama bin Laden, as we were discussing--</p><p>IMUS: You know, we don't need you -- well, making these little observations. Does Shep Smith do that? No.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, yes he does.</p><p>IMUS: No, he doesn't.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, he does.</p><p>IMUS: No, he doesn't</p><p>MCCORD: He does.</p><p>IMUS: He just reports a news.</p><p>MCCORD: And he lives an eyebrow, a very manicured eyebrow. He'll do that on you.</p><p>IMUS: No, he doesn't. He delivers the news. He lets us decide what we want to make of it. So we don't need --</p><p>MCCORD: fair and balanced.</p><p>IMUS: -- you to provide your student interpretation of whatever --</p><p>MCCORD: How is it a stupid interpretation? How is it a stupid interpretation.</p><p>IMUS: Because it comes from you.</p><p>MCCORD: Explain it to me. How is it stupid because it comes from me? How is it stupid if it comes from? I want some illumination to this.</p><p>IMUS: It's going to be difficult.</p><p>MCCORD: It's going to be difficult, right, because it's not stupid.</p><p>IMUS: May I talk.</p><p>MCCORD: Of course you can. It's your -- look what it says, it's your program, IMUS IN THE MORNING. Of course you can talk.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCCORD: What is it?</p><p>IMUS: It's going to be difficult to explain it to you?</p><p>MCCORD: Why?</p><p>IMUS: Because you're stupid.</p><p>MCCORD: You know what is stupid? You know what's stupid? You're stupid. I'm not stupid. You are stupid.</p><p>IMUS: Just finish reading the news sans comment.</p><p>MCCORD: Bin Laden, Zawahiri, house, cul-de-sac.</p><p>IMUS: Fine.</p><p>MCCORD: house, cul-de-sac, don't know where they are. Pakistan says they don't know where they are. Denies giving them protection and succor and relief. But according to the NATO official, who refuses to be identified because of the sensitive nature of what he's discussing, they're exactly where you said they were, hanging out barbecuing some chops in the back yard there along the border of Afghanistan.</p><p>And the Pentagon has put together a 120 member team to review a potential massive leak of Iraq war documents expected to start dropping maybe today. Whistle blower website WikiLeaks -- they're helpful, is expected to post as many as 500 --</p><p>IMUS: No no. We don't need you to comment about WikiLeaks is or not. They're helpful.</p><p>MCCORD: Who is going to inform the people about whether or not they're helpful? if I don't do it, whose responsibility is it?</p><p>IMUS: Let the people make up their own mind, unlike Frank Rich or Glenn Beck. You want both sides.</p><p>MCCORD: May I finish.</p><p>IMUS: Trying to beat their point of view into us. We'll decide ourselves.</p><p>MCCORD: May I finish? May I finish?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: Website WikiLeaks expected to post as many 500,000 documents this month, and officials at the Defense Department say they're prepared for a document dump as early as today and they, believe me, are not looking forward to it.</p><p>IMUS: I imagine they aren't, trying to lie to us and cover up everything. Well, the chickens are coming home to --</p><p>MCCORD: Whatever they do, crawl in a coop.</p><p>And President Obama taking part in a large open air rally in Ohio last night on behalf of the Democratic --</p><p>IMUS: Don't make it sound like he went to some rally and a bunch of people showed up. He went to Ohio University.</p><p>MCCORD: That's true. Speaking before a cheering crowds of 35,000 is the estimate at Ohio University, accusing Republicans of siding with special interests like pointed to a couple of things, insurance companies and Wall Street banks. Those are among the top --</p><p>IMUS: no, no, he didn't -- what did he say about Wall Street banks?</p><p>MCCORD: Special interests.</p><p>IMUS: Nobody is more in bed with them than he is. Who is he kidding? Oh, my god. That's like all of them telling us what to eat. And then every time they have a photo op, they have a hamburger in their hands.</p><p>MCCORD: And curly fries.</p><p>IMUS: It's crazy. Twelve minutes after the hour. Time for a business report. And here with that on the Fox Business Networkis Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-Man. Speaking of Wall Street banks, some breaking news from one of them is just in. Citigroup has just reported its earnings for last quarter. And Citi made more than two billion dollars in profit last quarter.</p><p>IMUS: Good for them. Jamie Dimon, right.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, Vikram Pandit. Jamie Dimon is JP Morgan. But Vikram Pandit, the CEO, says that Citi is successfully executing its strategy. And the number, by the way, was better than expected, although its sales were a little light of expectations. That's just in from Citigroup breaking at this hour.</p><p>IMUS: Warner has sports. The sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers. They make America's best boiler, Warner. At 96 percent efficient purifier series. Get one of those and stick it in your basement. Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\": Good morning, I-Man. NFL, the Jets go five and one, beat the Broncos 24-20. Winning touchdown, a minute and 13 left, set up by a huge fourth down interference call at the Bronco two.</p><p>Vikings beat the Cowboys 24 to 21. The cowboys drop to one and four.</p><p>The Rams, who had won only two games all last year, win their third game of the year, beating the Chargers.</p><p>Ben Roethlisberger returned, four game suspension, threw for three touchdowns, Steelers beat the Browns. But the Browns finally found a quarterback in Colt McCoy.</p><p>The Giants held on, beat the Lions.</p><p>IMUS: Colt McCoy from Texas.</p><p>WOLF: Colt McCoy from Texas.</p><p>IMUS: OF course, on Saturday, Texas went to Lincoln, Nebraska -- and Texas unranked this year -- or not in the top 25 -- and beat the fifth ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers.</p><p>WOLF: Twenty to 13. The Eagles beat the Falcons. Kevin Colb 23 for 29, 326 yards, three touchdowns. And after the game Andy Reid said Michael Vick is my number one quarterback.</p><p>IMUS: That was kind of a tongue in cheek deal.</p><p>WOLF: It is. We'll see Sunday, won't we, I-Man. Two overtime games, the Patriots were down by ten in the fourth quarter, beat the Ravens in overtime. And the Dolphins beat the Packers, 23-20 in overtime.</p><p>Last night, the Colts over the Redskins 27-24. Joseph Adai 128 yards in 17 carries.</p><p>IMUS: Did you mention the Jets game yet?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, I did.</p><p>IMUS: They were really lucky to win that. They played well. They're a good team, but --</p><p>WOLF: The Broncos played one of the best games of the year.</p><p>IMUS: Not good enough, was it?</p><p>WOLF: No, but that was interference because he grabbed the face mask. Otherwise he would have gotten away with it. And the Phillies with four in the seventh beat the Giants --</p><p>IMUS: Like Derek Jeter did, right? Go ahead.</p><p>WOLF: You mean faking being hit by the pitch.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God. Here is comes.</p><p>IMUS: Go ahead.</p><p>WOLF: Tonight, the Yankees and Texas game three. I say, look for Cliff Lee to allow one earned run and five hits and beat the Yankees.</p><p>IMUS: What time does that game start?</p><p>WOLF: That will be 8:10 p.m, I-Man.</p><p>IMUS: Is that on Fox?</p><p>WOLF. That will be on TBS. The American League is TBS. Fox is National League.</p><p>IMUS: What else is going on? Anything?</p><p>WOLF: The other thing, finally I would say -- I can get out here though, I would say that.</p><p>IMUS: Give me one more.</p><p>WOLF: OK. Well, this is -- this is -- your husband should make sure he has a will. The widow of former NFL quarterback Steve McNair -- remember he was shot and killed by his mistress, then she shot herself. Well, his wife finally won a request after a year and a half. She'll receive 2.5 million dollars for her and the four children from McNair's 20 million dollar estate, which had been frozen sense his death because he had no will.</p><p>So, obviously, you've got to make sure your husband has a will.</p><p>IMUS: Yeah. Or your wife, in case you get your hands on a wood chipper.</p><p>All right, 16 after the hour, thanks, Warner. Frank Rich next.</p><p>Before that, Dagen McDowell and Bernard McGuirk. This is one of Frank's wimpy little five favorite songs.</p><p>Well, did you know that Bigelow Green Tea is the number one tea -- number one green tea in the United States? That's right. A little family company up there in Fairfield, Connecticut, has the most popular green tea in the country. One of the best tea companies in the world, Bigelow.</p><p>Good reason too. Everybody knows green tea is loaded antioxidants. But not all green tea tastes the same. Some does not deliver on the flavor. That's why more and more people have been drinking Bigelow Tea, because they know it's not only great for you, it tastes great. People today are trying to find ways to live a healthier life style, Chuck.</p><p>They know that tea is a perfect thing to add to your daily routine. And what makes Bigelow tea the green tea of choice is all of the wonderful flavors and stuff. For example, you know, it's full of antioxidants. And like Pomegranates -- green tea with pomegranates, that sounds good, doesn't it? Start drinking green tea every day and make it Bigelow. It's the official tea of THE IMUS IN THE MORNING program, Bigelow.</p><p>MCSHANE: Let's get you up to date on those Citigroup earnings that came out just moments ago, reporting an operating profit of eight cents a share. Citi two cents above the Wall Street estimate. The revenue was 20.7 billion dollars. That number just short of the analysts' forecast for Citigroup. Stock up a little bit since the number came out. Citi says its credit loss provision was the lowest since 2007. And all elements, it says, are in place for continued profitability.</p><p>Vikram Pandit, the CEO, says Citi is successfully executing its strategy. As you see again, the stock is up seven cents in pre-market trading.</p><p>Let's check the rest of the markets now more broadly, and look at the U.S. stock index futures ahead of Wall Street trading. We are still down pretty much, but the Nasdaq futures have turned things around a little bit ahead of earnings tonight coming from Apple, up 1.5 points on Nasdaq futures. But the Dow and S&amp;P futures remain lower, as they have been throughout the morning.</p><p>European markets have fluctuated between gains and losses, and are now higher again. They're up by three tenths of one percent in London and higher in Paris and Frankfurt as well.</p><p>And a quick look at commodities this morning shows that the gold price is down by eight, almost nine dollars. And oil is now higher, after being lower earlier, as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues on Fox Business, the power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty three after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country and on the Fox Business Network. And this is confusing. I sound confused.</p><p>Time for Dagen McDowell now and the Fox Business Networkbusiness report. I just received an e-mail, Dagen, from Bob O'Brien, Levon's manager, who said it was a total pleasure having Dagen and Jonas. Who would Jonas be?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Rollo.</p><p>IMUS: That's Rollo. Levon loved meeting them. We set them in the front row and their faces were lit all night long. You can feel comfortable knowing that you can send people from your camp anywhere and they behave impeccably. She kept her shoes on, and what beautiful shoes they were.</p><p>Over the next -- over the knee -- over the knee boots, to be exact. We set them next to John Winter, the guy that -- who I'm trying to romance into putting Levon on the cover, which is not a bad idea.</p><p>MCCORD: Not at all.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty four after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Of course, Levon on \"Imus Ranch Record II.\" He and Larry did -- I asked him to do \"It Takes a Lot To Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry.\" And he said I believe we can do that.</p><p>MCCORD: They did. Please, come on.</p><p>IMUS: So good, it's stupid. And Sam Moore will be here tomorrow. He's in town and who the hell knows. He's really a crazy person, but I love him to death, the great Sam Moore.</p><p>This portion of the program is sponsored by National Grid. Did you do your report yet? No, you haven't. I've been talking.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, but I -- you talk about Levon and hearing that music, it just -- I'm a marshmallow, I get real emotional, so--</p><p>IMUS: You're not going to start weeping here, are you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I might. If I feel like it, I will.</p><p>IMUS: Did you talk to John Winter or no? I spoke to him briefly, told him how great Matt Taibbi is, actually, and how the magazine is kicking some ass.</p><p>IMUS: So you just really sucked up to him big time, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I was very -- I know when to shut my mouth.</p><p>IMUS: I like John Winter, so it's good you didn't embarrass me in front of him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's the only thing you're concerned about is me embarrassing you.</p><p>IMUS: If anybody is going to embarrass you, I think I've demonstrated, I can do that myself, unfortunately.</p><p>What's going on in the world of business, not that I care -- well, actually I do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you will care about this, because it dove-tails with one of your issues, I suppose. Airlines are eliminating or cutting back on their first class seating, because the demand simply isn't there. Southwest is buying Air Tran and Southwest is going to get rid of Air Tran's first class seats. Quantas has eliminated first class service on many of its long haul flights, but you can still fly business, number one, which is very nice and probably getting better. Or you can simply fly --</p><p>IMUS: You see all those people standing in line there?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, sir.</p><p>IMUS: You know what they should do?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know.</p><p>IMUS: They should call citation and--</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, for God's sake. They can't call -- who can call?</p><p>IMUS: Anybody can call Citation Air. .</p><p>MCCORD: -- all the people standing in line to get on Southwest or Air Tran aren't going to be calling Citation Air.</p><p>IMUS: Why?</p><p>MCCORD: Well, because it's not for their -- their level of society is not represented.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They aren't money bags like you is what he's saying.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, I see.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's all.</p><p>MCCORD: You're just incorrigible. You're just an idiot.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. What else were you saying?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, just calling you a money bags, that's all, which is a compliment, in many ways.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: Or insufferable ass would also work.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you looked good. Got that corduroy jacket on.</p><p>IMUS: Another Joseph Abboud (ph) special.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Styling.</p><p>IMUS: Time for a little Bernie briefing, sponsored by PC Richard and Son, celebrating 101 years. And here with the briefing is Bernard. Good morning, Bernie.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\": Hey chief. Well, the president and his wife, the first lady, were out campaigning yesterday. If you wonder why they have trouble rallying the base, the Obama administration, this judge ended the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. She handed down a decision. Anyway, it would end it. The administration is going to appeal that ruling. And they proclaim that they want to end Don't Ask Don't Tell.</p><p>Also, if California's vote to legalize pot in that state --</p><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The feds, the Obama administration, they say that they'll aggressively prosecute your bong hitting behind out there if you dare to toke up. It wasn't supposed to be this way. Gays in the military and free pot, you know, legalized pot, supposed to be like, live and let live.</p><p>IMUS: Hope and change. We're still hoping for the change.</p><p>MCGUIRK: It's apparently not the case. And Vince Vaughan, remember he got in a little trouble. It all started with Anderson Cooper went to the movies and he saw a trailer where Vince Vaughan was talking about an electric car and he said that's so gay. Well, they pulled that from the trailer, but Vince Vaughan spoke about it. And he said comedy and joking about our differences break tension and brings us together. Censorship divides us.</p><p>And anyway this organization, Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, they said that that's wrong. They said it does bring us together, does comedy, but unless one of us is the punch line. So now they're throwing down a challenge. They want him to take that whole line out of the movie, not just the trailer. So we have a showdown. So anyway.</p><p>IMUS: I hear kids say that all the time, the ones I'm around at the ranch. And they don't mean homosexual.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I hope Anderson Cooper and the guys from GLAAD, they don't Want Comedy central, Jon Stewart, the Family Guy, because there's more of what they might consider gay slurs flying there than at a Carl Paladino poker game. I tell you.</p><p>IMUS: Here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Frank Rich is next. One of his five favorite songs</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Here is your latest \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>As the White House continues to say it's not in favor of a nationwide freeze on home foreclosures, Shaun Donovan, who's the secretary of Housing and Development, saying, \"A national blanket moratorium on all foreclosure sales would do far more harm than good.\"</p><p>Some Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, have been supporting a temporary freeze on home foreclosures. Worries about what a freeze would do to earnings has been hurting bank stocks of late.</p><p>And speaking of banks, the earnings just in from Citigroup moments ago. It reported an operating profit of eight cents a share. That's a couple pennies better than expected. Revenue came in just short of expectations, $20.7 billion.</p><p>Citi says its credit loss provision was the lowest since 2007. All elements in place, it says, for continued profitability. You see the stock up this morning in pre-market trading.</p><p>We also have two mergers to tell you about this Monday morning. Northeast Utilities buying NStar for $4 billion. It's a stock deal. The combined company will serve about half the customers in New England.</p><p>Also, medical device maker St. Jude buying AGA Medical for $1.2 billion.</p><p>All right. The IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues right now here on Fox Business, giving you \"The Power to Prosper.\"</p><p>IMUS: It is 34 minutes past the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Coming up tomorrow, Scott Rasmussen. He'll be here to talk about the poll stuff.</p><p>How do you pronounce her name, Bernie, Puhn, Puhn?</p><p>That girl has got a book called \"Fight Less, Love More.\" Who knows? It's got to be some Esther Newberg deal where somebody talked me into it, doesn't it? Or somebody we thought we could make fun of and not get in trouble.</p><p>And then the great Sam Moore. Sam will be here.</p><p>Please welcome from \"The New York Times,\" Frank Rich.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Rich.</p><p>FRANK RICH, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": Good morning. How are you?</p><p>IMUS: I'm fine. How are you?</p><p>RICH: I'm fine. How old is Sam Moore?</p><p>IMUS: He's got to be around 212 years old.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RICH: That's what I thought. That's amazing. Have you had him on before?</p><p>IMUS: Oh, sure. He's a friend of mine. In fact, he's on -- well, if you're watching \"Good Morning America\" or listening to National Public Radio, or the stupid \"Today Show,\" or Fox and Fiends so you can be outraged, Sam is on the -- we did a record called the Imus Ranch Record --</p><p>RICH: Right.</p><p>IMUS: -- which was an enormous bestseller. And now we've done a second version, and Sam is on that, and he sounds like he's 30 years old.</p><p>RICH: That's amazing.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, they just cut it last year, this thing they did.</p><p>RICH: Jeez, that's great.</p><p>IMUS: So half my friends love you and the other half of my friends hate you. They say, \"Why do you put that bastard on?\" I say, \"Because I like him.\" Anyway --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RICH: I could probably say the reverse. Actually, I don't know many people who hate you.</p><p>IMUS: Well --</p><p>RICH: I'll look for them, if you want.</p><p>IMUS: I've made amends, I think. I hope.</p><p>Do you know A.O. Scott?</p><p>RICH: Yes, I do. I know him casually, yes. A very good guy, known as \"Tony.\" And I think a really good film critic.</p><p>IMUS: We read -- Charles and I, that's how we became fans of yours, you know, not because of your distorted weird political bent, but because of your writing, when you used to review the theater.</p><p>RICH: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And we read his review of \"Hereafter,\" and it's been a long time since I've read an essay like that. Man.</p><p>RICH: Well, you know, you're in for a treat, because he is really good. I read that piece, too, on Friday about the Eastwood movie. It was fantastic.</p><p>And he routinely does this, whatever the subject. And you well know, good writing, it doesn't matter, you have to agree with him or not. I haven't seen the Eastwood movie yet, but he's been great on this movie \"Inside Job.\"</p><p>He's just terrific. He's someone whose byline you look for even when it's a movie you have absolutely no interest in and you know you're never going to see no matter what he says about it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Well, of course Charles and I are late to the party, but we feel like we've just discovered this guy, which is, of course, so absurd, it's ridiculous. But the point being that's exactly right, because I didn't care anything about \"Hereafter,\" although we had Jay Mohr on, another segment you missed on the program while you were watching your reruns of \"The Daily Show,\" which I happen to like him though.</p><p>But just -- it's just some wonderfully constructed sentences.</p><p>MCCORD: Frank Richian.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>RICH: You know, I think that he's really, really good. And it's not like he's been around forever. I mean, he's a fairly young guy and -- and I'm terrible about dates, and so he's probably been writing for The Times, I don't know, at least 10 years at this point, but maybe not quite that long.</p><p>IMUS: And we just discovered him, right?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Normally other writers, I'm sure you'll agree with me, resent it, at least my experience over the years, whenever I mention someone else, although Elmore Leonard was here the other day --</p><p>RICH: Right?</p><p>IMUS: -- and he was very charming and gracious when we talked about other writers. But he's Elmore Leonard. What the hell does he care?</p><p>RICH: Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: Did you read Jeannette Walls, \"The Glass Castle\" or \"Half Broke Horses\"?</p><p>RICH: I have not. I've heard they're great, and I've just been a little memoired out, which is why I haven't gotten to it. But I hear they're wonderful. Do you agree?</p><p>IMUS: Oh, God, unbelievable. Did you ever read any Will James, the old cowboy?</p><p>RICH: No.</p><p>IMUS: No, of course not.</p><p>RICH: No, but tell me about it.</p><p>IMUS: Too busy reading these -- all these Russian novels.</p><p>RICH: Too busy reading crap in the news. I know.</p><p>IMUS: Well, he wrote a bunch of stuff. He was a real old-time cowboy, and he wrote -- his grammar was hideous, but he wrote these best-selling -- these pulp fiction deals years ago. And then wrote an autobiography, \"The Lone Cowboy,\" \"Smoky the Cowhorse,\" which my son has read growing up.</p><p>But Jeannette Walls, who was doing entertainment news at, for God's sake, MSNBC -- and we worked with her there.</p><p>RICH: I remember her, yes.</p><p>IMUS: If you were to tell me that she could write like this, I'd say, oh, get the hell out of here.</p><p>RICH: You know -- exactly, because I knew her, too. And she was doing show business gossip and stuff like that. I think I may have had a couple of dealings with her.</p><p>And no, I really -- I do want to read it. And I'll check out James as well.</p><p>I find, as I gather you still do, writing -- reading, particularly reading things that have nothing to do with the news or one's own actual work, the greatest solace going. And did you read this Jonathan Franzen novel, \"Freedom\"?</p><p>IMUS: I got to 160 pages. You know what I decided?</p><p>RICH: What?</p><p>IMUS: I don't give a damn what happens to Walter, what's her name, or anybody else in this book. They can all go to hell. And I stopped reading it.</p><p>RICH: The good thing is that they do, but I liked it more than that. But if you give it 160 pages, that's a fair shake.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I didn't think he was as good as DeLillo or Richard Price or certainly Elmore Leonard or any of those people.</p><p>RICH: They're all great.</p><p>IMUS: I just didn't care. I wasted -- I'll never get that time back. It's on my iPad. I can't get rid of it. I can't delete it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RICH: Well, there's a way to get rid of it on your iPad, but yes --</p><p>IMUS: Hey, do you -- do you read books, or do you read off a Nook or a Kindle or an iPad or what?</p><p>RICH: Oh, I have to say, as much as I love books, and still like to have physical books, I find both the Kindle and iPad really convenient.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man, I've got a hundred books in here, and you just can skip -- it just changes your life.</p><p>RICH: It does. The great -- particularly if you're travelling.</p><p>I'm always -- as I'm getting on an airplane, I'm always indecisive about what book I want to bring. And I might want to bring a novel, I might want to bring a political book.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>RICH: And they're always so heavy. And so these days, to just be able, as you said, to bring a hundred books -- and if you board with all of them and be able to download something in 10 seconds is amazing.</p><p>The one problem, I actually was getting on a flight about a year ago from California to New York. And my then-Kindle crashed. And so I had nothing to read. I had no backup except one old newspaper, so --</p><p>RICH: Oh, you need to get the iPad.</p><p>RICH: Oh, I know. The iPad is great. And now, of course, you travel with both. So soon you'll end up travelling with 20 devices and 20 power chargers, and you might as well bring the damn book.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, no. You can get the iPad and then download the Kindle and the Nook app. That's what I do.</p><p>RICH: Oh, yes. I use the Kindle app.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>RICH: And it's great. It's just heavier to hold, but I love it. But if you're someplace sunny, like probably at the ranch or by a swimming pool, the Kindle is better because it doesn't have the glare.</p><p>IMUS: Talking with Frank Rich from \"The New York Times.\"</p><p>Well, you must have been -- being the number one Fox News hater on the planet, you must have just been hysterical when you got up this morning and discovered that \"The New York Post\" had endorsed Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>RICH: You know, it's really -- first of all, I actually wrote in a column this week, if you're a conservative Republican running in New York, I don't think it's a good idea to threaten to kill the lead political reporter on \"The New York Post,\" which Paladino threatening to \"take out\" Fred Dicker, a very good reporter, by the way.</p><p>And so, I don't know how you could make a bigger mistake than that. I guess Cuomo could have come and machine-gunned the front entrance of \"The New York Times.\" But that's a political mistake.</p><p>But, yes, it's quite an endorsement. And, of course, The Times this morning has a poll that shows a much better than 2-1 lead for Cuomo. And Cuomo is not someone who everybody loves, but he has been handed pure gold in the case of this opponent.</p><p>IMUS: And then the president and first lady, again something probably to make you feel good, because they were able to draw 35,000 people yesterday, although we did learn it was at Ohio State University. But whatever. So maybe the magic is back, huh?</p><p>RICH: Oh, I don't know. I don't know about the magic. You know.</p><p>IMUS: I'm just being sarcastic, Frank.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RICH: I know. I know. I know.</p><p>But look, he's -- they've messed a lot of things up. And now it looks like they're going to pay a price. Maybe they'll pull some of it out.</p><p>And they're helped -- the Democrats are certainly helped when they have flaky candidates like Paladino. But that's not many -- that's only a small number of the candidates. And the country is angry. They're angry at everybody, and the party in power is going to get the shaft in all likelihood.</p><p>IMUS: There's one sentence in your column yesterday talking about the level of rage coursing sometimes violently through our national bloodstream.</p><p>Tell me about that.</p><p>RICH: I think there's too much -- there's too much crazy stuff going on with people making, you know, threats of violence against the president, against, you know, anybody that they're mad at. And there have been a number of reports, not partisan reports --places like \"TIME\" magazine just did a six-month investigation that just shows that the threat levels are up. People are angry at the government, period.</p><p>And it has a haunted -- and indeed, the government itself is saying this is the worst it's been since that period in '94, early '95, before it all exploded in Oklahoma City. There's a lot of this going on.</p><p>Not all of it's aimed at Obama by any means. You know, there have been incidents all over the place. And I think that's bad.</p><p>I mean, I understand why people are angry, but we can't have, you know, people burning down mosques or threatening -- in San Francisco there was a guy who loaded himself up with guns and explosives and was going to go to some liberal foundation no one has ever heard of because he decided they were the enemy, and the ACLU, and blow them up.</p><p>It's free-floating violence. I'm convinced what it's about is the economy.</p><p>People are desperate. And there's not a day that goes by where you don't hear or learn of personally or read in the newspaper or watch on TV some story about, you know, a family that's lost everything, and in many cases done nothing wrong, except be on the wrong side of this complete mess, economic mess, where a lot of jobs are not going to come back.</p><p>IMUS: What do you think people mean when they say we're going to take our country back? First of all, from who?</p><p>RICH: Yes. I think there are two -- the more benign way to look at it is that people just feel the government's somehow taken over their lives, which I really think is an incredible exaggeration. I don't think that Obama or this administration has been nearly that effective to take -- you know, take back people's-- take control of people's lives.</p><p>But I think there's some element of that. We want no more government. Of course, people do want government if it's going to pay their Social Security check or Medicare check, but we don't want any more government. That's the benign.</p><p>I also feel, particularly at the beginning, there was a racial cast to some of it. When someone yells -- a politician yells to an audience that's entirely of white people, \"Let's take our country back!\" intentionally or not, it has an undercurrent that I think that's ugly, too.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, I agree.</p><p>Talking with Frank Rich here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Bernard has a good line to describe Obamacare -- \"Taxes going up, Grandma going down.\"</p><p>RICH: Taxes going up, what going down?</p><p>IMUS: \"Taxes going up, grandma going down.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RICH: Can you fit it on a bumper sticker?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't know. Probably could, yes.</p><p>RICH: But take the health care plan. Who really knows what's in it?</p><p>IMUS: They don't.</p><p>RICH: I mean, I'm worried about it. I don't think people even-- and it's a mishmash, and we don't even -- we can't even -- it may be bad, but the fact is it certainly hasn't helped Obama, because no one sees any advantages yet, if there are any.</p><p>IMUS: Always nice to see you on the program. Buy some Jeannette Walls and Will James. All right?</p><p>RICH: I will. Will James is new to me. I'll start with him and then go to Jeannette Walls. That's great. Thank you.</p><p>IMUS: You're welcome, Frank.</p><p>Frank Rich, \"New York Times.\"</p><p>Twelve minutes until the hour</p><p>IMUS: Another ugly e-mail from Neil Cavuto --</p><p>MCCORD: Now what?</p><p>IMUS: -- regarding the Frank Rich interview.</p><p>Writes Neil at 8:48 a.m. Eastern Time, \"Totally pointless interview. Completely vapid. Half of it spent talking about loading books on iPad. Are you kidding me?\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: I've got a good idea, fatso.</p><p>MCCORD: OK. What is it?</p><p>IMUS: You get somebody else to do this for you, your dumb little business channel. See how that works out for you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Spent half the time talking about the iPad.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: He's such an idiot. And he hates Frank Rich. Oh, God, he hates Frank.</p><p>Doesn't he?</p><p>MCCORD: They have differences probably in philosophical viewpoints.</p><p>IMUS: But here's the difference. I love Cavuto. I'm telling you. People in this building, I'm telling you now, love Cavuto, as do I.</p><p>MCCORD: As they should.</p><p>IMUS: But he obviously -- but he hates Frank, and I don't care because I like Frank. Well, obviously, poor Neil is -- I mean, maybe the vig (ph) is not being paid in the Cavuto crime family or he wants another eclair or who knows?</p><p>(REPEAT

In fact, amid protestations by groups including the Internet Association, which claims Facebook, Google and Twitter are bias-free, it's an open fact that Big Tech is run predominantly by those on the ideological left. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey even admitted this before Congress, and footage of Google's leadership consoling one another after President Trump's victory in 2016 indicates the same is true for them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Many on the right have complained loudly and often of anti-conservative bias online. Unfortunately, all too often this is where our efforts stop. Once we're ignored or dismissed long enough, conservatives seem to just shrug our collective shoulders and accept defeat. It's this type of passivity that has allowed progressives to dominate film and television, universities and large swaths of the mainstream news media.</p><p> How did they accomplish that? By fighting tooth and nail for what they believe in every vertical.</p><p> I founded Turning Point USA to take the fight for ideological diversity directly to a progressive stronghold: the nation's leading colleges and universities. Now, with Trump's social media summit on Thursday, we have an opportunity to challenge another progressive hegemony, this time in Big Tech. If we don't yet know the exact solution to the problem, Thursday's summit is an important step in fighting to ensure social media platforms remain forums where all ideologies have a voice.</p><p> However, fighting back against private companies with government action is a politically and ideologically fraught idea for those of us on the right. Why? Because the last thing we want is more government regulation against private businesses. Regulation often helps Big Industry remain entrenched in power. The burdensome costs of complying with any new regulation would be a rounding error for the likes of Facebook and Google, but it might completely destroy a promising start-up poised to challenge their dominance.</p><p> Conservatives by and large believe in the corrective power of the free market above all. If we don't like how private companies are doing business, we should just start our own to compete, right?</p><p> There is one glaring problem with this: The free market must be functioning freely for this to be true. There is now ample reason to believe the market's normal corrective powers are being blocked by anti-competitive forces.</p><p> Many reputable economists and business executives have already made compelling arguments that these companies should be considered monopolies and are unfairly stifling competition. Jeremy Stoppelman, the co-founder of Yelp, concluded start-ups similar to his firm would no longer be successful today since \"that opportunity has been closed off by Google and their approach.\" Consider that Google alone controls more than 90 percent of all online searches, and its monopolistic power comes into frightening focus. The European Union even levied a $2.7 billion fine against Google, claiming the company manipulated search results to suppress competitors.</p><p> The second obstacle to the free market is Big Tech's exploitation of preexisting laws, namely Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that was passed by Congress in the '90s. Social media companies have leveraged Section 230 to great effect, and astounding profits, by claiming they are platforms \u2014 not publishers \u2014 thereby avoiding under the law billions of dollars in potential copyright infringement and libel lawsuits. YouTube, for example, advertises itself as an open platform \"committed to fostering a community where everyone's voice can be heard.\" Facebook and Twitter make similar claims.</p><p> Let's be clear, when these companies censor or suppress conservative content, they are behaving as publishers, and they should be held legally responsible for the all the content they publish. If they want to continue hiding behind Section 230 and avoid legal and financial calamity, they must reform.</p><p> As radio host Dennis Prager often says, if an airline permitted only those passengers holding The New York Times to board but then denied Wall Street Journal readers, we would all rightly call this discrimination and demand the airline change its policy. In the same way, conservatives cannot win the battle of ideas if we're marginalized or removed from mainstream culture and mainstream platforms.</p><p> How did we respond when progressives came to dominate higher education? We formed a few alternative universities such as Hillsdale College and Liberty University. Though we deeply value these institutions, it's also impossible for them to reverse higher education's half-century-long drift to the left. The same will be true on today's dominant social media platforms if we reflexively assume the free market will save us.</p><p> As a 25-year-old digital native, both my life and my organization have greatly benefited from social media. This is why I'm an optimist. But I'm also a realist. Conservatives can either acknowledge the fight we're already in \u2014 and fight to win \u2014 or forfeit our cultural influence to another generation in yet another, and perhaps the most important, information medium ever to exist.</p><p> Charlie Kirk is the founder and chief executive of Turning Point USA , a conservative youth organization, and host of a show on Apple Podcasts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNC-fc7e37cf6bb443eca25a285526d4f49579b8474</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899BFB5FDF5A1 NWBKNC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJW-B2W1-JBCN-40YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401970</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"912\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Salisbury Post<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

kicked<br/>the snow off his shoes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When he practices in the afternoons for Virginia Tech, he sees<br/>cattle on a hillside.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's hard to find a club there.\u00a0\u00a0No need for The Club, either.</p><p>But four years in the foothills have not chilled the Florida _<br/>the bravado, the belligerence and, above all, the talk _ out of<br/>Charlton.</p><p>Tuesday night, he says, is when the scores get settled and the<br/>circle is fully drawn.\u00a0\u00a0Charlton, from Orlando, yearned to intercept<br/>passes for Florida State.\u00a0\u00a0Now he plans to lurch out of their<br/>discarded recruiting files, like a fungus from an index card, and<br/>beat the Seminoles out of a national championship in the Sugar Bowl.</p><p>\"I don't think they're any better than some of the teams we've<br/>played,\" Charlton said.\u00a0\u00a0\"I know we've played against better<br/>quarterbacks.\u00a0\u00a0But I don't think they've seen a defense like ours. \"</p><p>This is what Florida kids do.\u00a0\u00a0Win the talk first.\u00a0\u00a0Then back it<br/>up.</p><p>Few coaches bother to regulate the woofing anymore, primarily<br/>because it isn't an insult anymore.\u00a0\u00a0Respect?\u00a0\u00a0You never give it and<br/>you spend all week getting mad that you don't have it.</p><p>Today's players find it hypocritical to serve as a promotional<br/>vehicle for opponents.\u00a0\u00a0Why make somebody feel good, just before you<br/>plant a helmet in his liver?</p><p>Fifteen Floridians play for Virginia Tech.\u00a0\u00a0\"That revenge factor<br/>_ wanting to beat somebody who didn't want you _ will be big,\" Tech<br/>assistant coach Billy Hite said last week.\u00a0\u00a0\"We're going to have to<br/>make sure Charlton doesn't say anything. \"</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Charlton also is a 21st-century player in his desire to play<br/>defense.</p><p>Florida State was more interested in his offensive skills.\u00a0\u00a0\"I<br/>don't know, but nowadays it's more fun to play defense, to run<br/>around and put a big hit on somebody and get on ESPN,\" he said.</p><p>Besides, Virginia Tech's defenders play offense, too.\u00a0\u00a0Charlton<br/>returned an interception for a touchdown against Clemson, returned<br/>a fumble for a score against Miami.\u00a0\u00a0The defense scored six<br/>touchdowns in the '99 season, just nine fewer than Tech's 11<br/>victims scored.</p><p>It's possible that Charlton will score his first bowl touchdown<br/>before Peter Warrick does.\u00a0\u00a0Warrick, the Florida State All-American<br/>and possible No. 1 pick in the 2000 NFL draft, has scored 37<br/>touchdowns in his career, but none in January, and last year he<br/>caught one lonely pass for 7 yards in the Fiesta Bowl-national<br/>title loss to Tennessee.</p><p>\"He's a great receiver,\" Charlton said.\u00a0\u00a0\"But we've played great<br/>receivers in our conference and held them down. \"</p><p>The cornerback on the other side is Anthony Midget, from<br/>Clewiston, near Florida's Lake Okeechobee.\u00a0\u00a0Pure football players<br/>spring from the lake country, where distractions are rare, and the<br/>alternative to college is a sugar-cane field.\u00a0\u00a0Midget grew up a<br/>Miami fan, but by the time he was recruited, the Hurricanes were<br/>serving a probation.\u00a0\u00a0A senior, Midget is undefeated against Miami,<br/>as is everyone else on the roster.</p><p>Overall, the defense ranks third nationally overall and eighth<br/>in pass defense.\u00a0\u00a0Only two receivers broke the 100-yard mark against<br/>Tech, and that happened on the same day, when Antonio Bryant and<br/>Latef Grim of Pittsburgh caught the Hokies without two of their<br/>secondary starters.</p><p>Miami's Santana Moss was held to four catches for 25 yards.\u00a0\u00a0Rod<br/>Gardner of Clemson, who caught 80 passes for the year, took nine<br/>for 94 yards.\u00a0\u00a0West Virginia's Khori Ivy had seven catches for 79<br/>yards.</p><p>Six of Warrick's eight touchdown catches came against<br/>defenseless Duke and Maryland.\u00a0\u00a0And Chris Weinke, the FSU<br/>quarterback at whom Charlton scoffs, has thrown at least one<br/>interception in nine consecutive games.</p><p>The Tech defensive scheme is a variation on Washington's<br/>national championship unit of the early '90s.\u00a0\u00a0The ethic is simple _<br/>everybody find the ball.\u00a0\u00a0Cornerbacks such as Charlton and Midget<br/>are left to fend for themselves.\u00a0\u00a0But the other quarterback is the<br/>one sweating bullets.</p><p>Phil Elmassian installed the system when he was Tech's<br/>coordinator in the mid-'90s.\u00a0\u00a0Now at Wisconsin, Elmassian watched<br/>Tennessee freshman Peyton Manning burn Tech for 12-for-19 passing<br/>in a 45-23 Gator Bowl victory in '94.</p><p>\"I'm the guy who put Manning on the map,\" Elmassian said.\u00a0\u00a0\"But<br/>how many Mannings are there?\u00a0\u00a0What this defense does is let you play<br/>11-on-1 against the quarterback.\u00a0\u00a0You're not competing against the<br/>offensive coordinator anymore, but the quarterback. \"</p><p>Whether they lip it or zip it _ and Corey Moore, a regular<br/>lecturer, gagged himself after a Media Day tantrum here _ the<br/>Virginia Tech folks obviously think that Florida State lacks<br/>discipline and precision, that the Seminoles have so casually<br/>pranced through the threadbare ACC that they're developed bad<br/>habits.</p><p>That does not explain why Tech coach Frank Beamer allowed the<br/>Hokies to visit riverfront casinos this week.\u00a0\u00a0Bobby Bowden barred<br/>the Seminoles from the tables, which meant they had to break curfew<br/>the old-fashioned way _ in the bars.\u00a0\u00a0It's hard to out-misbehave<br/>Florida State.</p><p>Perhaps Beamer thought all the national praise for the Hokies<br/>was making them soft.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps he wanted the chips back on their<br/>shoulders, and the casino was the only place that had some.</p><p>Perhaps Beamer wanted the same Ike Charlton who, three games<br/>into the season, complained that nobody would throw the ball at<br/>him.\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm begging for it,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0Being from Florida, he was not<br/>kneeling for long.</p><p>Mark Whicker is a

No need for The Club, either.</p><p>But four years in the foothills have not chilled the Florida -- the bravado, the belligerence and, above all, the talk -- out of Charlton.</p><p>Tuesday night, he says, is when the scores get settled and the circle is fully drawn. Charlton, from Orlando, yearned to intercept passes for Florida State. Now he plans to lurch out of their discarded recruiting files, like a fungus from an index card, and beat the Seminoles out of a national championship in the Sugar Bowl.</p><p>''I don't think they're any better than some of the teams we've played,'' Charlton said. ''I know we've played against better quarterbacks. But I don't think they've seen a defence like ours.''</p><p>This is what Florida kids do. Win the talk first. Then back it up.</p><p>Few coaches bother to regulate the woofing anymore, primarily because it isn't an insult anymore. Respect? You never give it and you spend all week getting mad that you don't have it.</p><p>Today's players find it hypocritical to serve as a promotional vehicle for opponents. Why make somebody feel good, just before you plant a helmet in his liver?</p><p>Fifteen Floridians play for Virginia Tech. ''That revenge factor -- wanting to beat somebody who didn't want you -- will be big,'' Tech assistant coach Billy Hite said last week. ''We're going to have to make sure Charlton doesn't say anything.''</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Charlton also is a 21st-century player in his desire to play defence.</p><p>Florida State was more interested in his offensive skills. ''I don't know, but nowadays it's more fun to play defence, to run around and put a big hit on somebody and get on ESPN,'' he said.</p><p>Besides, Virginia Tech's defenders play offence, too. Charlton returned an interception for a touchdown against Clemson, returned a fumble for a score against Miami. The defence scored six touchdowns in the '99 season, just nine fewer than Tech's 11 victims scored.</p><p>It's possible that Charlton will score his first bowl touchdown before Peter Warrick does. Warrick, the Florida State All-American and possible No. 1 pick in the 2000 NFL draft, has scored 37 touchdowns in his career, but none in January, and last year he caught one lonely pass for 7 yards in the Fiesta Bowl-national title loss to Tennessee.</p><p>''He's a great receiver,'' Charlton said. ''But we've played great receivers in our conference and held them down.''</p><p>The cornerback on the other side is Anthony Midget, from Clewiston, near Florida's Lake Okeechobee. Pure football players spring from the lake country, where distractions are rare, and the alternative to college is a sugar cane field. Midget grew up a Miami fan, but by the time he was recruited, the Hurricanes were serving a probation. A senior, Midget is undefeated against Miami, as is everyone else on the roster.</p><p>Overall, the defence ranks third nationally overall and eighth in pass defence. Only two receivers broke the 100-yard mark against Tech.</p><p>The Tech defensive scheme is a variation on Washington's national championship unit of the early '90s. The ethic is simple -- everybody find the ball. Cornerbacks such as Charlton and Midget are left to fend for themselves. But the other quarterback is the one sweating bullets.</p><p>Whether they lip it or zip it -- and Corey Moore, a regular lecturer, gagged himself after a Media Day tantrum here -- the Virginia Tech folks obviously think that Florida State lacks discipline and precision, that the Seminoles have so casually pranced through the threadbare ACC that they're developed bad habits.</p><p>Which does not explain why Tech coach Frank Beamer allowed the Hokies to visit riverfront casinos this week. Bobby Bowden barred the Seminoles from the tables, which meant they had to break curfew the old-fashioned way -- in the bars. It's hard to out-misbehave Florida State.</p><p>Perhaps Beamer thought all the national praise for the Hokies was making them soft. Perhaps he wanted the chips back on their shoulders, and the casino was the only place that had some.</p><p>Perhaps Beamer wanted the same Ike Charlton who, three games into the season, complained that nobody would throw the ball at him. ''I'm begging for it,'' he said.</p><p>Being from Florida, he was not kneeling for long.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CALHER2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3Y7X-KRJ0-00KD-50S0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Calgary Herald (Alberta, Canada)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 CanWest Interactive, a division of CanWest Global Communications Corp.

The best course for change is to bring fintech banking inside the regulated banking system rather than keeping it outside, looking in.</p><p>The reason no one can create a fintech bank today is because the U.S. bank regulation structure makes concentrated ownership - a feature of venture-funded innovation - an insurmountable barrier for most would-be banks.</p><p>Even where that's not an issue, it's nearly impossible for fintechs to convince regulators to approve their de novo banking applications. This is because digital banks, by definition, don't look like the Main Street startup banks around which regulatory approaches were built.</p><p>The applications that are accepted are processed with painful slowness if it shows any hint of an innovative approach. Justask Varo Money, which is still waiting on final regulatory approvals for a banking charter first filed in July 2017.</p><p>This is a stark contrast to Europe, in particular the U.K., where \"challenger\" banks are common.</p><p>While the U.S. regulatory process is stuck, politicians like Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., are introducing one-off bills tofurther limit industrial loan companyapplicants. Meanwhile, state financial regulators are suing (and so far, succeeding) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency over its new special-purpose bank charter for fintechs.</p><p>It's not a hopeful picture for those who think inviting fintech, along with other types of parallel and shadow banking entities, into the regulated banking system - rather than pushing them away - is the right policy outcome to manage systemic risks.</p><p>Despite these challenges, many fintechs (Varo Money, LendingClub, OnDeck, Robinhood, Square and Revolut, among others) areactively trying to becomesome type of a bank.</p><p>The reasons they want to be a \"real\" bank are obvious. Licensed banks in the U.S. get extremely valuable privileges, including direct access to the payments system, low-cost deposits, stable funding and a national platform to preempt conflicting state laws. This would be especially valuable for fintech lenders and payments innovators. But no one has made it to the goal line yet.</p><p>What about the contradictory proposition that, today, anyone can be a fintech bank? Just look around.</p><p>So many fintech and big tech companies have created so-called synthetic banks. These are companies that provide insured checking and savings accounts, payment cards and most of the capabilities of a traditional consumer bank without actually being a licensed bank.</p><p>From their customers' point of view, companies like Aspiration, Chime, Varo, N26, MoneyLion and Betterment (not to mention Apple, Google and a few old-timers like Fidelity) are banks for all practical purposes.</p><p>Synthetic banks combine a customer-friendly user experience and interface with access to necessary parts of the regulated financial system through contracts with existing banking players. Experienced, specialized service providers like Cambr and Promontory make synthetic banking's complex interactions with the banking rails close to a plug-and-play. As a result, just about anyone can start offering banking services to consumers within a few months of deciding it's a good idea.</p><p>But there's a big downside: Synthetic banks pay a heavy financial toll to gain access to the financial rails controlled by the incumbent banking oligopoly. Traditional banks are fighting hard to hold onto the economic rents they receive from exclusive access to deposit funding and the payments system, with policy inertia as their powerful ally.</p><p>Entrepreneurs must decide whether to challenge the current system for maximum future value, or try to fit within operational and financial limitations which limit the chance for business and financial success. It's a mess.</p><p>Regulators have the legal authority and tools to resolve the paradox, even if they sometimes appear to think they don't have such authority. All it takes is regulatory will.</p><p>There's nothing that prevents regulators from licensing all types of fintech specialty banks, which would then become subject to the full scope of current banking regulations. It's working fine in Europe where newly chartered fintech banks take deposits, do transactions and payments that, in collaboration with regulators, broadens banking services to consumers without creating excessive risk.</p><p>There's also nothing to prevent regulators from imposing higher levels of supervisory oversight as well as bespoke capital, liquidity and activities limitations on fintechs as a way of making sure that only appropriate risks are taken.</p><p>Legislators and regulators could also help by easing the limits on bank holding companies and the Volcker Rule that pertain to \"controlling\" investor stakes; and resolving (one way or the other) questions around forming an industrial loan company or getting a fintech charter.</p><p>Nature abhors an unresolved paradox.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016e-9351-d1b2-a16e-bbff11720000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XK4-7431-F06X-W2T9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

The best course for change is to bring fintech banking inside the regulated banking system rather than keeping it outside, looking in.</p><p>The reason no one can create a fintech bank today is because the U.S. bank regulation structure makes concentrated ownership - a feature of venture-funded innovation - an insurmountable barrier for most would-be banks.</p><p>Even where that's not an issue, it's nearly impossible for fintechs to convince regulators to approve their de novo banking applications. This is because digital banks, by definition, don't look like the main street startup banks around which regulatory approaches were built.</p><p>The applications that are accepted are processed with painful slowness if it shows any hint of an innovative approach. Justask Varo Money, which is still waiting on final regulatory approvals for a banking charter first filed in July 2017.</p><p>This is a stark contrast to Europe, in particular the U.K., where \"challenger\" banks are common.</p><p>While the U.S. regulatory process is stuck, politicians like Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., are introducing one-off bills tofurther limit industrial loan companyapplicants. Meanwhile, state financial regulators are suing (and so far, succeeding) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency over its new special-purpose bank charter for fintechs.</p><p>It's not a hopeful picture for those who think inviting fintech, along with other types of parallel and shadow banking entities, into the regulated banking system - rather than pushing them away - is the right policy outcome to manage systemic risks.</p><p>Despite these challenges, many fintechs (Varo Money, LendingClub, OnDeck, Robinhood, Square and Revolut, among others) areactively trying to becomesome type of a bank.</p><p>The reasons they want to be a \"real\" bank are obvious. Licensed banks in the U.S. get extremely valuable privileges, including direct access to the payments system, low-cost deposits, stable funding and a national platform to preempt conflicting state laws. This would be especially valuable for fintech lenders and payments innovators. But no one has made it to the goal line yet.</p><p>What about the contradictory proposition that, today, anyone can be a fintech bank? Just look around.</p><p>So many fintech and big tech companies have created so-called synthetic banks. These are companies that provide insured checking and savings accounts, payment cards and most of the capabilities of a traditional consumer bank without actually being a licensed bank.</p><p>From their customers' point of view, companies like Aspiration, Chime, Varo, N26, MoneyLion and Betterment (not to mention Apple, Google and a few old-timers like Fidelity) are banks for all practical purposes.</p><p>Synthetic banks combine a customer-friendly user experience and interface with access to necessary parts of the regulated financial system through contracts with existing banking players. Experienced, specialized service providers like Cambr and Promontory make synthetic banking's complex interactions with the banking rails close to a plug-and-play. As a result, just about anyone can start offering banking services to consumers within a few months of deciding it's a good idea.</p><p>But there's a big downside: synthetic banks pay a heavy financial toll to gain access to the financial rails controlled by the incumbent banking oligopoly. Traditional banks are fighting hard to hold onto the economic rents they receive from exclusive access to deposit funding and the payments system, with policy inertia as their powerful ally.</p><p>Entrepreneurs must decide whether to challenge the current system for maximum future value, or try to fit within operational and financial limitations which limit the chance for business and financial success. It's a mess.</p><p>Regulators have the legal authority and tools to resolve the paradox, even if they sometimes appear to think they don't have such authority. All it takes is regulatory will.</p><p>There's nothing that prevents regulators from licensing all types of fintech specialty banks, which would then become subject to the full scope of current banking regulations. It's working fine in Europe where newly chartered fintech banks take deposits, do transactions and payments that, in collaboration with regulators, broadens banking services to consumers without creating excessive risk.</p><p>There's also nothing to prevent regulators from imposing higher levels of supervisory oversight as well as bespoke capital, liquidity and activities limitations on fintechs as a way of making sure that only appropriate risks are taken.</p><p>Legislators and regulators could also help by easing the limits on bank holding companies and the Volker rule that pertain to \"controlling\" investor stakes; and resolving (one way or the other) questions around forming an industrial loan company or getting a fintech charter.</p><p>Nature abhors an unresolved paradox.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016e-9351-d1b2-a16e-bbff11720000-227</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XK4-B351-F06X-W3F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

In particular, in advanced economies, rising corporate market power has been blamed for low investment despite rising corporate profits, declining business dynamism, weak productivity, and a falling share of income paid to workers. </p><p>The rise of corporate giants has raised fresh questions about whether this trend might continue and, if so, whether some rethinking of policy is needed to maintain fair and strong competition in the digital age. However, corporate market power is hard to measure and common indicators such as market concentration or profit rates can be misleading. Our Chart of the Week, based on an upcoming IMF working paper using data for publicly listed firms from 74 countries, shows that the issue is broad and goes beyond Big Tech. Specifically, the chart plots the average markups (the ratio of the price at which firms sell their output to the marginal cost of production of that output, which provides a measure of market power) across all firms for advanced and emerging and developing economies.<url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/eng-may-30-cotw-corporategiants-1.png\">https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/eng-may-30-cotw-corporategiants-1.png</url> The chart unveils two clear facts. First, markups among advanced economies have significantly increased since the 1980s, by 43 percent on average, and this trend has accelerated during the present decade. Second, among emerging market and developing economies, the rise of markups is much more moderate, a 5 percent increase on average since 1990. More in-depth analysis shows that the increase in markups in advanced economies is mostly driven by 'superstar' firms that managed to increase their market power further, while markups in other firms have essentially been flat. Interestingly, this pattern is found in all broad economic sectors, not just in information and communication technology. Should we be concerned about this rise in corporate market power in advanced economies? The short answer is yes, especially if this trend continues. Our paper finds that, starting from low levels, higher markups are initially associated with increasing investment and innovation, but this relationship becomes negative when market power becomes too strong. Further, the link between markups and investment and innovation is more strongly negative in industries featuring higher degrees of market concentration. The paper also finds a negative association in firms between labor shares and markups, implying that the labor share of income declines in industries where market power rises. In other words, with higher market power, the share of firms' revenue going to workers decreases, while the share of revenue going to profits increases. What are the policy implications? These will depend on the factors behind this increase in global market power, which are still being debated. Possible culprits include the rise of intangible assets such as software, network effects (when a product's value to the user increases as the number of users of the product grows), or weaker anti-trust enforcement.

If we have runaway inflation, gold may do very well. If not, it probably won't be spectacular. Which industries boom will depend on how the economy evolves, but also on political decisions (eg, big tech firms may run foul of regulators). As for individual stocks - the biggest winners may well be companies that change the world in a way most of us can't yet foresee (perhaps in healthcare or green energy).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this week's magazine, we've got <url normalizedValue=\"https://moneyweek.com/investments/investment-strategy/601372/how-youd-invest-ps1000-until-2030\">some of your suggestions about what looks most exciting</url>. But more prosaically, we can also consider which asset classes simply look cheap given what we've learned in MoneyWeek's first 20 years and before. If the future is vaguely like the past and present, they should stand a good chance of doing well. The one caveat, of course, is that we are not heading into a decade of complete despair. If we are, cash, gold and perhaps long-term US Treasury bonds (I'd assume yields would go deeply negative, at least initially), would probably be all that you'll want to hold.</p><h>Growth, inflation and income</h><p>If you're looking for stockmarket growth, emerging Asia appears cheaper than other major regions. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://moneyweek.com/glossary/price-to-book-ratio/\">price/book ratio</url> for the MSCI Asia ex Japan index has been a strong predictor of returns in the past: a value below 1.5 has been consistent with double-digit annualised returns on average. Currently it stands at 1.47. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Xtrackers MSCI AC Asia ex Japan (<url normalizedValue=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/XAXJ.L\">LSE: XAXJ</url>)</emphasis> is a simple way to invest.</p><p>Resources stocks look like a bargain in their own right: the MSCI ACWI Commodity Producers index yields twice as much as the wider market (although dividends are uncertain right now). Even more interestingly, they should offer a decent hedge against high inflation. I'm not fond of this sector most of the time, but it increasingly looks like time to buy. There's no all-in-one ETF, but the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SSGA SPDR MSCI World Energy (<url normalizedValue=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/WNRG.L\">LSE: WNRG</url>)</emphasis> and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vaneck Vectors Global Mining (<url normalizedValue=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GDIG.L\">LSE: GDIG</url>) </emphasis>could be a good combination.</p><p>Income will be even harder to find, since interest rates will surely fall further. Everything is pricey, but there may be some (risky) mileage in fallen angels (investment grade bonds downgraded to junk). Spreads to government bonds (ie, the difference in yield between corporate bonds and government bonds) are twice what they were (although down from March) and the US Federal Reserve has made it clear that it will prop up the market. The 4.8% yield on the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">iShares Fallen Angels High Yield Corp Bond GBP Hedged (<url normalizedValue=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/WIGG.L\">LSE: WIGG</url>)</emphasis> could be appealing while inflation stays low.</p><h>I wish I knew what a bond was but I'm to embarrassed to ask</h><p>When governments or large companies want to borrow money, they can do so by issuing bonds to investors. Sovereign bonds are issued by governments, while one from a company is a corporate bond.</p><p>The bond issuer receives a loan from the bond investors, on which it must pay interest at set intervals - typically annually or semi-annually. The annual rate of interest is known as the coupon. This is normally fixed for the life of the bond, and so the bond market is also known as the fixed-income market.</p><p>The amount borrowed - known as the principal - must usually be repaid on a specified date (the maturity date).\u00a0</p><p>Bonds are typically tradeable instruments, so the investors can then sell them on to other people. A bond is issued with a face value (or a par value) - eg, \u00a3100 - and this is the amount that all holders will get paid at maturity. But the market price of the bond will fluctuate, and may be less or more than par value.</p><p>Bond investors tend to think in yields rather than prices. The \"current yield\" is the coupon as a percentage of the price. So if our bond pays 5% interest (\u00a35 a year) and the market price is \u00a3105, the current yield is 4.76%. The \"yield to maturity\" is the return for an investor who holds the bond until it matures. While our bond sells for \u00a3105, when it matures it will return its par value of \u00a3100 - so the yield to maturity here is less than the current yield. How much less depends on when it matures - if that's in six months, rather than six years, the difference will be greater.\u00a0</p><p>A highly trusted nation - eg, the US - or a highly rated company - such as Apple - will be able to pay a low coupon. Less reliable nations, such as Argentina, or small firms will pay more.</p><p>Rising interest rates are bad for bond prices. As the rates available elsewhere go up, yields on existing bonds must rise to compete, so their prices must fall. Inflation is also a problem because the coupon and principal is usually fixed, so inflation erodes their real value.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPMONW-httpsmoneyweekcominvestmentsinvestmentstrategy601375cheapbetsforthenextdecade</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPMONW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6006-MJV1-JB2G-R31W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464402</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Dennis Publishing Ltd.

Let\u2019s review how just how Twitter put itself in the crosshairs of the GOP for both policing and not policing user tweets.</p><p> According to President Donald Trump\u2019s tweets Tuesday and Wednesday, he believes Twitter is out of line and censoring him by adding the equivalent of an editor\u2019s note to some of his Tuesday tweets regarding mail-in ballots that said \u201cGet the facts about mail-in ballots.\u201d The link Twitter added leads to a page that provides links to various news outlet stories on mail-in ballots.</p><p> Regardless of anyone\u2019s feelings or facts about mail-in ballots, Twitter\u2019s updated user policy seems to state that monitoring content is beyond their control and they cannot take responsibility for such controls: \u201cAll Content is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content. We may not monitor or control the Content posted via the Services and, we cannot take responsibility for such Content.\u201d</p><p> But yet Twitter did monitor and take the responsibility to post their own note to a user tweet in this instance.</p><p> So Trump\u2019s assertion that he was treated unfairly has some legs. Going so far as to say \u201cTwitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH\u201d is a great tweet-bite but kicks the legs out from under his own legitimate concern. The president\u2019s tweet was flagged with the addition of the link beneath the tweet but it wasn\u2019t removed.</p><p> Which is where this logic train went completely off the rails and took on something like the nearly unintelligible screeches of the coastal kumbaya covens that advocate multi-cultural neighborhoods from behind gated communities.</p><p> Wednesday morning the president\u2019s tweet spot was more threatening of repercussions in an eye-for-an-eye fashion, with the basic message: If you censor me, I\u2019ll censor you right out of existence, with his tweet, \u201cRepublicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\u201d</p><p> So it reaches the point where the answer to perceived business censorship is for the government to censor the company out of business.</p><p> And that\u2019s where it gets actually strange.</p><p> For when Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) appeared on Fox News, his quote on the matter was \u201cBig tech gets a huge handout from the federal government. They get this special immunity, this special immunity from suits and from liability that\u2019s worth billions of dollars to them every year. Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China.\u201d</p><p> Ignore the obvious issue of the statement that immunity protection somehow carries a fiscal price tag the government is paying. Focus instead on what he\u2019s saying about what Twitter should be doing. Social media companies enjoy liability protection as a platform distributing other people\u2019s content. The senator is arguing Twitter should instead be responsible for its content under publishing rules that apply to newspapers.</p><p>Twitter is an aggregate of user-generated content, not a news publication producing its own content. The good senator from Missouri is arguing Twitter needs to step in and censor user content to fact-check it for fraud and libel before it allows tweets to publish, in effect, censoring tweets.</p><p> On one hand the president is threatening a social media company with censorship for censoring his tweets. On the other, Thursday\u2019s Executive Order threatens that same company for not censoring user tweets.</p><p> It leaves Twitter unable to determine the right thing to do while struggling to come to grips with the right thing to do.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTN-572fbc46a03511ea808800163ec2aa77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289694B731D4D6 NWBKTN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6014-0YN1-DXVP-V413-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401981</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"668\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Blount County Publishers LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

With 30-year time horizons and international ties that go back decades, they see the world differently than virtually any other entity, public or private. Recently, I had a chance to sit down with <person><nameText>John Watson, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Chevron's CEO, </nameText></person>for a wide-ranging conversation. </p><p>The following has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;nl/&gt; Henry Blodget: Ten years ago, nobody was breathing the possibility that the United States would become the world's No. 1 energy producer. How did that happen?&lt;nl/&gt; <person><nameText>John Watson</nameText></person>: Our industry tends to be viewed as static because the end product doesn't change very much. It's gasoline you put in your tank. But we're really a technology industry that produces oil. It's a very innovative business. There are a number of players, very big and very small, and they're constantly innovating, constantly competing.&lt;nl/&gt; So I think there's a tendency to underestimate the incentive that is out there to innovate and do things in a different way. Hydraulic fracturing is not new, directional drilling is not new, but putting them together the way that some of the innovators in our industry did \u2014 and it wasn't my company. A number of small entrepreneurs, some of them down to their last nickel, literally, were looking for a way to try to develop resources. And so that innovation, and the incentive that the marketplace provides, has fostered this environment. And it's happened in many ways. Shale is the most visible and surprising. But when I joined the company in 1980, a couple of hundred feet of water was deep water. Now we're doing work in 10,000 feet of water. Tremendous advancements in technology have taken place.&lt;nl/&gt; HB: And two or three years ago, all you heard was 'peak oil' in certain circles. Who is right? Are we going to run out, or is it infinite?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: There's plenty of oil in the world. The limitation on producing oil and gas is not the amount of oil and gas in the earth. It's the technology you apply get it out, the fiscal terms that are in place, the stability of the governments in place. And a variety of other above-ground risks, security amongst other things, that limit what can be produced and developed. In the United States, despite some restrictions, we have an environment in which the private sector has been allowed to innovate and develop resources. All the increase in production has taken place on private lands. Not on public lands. Not every country has that. Not every country has rule of law. There is a limit at some point [to the availability of oil in the world], but we're a long way from it.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;HB: The other thing that happened in the last year or two is that we've gone from people believing we're in an era of $100-plus oil and suddenly it was cut in half, $50 a barrel. Why didn't anybody see that coming?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: That's a good question! We've been introspective about that ourselves. In one sense, we should have seen it. I've been at Chevron for 35 years, and this is the fifth time I've seen a 50% or more reduction. So why didn't we see this one? I think the answer is that if you go back a year or so, supply and demand was in reasonable balance. Then the world economy slowed a little bit, a little bit more production came on from Iraq and Libya. Shale started producing a little better and you got out of balance.&lt;nl/&gt; What happens in our business is in general you put a lot of money in and then you produce. And if you misgauge that and you're producing too much, literally prices can fall to cash costs. But if you've already made the investment, you're going to keep producing. The operating cost to keep something running can be very low.&lt;nl/&gt; So it really amounts to a very steep supply-and-demand curve where once you get out of balance, prices can rise fast and they can fall fast. And typically in the past, OPEC or the Saudis would step in and make some production cuts. They've chosen not to do that. They've chosen that because their market share has gone from 50% 30 years ago to a third, OPEC as a whole. So they've chosen not to do that, so natural market forces are going to have to work. It will happen in due course, and the debate is how fast it will happen and where it will settle out when they rise.&lt;nl/&gt; HB: What's Chevron's best guess over the next few years? Are we staying at $50, back to $70, way over $100 again?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: Well, remember I was the one that wasn't able to predict the last decline? (Laughs)&lt;nl/&gt; HB: Absolutely! (laughs)&lt;nl/&gt; JW: I'll just say that the forces are at work now both on the cost side and on the price side to come into a better equilibrium. I expect this year to be a big shakeout year. This is a tough year because there's been momentum in the spin but you're seeing rig counts drop. You're seeing activity slow down. So 2015 is likely to be pretty choppy, and you've seen that.&lt;nl/&gt; I think that we'll get into better balance in 2016, and I think you'll see some price recovery. Where it ends up ultimately reasonable people could disagree on. What I'll tell you is a lot of the big projects aren't going to get started with the current cost/price relationships that we're seeing. Once that momentum works through the system and the spending effects start to be felt, you'll see prices recover.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;HB: The big projects that you refer to \u2014 how long do they take to come online?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: A deepwater development can take seven to 10 years, and then it produces for 20 or more. We've spent five-plus years building a big liquefied-natural-gas project in Australia. That will produce literally for 30 or 40 years. You do have to take a long-term view. We're still spending $35 billion this year on new projects. We are continuing to spend, but we all have to strike that balance between what you want to do to invest through the cycle and what you need to do to balance the near-term financial priorities.&lt;nl/&gt; We're continuing shale drilling, for example. We have a great position in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and we're continuing to invest when others are cutting back because we think it's economic to do so.&lt;nl/&gt; HB: Let's talk about energy in general. Is Chevron in the camp that believes global warming is a hoax, or is it real? And if it's real, what is the responsibility of an oil company in that?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: We're certainly not in the former camp. I wouldn't want to leave you with that impression. One of the challenges in talking about this subject is that we tend to jump right into that instead of stepping back a minute. I start from a more basic premise.&lt;nl/&gt; Everything you have in life \u2014 light, heat, mobility, the food you eat, the clothes you wear \u2014 every single thing you have is dependent upon fossil fuels. Eighty percent of the world's energy comes from fossil fuels. For most of the world, their priority is affordable energy. We are the envy of the world because we have tremendous diversity. We have renewables in this country. We've had hydropower for a long time, nuclear, oil, and gas and coal.&lt;nl/&gt;We are the envy of the world because we have tremendous diversity. We have renewables in this country. We've had hydropower for a long time, nuclear, oil, and gas and coal. Most of the world is just trying to keep the lights on.&lt;nl/&gt;We have this diversity. We have a rich portfolio of energy that we can choose from. Most of the world is just trying to keep the lights on or put the lights on.&lt;nl/&gt; When you start from a policy point of view, you have to ask: What are your priorities? The overwhelming priority is to sustain the quality of life that we have and for most of the world to achieve some semblance of the life we have. With that as a background, fossil fuels are essential to our life. Then you say, \"OK, what are the effects, and what should we do about them?\" That's where we need to strike the balance.&lt;nl/&gt; My general view is before we can replace fossil fuels we are going to have to have an affordable alternative. There was a big study for Secretary Chu that laid out a blueprint. Don't spend a lot of money subsidizing technologies that are not going to solve the problem. Invest in early-stage technologies, and we've identified about a dozen of them that may produce a step change in technologies.&lt;nl/&gt; No. 1: Husband the scarce resources that you have carefully. No. 2: There is low-hanging fruit that is economic to do in the way of energy conservation that we can put in place today. [No. 3:] we are blessed in this country with natural gas. It is naturally displacing coal and so it's a blessing. Enable that development. I don't mean subsidize it, enable that development, and that right there gets the United States on a pretty strong pathway.&lt;nl/&gt; Every country has its own energy objectives. I think most countries are going to continue, certainly in Asia and Africa, the developing nations, are going to continue to produce fossil fuels for a long time because it's all they can afford. That's certainly what China is going to do. I think that it is becoming apparent that the cost of a rapid transition when you don't have an economic alternative is going to be expensive. In Germany and Denmark electricity costs are triple the average in the United States.&lt;nl/&gt; If policymakers in our country want to impose additional costs on American consumers and business, just be transparent about it and tell the American people what the benefit is going to be versus the costs. What I think we tend to not do well in this country is talk candidly about those choices that we're making.&lt;nl/&gt; [For example,] in the Northeast, if you're going to shut down coal plants and nuclear plants, you better build pipelines through the Northeast so you can get natural gas in, right?&lt;nl/&gt; HB: And so why aren't we doing that? Is it local, national?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: It's both. At a federal level the Keystone Pipeline gets all the attention, and certainly that sets a very bad example from a policy point of view with a key ally to the north. It happens on a local level and at the state level as there has been some difficulty permitting natural-gas lines. My industry has to do its part, don't get me wrong. We have to be sure that we have the latest technology on pipelines. We have to be sure we work with the rail industry to be sure we keep the trains on the tracks and have the right sort of cars on the tracks. We have to be sure that we're listening to the public and we're out ahead of the concerns that are out there.&lt;nl/&gt; But fundamentally we have a great opportunity in this country and we just need to be sure we take advantage of it. I'm not in the coal and nuclear business. I think we're gradually dissipating our advantage in those areas, and I think there's probably an opportunity \u2014 even though it competes with my products.&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; HB: Do you think America's energy independence represents a fundamental change? Is this going to be true for generations to come, or is this more of a temporary state of affairs?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: Oh, I think we will have a competitive advantage as long as we continue to exercise that competitive advantage. I think we have a very secure system of energy supply. I think Americans should view it as a blessing. We have opportunity to take advantage of it and I think we've been able to do that largely on private lands. [In terms of prices,] I think there are real benefits to consumers. The way I describe it is when prices were high, our industry was investing very heavily and there were lots of jobs at a time when the countries needed it. Now prices are down and it's tough times for the oil patch, but consumers are benefiting and there's a stimulus effect from low prices. There's a benefit either way. That's the lens I look through. When I go overseas people say, 'You are so lucky.' Americans, you are so lucky. You have it all and I think we just have to be sure that our policies are consistent with that. [In America], we get some things right, and I think that's why we're succeeding.&lt;nl/&gt; HB: How is what is happening in Russia affecting the global market? Are you as worried \u2014 as a lot of ordinary citizens are \u2014 watching what appears to be a return to the Cold War?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: Well, we don't produce oil and gas in Russia. We do have a relationship with the government. We are partners with them in a pipeline that runs from Kazakhstan to the Black Sea across Russian territory. One of the things that makes American companies successful is that we're not political agents of our government. We play it straight. We were the only American company in Myanmar when it was a sanctioned country. We were one of the few American companies in Angola when they were at odds with the US government.&lt;nl/&gt; Our view is that Chevron and American companies can do a lot of good in these countries starting with our ethics, but extending into technology and development. At times when you have 30- and 40- or 50-year relationships with governments, you'll have ups and downs in the political cycle. I try not to enter that fray. We abide by the laws that the US has. We cannot do business with Iran today. So we don't do business with Iran.&lt;nl/&gt; HB: Chevron has moved a bunch of people from California to Texas. Is Texas better?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: Well, our headquarters is based in California and in fact our biggest position in the refining marketing business is in California. That's where headquarters is and that's where a lot of people are based.&lt;nl/&gt; The epicenter of the exploration business, the upstream business, is Houston, and so over time we've gradually migrated a lot of our headquarters-type activity closer to there. We've got a big presence in Midland, and we have one in Bakersfield, southern California. We go where the work is.&lt;nl/&gt; I think there are advantages to being in California.&lt;nl/&gt;I think there are advantages to being in California. There's a big environmental community. There's a big tech community. I think we've been out ahead of some in the industry thinking through some of the issues are where the sensitivities are with the American people.&lt;nl/&gt;We used to be called the California Company, so we've been here 135 years and I think we'll be here a lot longer. One of the advantages to being in California is that it's a little unusual for an oil company. There's a big NGO community. There's a big environmental community. There's a big tech community, and I think California as a leader in trends there are benefits to being close to that. Some people think of it as a disadvantage. I don't because I think we've been out ahead of some in the industry and thinking through some of the issues and where the sensitivities are with American people and environmental groups and others.&lt;nl/&gt; HB: So it's not a function that California's laws and taxes have just become egregiously restrictive and high? There are plenty of people in the finance industry who are moving across the border to Arizona. You've got people in Silicon Valley doing the same thing \u2014 if not Arizona, Nevada. It doesn't have anything to do with that?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: I am concerned about the fiscal direction of the state. The governor is working on a number of initiatives. I think we have a tax system that's very top heavy. I do think there's risk that a lot of high-income earners are choosing to leave the state. I try not to whine about it because every company has a choice.&lt;nl/&gt; We've chosen to stay, but I hope the governor and the legislature and others will be responsive because it is a costly place to do business. Not just from a tax point of view, but from a regulatory point of view and otherwise. The state has some very successful areas. Silicon Valley gets a lot of attention. Hollywood gets a lot of attention. You've got depression in the central valley of the state, and so it's a state of haves and have nots. It's going to need to be addressed in due course. I'm a lifer in California. I was born and raised here, fourth-generation Californian.&lt;nl/&gt; HB: What keeps you up at night now? What is your greatest worry?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: Frankly, the biggest thing I worry about every night is will our employees be safe, and the contractors. We have 60,000 employees, but 300,000 people work on our job sites every day, contractors and others, and I want to be sure they're safe. I think a lot about that, and I feel good about the position that we're in.&lt;nl/&gt; There are a number of business issues that I think about. I won't say price, per se. I think more about how we execute the work that we're doing. I want to be sure that in a price downturn we're still doing the right things in developing employees. One of the reasons the industry was in short supply of people is because during the '80s and '90s when prices were down we didn't hire very many people. We're going to continue to be on college campuses and hiring.&lt;nl/&gt; HB: You have this extraordinary statistic at the company: The average employee tenure is 31 years. People seem to join as 20-year-olds and work for Chevron forever. How do you do that in this day and age?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: I think our average employee is in their 40s now, but we've been going through what we call a crew change where a lot of people of my vintage, they're starting to cycle out and we're bringing in a lot of people off college campuses and otherwise.&lt;nl/&gt; I live in California. I'm from Silicon Valley.&lt;nl/&gt; I have a lot of tech friends and the common view is that jobs are portable. You build your skillset. You can't trust the company you're with and you move on. That may be true in some business, in some careers, in some technologies.&lt;nl/&gt; That is not what we tell the people we hire. I just described we're in a long-cycle business, and we don't hire people knowingly that we don't think can stay with us.&lt;nl/&gt;I have a lot of tech friends and the common view is that jobs are portable. You build your skillset. You can't trust the company you're with and you move on. That is not what we tell the people we hire. We're in a long-cycle business, and we don't hire people knowingly that we don't think can stay with us.&lt;nl/&gt;Obviously some choose to and some don't, but my view is people leave a company when they don't think they have opportunities. We have tremendous opportunities for people.&lt;nl/&gt; HB: How do you differentiate? When you're on a college campus pitching Chevron, what are you saying? \"Oh, you don't want to go work for Exxon. You want to come to Chevron because ...\" Why?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: I've never believed in negative marketing. It may sound corny in this day and age, but we talk about values. You go back to the '60s and '70s \u2014 we thought we were idealistic in those days. Well, the kids are really idealistic today, whether it's on environmental issues or otherwise. You have to be progressive in your views and prove you live up to your values.&lt;nl/&gt; A lot of people we hire start with internships, and we have an incredible retention rate after they've been inside and they see that we do a pretty good job, not perfect, but a pretty good job of living up to those values. They like the culture in our company. Then you have to have an offering that's competitive when it comes to training and development. For most disciplines we have a five-year period where they're guaranteed several different assignments, training, development, and mentoring.&lt;nl/&gt; I think the great fear for a young man or woman is that they're going to get pigeonholed and they're going to get lost inside a big company. By ensuring some mobility, some training, some interaction with others, I think you can get them off to a good start in their career.&lt;nl/&gt; HB: What's the life like for young employees at Chevron? You go to Silicon Valley it's all about free food and slides and scooters going all over the place and riding around the campus in self-driving cars. Do you have all that stuff?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: That is not our culture. I think it's about a challenging career. We have to pay competitively. It may be that in some markets you have to have free food and all those things to retain people. I don't think that's really key in the long run to retaining good people. Those same companies that have all those things have ultra-high turnover.&lt;nl/&gt; HB: Can you talk about the challenges of finding science and engineering talent. How hard it is to find great people?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: We recruit globally, and certainly we recruit at a broad range of schools that offer the degrees in engineering and technical degrees that we need. We do a lot of things to be sure that we're connected well with the academic community so we know who the promising students are. We also recruit internationally. In many countries where we operate we're one of the largest employers, and jobs with our company are highly desired, whether it's Thailand, Indonesia, Nigeria, Angola, we're a good draw.&lt;nl/&gt; We would love to see more young people going into science, technology, engineering, and math, and so we do a lot of work starting at the elementary-school level. We can't be everywhere, but we do work with STEM-related programs, Project Lead the Way, supporting curriculum in STEM, things of that sort. We try to help with the feeder pool, but it's a national issue and I would love to see greater diversity. Right now less than 10% to 15% of the graduates of the big engineering schools are women. I'd love to see more women. I'd love to see more underrepresented minorities in that group. We're getting better. As a company our visible diversity is rising, but I'd love to have a broader pool to draw from in total and from a diversity perspective.&lt;nl/&gt; HB It's hard to be the guy at the top. Who are your sources of inspiration, or whom do you turn to for advice?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: I've been very fortunate inside the company. From the day I joined, I have had people who have been willing to take the time to talk to me and to help me. Some of those are peers. Some of those have been a very senior level. Certainly my two predecessors helped me quite a bit.&lt;nl/&gt; Outside the company I draw inspiration from a lot of places, from a pure admiration point of view. You know, Lee Kuan Yew just passed away and I've had a chance to meet him. Certainly if you think about trying to create prosperity around the world, taking Singapore from where they were to where they are today is a modern-day miracle, and whatever the criticism might be it's a tremendous accomplishment. I think in my industry we're looking to create prosperity. A better way of life comes from having affordable energy, and that's what we're trying to do. I admire people that have created that prosperity. In his case energy wasn't the issue, but he put in place a whole system that did just that.&lt;nl/&gt; </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BZIN10564514324985076622294121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BZIN-5352</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G2J-KMJ1-JCMN-Y53V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3808\"/><timeReceived>8:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Insider</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>May 24, 2015 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002JWP</classCode><className>CHEVRON CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>ORGANIZATION OF THE PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS324110 PETROLEUM REFINERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS211111 CRUDE PETROLEUM &amp;

To address this question, the George J. Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business spearheaded a yearlong multidisciplinary research effort and now is presenting the final results.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms Final Report and Policy Brief, released Sept. 17, identifies the trouble with America's largest technology companies in four areas-market structure, consumer privacy and data protection, media, and political systems. It then delivers policy recommendations to rein in Big Tech, including creating a new Digital Authority.</p><p>\"We want to reduce the harmful effects of digital platforms without reducing the enormous benefits they bring,\" said\u00a0Luigi Zingales, faculty director of the Stigler Center and a finance professor at Chicago Booth. \"Taken together, the recommendations are aimed at maintaining the benefits of digital platforms while promoting competition, protecting consumers and defending democracies.\"</p><p>The policy brief and the accompanying 330-page report are the result of 12 months of research and debate among more than 30 scholars and policymakers convened by the Stigler Center at its annual antitrust and competition conference in Chicago.</p><p>The recommendations come at a time when the U.S. government is increasing its own scrutiny of digital platforms. State attorneys general from across the country announced last week a sweeping investigation into the market power of big technology companies including Google and Facebook. The Justice Department said in July that it would start an antitrust review into Google and Apple, while the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook a record $5 billion as part of a settlement related to violating consumers' privacy rights.</p><p>The Stigler report cites \"the lack of meaningful competition in many key digital markets\" and adds that \"the concentration of economic, media, data and persuasion, and political power is incredibly dangerous for our democracies.\"</p><p>A significant problem with scholarship around policymaking in many areas, but particularly around digital platforms, is the influence or even the perceived influence of corporate money and donations on think tanks, NGOs, and even universities, said Zingales, one of the world's leading economists and an expert\u00a0on the issues\u00a0at intersection of economics and politics.

To address this question, the George J. Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business spearheaded a yearlong multidisciplinary research effort and now is presenting the final results.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms Final Report and Policy Brief, released Sept. 17, identifies the trouble with America's largest technology companies in four areas-market structure, consumer privacy and data protection, media, and political systems. It then delivers policy recommendations to rein in Big Tech, including creating a new Digital Authority.</p><p>\"We want to reduce the harmful effects of digital platforms without reducing the enormous benefits they bring,\" said\u00a0Luigi Zingales, faculty director of the Stigler Center and a finance professor at Chicago Booth. \"Taken together, the recommendations are aimed at maintaining the benefits of digital platforms while promoting competition, protecting consumers and defending democracies.\"</p><p>The policy brief and the accompanying 330-page report are the result of 12 months of research and debate among more than 30 scholars and policymakers convened by the Stigler Center at its annual antitrust and competition conference in Chicago.</p><p>The recommendations come at a time when the U.S. government is increasing its own scrutiny of digital platforms. State attorneys general from across the country announced last week a sweeping investigation into the market power of big technology companies including Google and Facebook. The Justice Department said in July that it would start an antitrust review into Google and Apple, while the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook a record $5 billion as part of a settlement related to violating consumers' privacy rights.</p><p>The Stigler report cites \"the lack of meaningful competition in many key digital markets\" and adds that \"the concentration of economic, media, data and persuasion, and political power is incredibly dangerous for our democracies.\"</p><p>A significant problem with scholarship around policymaking in many areas, but particularly around digital platforms, is the influence or even the perceived influence of corporate money and donations on think tanks, NGOs, and even universities, said Zingales, one of the world's leading economists and an expert\u00a0on the issues\u00a0at intersection of economics and politics. To preserve not only the independence but also the appearance of independence of the analysis, the center recruited scholars and experts who had not worked for, consulted with or acted as expert witness for or against Google or Facebook within the previous two years.</p><p>The policy recommendations from the Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms build on the solutions formed by four subcommittees, each writing a separate report on its findings. The four subcommittee reports are Market Structure and Antitrust, Privacy and Data Protection, Media and Politics.</p><p>The key policy recommendations are as follows:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Force interoperability among social media, similar to how phone companies operate. Mandate an open and common application program interface that allows different messaging systems to connect to one another.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Change the threshold for merger review, basing it on transaction value or other criteria that allow regulators to scrutinize transactions between digital platforms and startups.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Create inside the FTC a Digital Authority, capable of overseeing all aspects of digital platforms.

To address this question, the George J. Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business spearheaded a yearlong multidisciplinary research effort and now is presenting the final results.</p><p>The Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms Final Report and Policy Brief, released Sept. 17, identifies the trouble with America's largest technology companies in four areasmarket structure, consumer privacy and data protection, media, and political systems. It then delivers policy recommendations to rein in Big Tech, including creating a new Digital Authority.</p><p>\"We want to reduce the harmful effects of digital platforms without reducing the enormous benefits they bring,\" said Luigi Zingales, faculty director of the Stigler Center and a finance professor at Chicago Booth. \"Taken together, the recommendations are aimed at maintaining the benefits of digital platforms while promoting competition, protecting consumers and defending democracies.\"</p><p>The policy brief and the accompanying 330-page report are the result of 12 months of research and debate among more than 30 scholars and policymakers convened by the Stigler Center at its annual antitrust and competition conference in Chicago.</p><p>The recommendations come at a time when the U.S. government is increasing its own scrutiny of digital platforms. State attorneys general from across the country announced last week a sweeping investigation into the market power of big technology companies including Google and Facebook. The Justice Department said in July that it would start an antitrust review into Google and Apple, while the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook a record $5 billion as part of a settlement related to violating consumers' privacy rights.</p><p>The Stigler report cites \"the lack of meaningful competition in many key digital markets\" and adds that \"the concentration of economic, media, data and persuasion, and political power is incredibly dangerous for our democracies.\"</p><p>A significant problem with scholarship around policymaking in many areas, but particularly around digital platforms, is the influence or even the perceived influence of corporate money and donations on think tanks, NGOs, and even universities, said Zingales, one of the world's leading economists and an expert on the issues at intersection of economics and politics. To preserve not only the independence but also the appearance of independence of the analysis, the center recruited scholars and experts who had not worked for, consulted with or acted as expert witness for or against Google or Facebook within the previous two years.</p><p>The policy recommendations from the Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms build on the solutions formed by four subcommittees, each writing a separate report on its findings. The four subcommittee reports are Market Structure and Antitrust, Privacy and Data Protection, Media and Politics.</p><p>The key policy recommendations are as follows:</p><p>Force interoperability among social media, similar to how phone companies operate. Mandate an open and common application program interface that allows different messaging systems to connect to one another.</p><p>Change the threshold for merger review, basing it on transaction value or other criteria that allow regulators to scrutinize transactions between digital platforms and startups.</p><p>Create inside the FTC a Digital Authority, capable of overseeing all aspects of digital platforms. This DA would oversee how these companies collect data, set up rules allowing data portability among competing service providers and data sharing with third parties, promote open standards, and review mergers in parallel with the Justice Department.</p><p>Extend campaign disclosure obligations to specifically target digital platforms, including relationships with politicians, academic funding, and the intentional promotion or demotion of content related to political figures.</p><p>Adopt sticky pro-consumer default rules, forcing companies to actually explain data protection practices to consumers instead of just encouraging them to click \"I agree.\" Also discourage so-called dark patterns, or user interfaces that can confuse consumers or manipulate them.</p><p>Remove the safe-harbor protections associated with Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act for content actively promoted and monetized by digital platforms.</p><p>Promote investigative and democratic journalism by: setting up pilot projects that instruct the development of alternative funding sources for local news media; and requiring antitrust authorities to consider media plurality when reviewing mergers between media companies.</p><p>Impose an additional fiduciary duty on the boards of monopolies, specifically a fiduciary duty toward society.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123196897</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X32-M3K1-DYTH-G0F3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"857\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 17, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

PHOTO: Bloomberg</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Toward the end of every year, chicken producers compete for massive contracts with grocery stores and fast-food chains across America. At least, that's how it's supposed to work. A string of text messages and emails disclosed in a federal indictment Wednesday suggest otherwise. In one 2014 exchange, Jayson Penn, now the CEO of chicken giant Pilgrim's Pride, asked an unnamed colleague about negotiations with a restaurant franchise. He noted that a competitor \"did cave\" to offering a lower rate to lock in a previous contract. </p><p>The manager responded to say, \"They are listening to my direction.\" \"Who is they?\" Penn asked. If \"they\" is illegal, he said, \"don't tell me.\" After years of talk, the feds have finally pounced: Big Chicken, they say, has been fixing prices. It's one of the stranger examples of alleged market rigging in a long history of cases - and an unusual one in that the chief of a company this big is actually facing criminal charges and as many as 10 years in prison. The charges the Justice Department laid out Wednesday in its indictment appear to document executives at competing companies colluding to share pricing and bidding information from 2012 through 2017 in the cutthroat world of commodity chicken. Penn was indicted by a grand jury in Colorado along with a former vice president of the company. There are also charges against executives from Claxton Poultry Farms, a tiny player, with about 1 percent market share. Pilgrim's, which is majority owned by Brazilian food giant JBS, said it is \"committed to high ethical standards, governance, and free and open competition that benefits both customers and consumers.\" The company will \"continue to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice in their investigation,\" it said in a statement late Wednesday. Penn didn't respond to a message seeking comment sent to him via LinkedIn. The Justice Department filing includes some colorful text message exchanges, with Penn boasting to colleagues at Pilgrim's about charging customers \"A-Hole Premiums.\" They also suggest that the poultry giant was in regular communication with rivals over prices. There are seven suppliers referenced in the indictment, though only Pilgrim's and Claxton are named. That indicates more changes could come after a decade of hearings on antitrust and consolidation in the industry and a slew of civil lawsuits. \"It's hard to get anything more solid than having text messages of people working together to rig prices,\" said Christopher Leonard, author of \"The Meat Racket,\" which examines the protein industry. \"This is the most significant action in federal government on the meat industry in probably decades.\" The case against Pilgrim's is part of an ongoing investigation into allegations of price fixing by chicken processors that came to light last year. Tyson Foods and Sanderson Farms have received grand jury subpoenas in the investigation, according to regulatory filings. In a statement, the Justice Department said the charges were the first filed in the open probe. Together, Pilgrim's, Tyson and Sanderson control almost half the U.S. chicken market. A woman who answered at Claxton's headquarters in Georgia after a transfer from a receptionist declined to comment without identifying herself and hung up. Sanderson said it had no comment, noting that it wasn't named or involved in the indictment. Tyson didn't respond to emails and phone calls seeking comment. The charges are the latest bombshell to hit the U.S. meat industry, which has been gripped by crisis after the coronavirus pandemic sparked plant closures. Thousands of the industry's workers got sick, and dozens have died, with unions and labor advocates saying that the protein producers didn't do enough to protect employees. Even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded in a recent report that conditions at the plants increased the risk of the infection spreading. Meat prices surged after the plants closed. Processing companies continued to see high margins, while some grocery stores ran short of supplies, and farmers were forced to euthanize hogs. That's brought fresh scrutiny to America's opaque pricing mechanisms for meat and livestock. While Wednesday's charges are unrelated to the current crisis, they could signal that enforcers will be vigilant about issues in the industry. The Justice Department is also probing potential market manipulation at beef processors, and the U.S. Agriculture Department is separately investigating processor margins. The four executives charged - Penn; Roger Austin, a former vice president of Pilgrim's; Mikell Fries, the president of Claxton Poultry; and Scott Brady, a Claxton vice president - face a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine. In the 2014 text exchange between Penn and the unnamed colleague, the latter eventually clarifies that the reference to \"they\" was referring to a fellow Pilgrim's employee who was negotiating the deal for the company, not a competitor. The text exchanges cited in the indictment are full of industry terminology dealing in the weird complexities of chicken pricing. But the document also gives a public glimpse into the arcane market. Restaurants and supermarkets receive bids and other pricing offers including discount levels directly from suppliers, or in the case of fast-food restaurants, through a centralized buying cooperative. Negotiations usually occur toward the end of the year and establish prices for the next 12 months. Chicken pricing is often based on a cost model for eight-piece bone-in chicken products, know as the eight-piece COB. Dark meat is usually priced at a discount to that benchmark. The messages between executives reveal that a difference of just pennies on a price can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional profit because of the scale of volume. Claxton's Brady, a former Pilgrim's employee, in a 2012 text message tells Fries that Pilgrim's was selling eight pieces of chicken for 3 cents more than his company. His textshows that he found out about the price difference from Austin, the then-executive at Pilgrim's. Austin said \"to raise our prices,\" Brady texted at 4:45 p.m. Nov. 23, 2012. Fries responded, \"Tell him we are trying!\" U.S. chicken prices had just started picking up in 2012, after a drought affected supplies. The filing appears to deal mainly with the obscure market for small-sized chickens - the juicy, sought-after variety that has recently ignited a war for chicken sandwich dominance in national restaurant chains. The Justice Department is likely to bring additional charges in the investigation, said Lisa Phelan, a lawyer at Morrison Foerster LLP in Washington and a former prosecutor with the Justice Department. Pilgrim's Pride is probably negotiating a plea agreement with the government, she said, and other companies in the industry could be targeted, which is typical in a price-fixing investigation. \"The DOJ always looks to hold both the companies and executives responsible for any kind of collusion in cartel conduct,\" Phelan said. While Tyson Foods, the biggest U.S. chicken producer, isn't named, the news \"casts a pall\" over the company, said analysts at JPMorgan &amp; Chase. Shares of Pilgrim's Pride tumbled 12 percent Wednesday. Tyson dropped 3.8 percent, and Sanderson fell 6.2 percent. \"If these allegations are true, they offer more evidence of an industry that has no problem exploiting workers and now possibly customers, for their gain,\" said Minor Sinclair, director of U.S. Domestic Programs at Oxfam America, an advocacy group that holds shares in Pilgrim's. One tool prosecutors may be using to gather evidence is cooperation from a company. The Justice Department's antitrust division has a leniency program that allows companies to win immunity from charges if they are the first to alert the government to price-fixing conduct and agree to cooperate and provide evidence of wrongdoing by their competitors. A building public backlash against massive companies that dominate their business lines surfaced in the Democratic presidential primary, with several candidates joining \"Big Agribusiness\" to \"Big Tech\" and Wall Street as political in appeals to win over traditionally Republican-leaning rural voters. Food shortages during the coronavirus pandemic and market disruptions from outbreaks at meat plants have further focused attention on the risks in consolidation. Republican-leaning hog farmers and cattle ranchers have seethed in particular at the disconnect between rising consumer prices for beef and pork and declining prices paid for their livestock. Even with the Trump administration's antitrust investigation into big meatpacking companies, a resolution may be months or years away. The charges against chicken processors demonstrate a commitment to enforcement of price-fixing laws. Still, the revelations are unlikely to have a big effect on retail chicken prices, according to JPMorgan analysts. While the difference of pennies per bird can create big profits for producers, it's unlikely to have a large impact on most grocery shoppers. \"Supply and demand remains the primary driver of prices,\" the analysts said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN78932311</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:602R-FW11-JC8S-D1C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1536\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

That's it for us. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE, of course not. And \"SPECIAL REPORT\" with Bret Baier, up next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Good evening. I'm Bret Baier. We are coming to you tonight from Fox News World Headquarters in New York. Breaking tonight, we are following three major stories.</p><p>Vice President Pence as you just saw, saying he has great hope for great progress in expanding coronavirus testing throughout the country. The vice president just finished briefing the media in the White House briefing room.</p><p>The House has approved an emergency spending bill as two more Americans die from the virus. We'll have details shortly.</p><p>In the presidential race, you can call it consolidation Wednesday after a dramatic Super Tuesday for Democratic presidential candidates. But we begin tonight leading off with a rare and stern rebuke from the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court to the Senate minority leader.</p><p>It comes as the high court jumps back into the abortion debate. Fox News chief legal correspondent and anchor of \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\", Shannon Bream, has the specifics, and it was rare. Good evening, Shannon.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Yes, that's the right word for this, Bret. And it started when the Senate's top Democrat Chuck Schumer said this at a rally outside the Supreme Court as the justices were hearing a heated abortion case inside, \"I want to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\"</p><p>Well, that prompted this response from Chief Justice John Roberts, \"Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous. All members of the court will continue to do their job without fear or favor, from whatever quarter.\"</p><p>And just moments ago, a spokesperson for Schumer said his comments, \"we're a reference to the political price Senate Republicans will pay for putting these justices on the court, and a warning that the justices will unleash a major grassroots movement on the issue of reproductive rights against the decision.\"</p><p>Only then accused Roberts of not taking -- of taking sides for not calling out President Trump for his comments last week. The Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor should have to recuse themselves after they made comments about the president. And it all comes against with backdrop of a high profile abortion case argued today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: From the moment Donald Trump won the presidency, the left has been warning that his appointments to the Supreme Court would be aimed at one thing, overturning Roe v. Wade.</p><p>Today, the justices including two appointed by the president, heard the case of a Louisiana law that requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their clinics.</p><p>In 2016, the Supreme Court struck down similar portions of a Texas law. Justice Ginsburg questioned the real aim of the Louisiana law and noted how challenging it can be for an abortion provider to gain the necessary hospital privileges.</p><p>\"Abortion providers will never, if that's -- if they're not also doing obstetrics and gynecology, they will never qualify because their patients don't go to the hospital.\"</p><p>NANCY NORTHUP, PRESIDENT, CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS: It's an underhanded law that is designed to bar access to abortion, which the Constitution guarantees.</p><p>BREAM: But there's a chance that justices may never get to the merits of the case. That's because none of the plaintiffs to the case are patients, instead, they're an abortion clinic and group of anonymous doctors fighting the Louisiana requirements.</p><p>Justice Alito spent several minutes questioning whether those doctors could appropriately challenge the very regulatory framework supporters say was designed to protect the health and safety of clinic patients, \"You think that if the plaintiff actually has interests that are directly contrary to those of the -- those individuals on whose behalf the plaintiff is claiming to sue, nevertheless that plaintiff can have standing?</p><p>Pro-life advocates argue this case isn't about overturning Roe v. Wade, but instead about protecting women who do seek abortions.</p><p>KRISTAN HAWKINS, PRESIDENT, STUDENTS FOR LIFE OF AMERICA: I think this case boils down to who do you put first? Your patients or your profits?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: So, the court appeared split on this hot button issue with the possibility Chief Justice Roberts is the king -- key swing vote here. Decision is due by late June. Of course, that's right in the middle of an election year when the Supreme Court is guaranteed, Bret, to be a factor for a lot of folks out there considering their votes.</p><p>BAIER: Shannon, we just got that sound bite from Senator Schumer, you referenced early in the piece. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): I want to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Now, for Schumer's office to say it was a reference to the political price Republicans will pay for putting them on the court and a warning that will unleash a grassroots effort, I mean, it's pretty pointed to Gorsuch and Kavanaugh.</p><p>BREAM: Yes. And he said you will pay the price. I mean, really the only remedy that he would have to go after them at this point would be an impeachment. Other than that, it sounded threatening enough to the chief justice that he thought it was something that needed to be addressed.</p><p>He very rarely does this, as we've noted. Now, he did say something to brush back President Trump, when President Trump referred to a judge as an Obama judge, because he'd been appointed by President Obama. The chief then, saying, we don't have Obama judges, or Trump or Bush judges. We're all just trying to do a neutral job and that's what the judiciary does.</p><p>So, another rare statement from him today, we don't get them often. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: That's right. Shannon, thanks so much.</p><p>Mike Bloomberg is out after just one primary night. One-off sure caucus when and more than a half-billion dollars spent on advertising. Roughly, $13 million per delegate, he received.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren is mulling her options tonight after a disastrous Super Tuesday that included an embarrassing third-place finish in her home state of Massachusetts. Mayor Bloomberg is throwing his support behind a resurgent Joe Biden, left for dead by many pundits just week -- a week ago. Now riding a huge wave of momentum after a massive delegate haul on Super Tuesday including Maine, which was just added to his column this afternoon.</p><p>Maine, Bernie Sanders picked up the biggest prize-winning in California. National correspondent William La Jeunesse is in Los Angeles tonight. Good evening, William.</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Bret. From 25 candidates, this race is effectively down to two: Biden and Sanders. While Warren reassesses her future, this has energized the Super Tuesday, the Biden campaign. And today he was here to capitalize on the win.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Joe Biden in California today thanking voters while seeking cash to fuel his campaign.</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to bring together all Americans. And we did that, we showed that last night. That's why I entered the race in the first place, to unify this country. So, we welcome all those who want to join us.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: From what many pundits called a near-dead man walking, to front runner, Biden's campaign shifted into high gear as Super Tuesday voters gave the former vice president a lead in delegates while forcing a rival to back down.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want you to all know that I am grateful to everyone who supported us.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Billionaire Michael Bloomberg ended his campaign today after spending more than $500 million. He pledged to help defeat President Trump and Biden said he would accept the financial assistance.</p><p>BLOOMBERG: I endorse Joe Biden, and I hope you will join me and working to make him the next president of the United States of America.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: But Bloomberg out, Biden now owns the middle of a fractured Democratic Party. His victories in Texas, Minnesota, and Massachusetts, stunning even supporters.</p><p>REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): I did not expect that at all.</p><p>DONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: I've never seen anything like it in my life.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Biden's victory Tuesday marks a historic rebound. A week ago, his campaign stuck in third, beg for money. Today, he leads the delegate race in double digits.</p><p>But Senator Bernie Sanders is not far behind and is already headed to two campaign events in Michigan. A state he won in 2016, but currently trails Biden according to polls.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is a campaign which is trying to bring and it is not easy. People who have not been involved in the political process.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: The senator to California winning 49 out of 58 counties, riding the wave of young and Hispanic voters. Today, a new Sanders' add featured praise from former President Obama.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Bernie is somebody who has the virtue of saying exactly what he believes.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Senator Elizabeth Warren failed to win a single state. President Trump called her a spoiler.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Had Elizabeth Warren endorsed Bernie? You're talking about a whole different subject and that's not even a question. You're talking about a whole -- because he would have gotten 80, 90 almost. I mean, he would have gotten most of those votes.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Warren's campaign manager today said she needed time and space to consider her next step.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Sanders today cast, this is a battle between us versus them, workers versus corporations, rich versus poor. While Biden, of course, stressed that unity to defeat President Trump, who called Bloomberg a spiteful person, but said his billions would not cost rather sway the general election. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: William, thank you.</p><p>Our other major story breaking tonight, the latest on the coronavirus. Two more deaths being reported in the U.S., another in Washington State, and for the first time, a fatality outside of Washington, in California.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence, who's heading up the administration's efforts just said to reporters in the White House briefing room, the administration is moving quickly to expand access to testing kits.</p><p>Correspondent Kristin Fisher was in the briefing room at the White House, joins us from the North Lawn. Good evening, Kristin.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Yes, Vice President Mike Pence just wrapped up another coronavirus briefing, something that's becoming almost a nightly occurrence here at the White House.</p><p>Earlier today, he was over on Capitol Hill, briefing Republican and Democratic lawmakers. And before that, back to back meetings here at the White House with the CEOs of companies and industries that are playing a critical role in containing the spread of the coronavirus. From the CEOs of nursing homes to diagnostic labs to all the major airlines.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP: I think where these people are flying, it's safe to fly. In large portions of the world are very safe to fly.</p><p>FISHER: As President Trump met with CEOs from almost every major American airline to discuss the steps those companies are taking to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, he also shared what he's been doing to make sure he doesn't get sick.</p><p>TRUMP: I haven't touched my face in weeks. In weeks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP: I miss it.</p><p>FISHER: The airline industry is missing the billions of dollars in projected lost revenue due to the coronavirus. Airline stocks have plunged 27 percent over the last three weeks, and it's only getting worse. But don't expect President Trump to give the airlines a bailout.</p><p>TRUMP: Don't ask that question, please because they have an asset. So, I don't want you to give them any ideas.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're all in, we're here to help.</p><p>FISHER: Vice President Mike Pence solicited ideas from the CEOs of diagnostic labs about how to make coronavirus test kits available to anyone who wants one.</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our objective is to make tests available broadly to the American public. You know, we want to make sure the American people can go to their doctor, can go to the local med check or CVS and obtain access to --</p><p>FISHER: The vice president, says the availability of testing kits is rapidly accelerating, and is on track for about a million tests a week, starting this week. The U.S. has lagged behind many other countries in its ability to test for the coronavirus. For the development of a vaccine is on pace to be the fastest delivery in human history. According to Dr. Anthony Fauci.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: The good news is we did it fast. The bad news is that the reality of vaccinology means this is not going to be something enough tomorrow.</p><p>FISHER: Dr. Fauci testified today that a vaccine is still 12 to 18 months away.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The bill is passed.</p><p>FISHER: One thing that was ready today, a bipartisan agreement on emergency coronavirus funding $8.3 billion. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, use the high price tag to tweak the administration from the Senate floor.</p><p>SCHUMER: This is very close to the amount that I thought was appropriate when I requested it last week, $8.5 billion. And it's more than four or five times with the administration originally requested.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FISHER: Now, tomorrow, Vice President Mike Pence just announced that he's going to be traveling to Washington State, which has really become ground zero for the coronavirus outbreak here in the United States.</p><p>And a few minutes ago, I asked him if he has any hesitations about traveling to Washington State tomorrow for his own personal health. His response, no hesitation whatsoever. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Kristin Fisher, live on the North lawn. Kristin, thank you.</p><p>From coast to coast, the coronavirus appears to be gaining traction. Spurring widespread civic concern. Correspondent David Lee Miller takes a look tonight from New York.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Eleven New York City area residents have now tested positive for the virus.</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): The daughter is 14 years old.</p><p>MILLER: This afternoon, the governor announcing five new confirmed cases, all from a family who had contact with a 50-year-old lawyer who remains in stable condition at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital on the city's west side.</p><p>As a precaution, two schools with the infected lawyer's kids attend to class have temporarily shut down, as well as a synagogue with a family attended services.</p><p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, says research and investigation prevent the virus from spreading.</p><p>CUOMO: Whenever you find a case, it's about containment. And doing the best you can to keep the circle as tight as possible.</p><p>MILLER: Authorities in Placer County, California, just north of Sacramento today announced that state's first fatality caused by the coronavirus. The elderly victim is believed to have been exposed to the virus while on a cruise to Mexico. Meanwhile, Los Angeles County declared a state of emergency.</p><p>HILDA SOLIS, SUPERVISOR, LOS ANGELES COUNTY: In the last 48 hours alone, the L.A. County Department of Public Health has confirmed six new cases of the novel coronavirus in our community.</p><p>MILLER: According to the World Health Organization, the coronavirus is three times more deadly than the flu. At least, 10 virus-related deaths in the U.S. are linked to a nursing home in Seattle.</p><p>In South Korea, a member of the U.S. military along with his wife and child have the virus. Global containment efforts include canceling Friday prayers in Iran, and Italy schools are closed for two weeks.</p><p>And for the next month. All sporting events including soccer will take place without fans. In Japan, where nearly 1,000 cases of the virus have been reported, officials say there are no plans to cancel this Summer Olympics.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MILLER: It is still much too early to calculate all the consequences of the virus. Even 007 is not immune. The producers at the next Bond film have postponed its release from April to November, setting what they call the global theatrical marketplace. The movie is called No Time to Die.</p><p>BAIER: OK. David Lee, thank you.</p><p>Healthcare stocks let a huge rally on Wall Street today. The Dow surged 1,173 points. The S&amp;P 500 dropped or jumped rather, 127. The NASDAQ soared 334 today.</p><p>Fox Business correspondent Jackie DeAngelis is in New York tonight with analysis. Good evening, Jackie.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you, Bret. Well, on a day like today where the Dow finishes up almost 1,200 points. Its second-largest point game ever even when the coronavirus concerns are growing, it makes you question what's really been driving the market volatility?</p><p>Well, the virus definitely spurred selling, but fears happened to coincide roughly with Bernie Sanders, winning the Nevada caucus. Wall Street worrying that he was looking like the front runner.</p><p>But after Super Tuesday in Biden's upward momentum, investor's takeaway is that Joe Biden is back in the game and a Bernie Sanders nomination is not a slam dunk.</p><p>Now, with Mike Bloomberg also dropping out today pledging his support to Biden, a market assessment is clearing the field as a good thing. But what's ironic is that Sanders would be the one that Wall Street things would be easier for Trump to beat.</p><p>At the same time, Biden's more moderate approach would be what the market would want if a Democrat were to take the White House.</p><p>Also, being digested at this time, the emergency half-point rate cut from the Fed yesterday. Well, it's not a cure off for the market, it definitely will lend some support. Healthcare stocks rallying today, and that's because the market is less concerned about Medicare-for-All, that's a Sanders' proposal.</p><p>And big tech was hired too because Sanders has been vocal about severely regulating and even breaking up technology companies. Still, there's an amber light flashing, and that's the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury notes still hovering at all-time lows.</p><p>So, as investors buy stocks, they buy bonds too for protection, and it's a sign that the volatility may not be over just yet, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Hold on tight. Jackie, thanks.</p><p>Up next, the U.S. launches a new attack against the Taliban just days after signing a peace agreement. Keep it here.</p><p>BAIER: The much-celebrated peace agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban in Afghanistan may be in trouble tonight. The American military has launched its first strike against the terror group since Saturday signing ceremony. Correspondent Benjamin Hall has the latest tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: The U.S. military has launched a drone strike in southern Afghanistan. It's first and 11 days after the Taliban carried out 43 attacks yesterday, 76 since the deal was signed.</p><p>It comes just a day after President Trump confirmed he had spoken directly with the leader of the terror group.</p><p>TRUMP: I spoke to the leader of the Taliban today. We had a good conversation. We've agreed there's no violence. We don't want violence. We'll see what happens.</p><p>HALL: But as the U.S. prepared to withdraw some of its 13,000 troops, there is growing concern by Republican lawmakers who say there is no specific language in the deal about a reduction in violence and no evidence the Taliban have broken with al-Qaeda.</p><p>REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY): So, I believe that the American people deserve to know what agreement has been entered into in our name with the terrorists who harbored those who killed 3,000 Americans on 9/11.</p><p>HALL: A concern that Secretary Pompeo addressed on SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: We made it all public. There's no secrets ideals, members of Congress will get to see the two classified implementation military elements of this, but the deal is laid out there for the world to see.</p><p>I'm confident that over time, we're going to get to a better place.</p><p>HALL: At a hearing today at the Senate Armed Services Committee, Secretary Esper stressed that they will be bringing the two sides back together in the coming days, while General Milley said that the recent attacks were not game-changers.</p><p>GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEF OF STAFF: And of significance, there's no attacks on 34 provincial capitals, there's no attacks in Kabul. There's no high profile attacks, there's no suicide bombers, there's no vehicle-borne suicide. No attack against the U.S. forces, no attack against coalition. There's a whole laundry list of these things that aren't happening.</p><p>HALL: The Taliban are at their strongest since the U.S. invasion 18 years ago. And the Afghan government also fear that if U.S. forces leave, they will be no match for the resurgent terror group.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HALL: Inter-Afghan peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government are scheduled to start on March the 10th. It's unclear now if those will even go ahead. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Benjamin, thank you. Fox News Senior strategic analyst, retired four-star General Jack Keane, familiar face to all of you, will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom next week. It's the nation's highest civilian honor.</p><p>Keane is a former Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army and chairman of the Institute for the Study of War. Congratulations to General Keane.</p><p>Up next, how the media are trying to dig out of a hole after throwing dirt on Joe Biden's presidential campaign just a few days ago.</p><p>First, \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight, Israel remains in political deadlock as the final votes are being tallied from the third election in less than a year. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party holds a solid lead, but fall short so far of the outright parliamentarian majority needed to form a government.</p><p>Greek authorities fire tear gas and stun grenades today to repulse a push by migrants to cross its land border from Turkey. Turkish authorities say one person was killed and five wounded by fire coming from the Greek side.</p><p>In assertion, the Greek government strongly rejects as fake news.</p><p>Japan's government has opened part of the last town that had been off- limits due to radiation since the Fukushima nuclear disaster, nine years ago. It's considered a symbolic move showing the region's recovery ahead of the Tokyo Olympics if they are going forward.</p><p>All 7,000 people in the town of Futaba were forced to evacuate when three reactors at the plant melted down after being damaged by a magnitude nine earthquake and tsunami in March of 2011.</p><p>Just some of the other stories \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight, we'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: Our \"TOP STORY\" at the bottom of the hour, former Vice President Joe Biden, a big winner on Super Tuesday. He won primaries from Texas to Massachusetts, even Maine today, reviving a campaign that was nearly pronounced dead by the media just a few days ago. Many in the media, at least.</p><p>Tonight, Fox News media analyst and host of Fox's \"MEDIA BUZZ\" Howard Kurtz, looks at how quickly things have changed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST: It wasn't long ago after Iowa and New Hampshire that many journalists and pundits were writing off Joe Biden's campaign.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think he is on his way out the door.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It looks like Joe Biden's campaign is collapsing or on the verge of collapse.</p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR: He's not going to be president. And it's very hard for him, I'm sure.</p><p>KURTZ: The L.A. Times said Biden was on \"life support\". Business Insider headline said, \"Drop out Joe Biden\". Other outlets called him toast. The former vice president had to urge voters to ignore the media chatter.</p><p>BIDEN: So, when you hear all these pundits and experts, cable T.V. talkers talked about the race, tell them, it ain't over man.</p><p>KURTZ: It wasn't over.</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, HOST, CNN: Joe Biden will win the Democratic presidential primary.</p><p>KURTZ: Many journalists were stunned by Biden's Super Tuesday performance as he racked up victories in 10 states.</p><p>BIDEN: Well, I'm here to report, we are very much alive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's incredible. I've never heard of anything like it. I don't any of us have ever heard anything like it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It really is a shocking turn around.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here is a guy who 10 days was dead. Joe Biden was done.</p><p>KURTZ: The media were convinced that Biden would be crippled by a lack of cash, while Mike Bloomberg could spend his way to Super Tuesday success. More than $500 million later, the former mayor dropped out today.</p><p>But news also acted as a megaphone for Democratic insiders who warned that Bernie Sanders could lock up the race yesterday and would likely lose to President Trump. That media message broke through with late deciders who broke for Joe Biden.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KURTZ: Joe Biden may be basking in the media spotlight, but he's the same candidate once derided for blunders and lousy debates. With Sanders still highly competitive, it would be a mistake for journalists to embrace a new conventional wisdom that Biden can't lose. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Very true, Howie, very true. Thanks.</p><p>Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been forced into a runoff as he attempts to win back his old Senate seat in Alabama. Sessions will face former college football coach Tommy Tuberville in the Republican runoff March 31st. The winner of that goes up against Democrat incumbent Doug Jones in November.</p><p>President Trump weighed in today, rubbing it in, tweeting \"This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States and then doesn't have the wisdom or courage to stare down and end the phony witch hunt.

The death toll tonight stands at 24, with at least 21 others still missing. Correspondent Steve Harrigan is in Cookeville, Tennessee, tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVEN HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Most of the deaths from the Tennessee tornado occurred here in Putnam County 80 miles east of Nashville. On Monday, Hensley Drive in Cookeville was lined with houses. By Tuesday, they were gone, replaced by piles of debris, debris that contains memories for one veteran.</p><p>CHESTER BUSH, COOKEVILLE, TENNESSEE RESIDENT: I had a framed certificate of my Bronze Star from Vietnam.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Among the 18 dead here, five children under the age of 13.</p><p>RICKY SHELTON, (R) COOKEVILLE, TENNESSEE, MAYOR: This is absolutely tragic and a devastating day for our city and county. I would first ask for prayers for the families affected, prayers for our community, prayers for our responders that are out there right now.</p><p>HARRIGAN: Bobcats, cranes, bulldozers plow through what was once a neighborhood, now a grid to be sorted and removed. Luke Carty and his wife lost their home.</p><p>LUKE CARTY, COOKEVILLE, TENNESSEE RESIDENT: We don't know what the future looks like, but when you see other people lose people and you see whole families disappear, and we are fine compared to that.</p><p>HARRIGAN: No new bodies were recovered overnight.

We will have reaction from the panel when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price!</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SCHUMER: You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer outside of the Supreme Court, talking about an abortion case, directing those comments directly to Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, prompting a response by the chief justice in a letter. \"Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous. All members of the court will continue to do their job without fear or favor from whatever quarter.\"</p><p>A Schumer spokesperson responded, saying \"women's health care rights are at stake, and Americans from every corner of the country are in anguish about what the court might do to them. For Justice Roberts to follow the right wing's deliberate misinterpretation of what Senator Schumer said while remaining silent when President Trump attacked Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg last shows Justice Roberts does not just call balls and strikes.\"</p><p>So let's begin there with our panel, Bill McGurn, columnist for \"The Wall Street Journal,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr., currently chairman of RX Saver. Bill, thoughts on this.</p><p>BILL MCGURN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I thought it was a very crude attack, but I actually thought the response was worse. This cockamamie idea that Roberts had got it wrong. He is the same guy that said the intelligence community could get you six ways to Sunday. It was very inappropriate, and he doubled down. I'm not sure it hurts him in his constituency, but it is very inappropriate.</p><p>BAIER: Senator Sasse's office responding, Schumer's flaks are gaslighting. Schumer addressed his threat to Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh by name and literally pointed at the court. Check the tape.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": He clearly threatened, and it was a violent threat, and that's wrong to do that. It is also incredibly hypocritical. He says that if you speak in any way about judges, like a judge should recuse himself or herself because of a conflict of interest that that is inappropriate, and yet here he is actually threatening these people.</p><p>But more than anything, I think the problem should be that what we should expect of Supreme Court justices is that they faithfully interpret the law and the Constitution. This is an issue of whether the Constitution prohibits basic standards of care for abortion clinics. Chuck Schumer thinks that he would like the court to have a particular outcome that is extraconstitutional. And that threat to the Constitution is actually worse than any threat that he might be making.</p><p>BAIER: Harold, Shannon pointed out earlier in the show that Justice Roberts has responded to President Trump when he went after a federal judge, saying he was an Obama judge. Justice Roberts issuing a statement, saying there are no Obama judges or Trump judges. There are judges for the law. So this statement is, while rare, has happened before.</p><p>HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE: We are at a low point when presidents, Supreme Court justices, and congresspeople are going at one another. There is nothing wrong with saying, Schumer to say I disagree with what you guys are going to do. I hope you pay attention to the law the way I see it. I happen to view it the way he does.</p><p>However, you can't incite violence. And one can make the case, whether he meant it or not, he is encouraging a kind of activity. The appropriate thing for young Justin Goodman, the press secretary, would have been, look, he didn't mean that. What he meant was this. But they almost sound like they doubled down on this.</p><p>And politics, there is nothing wrong with a little rough politics, but this is not the kind of politics that the American people signed up for it. And Democrat or Republican, pro-choice or pro-life, it was wrong of Senator Schumer to say that. I'm glad the chief justice shot back. And I hope if there are times where he's not calling balls and strikes, that Senator Schumer will call the chief justice and say please say something about this. But in fairness, he did say that about the judges when President Trump made his awful statement.</p><p>BAIER: Let's talk about last night. It looks like a two-man race, we will see. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am here to report, we are very much alive! We were told when we get to Super Tuesday, it would be over. It may be over for the other guy.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, (D) FORMER NEW YORK MAYOR: I am glad to say I endorse Joe Biden, and I hope you will join me in working to make him the next president of the United States.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D-VT) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look, the media has been talking about for months, how do we stop Bernie Sanders? How do we stop a movement of working people and low-income people? How do we stop a multigenerational, multiracial movement which is standing up for justice? And what you do is you get candidates out of the race to rally around Joe Biden.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Bernie Sanders still in, Elizabeth Warren assessing her campaign. Mike Bloomberg out. If you look at the delegates, Joe Biden, 566 as of tonight, Bernie Sanders, 501, 61 for Elizabeth Warren. Biden had a great night if you see the Super Tuesday wins by the former vice president. This doesn't even include Maine, yes, it does, there you go. It was called today. But he won Maine, Bill, and Massachusetts.</p><p>MCGURN: There is no way around it. No one predicted Joe Biden would do as well. I thought he would win maybe four states or something, but he did very well. It's also the perfect storm for him. South Carolina was always going to be his backstop. He had Mr. Clyburn give his endorsement, which counted for a lot. He not only won South Carolina but he won it big. Then he gave a very vigorous victory speech where he looked good, and then he went into Super Tuesday, the great benefit without a debate in between where he might embarrass himself. So it was a perfect storm.</p><p>And it completely flipped the narrative. A week ago if we were on here we would be saying how the moderates are splitting up the vote and giving it to Bernie. Now it is the progressives doing that.</p><p>BAIER: Right. What is Elizabeth Warren thinking, Harold?</p><p>FORD: Do I get out? If I do, I believe strongly in this progressive message. Is this the way to help Bernie Sanders? Bernie Sanders went on today and tried to lay out what he thought the party was doing to him. He needs to get over himself. The party change the rules for him a few years ago. He probably had a more legitimate argument a few years ago when the superdelegates were able to vote early, advantaged Secretary Clinton. I was for Secretary Clinton then. Make the case for why you think your message is best and your narrative and your ideas are the best America. Stop playing the victim.</p><p>You want to talk about victims in this country, people who are struggling to pay their light bill. My friends and family back in Tennessee dealing with devastation of a tornado. Those are the victims, not you because you're concerned that a few people got out of the race. Lay out where you want to take the country. Let Democrats have a choice. And if Democrats choose Joe Biden over you, you have to live with that. If Democrats choose Sanders over Biden, Democrats will have to live with that outcome as well.</p><p>BAIER: Bernie Sanders out with a couple new ads in states coming up. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When I argue we should freeze federal spending, I mean Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Great passion and is fearless. Bernie served on the Veterans Committee and got bills done.</p><p>I think people are ready for a call to action.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: You know he's going the distance when he has the Obama ad. He is staying in for the long haul.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I think he's not ready to give up yet, but I do think it's really -- I agree that he needs to get over this in a sense, but he also needs to fight. The establishment really did make a decision that they were going to get behind Biden. And I actually want to give them kudos. Coming out of Nevada I think people really thought that they were in a bad place. They needed to do something big and they did it. It wasn't just that Biden had to win South Carolina, he had to win big. Clyburn coming out and saying we really need to have as much of the vote here as possible was huge. Having Pete Buttigieg get out, having Amy Klobuchar get out, all of these things mattered and contributed to this epic victory. And so I'm not saying it is over.</p><p>FORD: This isn't the establishment. This is basically those of us in the party who are capitalists. I believe that we ought to have a vigorous debate in the fall about a democratic form of capitalism which is reconstituted capitalism trying to help people where it doesn't work equally, and the capitalism on the other side. Socialism versus --</p><p>BAIER: So it was more of a scared of down ballot socialism?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: It wouldn't have worked if the people didn't think that. But I also think it is interesting that Bloomberg is out. We had years where people were saying a couple hundred thousand dollars and barely literate Facebook ads from Russians caused Donald Trump to win. Here you had a guy spend nearly $1 billion, and he went nowhere. It's a humiliating defeat for Michael Bloomberg.</p><p>BAIER: Let's just rewind a second. That is a great point. So Russia influenced the election with $200,000, $300,000 in Facebook ads. And Michael Bloomberg could not get more than 50 delegates and $600 million.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: And it hurts Bernie Sanders message, too, because he likes to say the billionaires control everything. Here, clearly Bloomberg having all this money didn't do as much for him as Biden having the media and the establishment behind him did. I would pick media and establishment over --</p><p>BAIER: But what he is getting upset about is the rigging talking about -- the establishment rigging it against Bernie. This is just an election. It is happening, and they are making decisions.</p><p>FORD: Exactly, and if you have better ideas you will prevail. With Bloomberg, and I like Mayor Bloomberg and was, frankly, in support of him. His challenge was how he performed in the debates. I think people saw these ads and they were looking for something different. And for whatever set of reasons, I thought he did a great job with you the other night down in Virginia, you and Martha, he was fantastic. If he had done that in the debates, we might be having a different conversation. Five days ago Joe Biden's campaign was not only on life support, we were all just ready to go to church and say it is going to be over here very soon. Now he's the frontrunner.</p><p>But we have got a ways to go. If you are Bernie Sanders, don't be a crybaby. Lay out what you want to do for the country. And if Democrats see fit to support you, they will. But I don't disagree with it. I hadn't thought about the Russia thing.</p><p>BAIER: Listen, we're going to wrap up. We'll look forward on the election after we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think he is on his way out the door.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It looks like Joe Biden's campaign is collapsing or on the verge of collapse.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is a path for Biden as like a zombie candidate. He's broke. He's been dreadful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He doesn't have a grassroots operation. So it's felt like a dead man walking campaign for a long time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And Joe Biden completely collapsing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: To be fair, it did look like that, and pretty much everybody weighed in like that. We're back to the panel. I have not seen anything like this, the phoenix from the ashes of a politician. John McCain was a little bit like it in 2008, but not even, not like this.</p><p>MCGURN: I do agree with Harold. I think a lot of this is more anti-Sanders thing -- people combining to keep Bernie, and not just for the presidency but because they worried about the House majority with Bernie on top of the ticket. Again, I mentioned that perfect storm. Part of that was because people counted Joe Biden out, he didn't really face tough questions from the other candidates. They almost treated him like he was in a threat at all.</p><p>BAIER: A factor.</p><p>MCGURN: That is going to change going forward to. What I find interesting is he still invokes Barack Obama all the time. It helps him, I think. It helps him with the African-American -- but Barack Obama still has not endorsed him.</p><p>BAIER: And it doesn't seem like he will, Mollie.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: He is the zombie candidate, but he got new brains with Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg getting out. The question is whether they keep doing that with new people. How do you keep this candidacy going, because there were reasons Joe Biden didn't perform well in previous contests, and those things are going to come back. Those difficulties that he has, the lack of excitement, it will be more difficult to keep things going as well.</p><p>BAIER: I said last night, the Democrats look past all of that, and they just five him a pass because it is Joe Biden. Is that fair?</p><p>FORD: Yes. Voters feel like they know him. He was with Obama. He's been around a long time. He has chaired committees, national hearings. People have had an opportunity to vet him in their own way.</p><p>Which is why if you're Sanders, why didn't make the case today why you should be president, not how you were beat up on and done wrong by some Democrats? Biden, also, to your point, the anti-Sanders thing is about his ideas. It is nothing against him personally. So Biden now has to understand he has to deliver a message. The economy is moving in a good direction. How do you make the case that earning, owning, and working are good things, and Democrats can produce for people? That is the challenge for Democrats. And if Biden can do that, he can beat Sanders. If not, Sanders will remain a formidable force in the race.</p><p>BAIER: All the way to Milwaukee.</p><p>FORD: And I think it's making Joe Biden madder watching those commercials with Barack Obama. And it might be President Obama who will actually say where he stands in this race with all of this confusion.</p><p>BAIER: We will see. We will see. We are heading to Biden's boyhood home, Scranton, Pennsylvania, for a town hall with the president tomorrow. Panel, thank you.</p><p>When we come back, a really cool ride for a child with a debilitating condition.</p><p>BAIER: Finally tonight, a boy gets a new set of wheels.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Am I going to drive that?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That is yours to drive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's for you, bud.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Five-year-old Brantley Volpel, who has spina bifida, loves big monster trucks. So when Monster Jam came to Portland, Oregon, Brantley's wheelchair rolled right into the driver's seat of a miniature version of his favorite truck. How cool is that? He took a few laps around in his new ride and loved it.</p><p>A quick reminder, tomorrow a 30-minute SPECIAL REPORT live from Scranton, Pennsylvania, followed by a town hall with President Trump, his first of the 2020 campaign season. I will be joined by Martha MacCallum for the questioning, and, obviously, all the people there will get the questions. Look forward to seeing you.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced and unafraid.

Amazon is not part of that probe.  But increasing scrutiny of the tech industry in Washington could raise antitrust questions for the e-commerce giant.  </p><p>      Joining us now for more insight is Chieh Huang.  He is the CEO and founder of Boxed.  Great to have you in New York.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUANG</emphasis>:  Thank you for having me back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  So what do you think about this?  Do you think there needs to be more regulatory oversight of these big tech firms?  We'll talk about before we dig down into your business.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUANG</emphasis>:  Well, it's interesting because I have real view and the view that I want to say now and then it will come and bite me in the butt later on.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Tell us what you think.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUANG</emphasis>:  But I do think so to a certain extent, right?  I think as you're looking at kind of the position of Amazon for example, the fact that they can just put a simple press release out there or file a simple trademark application and have an entire market react with billions of market cap loss, I think there's something to that.  And whether that needs to be corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUANG</emphasis>:  Or whether that is a legislative action.  We will see in the future.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUANG</emphasis>:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book, \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.  But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you would say is that they try to lower prices. They try to inject more competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets solely by themselves.  </p><p>      So right now in a vacuum, potentially no.  But when you look at the swirl of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUANG</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUANG</emphasis>:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large- format only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is actually business-to-business.  </p><p>      So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400 times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically they don't really care about going to those regions?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUANG</emphasis>:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30 minutes drive of a Costco.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUANG</emphasis>:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off Amazon.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What have you adapted better at?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUANG</emphasis>:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been really difficult for us to --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Interesting. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUANG</emphasis>:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that sustainable if you scale that up?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUANG</emphasis>:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of automation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  But you retrained.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUANG</emphasis>:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have earning power over their career is a lot better.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.     </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Amazon is not part of  that probe.  But increasing scrutiny of the tech industry in Washington  could raise antitrust questions for the e-commerce giant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Joining us now for more insight is Chieh Huang.  He is the CEO and founder  of Boxed.  Great to have you in New York.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CHIEH HUANG, CEO, BOXED:  Thank you for having me back.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  So what do you think about this?  Do you think there needs to  be more regulatory oversight of these big tech firms?  We'll talk about  before we dig down into your business.</p><p> HUANG:  Well, it's interesting because I have real view and the view that I  want to say now and then it will come and bite me in the butt later on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Tell us what you think.</p><p> HUANG:  But I do think so to a certain extent, right?  I think as you're  looking at kind of the position of Amazon for example, the fact that they  can just put a simple press release out there or file a simple trademark  application and have an entire market react with billions of market cap  loss, I think there's something to that.  And whether that needs to be  corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will  eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  Or whether that is a legislative action.  We will see in the  future.</p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company  like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p> HUANG:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past  with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book,  \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.   But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you  would say is that they try to lower prices.  They try to inject more  competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets  solely by themselves.</p><p> So right now in a vacuum, potentially no.  But when you look at the swirl  of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p> FU:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project  searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p> HUANG:  Yes.</p><p> FU:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted  attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed  profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p> HUANG:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but  there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in  places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format  only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is  actually business-to-business.</p><p> So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the  beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for  everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that  pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400  times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches  where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said  about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread  basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less  at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do  you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically  they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p> HUANG:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just  offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of  opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those  rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for  example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30  minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it  doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are  not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been  able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my  garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months  span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off  Amazon.</p><p> FU:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company  Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What  have you adapted better at?</p><p> HUANG:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability  to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And  it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want  to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is  really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square  foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for  me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for  large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been  really difficult for us to --</p><p> FU:  Interesting.</p><p> HUANG:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than  Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and  different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be  really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your  warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that  sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p> HUANG:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need  to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those  positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of  automation.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  But you retrained.</p><p> HUANG:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have  earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p> FU:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

We will see in the  future.</p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company  like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p> HUANG:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past  with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book,  \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.   But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you  would say is that they try to lower prices.  They try to inject more  competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets  solely by themselves.</p><p> So right now in a vacuum, potentially no.  But when you look at the swirl  of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p> FU:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project  searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p> HUANG:  Yes.</p><p> FU:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted  attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed  profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p> HUANG:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but  there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in  places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format  only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is  actually business-to-business.</p><p> So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the  beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for  everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that  pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400  times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches  where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said  about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread  basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less  at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do  you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically  they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p> HUANG:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just  offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of  opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those  rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for  example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30  minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it  doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are  not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been  able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my  garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months  span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off  Amazon.</p><p> FU:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company  Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What  have you adapted better at?</p><p> HUANG:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability  to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And  it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want  to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is  really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square  foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for  me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for  large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been  really difficult for us to --</p><p> FU:  Interesting.</p><p> HUANG:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than  Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and  different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be  really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your  warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that  sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p> HUANG:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need  to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those  positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of  automation.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  But you retrained.</p><p> HUANG:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have  earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p> FU:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

We'll talk about  before we dig down into your business.</p><p> HUANG:  Well, it's interesting because I have real view and the view that I  want to say now and then it will come and bite me in the butt later on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Tell us what you think.</p><p> HUANG:  But I do think so to a certain extent, right?  I think as you're  looking at kind of the position of Amazon for example, the fact that they  can just put a simple press release out there or file a simple trademark  application and have an entire market react with billions of market cap  loss, I think there's something to that.  And whether that needs to be  corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will  eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  Or whether that is a legislative action.  We will see in the  future.</p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company  like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p> HUANG:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past  with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book,  \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.   But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you  would say is that they try to lower prices.  They try to inject more  competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets  solely by themselves.</p><p> So right now in a vacuum, potentially no.  But when you look at the swirl  of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p> FU:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project  searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p> HUANG:  Yes.</p><p> FU:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted  attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed  profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p> HUANG:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but  there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in  places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format  only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is  actually business-to-business.</p><p> So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the  beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for  everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that  pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400  times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches  where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said  about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread  basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less  at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do  you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically  they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p> HUANG:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just  offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of  opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those  rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for  example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30  minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it  doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are  not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been  able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my  garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months  span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off  Amazon.</p><p> FU:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company  Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What  have you adapted better at?</p><p> HUANG:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability  to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And  it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want  to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is  really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square  foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for  me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for  large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been  really difficult for us to --</p><p> FU:  Interesting.</p><p> HUANG:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than  Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and  different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be  really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your  warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that  sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p> HUANG:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need  to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those  positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of  automation.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  But you retrained.</p><p> HUANG:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have  earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p> FU:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Do you think there needs to  be more regulatory oversight of these big tech firms?  We'll talk about  before we dig down into your business.</p><p> HUANG:  Well, it's interesting because I have real view and the view that I  want to say now and then it will come and bite me in the butt later on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Tell us what you think.</p><p> HUANG:  But I do think so to a certain extent, right?  I think as you're  looking at kind of the position of Amazon for example, the fact that they  can just put a simple press release out there or file a simple trademark  application and have an entire market react with billions of market cap  loss, I think there's something to that.  And whether that needs to be  corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will  eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  Or whether that is a legislative action.  We will see in the  future.</p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company  like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p> HUANG:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past  with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book,  \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.   But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you  would say is that they try to lower prices.  They try to inject more  competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets  solely by themselves.</p><p> So right now in a vacuum, potentially no.  But when you look at the swirl  of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p> FU:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project  searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p> HUANG:  Yes.</p><p> FU:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted  attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed  profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p> HUANG:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but  there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in  places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format  only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is  actually business-to-business.</p><p> So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the  beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for  everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that  pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400  times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches  where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said  about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread  basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less  at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do  you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically  they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p> HUANG:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just  offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of  opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those  rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for  example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30  minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it  doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are  not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been  able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my  garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months  span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off  Amazon.</p><p> FU:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company  Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What  have you adapted better at?</p><p> HUANG:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability  to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And  it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want  to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is  really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square  foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for  me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for  large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been  really difficult for us to --</p><p> FU:  Interesting.</p><p> HUANG:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than  Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and  different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be  really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your  warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that  sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p> HUANG:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need  to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those  positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of  automation.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  But you retrained.</p><p> HUANG:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have  earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p> FU:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

But when you look at the swirl  of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p> FU:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project  searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p> HUANG:  Yes.</p><p> FU:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted  attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed  profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p> HUANG:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but  there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in  places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format  only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is  actually business-to-business.</p><p> So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the  beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for  everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that  pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400  times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches  where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said  about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread  basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less  at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do  you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically  they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p> HUANG:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just  offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of  opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those  rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for  example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30  minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it  doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are  not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been  able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my  garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months  span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off  Amazon.</p><p> FU:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company  Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What  have you adapted better at?</p><p> HUANG:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability  to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And  it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want  to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is  really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square  foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for  me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for  large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been  really difficult for us to --</p><p> FU:  Interesting.</p><p> HUANG:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than  Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and  different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be  really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your  warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that  sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p> HUANG:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need  to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those  positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of  automation.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  But you retrained.</p><p> HUANG:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have  earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p> FU:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

I think as you're  looking at kind of the position of Amazon for example, the fact that they  can just put a simple press release out there or file a simple trademark  application and have an entire market react with billions of market cap  loss, I think there's something to that.  And whether that needs to be  corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will  eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  Or whether that is a legislative action.  We will see in the  future.</p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company  like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p> HUANG:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past  with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book,  \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.   But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you  would say is that they try to lower prices.

Do you think there needs to  be more regulatory oversight of these big tech firms?  We'll talk about  before we dig down into your business.</p><p> HUANG:  Well, it's interesting because I have real view and the view that I  want to say now and then it will come and bite me in the butt later on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Tell us what you think.</p><p> HUANG:  But I do think so to a certain extent, right?  I think as you're  looking at kind of the position of Amazon for example, the fact that they  can just put a simple press release out there or file a simple trademark  application and have an entire market react with billions of market cap  loss, I think there's something to that.  And whether that needs to be  corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will  eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  Or whether that is a legislative action.  We will see in the  future.</p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company  like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p> HUANG:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past  with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book,  \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.   But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you  would say is that they try to lower prices.  They try to inject more  competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets  solely by themselves.</p><p> So right now in a vacuum, potentially no.  But when you look at the swirl  of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p> FU:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project  searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p> HUANG:  Yes.</p><p> FU:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted  attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed  profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p> HUANG:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but  there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in  places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format  only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is  actually business-to-business.</p><p> So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the  beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for  everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that  pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400  times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches  where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said  about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread  basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less  at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do  you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically  they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p> HUANG:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just  offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of  opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those  rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for  example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30  minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it  doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are  not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been  able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my  garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months  span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off  Amazon.</p><p> FU:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company  Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What  have you adapted better at?</p><p> HUANG:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability  to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And  it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want  to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is  really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square  foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for  me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for  large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been  really difficult for us to --</p><p> FU:  Interesting.</p><p> HUANG:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than  Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and  different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be  really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your  warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that  sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p> HUANG:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need  to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those  positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of  automation.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  But you retrained.</p><p> HUANG:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have  earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p> FU:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Do you think there needs to be more regulatory oversight of these big tech firms? We'll talk about before we dig down into your business.</p><p>HUANG: Well, it's interesting because I have real view and the view that I want to say now and then it will come and bite me in the butt later on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Tell us what you think.</p><p>HUANG: But I do think so to a certain extent, right? I think as you're looking at kind of the position of Amazon for example, the fact that they can just put a simple press release out there or file a simple trademark application and have an entire market react with billions of market cap loss, I think there's something to that. And whether that needs to be corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>HUANG: Or whether that is a legislative action. We will see in the future.</p><p>SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST: Do you see any kind of evidence that a company like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p>HUANG: I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book, \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices. But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you would say is that they try to lower prices. They try to inject more competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets solely by themselves.</p><p>So right now in a vacuum, potentially no. But when you look at the swirl of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p>FU: Right. And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p>HUANG: Yes.</p><p>FU: That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted attention on Amazon. How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p>HUANG: What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in places like B2B. And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format only anywhere in the U.S. But the reality is a big part of our business is actually business-to-business.</p><p>So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for everyone here to eat and to enjoy. Certainly the folks who stock that pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400 times, you know? And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less at times to. Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p>HUANG: To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30 minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>HUANG: And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are not. And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been able to grow so quickly. We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months span. So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off Amazon.</p><p>FU: Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company Boxed. What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result? What have you adapted better at?</p><p>HUANG: It's interesting. So I feel like we have this really good ability to focus on our customer. And so our customer wants wholesale, right? And it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want to be everything for everyone. And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for me. For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been really difficult for us to --</p><p>FU: Interesting.</p><p>HUANG: -- concentrate on. But i feel like we do wholesale better than Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, I want to ask you about automation. You have to be really quick because we're running out of time. But you've automated your warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result. Is that sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p>HUANG: I think it is sustainable. I think the reality is folks will need to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those positions. So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of automation.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But you retrained.</p><p>HUANG: We retrain them. And now we feel like their ability to have earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p>FU: Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

And whether that needs to be  corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will  eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  Or whether that is a legislative action.  We will see in the  future.</p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company  like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p> HUANG:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past  with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book,  \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.   But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you  would say is that they try to lower prices.  They try to inject more  competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets  solely by themselves.</p><p> So right now in a vacuum, potentially no.  But when you look at the swirl  of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p> FU:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project  searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p> HUANG:  Yes.</p><p> FU:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted  attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed  profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p> HUANG:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but  there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in  places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format  only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is  actually business-to-business.</p><p> So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the  beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for  everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that  pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400  times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches  where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said  about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread  basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less  at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do  you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically  they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p> HUANG:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just  offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of  opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those  rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for  example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30  minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it  doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are  not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been  able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my  garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months  span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off  Amazon.</p><p> FU:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company  Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What  have you adapted better at?</p><p> HUANG:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability  to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And  it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want  to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is  really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square  foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for  me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for  large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been  really difficult for us to --</p><p> FU:  Interesting.</p><p> HUANG:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than  Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and  different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be  really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your  warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that  sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p> HUANG:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need  to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those  positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of  automation.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  But you retrained.</p><p> HUANG:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have  earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p> FU:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Do you think there needs to  be more regulatory oversight of these big tech firms?  We'll talk about  before we dig down into your business.</p><p> HUANG:  Well, it's interesting because I have real view and the view that I  want to say now and then it will come and bite me in the butt later on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Tell us what you think.</p><p> HUANG:  But I do think so to a certain extent, right?  I think as you're  looking at kind of the position of Amazon for example, the fact that they  can just put a simple press release out there or file a simple trademark  application and have an entire market react with billions of market cap  loss, I think there's something to that.  And whether that needs to be  corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will  eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  Or whether that is a legislative action.  We will see in the  future.</p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company  like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p> HUANG:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past  with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book,  \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.   But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you  would say is that they try to lower prices.  They try to inject more  competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets  solely by themselves.</p><p> So right now in a vacuum, potentially no.  But when you look at the swirl  of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p> FU:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project  searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p> HUANG:  Yes.</p><p> FU:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted  attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed  profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p> HUANG:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but  there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in  places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format  only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is  actually business-to-business.</p><p> So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the  beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for  everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that  pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400  times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches  where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said  about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread  basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less  at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do  you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically  they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p> HUANG:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just  offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of  opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those  rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for  example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30  minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it  doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are  not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been  able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my  garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months  span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off  Amazon.</p><p> FU:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company  Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What  have you adapted better at?</p><p> HUANG:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability  to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And  it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want  to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is  really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square  foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for  me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for  large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been  really difficult for us to --</p><p> FU:  Interesting.</p><p> HUANG:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than  Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and  different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be  really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your  warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that  sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p> HUANG:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need  to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those  positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of  automation.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  But you retrained.</p><p> HUANG:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have  earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p> FU:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Amazon is not part of  that probe.  But increasing scrutiny of the tech industry in Washington  could raise antitrust questions for the e-commerce giant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining us now for more insight is Chieh Huang.  He is the CEO and founder  of Boxed.  Great to have you in New York.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHIEH HUANG, CEO, BOXED:  Thank you for having me back.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  So what do you think about this?  Do you think there needs to  be more regulatory oversight of these big tech firms?  We'll talk about  before we dig down into your business.</p><p>HUANG:  Well, it's interesting because I have real view and the view that I  want to say now and then it will come and bite me in the butt later on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Tell us what you think.</p><p>HUANG:  But I do think so to a certain extent, right?  I think as you're  looking at kind of the position of Amazon for example, the fact that they  can just put a simple press release out there or file a simple trademark  application and have an entire market react with billions of market cap  loss, I think there's something to that.  And whether that needs to be  corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will  eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p>HUANG:  Or whether that is a legislative action.  We will see in the  future.</p><p>SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company  like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p>HUANG:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past  with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book,  \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.   But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you  would say is that they try to lower prices.  They try to inject more  competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets  solely by themselves.</p><p>So right now in a vacuum, potentially no.  But when you look at the swirl  of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p>FU:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project  searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p>HUANG:  Yes.</p><p>FU:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted  attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed  profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p>HUANG:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but  there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in  places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format  only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is  actually business-to-business.</p><p>So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the  beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for  everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that  pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400  times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches  where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said  about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread  basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less  at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do  you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically  they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p>HUANG:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just  offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of  opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those  rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for  example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30  minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p>HUANG:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it  doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are  not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been  able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my  garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months  span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off  Amazon.</p><p>FU:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company  Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What  have you adapted better at?</p><p>HUANG:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability  to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And  it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want  to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is  really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square  foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for  me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for  large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been  really difficult for us to --</p><p>FU:  Interesting.</p><p>HUANG:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than  Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and  different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be  really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your  warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that  sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p>HUANG:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need  to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those  positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of  automation.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  But you retrained.</p><p>HUANG:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have  earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p>FU:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Amazon is not part of  that probe.  But increasing scrutiny of the tech industry in Washington  could raise antitrust questions for the e-commerce giant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Joining us now for more insight is Chieh Huang.  He is the CEO and founder  of Boxed.  Great to have you in New York.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CHIEH HUANG, CEO, BOXED:  Thank you for having me back.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  So what do you think about this?  Do you think there needs to  be more regulatory oversight of these big tech firms?  We'll talk about  before we dig down into your business.</p><p> HUANG:  Well, it's interesting because I have real view and the view that I  want to say now and then it will come and bite me in the butt later on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Tell us what you think.</p><p> HUANG:  But I do think so to a certain extent, right?  I think as you're  looking at kind of the position of Amazon for example, the fact that they  can just put a simple press release out there or file a simple trademark  application and have an entire market react with billions of market cap  loss, I think there's something to that.  And whether that needs to be  corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will  eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  Or whether that is a legislative action.  We will see in the  future.</p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company  like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p> HUANG:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past  with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book,  \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.   But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you  would say is that they try to lower prices.  They try to inject more  competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets  solely by themselves.</p><p> So right now in a vacuum, potentially no.  But when you look at the swirl  of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p> FU:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project  searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p> HUANG:  Yes.</p><p> FU:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted  attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed  profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p> HUANG:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but  there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in  places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format  only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is  actually business-to-business.</p><p> So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the  beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for  everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that  pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400  times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches  where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said  about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread  basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less  at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do  you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically  they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p> HUANG:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just  offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of  opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those  rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for  example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30  minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it  doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are  not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been  able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my  garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months  span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off  Amazon.</p><p> FU:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company  Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What  have you adapted better at?</p><p> HUANG:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability  to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And  it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want  to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is  really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square  foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for  me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for  large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been  really difficult for us to --</p><p> FU:  Interesting.</p><p> HUANG:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than  Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and  different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be  really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your  warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that  sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p> HUANG:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need  to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those  positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of  automation.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  But you retrained.</p><p> HUANG:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have  earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p> FU:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Do you think there needs to  be more regulatory oversight of these big tech firms?  We'll talk about  before we dig down into your business.</p><p> HUANG:  Well, it's interesting because I have real view and the view that I  want to say now and then it will come and bite me in the butt later on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Tell us what you think.</p><p> HUANG:  But I do think so to a certain extent, right?  I think as you're  looking at kind of the position of Amazon for example, the fact that they  can just put a simple press release out there or file a simple trademark  application and have an entire market react with billions of market cap  loss, I think there's something to that.  And whether that needs to be  corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will  eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  Or whether that is a legislative action.  We will see in the  future.</p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company  like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p> HUANG:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past  with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book,  \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.   But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you  would say is that they try to lower prices.  They try to inject more  competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets  solely by themselves.</p><p> So right now in a vacuum, potentially no.  But when you look at the swirl  of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p> FU:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project  searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p> HUANG:  Yes.</p><p> FU:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted  attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed  profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p> HUANG:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but  there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in  places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format  only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is  actually business-to-business.</p><p> So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the  beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for  everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that  pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400  times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches  where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said  about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread  basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less  at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do  you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically  they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p> HUANG:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just  offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of  opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those  rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for  example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30  minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it  doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are  not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been  able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my  garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months  span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off  Amazon.</p><p> FU:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company  Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What  have you adapted better at?</p><p> HUANG:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability  to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And  it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want  to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is  really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square  foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for  me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for  large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been  really difficult for us to --</p><p> FU:  Interesting.</p><p> HUANG:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than  Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and  different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be  really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your  warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that  sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p> HUANG:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need  to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those  positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of  automation.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  But you retrained.</p><p> HUANG:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have  earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p> FU:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

We will see in the future.</p><p>SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST: Do you see any kind of evidence that a company like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p>HUANG: I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book, \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices. But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you would say is that they try to lower prices. They try to inject more competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets solely by themselves.</p><p>So right now in a vacuum, potentially no. But when you look at the swirl of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p>FU: Right. And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p>HUANG: Yes.</p><p>FU: That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted attention on Amazon. How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p>HUANG: What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in places like B2B. And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format only anywhere in the U.S. But the reality is a big part of our business is actually business-to-business.</p><p>So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for everyone here to eat and to enjoy. Certainly the folks who stock that pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400 times, you know? And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less at times to. Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p>HUANG: To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30 minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>HUANG: And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are not. And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been able to grow so quickly. We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months span. So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off Amazon.</p><p>FU: Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company Boxed. What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result? What have you adapted better at?</p><p>HUANG: It's interesting. So I feel like we have this really good ability to focus on our customer. And so our customer wants wholesale, right? And it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want to be everything for everyone. And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for me. For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been really difficult for us to --</p><p>FU: Interesting.</p><p>HUANG: -- concentrate on. But i feel like we do wholesale better than Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, I want to ask you about automation. You have to be really quick because we're running out of time. But you've automated your warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result. Is that sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p>HUANG: I think it is sustainable. I think the reality is folks will need to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those positions. So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of automation.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But you retrained.</p><p>HUANG: We retrain them. And now we feel like their ability to have earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p>FU: Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Do you think there needs to  be more regulatory oversight of these big tech firms?  We'll talk about  before we dig down into your business.</p><p> HUANG:  Well, it's interesting because I have real view and the view that I  want to say now and then it will come and bite me in the butt later on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Tell us what you think.</p><p> HUANG:  But I do think so to a certain extent, right?  I think as you're  looking at kind of the position of Amazon for example, the fact that they  can just put a simple press release out there or file a simple trademark  application and have an entire market react with billions of market cap  loss, I think there's something to that.  And whether that needs to be  corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will  eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  Or whether that is a legislative action.  We will see in the  future.</p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company  like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p> HUANG:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past  with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book,  \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.   But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you  would say is that they try to lower prices.  They try to inject more  competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets  solely by themselves.</p><p> So right now in a vacuum, potentially no.  But when you look at the swirl  of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p> FU:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project  searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p> HUANG:  Yes.</p><p> FU:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted  attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed  profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p> HUANG:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but  there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in  places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format  only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is  actually business-to-business.</p><p> So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the  beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for  everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that  pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400  times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches  where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said  about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread  basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less  at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do  you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically  they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p> HUANG:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just  offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of  opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those  rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for  example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30  minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it  doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are  not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been  able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my  garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months  span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off  Amazon.</p><p> FU:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company  Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What  have you adapted better at?</p><p> HUANG:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability  to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And  it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want  to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is  really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square  foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for  me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for  large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been  really difficult for us to --</p><p> FU:  Interesting.</p><p> HUANG:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than  Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and  different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be  really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your  warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that  sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p> HUANG:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need  to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those  positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of  automation.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  But you retrained.</p><p> HUANG:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have  earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p> FU:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Amazon is not part of  that probe.  But increasing scrutiny of the tech industry in Washington  could raise antitrust questions for the e-commerce giant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Joining us now for more insight is Chieh Huang.  He is the CEO and founder  of Boxed.  Great to have you in New York.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CHIEH HUANG, CEO, BOXED:  Thank you for having me back.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  So what do you think about this?  Do you think there needs to  be more regulatory oversight of these big tech firms?  We'll talk about  before we dig down into your business.</p><p> HUANG:  Well, it's interesting because I have real view and the view that I  want to say now and then it will come and bite me in the butt later on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Tell us what you think.</p><p> HUANG:  But I do think so to a certain extent, right?  I think as you're  looking at kind of the position of Amazon for example, the fact that they  can just put a simple press release out there or file a simple trademark  application and have an entire market react with billions of market cap  loss, I think there's something to that.  And whether that needs to be  corrected by the markets in general, whether most folks in the market will  eventually just say, you know, there it is more bark than bite.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  Or whether that is a legislative action.  We will see in the  future.</p><p> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG HOST:  Do you see any kind of evidence that a company  like amazon is engaging in anti-competitive behavior?</p><p> HUANG:  I don't see outside of potentially what they've done in the past  with some of the acquisitions, and it's well-documented in Brad's book,  \"The Everything Store in terms of kind of their past acquisition practices.   But in general, currently now, it's really a conundrum because what you  would say is that they try to lower prices.  They try to inject more  competition at the marketplace, yet they have an ability to move markets  solely by themselves.</p><p> So right now in a vacuum, potentially no.  But when you look at the swirl  of events and their M.O. kind of in the past and now, TBD.</p><p> FU:  Right.  And right now in fact, about 55 percent of all project  searches begin on Amazon which has surpassed Google.</p><p> HUANG:  Yes.</p><p> FU:  That's been something that caught a lot of attention, unwanted  attention on Amazon.  How do you raise your company's profile, Boxed  profile in this kind of environment when Amazon dominates?</p><p> HUANG:  What's really interesting is that, yes, they are dominant but  there's still some market share left for the rest of us especially in  places like B2B.  And so for us Boxed, we ship toilet paper, large-format  only anywhere in the U.S.  But the reality is a big part of our business is  actually business-to-business.</p><p> So take for example the green rooms you have in Bloomberg or down in the  beautiful atrium here, there are just hundreds of different snacks for  everyone here to eat and to enjoy.  Certainly the folks who stock that  pantry aren't going on Amazon and clicking like SkinnyPop Chips like 400  times, you know?  And so I think for us, it is really finding those niches  where Amazon is not as strong and really going after it.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, it's interesting, I read something that you'd said  about actually some of your best customers and what you called the bread  basket regions of American, populations with 50,000 people, maybe even less  at times to.  Just to go back to exactly to what you were saying there, do  you think they're insulated from the likes of Amazon because logistically  they don't really care about going to those regions?</p><p> HUANG:  To a certain extent, but it -- to your guys' point before, it just  offers more opportunity for folks like us because there is a quite a lot of  opportunity out there, whether it's in the city or especially out in those  rural areas that you mentioned because if you look at our business for  example, there's 30 million folks in the U.S. that don't live within 30  minutes drive of a Costco.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p> HUANG:  And so those folks, it's -- whether they like Costco or not, it  doesn't even matter because that brand is ubiquitous, the locations are  not.  And so that is how, Scarlet, to your point, that's how we've been  able to grow so quickly.  We went from $40,000 in sales in 2014 in my  garage and last year trailing cleared over nine figures in about 36 months  span.  So absolutely, there is opportunity but you can't take your eye off  Amazon.</p><p> FU:  Chieh, you borrowed a lot from Amazon when you built out our company  Boxed.  What do you think you do better than Amazon now as a result?  What  have you adapted better at?</p><p> HUANG:  It's interesting.  So I feel like we have this really good ability  to focus on our customer.  And so our customer wants wholesale, right?  And  it's really difficult because Amazon is the everything store and they want  to be everything for everyone.  And so for us as entrepreneurs, it is  really tough when you get a single person living in a 300 foot -- square  foot apartment in the Upper East Side and says, you know, Boxed isn't for  me.  For us to really admit that it isn't for you and that it's solely for  large families and for folks who want to stock up on something, that's been  really difficult for us to --</p><p> FU:  Interesting.</p><p> HUANG:  -- concentrate on.  But i feel like we do wholesale better than  Amazon partly because as a wholesaler, we can sell different items and  different pack sizes that Amazon usually can't get their hands on.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  You know, I want to ask you about automation.  You have to be  really quick because we're running out of time.  But you've automated your  warehouses and actually not lost any employees as a result.  Is that  sustainable if you scale that up?</p><p> HUANG:  I think it is sustainable.  I think the reality is folks will need  to be able to kind of work with those robotics in order to keep those  positions.  So for us, we didn't go and layoff anyone solely because of  automation.</p><p> CHATTERLEY:  But you retrained.</p><p> HUANG:  We retrain them.  And now we feel like their ability to have  earning power over their career is a lot better.</p><p> FU:  Chieh Huang, the CEO and Founder and Boxed.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

In addition, misinformation and inappropriate content appeared in YouTube's recommendation engines, according to the complaints.</p><p>  The F.T.C. is pursuing the investigation of YouTube as regulators and lawmakers in Washington are signaling their interest in curbing the power and influence of some of the biggest tech companies. The agency is poised to announce a settlement with Facebook over the social network's handling of user data and potential violations of a 2011 consent decree with the agency over previous privacy violations.</p><p>  The House Judiciary Committee announced a broad antitrust investigation into Big Tech earlier this month. And the two top federal antitrust agencies, the Justice Department and the F.T.C., agreed to divide oversight over Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google as they explore whether the companies have abused their market power to harm competition and consumers.</p><p>  The F.T.C. has put more focus on child privacy. In February, the consumer protection agency fined the music video-sharing app Music.ly, now known as TikTok, a record $5.7 million for violating child privacy laws. The F.T.C. said in its settlement that TikTok allowed children under the age of 13 to use the site with little enforcement of its minimum-age requirement.</p><p>YouTube has been considering significant changes to its handling of children's videos, including how its algorithms work with the videos, according to the two people briefed on the talks. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the internal discussions.</p><p>  ''We consider lots of ideas for improving YouTube, and some remain just that -- ideas. Others, we develop and launch, like our restrictions to minors live streaming or updated hate speech policy,'' Andrea Faville, a YouTube spokeswoman, said in a statement.</p><p>  The Washington Post was the first to report news of the F.T.C.'s investigation of YouTube.</p><p>  The federal investigation of YouTube is the latest cloud hanging over the video service, which has more than two billion users. It has come under criticism for not doing enough to filter inappropriate or dangerous content, while promoting videos that espouse extreme points of view and inconsistently applying its own rules on harassment.</p><p>YouTube's main site and app are intended for viewers 13 and older. The company directs younger children to the YouTube Kids app, which contains a filtered set of videos from the main site.</p><p>YouTube's distinction between its main product and YouTube Kids is significant because of the rules on disclosure and parental consent that kick in for sites with ''actual knowledge'' that they are trafficking in the personal information of children under 13.</p><p>  But consumer advocacy groups have argued that YouTube, which is owned by Google, is able to collect data on children under 13 through its main site, where cartoons, nursery-rhyme videos and those ever-popular toy-unboxing clips garner millions of views.</p><p>  Dealing with children's videos is particularly thorny for YouTube. Children are among the most avid users of YouTube, and videos geared toward them are popular on the platform. However, YouTube has struggled to keep inappropriate content away from children's videos, in part because of the volume of videos being uploaded to the platform.</p><p>  In February, YouTube was rocked by a video documenting how pedophiles used the comments on videos of children to guide other predators. After brands announced plans to boycott YouTube, the company said it would disable comments on most videos featuring children under 13 years old.</p><p>  Earlier this month, The New York Times published an investigation into how YouTube's automated recommendation system promoted videos of scantily clad children to people who had watched other videos of young children in compromised positions or sexually themed content.</p><p>  The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, an advocacy group, said it had filed two complaints -- one in 2016 and another in 2018 -- with the F.T.C. about YouTube.</p><p>  In 2016, the group said YouTube and other companies were using so-called influencer marketing to target children. Last year, the group was part of a coalition of children's advocacy groups that filed a complaint saying YouTube was collecting the personal information of children under 13 without obtaining parental consent.</p><p>  ''Action by the F.T.C. is long overdue,'' said David Monahan, campaign manager at the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. ''If action is coming, we hope it comes with the conditions that YouTube clean up its act and stop targeting children.''</p><p>  With skepticism toward the tech industry growing in Washington, the F.T.C. investigation is likely to be applauded by lawmakers. Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a frequent YouTube critic, welcomed the inquiry. In March, Mr. Markey and Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, introduced a bill that would apply the children's online privacy law to teenagers up to 16.</p><p>  ''It is no secret that kids flock to YouTube every day, but the company has yet to take the necessary steps to protect its youngest users,'' Mr. Markey said in a statement. ''I am pleased to see reports that the F.T.C. is working to hold YouTube accountable for its actions.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-679534190620</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCN-XTF1-JBG3-64WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/technology/youtube-child-privacy.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/technology/youtube-child-privacy.html</url><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 20, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Lawmakers from both major political parties seemed to agree that tech companies need to do more to help protect children from exploitative and mature online content.</p><p>No technology company representatives testified at the hearing, though a nonprofit group whose members include several big tech names   such as Facebook, Google and Snap   was part of the panel of witnesses. That group, the Family Online Safety Institute, advocated for more education of parents and children about navigating online content, as well as broader adoption of existing parental control software.</p><p>Christopher McKenna, founder and CEO of Protect Young Eyes, an organization that aims to educate families, schools and churches about online safety, proposed the creation of a new independent rating system for popular social media applications to better educate parents about the various risks associated with those sites, particularly the risk of being exposed to sexually explicit content. He said existing ratings fail to warn parents about the rampant sexual images and activity accessible on many popular social media platforms.</p><p>\"Tech companies will tell us that ratings are already in place; however, ratings are not uniform, lack transparency, and there's little accountability for inaccurate ratings,\" McKenna said in written testimony.</p><p>Angela Campbell, a law professor at Georgetown University and co-director of Georgetown's Institute for Public Representation, said laws regarding children's online privacy have not kept pace with the growth and evolution of internet platforms. As such, big tech has felt \"empowered to ignore the existing safeguards,\" Campbell said.</p><p>She urged the committee to place more pressure not only on tech companies but also the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to enforce laws such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998, which restricts websites from collecting information on children under the age of 13 without obtaining consent from their parents.</p><p>Google-owned YouTube has faced increased scrutiny from regulators and consumers this year over its handling of a range of issues involving children's content, including algorithm-driven viewing suggestions, advertising and video comments. YouTube reportedly has weighed creating a separate platform for children's content, though Bloomberg News recently reported that regulators were considering allowing the platform to disable advertising on certain children's channels as an alternative.</p><p>\"The task of protecting children online is nearly impossible without the partnership of the big tech companies,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who chastised companies for \"inadequate and abysmally slow\" responses to questions and concerns about how they handle children's sensitive online data.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., went further, accusing YouTube in particular of prioritizing ad revenue streams over safety. \"I think we can agree that exploiting children online is one of the worst dangers and one of the worst social threats that we face,\" Hawley said. His concern is that tech companies have prioritized ensuring the reach of revenue-driving video recommendation services over safety.</p><p>Hawley in June introduced a bill that would ban video-hosting websites from including most videos featuring minors in their recommendation engines, though the videos could still appear in search. The bill is pending a review by the Judiciary committee.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-52771358</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJC-B3W1-F19Y-C355-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;
