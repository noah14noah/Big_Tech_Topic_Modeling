I'm Chris Hayes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Obama hit the road today traveling to the laboratory of  Obamacare, the state of Massachusetts, to defend his signature law today. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I'm confident these  marketplaces will work, because Massachusetts has shown that the model  works. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yes, this is hard.  The healthcare system is a big system and it's  complicated.  And if it was hard doing it just in one state, it's harder to  do it in all 50 states, especially when the governors of a bunch of states  and half of the Congress, aren't trying to help.  Yes.  It's hard, but it's  worth it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES:  While the president was in Boston trying to reboot the conversation  around the new health law, House Republicans were back in Washington hard  at work investigating the law's troubled debut. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPER)</p><p>REP. FRANK PALLONE (D), NEW JERSEY:  Once again, here we have my Republican  colleagues trying to scare everybody.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Will the gentleman yield? </p><p>PALLONE:  No, I will not yield to this monkey court. </p><p>HAYES (voice-over):  Today, the monkey court was back in session.  This  time with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius fielding  the questions from congressmen eager to get to the bottom of the rocky  health reform rollout. </p><p>Did you know, for example, that Kathleen Sebelius used to be governor of  Kansas? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Madam Secretary, while you're from Kansas --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As governor in Kansas --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You were governor and state insurance commissioner in  Kansas.</p><p>HAYES:  Which is also the site of an iconic American film. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There was a famous movie called \"The Wizard of Oz\".</p><p>PALLONE:  I know we're not in Kansas.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  People went to see the wizard because of the wonderful  things that he did.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Those folks worked hard to go down that yellow brick  road.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some may say we are actually in the Wizard of Oz land.  </p><p>HAYES:  That land you speak of, sir, is called Oz. </p><p>But Sebelius wasn't actually born in Congress, which means she could not  have run into the 90-year-old Texas Congressman Ralph Hall on a tricycle in  Meade, Kansas, circa 1931.</p><p>REP. RALPH HALL (R), TEXAS:  Were you born in Kansas, Meade, Kansas? </p><p>KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY:  I was not, I was  born in Cincinnati, Ohio. </p><p>HALL:  I was in third grade there and thought I saw you on a tricycle there  one day.</p><p>HAYES:  Who was the Kathleen Sebelius lookalike on a tricycle in Depression  era Kansas?  We may never know.</p><p>So the Republicans moved on to more important matter, like the relative  morality of an ad put out by a Colorado nonprofit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you agree with this kind of advertising for  Obamacare? </p><p>SEBELIUS:  I can't see it and again --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's a college student doing a keg stand. </p><p>SEBELIUS:  If the Colorado exchange did that --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you approve of this kind of advertising? </p><p>SEBELIUS:  State-based marketplace.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you approve of this kind of advertising? </p><p>SEBELIUS:  I don't see it --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's a pretty big picture of a keg. </p><p>HAYES:  Marsha Blackburn, however, took a pro-bro stance, channeling Toby  Keith's \"Red Solo Cup\" to the cry to reform the health.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Some people like to drink out of a  red cup, not a crystal stem. </p><p>HAYES:  Stepping in to carry the torch for the GOP women was Congresswoman  Renee Ellmers. </p><p>REP. RENEE ELLMERS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  Correct me if I'm wrong, do men  not have to buy maternity coverage?  </p><p>HAYES:  Congressman Bill Long had other reasons for boycotting the new  site.</p><p>REP. BILLY LONG (R), MISSOURI:  I could not bring myself to do that from  what I've heard from people like John McAfee, and folks about the security.</p><p>HAYES:  You know John McAfee, the Internet security mogul-turned-fugitive  from the law, and certifiable creep.</p><p>JOHN MCAFEE, INTERNETS SECURITY MOGUL:  People asked me, did you actually  sleep with 10 17-year-old girls and you're 67-year-old man?  I go, yes, I  did. </p><p>HAYES:  Yes, the rollout of the ACA has been rocky to say the least, don't  worry, America, Congress is on it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAYES:  Joining me is Congressman Leonard Lance, Republican from New  Jersey, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and  Congresswoman Donna Christensen, a Democrat who represents U.S. Virginia  Islands, also a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and a  doctor herself.</p><p>And, Congressman Lance, I'm a little confused at this point of the sort of  Republican objection through a policy standpoint, is the idea that health  insurance companies should not be able to cancel policies in the individual  market?</p><p>REP. LEONARD LANCE (R), NEW JERSEY:  That is correct.  And that is the  substance.  First we want to make sure that the procedure works, which is  the Web site.  And I want to work with the administration to make sure that  the Web site is up and running fully, as quickly as possible, Chris. </p><p>HAYES:  Well, that's great.  I think that is -- that is everyone who cares  about the implementation of the law feels this way. </p><p>But just to -- just to make sure I'm understanding you: your position, the  Republican Party position, is that private health insurance companies  should not be cancelling policies in the individual market?  That should be  something they're not allowed to do? </p><p>LANCE:  I think that those who are satisfied with their health ca policies  should be able to keep their health care policies and that is what the  president has said repeatedly.  And unfortunately, in many circumstances,  that will not be the case. </p><p>HAYES:  But you are aware that, you know, just for instance, one House  study showed that in five years in the mid-2000s, that 20,000 policies were  cancelled by insurance companies.  Insurance companies cancel policies as a  matter, of course, particularly in this market.  Would the House  Republicans be willing to introduce a law banning them from this practice? </p><p>LANCE:  No, Chris, what we say is that if you are satisfied with the  policies and if the insurance companies will continue those policies, that  ought to be able to be acceptable.  And that is what the president said  repeatedly.  And unfortunately that is not the case in many circumstances.   And I think that that should be the case. </p><p>HAYES:  Congresswoman Christensen, did you feel like you got a better  sense, got your hands around what was going on with the health exchanges  today in today's hearings? </p><p>REP. DONNA CHRISTENSEN (D), U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS:  Well, I've always known  that the health exchanges have been worked on from day one, when the  problems first surfaced, that improvements are being made.  We see that  more people are being able to apply.  And the paper -- those who are doing  it by paper, those paper applications are being entered at higher numbers  now. </p><p>So, I think yes, I am very, very comfortable that the changes that need to  be made are being made.  And that it will be ready, hopefully, by the end  of November.  But --  </p><p>HAYES:  And what is your reaction to the criticisms from your colleagues in  the Republican Party about the fact that some people are seeing their  current plans in the individual market cancelled? </p><p>CHRISTENSEN:  Well, you know, there are plans that -- if they were in place  at the time that the law was passed, they can be grandfathered.  But some  insurance -- as a physician, I saw patients with insurance policies that  when they got sick, they were of no use. </p><p>And what we're doing -- what is happening with the Affordable Care Act, is  we're raising the level of insurance.  We're improving the services that  are provided.  We're making insurance more secure.  And if there are any  policies that don't meet the high standards, they may not be able to  continue to see patients, but -- to write policies for patients.  But most  of them are going to be grandfathered.  Only about 5 percent are not  meeting that standard, and are dropping patients. </p><p>But as you said, Chris, insurance companies drop their insured all the time  for a variety of reasons.  And I guess in some cases, they felt that this  was a good excuse, whether it was warranted or not. </p><p>HAYES:  Congressman Leonard Lance and Congresswoman Donna Christensen, I  thank you both for your time. </p><p>LEONARD:  Thank you.</p><p>HAYES:  Joining me now is Clay Johnson, founder and CEO of the Department  of Better Technology, a firm that designs and builds software for  government.  He was a presidential innovation fellow.</p><p>And, Clay, I wanted to have you on because you have been tweeted about  watching these hearings.  They're all out of healthcare.gov.  You worked on  trying to do big tech projects.  What was your takeaway from the hearing  today? </p><p>CLAY JOHNSON, DEPARTMENT OF BETTER TECHNOLOGY:  My takeaway was that we  have a Congress that is dangerously illiterate when it comes to technology  issues.  I mean, looking at this thing, for me as a programmer and  technologist, it was rather like watching people who can't neither read nor  write trying to be a book critics.  I had no grasp of the fundamental  issues at stake here or what is even and what is even bad, that was sort of  baffling. </p><p>HAYES:  What do you -- what did you emerged to you about what is going on  with the Web site?  Which it seems to me, Republicans have kind of moved  past certain criticisms.  Yet, that seems to be the implementation hurdle  that this law needs to get over. </p><p>JOHNSON:  It's interesting for sort of fiscal conservatives to move on, and  worry about this issue, whether or not people can keep their health  insurance.  You know, the system that we use called the federal procurement  process, in order to buy and build Healthcare.gov is broken.  And that's  responsible for $500 billion a year of spend by the federal government.</p><p>HAYES:  Wait, I'm sorry -- $500 billion a year? </p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes, a half a trillion dollars a year.  T's and B's is what we're  dealing with. </p><p>HAYES:  Goes through the federal procurement system, the system that got  the various contractors that built out this Web site. </p><p>JOHNSON:  Right.  And I think it's fundamentally broken, when you look at a  Web site like healthcare.gov, that costs $200 million, this idea that  that's acceptable is clearly false.  And so I think you have to take a step  back and look at the thing that created it.  You have to look at the idea  that maybe we're not selecting the best vendors or the best people are not  working on this.</p><p>Look, when you build a technology project, you need three things.  You need  money, you need time, and you need talent.  We had plenty of money and we  had plenty of time.  So --  </p><p>HAYES:  That's an interesting critique. </p><p>Do you think that there is any way to reform that process so that in the  short term needed to get implementation up and running or is this a bigger  thing that the big tech companies and government is inevitably will have to  do down the line? </p><p>JOHNSON:  Look, the standings group came out last week and said that 94  percent of federal IT projects up above $10 million fail.  The federal IT  budget alone is $81 billion a year.</p><p>HAYES:  Wait a second, wait a second -- 94 percent of federal IT projects  above $10 million fail?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Right, and the federal IT budget is $80 billion a year. </p><p>So, I don't know why the Republicans are not up in arms about trying to fix  the federal procurement process, because what they could be doing is really  working hard on that, being of service to the idea of fiscal conservatism  and opening the door to thousands if not millions of small businesses to  compete on projects like Healthcare.gov.  And they would probably do a  better job at it. </p><p>HAYES:  And yet, we've seen them kind of move past the Web site.  I mean  today, the thing that was notable about the hearing, I thought there was  going to be a lot on the Web site, here they have Kathleen Sebelius, the  woman who is ultimately responsible for this, and it didn't get a lot of  play. </p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.  It was interesting, last week at the hearing with the  contractors, Marsha Blackburn was asking about error logs and asking about,  you know, HTTP request, and all kinds of technical stuff.  And this time,  she was talking about red solo cups and crystal straws.  It was sort of --  you know, as a person who wants to see the federal procurement process  changed, myself, I was sort of sad to see the right especially, but also  the left, sort of move on from the actual Web site.</p><p>HAYES:  Well, the monkey court attention span is short. </p><p>Clay Johnson from the Department of Better Technology -- thank you so much. </p><p>Coming up -- </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I get a letter from someone in my district, Adrian, she  says that she lost her coverage.  She is going on the exchange.  She  doesn't qualify for a subsidy.  She feels -- she writes this -- she feels  betrayed by her government. </p><p>Now, she has to sit there asking herself is this fair?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES:  Meet the newest Republican line of attack on Obamacare.  We'll tell  you the full story, ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HAYES:  Hi there.  I'm Chris Hayes, and you're watching MSNBC, the place  for politics.  I'm here to talk to you about a new and very special part of  our operation.  We here at the MSNBC like to lean forward and so we did. </p><p>Out of the past and into the future, welcome to the new MSNBC.com.  Now,  not to worry, you will still find videos of your favorite shows in  reporting.  But now, it's better in every single way.  It's not a Web site  anymore.  It's a community.</p><p>So, go, make a poll.  Join the group to create your own, because you can do  that.  Every nook and cranny of the site has something to offer.  So, don't  stay too far from our page.  Allin.com.MSNBC.com (ph).</p><p>Thanks.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA:  Anyone peddling the notion that insurers are cancelling people's  plan without mentioning that almost all the insurers are encouraging people  to join better plans with the same carrier and stronger benefits and  stronger protections, while others will be able to get better plans with  new carriers to the marketplace, and that many will get new health to pay  for these better plans and make them actually cheaper -- if you leave that  stuff out, you're being grossly misleading, to say the least. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES:  As the president responding to what has become the leading line of  Republican's attack to Obamacare in the last week, which is no longer a  glitchy Web site.  It's now policy cancellations. </p><p>Republicans, you see, are now very worried about cancelled health care  coverage and Obamacare forcing people into signing up for more expensive  plans.  But it's not clear that is what is actually happening. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REPORTER:  Self employed realtor, she buys her own insurance.  (INAUDIBLE)  provider recently sent her this notice reading, \"Because of the  requirements of new laws, we can no longer offer your current policy. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  All I want is what I currently have.  I want to keep  my doctors and I would like to have lower premiums. </p><p>REPORTER:  The insurance company is offering her a new plan that would cost  $484 a month versus her current $293 premium, a 65 percent increase. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES:  So, 65 percent increase, that looks bad.  That was a report from  \"NBC Nightly News\".</p><p>But contributing editor for \"The American Prospect\", Paul Waldman, saw the  report and wanted to know what (INAUDIBLE) other options might be.  He did  a little digging, and discovered that by going on the California exchange,  he got, quote, \"nine different choices for a bronze plan.  The average  monthly cost was $258 or $35 a month less than what she is paying for her  bare bones plan.\"  Waldman also found that, quote, \"she could get a silver  plan with more generous coverage for $316, only $23 more than what she is  paying now.\"</p><p>One of our producers also hopped on the California exchange Web site and  came up with similar results. </p><p>That's assuming the woman was 45 years old and had an income high enough  she didn't qualify for subsidies. </p><p>Now, the other context here is that insurance companies don't seem to be  giving people the full menu of options in the letters they're sending to  announce the policy cancellation.  In fact, those letters seem like they're  being used to up-sell people into more expensive plans.  Or as Waldman  points out, it's like getting a letter from your car dealer and saying,  your 2010 Toyota Corolla you're releasing has been recalled.  We can supply  you with an Avalon for twice the price. </p><p>What they don't seem to be communicating to their customers is that they're  very well might be another plan that is ACA compliant that cost about the  same as what they're paying right now. </p><p>Joining me now is Wendell Potter, former head of the communications at the  insurance company Cigna, author of the fortcoming e-book, \"Obamacare,  What's In It For Me: What Everyone Needs to Know About the Affordable Care  Act.\"  He's now senior analyst at the Center for Public Integrity. </p><p>All right.  Wendell, I want to start with the baseline, which is what we  had had before the Affordable Care Act, because I think that's getting  lose.</p><p>How common was it for insurance companies to cancel policies in the  individual market in a given year?  </p><p>WENDELL POTTER, CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY:  Well, it's very, very common.   In fact, it's one of the reasons I left the industry just because of that  practice.</p><p>In fact, my own son was a victim of that.  In 2009, before the Affordable  Care Act was passed, he got a letter from his Blue Cross plan in  Pennsylvania telling him that his plan was being cancelled.  And his  options were to go into a plan that was somewhat comparable, but his  premiums would increase 65 percent or he could shift into a very high  deductible plan, shifting from one that had a $500 deductible, to one that  had $5,000 deductible plan.  It was 10 time increase in deductibles.  And  that's what he was able to do. </p><p>This has been going on for many years, Chris, and just is now coming to  light.  Reporter's really have not focused on this in years past, so  insurance companies have been able to get away with this. </p><p>HAYES:  So, the big question here is what is driving this?  And it seems to  me there's a few things going on.  One is, plan that are being cancelled  have to be replaced with a plan that is compliant with the Affordable Care  Act, which means basic minimum, which are being enforced.  But it also does  seem to know, and I have now seen a bunch of these letters through these  stories which have become a kind of genre, that the insurance companies  saying you can enroll in this plan B, and it is a lot more expensive.  But  it is also not clear this is the only plan they're offering.</p><p>POTTER:  Right, that's exactly right.  It is a classic example of what I  used to do for a living.  That is, obscure the facts and use selective  disclosure of facts to present something and make people think that they  will not be able to get something that is better, and probably for less  money on the exchange.  They don't want you to know that. </p><p>HAYES:  What is -- what kind of -- just for people to kind of understand  the overall context of the health insurance market, what sliver of the  population are we dealing with and we're talking about people that are in  the individual market right now, that have plans that are not grandfathered  in, that are being cancelled?  Can you give us a sense of the -- the  picture of, you know -- there are over 3 million Americans, what are we  looking at here?</p><p>POTTER:  Less than 4 percent, about 4 percent.  Fourteen to 15 million in  the individual market, it's small for two reasons.  One, because insurance  companies have been able to engage in practices of black balling people  because of pre-existing conditions.  People can't buy policies at any  price, in many cases on the individual market because of being sick in the  past. </p><p>And also, because they're able to cancel policies when they want to and --  or price them so high that people can't afford them.  And so, we're talking  about a very small percentage of the population. </p><p>Here is the other thing, too, though.  People who are currently in the  individual market probably can get coverage that is better than what they  have now.  Because a lot of these people are enrolled in junk policies that  companies that I used to work with where I absolutely have sold in the past  several years.  And they can probably, many of them will, in fact, the  majority will quality for tax credits or subsidies to bring the cost of  premiums down.  So they'll be paying less for better coverage. </p><p>HAYES:  Quickly, Wendell, did the president and the people in the  administration over-promise when they said repeatedly if you like your plan  now, you can keep it?</p><p>POTTER:  Well, it was unfortunate language, because the president nor  Congress in this law can really control the insurance companies that well,  that effectively.  They control the health care system in many ways.   They're able to get away with this, and they are, as we're seeing.</p><p>HAYES:  Yes.  It was a promise that now appears that they could not  themselves keep.  Wendell Potter from the Center for Public Integrity --  thank you so much. </p><p>All right, Congressman Barney Frank's name was brought up more than once  today on the House floor, cited as the authority, the man supporting the  bill that is essentially a big wet kiss from politicians to Wall Street.   But that's actually not exactly the case.  He will be here to react, coming  up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HAYES:  A big day for Congress today, back in the swing of things, back to  work.  House of Representatives holding one of its first floor votes since  the government shutdown ended two weeks ago.  And what did they vote on?   They voted to gut a major part of Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEITH ELLISON (D), MINNESOTA:  I think we're a day in front of  Halloween, and here we are handing out treats to the likes of J.P. Morgan  Chase, Citi, and Bank of America.  You know, it is fitting on this day that  we should be doing the people's business.  And yet, here we are, handing  out treats and goodies to huge banks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES:  The bill, which would allow big mega banks greater leeway in the  kind of risky trading that caused the great crash, prevailed, capturing 70  Democrats along with all but three Republicans, in a touching display of  bipartisan moxy. </p><p>But get this, though, the bill, HR-992, known as the Swaps Regulatory  Improvement Act was pretty much written by Citibank, along with its big  bank cohorts.  Here is a key section of the draft legislation as written by  Citigroup courtesy of \"Mother Jones\", and here is the final bill, as voted  out of committee by a 53-6 months ago and passed today by the full House. </p><p>As \"The New York Times\" notes, Citigroup's recommendations were reflective  in more than 70 lines of the House Committee's 85-line bill, two crucial  paragraphs prepared by Citigroup in conjunction with other Wall Street  banks were copied nearly word for word. </p><p>In justifying his support of the bill, the current chairman of the House  Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling, cited the former chair of the  committee, Barney Frank. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JEB HENSARLING (R), TEXAS:  And those who are loathe to ever amend  Dodd-Frank, no less of an authority, than Barney Frank himself, former  chairman of the committee, said, quote, \"It addresses the valid criticisms  of Section 716 without weakening the financial reform law's important  safeguards or prohibitions on bank proprietary trading.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES:  Joining me now is former Congressman Barney Frank, Democrat from  Massachusetts, former chair of the House Financial Services Committee, co- author of the Dodd-Frank financial reform, and cited many times today in  the House debate as someone who favored this bill. </p><p>Barney Frank, did you favor this bill?</p><p>BARNEY FRANK (D-MA), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN:  No, I never did.  And I am  touched by this invocation. </p><p>It reminds me what I have always felt about a lot of Republicans.  They  have a great fondness for dead Democrats.  You know, Harry Truman, John  Kennedy.  They always like them -- I guess they have developed a new  fondness now, for nonmembers of the house.  Because that is certainly not a  deference any of them paid to my judgment when I was there.  </p><p>The fact is, I did say in 2009, 2010, when the bill came out in the Senate,  that I didn't think it was necessary and I thought we could do it other  ways.  On the other hand, I had consistently said since then, while it is  not in my judgment, one of the critical elements is in the bill, it is a  great mistake, I believe, at this point, to start picking it apart.  One of  the things that the Tea Party fundamentally missed in the effort to  relitigate the health care bill is, there is an important issue in the  legislating, when you passed something, when you had your fight and won or  lost, you don't immediately, if you get a temporary advantage undo it. </p><p>These people say, oh, well, the business community needs predictability.   You don't want to keep changing things.  Well, they shouldn't change  things.  Others (INAUDIBLE), we didn't think it was necessary at the times,  we've gone on from things.  Things have evolved.  It has now became part of  the expectations, part of the -- so no, I never said -- I did say that it  wasn't one of the critical elements.  </p><p>At the same time, I have consistently said I didn't think it should be  repealed on the principle that it is now too early to start undoing this.   And, there is another factor, this restriction on the derivatives giving  them out of the banks, to semi set overlaps revocable.  </p><p>Well, if we have in place a very strong vocal rule, which keeps banks from  doing some of this, that might after some years of experience lead you to a  different conclusion.  But, we are not there yet.  So, this is frankly a  fairly hypocritical invocation of me, this radioactive imputation of me, of  great wisdom, which I never noticed in doing when I was there.  </p><p>It was out of context.  I know I was against the bill.  I never voted for  the bill.  As a fact, when I heard they were saying that, I called my  former colleague, Maxine Waters, her staff -- repudiating that.   </p><p>HAYES:  Yes.  Here is Congressman Maxine Waters speaking today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAXINE WATERS, (D) CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN:  And in case America forgot,  J.P. Morgan reminded all of us the importance in setting limits on bank  activity.  In 2012, four years after the crisis, J.P. Morgan Chase, London  well caused the bank to lose more than $6 billion in a few months.    (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES:  And, here is one of the things about Dodd Frank.  It was crafted in  such a way so that a fair amount of the granular rule making was left to  regulators.  And, my question to you as the architect of this bill, how do  you feel about the house and congress coming back to essentially micro- manage a lot the stuff that was intentionally left in the bill for  regulators to make decisions on.   </p><p>FRANK:  First, let me defend that matter for you because you are right.  To  the extent that we got very specific in the regulation, we would have had  two problems.  First of all, things evolve.  Things change.  </p><p>We didn't want to just prevent the bad practices of the past.  We wanted  all empower regulators to anticipate or deal with new evolving practices in  the future.  Secondly, the most specific you make a provision, the more  easily it can be evaded --</p><p>HAYES:  That is right.</p><p>FRANK:  -- you just change a few pieces of it.  But, here is the real  problem, I am happy about that.  But, this is what most bothers me and this  is why I would never be for this kind of legislation right now.  Once  again, if you have the vocable and you have an adequate set of regulations,  I'm willing to author this again.</p><p>But, here is the problem, the biggest single grant of new authority in the  bill was to the commodity futures trading commission, which has the major  responsibility for regulating derivatives -- financial derivatives.  They  were set up to do agricultural things.</p><p>Now, they got into this very complicated hundred of trillions of dollars  derivative.  They got a budget of a couple of hundred million.  The serious  attack the republicans have been unfortunately successfully making so far - -</p><p>HAYES:  Is billing after that budget.</p><p>FRANK:  -- is to refuse to fund, they wouldn't fund the commodities futures  trading commission.  So, that is the problem --</p><p>HAYES:  Right.</p><p>FRANK:  They have choked off the regulator and kept them from being able to  do this.  That, while taken together is why I would never support a bill  like this.   </p><p>HAYES:  Really important point, former Congressman Barney Frank, thank you  so much.  We will be right back with Click Three. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HAYES:  Coming up, you definitely want to see this.  An exclusive report  from our reporters on a big deadline that is hitting this Friday that no  one is talking of it that has millions of people panicking.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>But, first, I want to show you the three awesomest things on the internet  today.  We begin with some evidence making the case for an actual --  Perhaps, like the one used by the seniors.  The mildly rumored 80's movie,  \"Cocoon.\"</p><p>You see, if you are remaking the movie \"Cocoon\" today, and you did come up  with an age appropriate movie star, the role of Ben, the kindly old  grandfather played by mustache old character actor Wilford Brimley, who  would you get?  Why you could get George Clooney, who is a year older than  Wilford Brimley was when \"Cocoon\" was released.  </p><p>That shocking information was reviewed by bosure.com today, showing how  well-preserved today's movie stars really are.  For instance, would you  have get that dashing Denzel Washington is one year frankly for being old  enough to play Matt Lock, or Betty Davis playing the Baby Jane is only one  year older than dancing nimble, Ellen Degeneres is today.  </p><p>When Jack Lemmon starred in \"Grumpy Old Men,\" he was only two years older  than today's Samuel L. Jackson and while we can't picture Jackson as a  grumpy old man, there has been a lot of time using himself to Jack Lemmon  in \"Pulp Fiction.\" </p><p>The second most awesome thing on the internet today, windows to the soul.   You are not looking at some kind of post-modern jack-o-lantern.  It is  actually a house, bought for just about $500 and made entirely out of  recycled windows.  Photographer Nick Olsen, designer Lilah Horwitz spent  seven months constructing this west Virginia cabin.  That is not their  primary home, it is a wonderful retreat back to nature.  No plumbing or  electricity.  There is a whole lot of sunshine.  </p><p>Whatever the deficiencies, it sure beats this building, which you could  call its pole opposite.  That is a high-rise in china ha upon further  inspection, has fake windows painted on it.  Fine, if you're a vampire, not  fine if you ever want to see outside.  But to be fair, it is a lot safer  for birds flying through the air than this place.</p><p>And, the third awesomest thing on the internet today.  I'm not the only one  who loves the pope.  This kid loves him, too.  During the Vatican  celebration, children were seated around the Pope Francis' platform.  And,  this little fellow decided to do a little free-lancing.  </p><p>Before long, the children sudden became a duo, begging for their own  sitcom.  At first, the youngster was protective of the Holy Father wanting  Pop Francis' attention -- and started helping people up to the stage for a  meeting with the pontiff.  Pope Francis was totally cool with it.  It all  ended in a touching embrace.  </p><p>It is quite an achievement in Grantsville upstaging so much so, we're  convinced this kid went to the -- Giuliani Academy of public events  interruptions.  You can find all the links for tonight's Click Three on our  website, allinwithchris.com, we'll be right back. </p><p>(END VIDEO CIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HAYES:  This Friday, 47 million poor people are going to have their  benefits cut.  You probably haven't heard about it, but food agencies that  are struggling to feed the growing ranks of America's hungry are in full- out panic mode.  It is called the hunger cliff, and as you are about to see  in our exclusive report we are about to go over it. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES (voice-over):  The sun has not come up yet outside the river fun food  pantry in Queens, New York.  But, many of the hundreds who line up here  every Saturday have already been here for hours, bundled up against the  cold.  They come before sunrise for free food, cereal, vegetables,  sometimes meat so that can feed themselves and their kids for another week.   For many here on food stamps, it is not enough.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER:  I went here to exercise 45 because the line  is so long.  I try to come up 10.  The line is all the way to that corner  and I spent four hours on the line.   </p><p>HAYES (voice-over):  Last year, 47 million people, a full 15% of the  population depended on food stamp assistance.  And, their lives are about  to get harder.  When provisions for the 2009 stimulus package expire  tomorrow night, $5 billion in cuts to the food stamp program will take  effect.  </p><p>That means a lot to the people who need food the most.  Average food stamp  recipient gets about $133 in benefits per month, or less than a $1.50 per  meal.  For a family of four, the cuts coming down the line work out to 24  fewer meals every month.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER:  I read on the newspaper that today there will  be a cutback.  I reached to the point, I didn't know what to do.  I don't  know, maybe I may have to go somewhere else to see if I could get some more  food.  I really don't know.  I really don't know, but it would really hit  me hard.  </p><p>HAYES (voice-over):  The cuts to food stamps also called snap benefits are  the first big hit in what activists have taken to calling the hunger cliff.   The second hit may come soon.  In Washington, a committee met today,  starting to reconcile the house and senate version of the farm bill, which  has long been the vehicle for food stamp legislation. </p><p>The senate version of the bill cuts more than $4 billion to food stamps  over a decade.  The house wants to cut who whopping $39 billion and kick  nearly 4 million people off the program.  While President Obama had  promised to veto major cuts with the snap program, it is likely additional  cuts are coming.  </p><p>Some republicans have tried to spin these cuts as humane.  Representatives  from Sutherland, Florida has led the charge for the food stamp cuts in the  house told \"The Washington Post\" that being dependent on food stamps makes  you more vulnerable.  Paul Ryan suggested that cutting food stamps is doing  the poor a favor.   </p><p>PAUL RYAN, (R) WISCONSIN CONGRESSMAN:  We don't want to turn the safety net  into a hammock that lulls able-bodied people to lives of dependency and  complacency that drains them of their will and their incentive to make the  most of their lives.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over):  And, others, just seem to want to punish the hunger. </p><p>STEPHEN FINCHER, (R) TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE:  The one who is unwilling to  work shall not eat. </p><p>HAYES (voice-over):  That was Stephen Fincher, republican of Tennessee, who   himself has taken nearly $3.5 million from taxpayers to finance farm --  provided by the very single farm bill -- food stamp recipients as leads to  vultures.  But, the truth is that nearly half of food stamp recipients are  children.  </p><p>And, more than four in ten will live in household or someone works.  Many  of those without a job desperately want one.  Elizabeth Ferrera is a single  mother with a master's degree.   </p><p>ELIZABETH FERRERA, SINGLE MOTHER:  I need food stamps and I need food in  order to survive, you know to feed my three children.  It is really hard to  get a job out there.  Even though I have all the qualifications, you know,  they still don't hire all the people.   </p><p>HAYES (voice-over):  Zurica Abdul have to stay home to take care of her  disabled 15-year-old daughter.  </p><p>ZURICA ABDUL, MOTHER OF DISABLED DAUGHTER:  I am with my 6-year-old,  sometimes, she told me she is hungry and I have nothing to give her.  So,  it is very hard.  You know, when you just have milk and you have to warm it  and give to child of 6.  You need money to go to school without food.   </p><p>HAYES (voice-over):  Abdul is one of thousands in New York alone who  depends on food pantries to make ends meet.  But, because of the sequester,  food pantries are already dealing with a 5% reduction in federal subsidies,  even as they see needs increasing due to the cuts to food stamps.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:  The senior who is getting $700, our rent is  $500, their medicine is $5 to $10 per prescription.  So, you put that  altogether, what is left?  So, you know?  So, I think if you can get food,  you know some of it is actually a dire need just to meet the essentials.  </p><p>But, some of it is actually trying to put together a picture that they can  survive.  I know a lot of people think that people come here for food.  You  know, a lot of times they hear the word moocher and things like that.  I  have to say it is offensive to me because I want to challenge anyone out  there to come during the winter, to come at 3:00 in the morning, stand in  this line and wait for food.   </p><p>HAYES (voice-over):  If house republicans have their way, that line is only  get longer.   </p><p>ABDUL:  Every day you come to get money, if you have $307, you come, you  are going to spend 300 this week, you can't go over, you know?  Once you go  over, then before the month is up, it is three or four days sometimes you  don't have enough food to eat.  So, it is very hard.  If they cut it, you  know, a lot of people is going to suffer.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER:  What about all the years I paid taxes?  You  know?  I worked so hard.  And, when it is time now, I believe that I should  get some help.  Look what happens now.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES:  For more on the Hunger Cliff, check out our reporter Ned  Resnikoff's great piece on msnbc.com.  Fantastic companion photos from John  Trotter.  A congressman who is fighting the GOP food stamp cuts and people  on the frontlines of the hunger battle will join me next, stick around.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HAYES:  We are back, and joining me now is Joel Berg, Executive Director of  the New York Coalition Against Hunger, author of \"All You Can Eat: How  Hungry Is America?\"  Margarette Purvis, president and CEO of Food Bank from  New York City and Congressman Jim McGovern, democrat from Massachusetts, a  member of the house agriculture committee and co-chair of House Hunger  Caucus.  </p><p>Joe and Margarette, I want to start with you, $5 billion in cuts happen on  Friday.  That money goes away.  Now, it is an $80 billion a year program  more or less.  That is, you know, a little more than 5%, but how big a deal  is this really? </p><p>MARGARETTE PURVIS, CEO OF FOOD BANK FOR NEW YORK CITY:  This is the biggest  of deals.  You know, just in New York City alone, these cuts will wipe out  76 million meals from people who need it the most.  </p><p>Already, we know that a family, who typically have their benefits -- their  food stamps, it will last until about the third week without the cuts.  You  know, the fourth week of the month that they decided to do this, it is for  thanksgiving --</p><p>HAYES:  Right.</p><p>PURVIS:  -- it is for Hanukkah.  It makes absolutely no sense, especially  since we all know that nothing has happened differently with our economy.   </p><p>HAYES:  How about, can private charities kicked in?  Is this -- you know, I  give money to food banks, people give money to food banks.  </p><p>JOEL BERG, NEW YORK COALITION AGAINST HUNGER:  And, you should, but no one  should be fooled into thinking this can solve the problem.  Every food  bank, soup kitchen, food pantry in America distributes about $5 billion  worth of food.  So, this cut goes into effect now, this is as if all of  these charities didn't exist for a year.  And, the cuts being proposed --</p><p>HAYES:  The cuts that happen on Friday, automatically that no one is  talking about, they're not like a political issue.  Those just are equal to  the sum total of privately charity funded food assistance in the entire  nation.  That is the size of the cut.  </p><p>BERG:  Correct.  As media matters pointed out until this segment as far as  we know this is the first network news show to even discuss 48 million  people losing food.  And, the house cuts on top of this would be eight  times what charities distribute in a year.   </p><p>HAYES:  And, Congressman, I want to go to you on that.  The republicans  have proposed a $39 billion cuts to programs.  That is over 10-year window  that is to be scored about $4 billion a year.  One of the things that I  think is interesting here is it seems to me like these food stamps were  something there was a political consensus around, until recently.  </p><p>I wanted to show you just an image from Fox News who has been doing a lot  of reporting, I guess you can call.  This is just an image.  Quote,  unquote, \"Poor households   reviewed that 99.6% of them have a  refrigerator.\"  The implication being that these people are not really  poor.  They don't actually need this.  Have you seen the political  consensus around this very basic aspect of safety net necessity, erode? </p><p>JIM MCGOVERN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS CONGRESSMAN:  Unfortunately, yes.  There  used to be a bipartisan consensus that any hunger was something that we  ought to be committed to.  Unfortunately, that bipartisan consensus  disappeared.  And, what we have seen as republicans belittle poor people,  and diminish their struggle, and basically use them as political funds in  their budget struggle.  </p><p>Every family tried to find savings, it comes from programs like SNAP or  programs that help poor people and it is very frankly now unfortunate.  It  is really sad.  And, if government stands for anything, we ought to be  there for the people who are most vulnerable.   </p><p>HAYES:  Is there going to be any way to avoid further cuts when you are  considering reconciling a senate bill that has got $4 billion in cuts over  ten years and a  house bill that has got $39 billion in cuts over ten  years? </p><p>MCGOVERN:  Well, I'm on the conference committee of the farm bill, and I  said today that you know I am willing to be flexible.  I am willing to be  reasonable but I'm not going to support a farm bill that makes more people  hungry in America.  We ought to at least agree on that.  </p><p>And, I don't believe that we should have anymore cuts in SNAP.  We should  be talking about how to end hunger, not just talking about trying to  protect the program.  We ought to have some White House leadership quite  frankly.  We need to have White House conference on food and nutrition to  bring people together and actually have a road map to end hunger.  </p><p>That is what we should -- That is where our discussion should be focused,  not on these cutbacks to SNAP.  But, we're going to fight hard to make sure  there is no further damage to SNAP.  But, it is an uphill battle, given the  makeup of the House of Representatives.   </p><p>HAYES:  One of the things that have attracted kind of the political  attention by conservative and Fox News and republicans is that there has  been massive growth in the food stamp program.  That is not a right wing  lie.  That program has gotten much more expensive.  $80 billion is a lot of  money.  We shouldn't not mince words about the size of the program.  Why  has the size of the program expanded so much? </p><p>PURVIS:  The size of the program reflects the size of the problem.  It is  not growing off on its own.  It reflects that there is a huge hunger  crisis.  The problem is that we are treating the issue as the people,  rather than the issue of being why is hunger this bad in this country?   Everyone should be upset about this, not upset at the people who are  suffering through it.   </p><p>HAYES:  Why is it so bad in this country?  And, what is the answer to that  question?</p><p>BERG:  Living wages, jobs.  People complaining about food stamps and Snap  having to fill in the gap are the very same people wrecking economy.  They  are not really anti-government.  They are anti-government for other people.   Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida. who is complaining bitterly about the food  stamp program.  He admitted he received benefits earlier in life.  So, my  organization sent him a letter with a mirror in it, and said if you want to  see what a food stamp recipient looks like, check this out.   </p><p>(LAUGHING)</p><p>MCGOVERN:  And, Chris, may I just add.  Look, the majority of people on  food stamps are senior citizens and children.  All of the able-bodied you  know, people that can actually work, majority of those people work.  Many  of them work full-time and they still earn so little that they qualify for  this benefit.  So, we have a lousy economy, when the economy gets better,  fewer people will be on food stamps.   </p><p>HAYES:  But congressman, to push you more on that, it is now -- we are now  four years in this recovery.  And, when we are going into the reporting of  this and looking into the numbers -- I mean 15% of Americans are poor.  47  million people, I look at that and I say America, this is not working.  </p><p>What we are doing right now, our system, the system we're running is  failing.  47 million people in poverty, hungry in this country is a failing  grace.  It is American capital is not producing at this moment, broad gains  for people.  It is not.   </p><p>MCGOVERN:  That is why we need a broader discussion.  That is why we need a  White House conference on food and nutrition to talk about how you end this  problem.  Not just how you put band aids on it.  But, we need to be talking  about increasing the minimum wage.  We need to be talking about increasing  the minimum wage.  </p><p>We need to be talking about how you extend letters of opportunity to help  people get out of poverty.  But, in the meantime, we need to make sure that  we are there with the safety net to make sure people have at least enough  to eat.  </p><p>Boy, what a radical idea that everybody in this country, the richest  country in the history of the world ought to have enough to eat.  Surely,  we should be able to get a bipartisan consensus on that, but unfortunately  in Washington that consensus has blown up.   </p><p>HAYES:  We declared the war on poverty.  We actually won that poverty.   That is incredibly in successful social and then we just decided to turn  tail and run.  Joel Berg from the New York Coalition Against Hunger,  Margarett Purvis from Food Bank for New York City, and Congressman Jim  McGovern, thank you very much.  That is all in for this evening.  \"RACHEL  MADDOW SHOW\" starts right now.  Good evening, Rachel.  </p><p>RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST:  Good evening, Chris.

The healthcare system is a big system and it's complicated. And if it was hard doing it just in one state, it's harder to do it in all 50 states, especially when the governors of a bunch of states and half of the Congress, aren't trying to help. Yes. It's hard, but it's worth it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: While the president was in Boston trying to reboot the conversation around the new health law, House Republicans were back in Washington hard at work investigating the law's troubled debut.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPER)</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>FRANK PALLONE </nameText></person>(D), NEW JERSEY: Once again, here we have my Republican colleagues trying to scare everybody.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will the gentleman yield?</p><p>PALLONE: No, I will not yield to this monkey court.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): Today, the monkey court was back in session. This time with Health and Human Services Secretary <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>fielding the questions from congressmen eager to get to the bottom of the rocky health reform rollout.</p><p>Did you know, for example, that <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>used to be governor of Kansas?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Madam Secretary, while you're from Kansas --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As governor in Kansas --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You were governor and state insurance commissioner in Kansas.</p><p>HAYES: Which is also the site of an iconic American film.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was a famous movie called \"The Wizard of Oz\".</p><p>PALLONE: I know we're not in Kansas.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People went to see the wizard because of the wonderful things that he did.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those folks worked hard to go down that yellow brick road.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some may say we are actually in the Wizard of Oz land.</p><p>HAYES: That land you speak of, sir, is called Oz.</p><p>But Sebelius wasn't actually born in Congress, which means she could not have run into the 90-year-old Texas<person><nameText>Congressman Ralph Hall </nameText></person>on a tricycle in Meade, Kansas, circa 1931.</p><p><person><nameText>REP.

MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE: Some people like to drink out of a red cup, not a crystal stem.</p><p>HAYES: Stepping in to carry the torch for the GOP women was Congresswoman Renee Ellmers.</p><p>REP. RENEE ELLMERS (R), NORTH CAROLINA: Correct me if I'm wrong, do men not have to buy maternity coverage?</p><p>HAYES: Congressman Bill Long had other reasons for boycotting the new site.</p><p>REP. BILLY LONG (R), MISSOURI: I could not bring myself to do that from what I've heard from people like John McAfee, and folks about the security.</p><p>HAYES: You know John McAfee, the Internet security mogul-turned-fugitive from the law, and certifiable creep.</p><p>JOHN MCAFEE, INTERNETS SECURITY MOGUL: People asked me, did you actually sleep with 10 17-year-old girls and you're 67-year-old man? I go, yes, I did.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, the rollout of the ACA has been rocky to say the least, don't worry, America, Congress is on it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAYES: Joining me is Congressman Leonard Lance, Republican from New Jersey, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Congresswoman Donna Christensen, a Democrat who represents U.S. Virginia Islands, also a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and a doctor herself.</p><p>And, Congressman Lance, I'm a little confused at this point of the sort of Republican objection through a policy standpoint, is the idea that health insurance companies should not be able to cancel policies in the individual market?</p><p>REP. LEONARD LANCE (R), NEW JERSEY: That is correct. And that is the substance. First we want to make sure that the procedure works, which is the Web site. And I want to work with the administration to make sure that the Web site is up and running fully, as quickly as possible, Chris.</p><p>HAYES: Well, that's great. I think that is -- that is everyone who cares about the implementation of the law feels this way.</p><p>But just to -- just to make sure I'm understanding you: your position, the Republican Party position, is that private health insurance companies should not be cancelling policies in the individual market? That should be something they're not allowed to do?</p><p>LANCE: I think that those who are satisfied with their health ca policies should be able to keep their health care policies and that is what the president has said repeatedly. And unfortunately, in many circumstances, that will not be the case.</p><p>HAYES: But you are aware that, you know, just for instance, one House study showed that in five years in the mid-2000s, that 20,000 policies were cancelled by insurance companies. Insurance companies cancel policies as a matter, of course, particularly in this market. Would the House Republicans be willing to introduce a law banning them from this practice?</p><p>LANCE: No, Chris, what we say is that if you are satisfied with the policies and if the insurance companies will continue those policies, that ought to be able to be acceptable. And that is what the president said repeatedly. And unfortunately that is not the case in many circumstances. And I think that that should be the case.</p><p>HAYES: Congresswoman Christensen, did you feel like you got a better sense, got your hands around what was going on with the health exchanges today in today's hearings?</p><p>REP. DONNA CHRISTENSEN (D), U.S.VIRGIN ISLANDS: Well, I've always known that the health exchanges have been worked on from day one, when the problems first surfaced, that improvements are being made. We see that more people are being able to apply. And the paper -- those who are doing it by paper, those paper applications are being entered at higher numbers now.</p><p>So, I think yes, I am very, very comfortable that the changes that need to be made are being made. And that it will be ready, hopefully, by the end of November. But --</p><p>HAYES: And what is your reaction to the criticisms from your colleagues in the Republican Party about the fact that some people are seeing their current plans in the individual market cancelled?</p><p>CHRISTENSEN: Well, you know, there are plans that -- if they were in place at the time that the law was passed, they can be grandfathered. But some insurance -- as a physician, I saw patients with insurance policies that when they got sick, they were of no use.</p><p>And what we're doing -- what is happening with the Affordable Care Act, is we're raising the level of insurance. We're improving the services that are provided. We're making insurance more secure. And if there are any policies that don't meet the high standards, they may not be able to continue to see patients, but -- to write policies for patients. But most of them are going to be grandfathered. Only about 5 percent are not meeting that standard, and are dropping patients.</p><p>But as you said, Chris, insurance companies drop their insured all the time for a variety of reasons. And I guess in some cases, they felt that this was a good excuse, whether it was warranted or not.</p><p>HAYES: Congressman Leonard Lance and Congresswoman Donna Christensen, I thank you both for your time.</p><p>LEONARD: Thank you.</p><p>HAYES: Joining me now is Clay Johnson, founder and CEO of the Department of Better Technology, a firm that designs and builds software for government. He was a presidential innovation fellow.</p><p>And, Clay, I wanted to have you on because you have been tweeted about watching these hearings. They're all out of healthcare.gov. You worked on trying to do big tech projects. What was your takeaway from the hearing today?</p><p>CLAY JOHNSON, DEPARTMENT OF BETTER TECHNOLOGY: My takeaway was that we have a Congress that is dangerously illiterate when it comes to technology issues. I mean, looking at this thing, for me as a programmer and technologist, it was rather like watching people who can't neither read nor write trying to be a book critics. I had no grasp of the fundamental issues at stake here or what is even and what is even bad, that was sort of baffling.</p><p>HAYES: What do you -- what did you emerged to you about what is going on with the Web site? Which it seems to me, Republicans have kind of moved past certain criticisms. Yet, that seems to be the implementation hurdle that this law needs to get over.</p><p>JOHNSON: It's interesting for sort of fiscal conservatives to move on, and worry about this issue, whether or not people can keep their health insurance. You know, the system that we use called the federal procurement process, in order to buy and build Healthcare.gov is broken. And that's responsible for $500 billion a year of spend by the federal government.</p><p>HAYES: Wait, I'm sorry -- $500 billion a year?</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes, a half a trillion dollars a year. T's and B's is what we're dealing with.</p><p>HAYES: Goes through the federal procurement system, the system that got the various contractors that built out this Web site.</p><p>JOHNSON: Right. And I think it's fundamentally broken, when you look at a Web site like healthcare.gov, that costs $200 million, this idea that that's acceptable is clearly false. And so I think you have to take a step back and look at the thing that created it. You have to look at the idea that maybe we're not selecting the best vendors or the best people are not working on this.</p><p>Look, when you build a technology project, you need three things. You need money, you need time, and you need talent. We had plenty of money and we had plenty of time. So --</p><p>HAYES: That's an interesting critique.</p><p>Do you think that there is any way to reform that process so that in the short term needed to get implementation up and running or is this a bigger thing that the big tech companies and government is inevitably will have to do down the line?</p><p>JOHNSON: Look, the standings group came out last week and said that 94 percent of federal IT projects up above $10 million fail. The federal IT budget alone is $81 billion a year.</p><p>HAYES: Wait a second, wait a second -- 94 percent of federal IT projects above $10 million fail?</p><p>JOHNSON: Right, and the federal IT budget is $80 billion a year.</p><p>So, I don't know why the Republicans are not up in arms about trying to fix the federal procurement process, because what they could be doing is really working hard on that, being of service to the idea of fiscal conservatism and opening the door to thousands if not millions of small businesses to compete on projects like Healthcare.gov. And they would probably do a better job at it.</p><p>HAYES: And yet, we've seen them kind of move past the Web site. I mean today, the thing that was notable about the hearing, I thought there was going to be a lot on the Web site, here they have <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius, </nameText></person>the woman who is ultimately responsible for this, and it didn't get a lot of play.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes. It was interesting, last week at the hearing with the contractors, Marsha Blackburn was asking about error logs and asking about, you know, HTTP request, and all kinds of technical stuff. And this time, she was talking about red solo cups and crystal straws. It was sort of -- you know, as a person who wants to see the federal procurement process changed, myself, I was sort of sad to see the right especially, but also the left, sort of move on from the actual Web site.</p><p>HAYES: Well, the monkey court attention span is short.</p><p>Clay Johnson from the Department of Better Technology -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I get a letter from someone in my district, Adrian, she says that she lost her coverage. She is going on the exchange. She doesn't qualify for a subsidy. She feels -- she writes this -- she feels betrayed by her government.</p><p>Now, she has to sit there asking herself is this fair?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Meet the newest Republican line of attack on Obamacare. We'll tell you the full story, ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HAYES: Hi there. I'm Chris Hayes, and you're watching MSNBC, the place for politics. I'm here to talk to you about a new and very special part of our operation. We here at the MSNBC like to lean forward and so we did.</p><p>Out of the past and into the future, welcome to the new MSNBC.com. Now, not to worry, you will still find videos of your favorite shows in reporting. But now, it's better in every single way. It's not a Web site anymore. It's a community.</p><p>So, go, make a poll. Join the group to create your own, because you can do that. Every nook and cranny of the site has something to offer. So, don't stay too far from our page. Allin.com.MSNBC.com (ph).</p><p>Thanks. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: Anyone peddling the notion that insurers are cancelling people's plan without mentioning that almost all the insurers are encouraging people to join better plans with the same carrier and stronger benefits and stronger protections, while others will be able to get better plans with new carriers to the marketplace, and that many will get new health to pay for these better plans and make them actually cheaper -- if you leave that stuff out, you're being grossly misleading, to say the least.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: As the president responding to what has become the leading line of Republican's attack to Obamacare in the last week, which is no longer a glitchy Web site. It's now policy cancellations.</p><p>Republicans, you see, are now very worried about cancelled health care coverage and Obamacare forcing people into signing up for more expensive plans. But it's not clear that is what is actually happening.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REPORTER: Self employed realtor, she buys her own insurance. (INAUDIBLE) provider recently sent her this notice reading, \"Because of the requirements of new laws, we can no longer offer your current policy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All I want is what I currently have. I want to keep my doctors and I would like to have lower premiums.</p><p>REPORTER: The insurance company is offering her a new plan that would cost $484 a month versus her current $293 premium, a 65 percent increase.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: So, 65 percent increase, that looks bad. That was a report from \"NBC Nightly News\".</p><p>But contributing editor for \"The American Prospect\", Paul Waldman, saw the report and wanted to know what (INAUDIBLE) other options might be. He did a little digging, and discovered that by going on the California exchange, he got, quote, \"nine different choices for a bronze plan. The average monthly cost was $258 or $35 a month less than what she is paying for her bare bones plan.\" Waldman also found that, quote, \"she could get a silver plan with more generous coverage for $316, only $23 more than what she is paying now.\"</p><p>One of our producers also hopped on the California exchange Web site and came up with similar results.</p><p>That's assuming the woman was 45 years old and had an income high enough she didn't qualify for subsidies.</p><p>Now, the other context here is that insurance companies don't seem to be giving people the full menu of options in the letters they're sending to announce the policy cancellation. In fact, those letters seem like they're being used to up-sell people into more expensive plans. Or as Waldman points out, it's like getting a letter from your car dealer and saying, your 2010 Toyota Corolla you're releasing has been recalled. We can supply you with an Avalon for twice the price.</p><p>What they don't seem to be communicating to their customers is that they're very well might be another plan that is ACA compliant that cost about the same as what they're paying right now.</p><p>Joining me now is Wendell Potter, former head of the communications at the insurance company Cigna, author of the fortcoming e-book, \"Obamacare, What's In It For Me: What Everyone Needs to Know About the Affordable Care Act.\" He's now senior analyst at the Center for Public Integrity.</p><p>All right. Wendell, I want to start with the baseline, which is what we had had before the Affordable Care Act, because I think that's getting lose.</p><p>How common was it for insurance companies to cancel policies in the individual market in a given year?</p><p>WENDELL POTTER, CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY: Well, it's very, very common. In fact, it's one of the reasons I left the industry just because of that practice.</p><p>In fact, my own son was a victim of that. In 2009, before the Affordable Care Act was passed, he got a letter from his Blue Cross plan in Pennsylvania telling him that his plan was being cancelled. And his options were to go into a plan that was somewhat comparable, but his premiums would increase 65 percent or he could shift into a very high deductible plan, shifting from one that had a $500 deductible, to one that had $5,000 deductible plan. It was 10 time increase in deductibles. And that's what he was able to do.</p><p>This has been going on for many years, Chris, and just is now coming to light. Reporter's really have not focused on this in years past, so insurance companies have been able to get away with this.</p><p>HAYES: So, the big question here is what is driving this? And it seems to me there's a few things going on. One is, plan that are being cancelled have to be replaced with a plan that is compliant with the Affordable Care Act, which means basic minimum, which are being enforced. But it also does seem to know, and I have now seen a bunch of these letters through these stories which have become a kind of genre, that the insurance companies saying you can enroll in this plan B, and it is a lot more expensive. But it is also not clear this is the only plan they're offering.</p><p>POTTER: Right, that's exactly right. It is a classic example of what I used to do for a living. That is, obscure the facts and use selective disclosure of facts to present something and make people think that they will not be able to get something that is better, and probably for less money on the exchange. They don't want you to know that.</p><p>HAYES: What is -- what kind of -- just for people to kind of understand the overall context of the health insurance market, what sliver of the population are we dealing with and we're talking about people that are in the individual market right now, that have plans that are not grandfathered in, that are being cancelled? Can you give us a sense of the -- the picture of, you know -- there are over 3 million Americans, what are we looking at here?</p><p>POTTER: Less than 4 percent, about 4 percent. Fourteen to 15 million in the individual market, it's small for two reasons. One, because insurance companies have been able to engage in practices of black balling people because of pre-existing conditions. People can't buy policies at any price, in many cases on the individual market because of being sick in the past.</p><p>And also, because they're able to cancel policies when they want to and -- or price them so high that people can't afford them. And so, we're talking about a very small percentage of the population.</p><p>Here is the other thing, too, though. People who are currently in the individual market probably can get coverage that is better than what they have now. Because a lot of these people are enrolled in junk policies that companies that I used to work with where I absolutely have sold in the past several years. And they can probably, many of them will, in fact, the majority will quality for tax credits or subsidies to bring the cost of premiums down. So they'll be paying less for better coverage.</p><p>HAYES: Quickly, Wendell, did the president and the people in the administration over-promise when they said repeatedly if you like your plan now, you can keep it?</p><p>POTTER: Well, it was unfortunate language, because the president nor Congress in this law can really control the insurance companies that well, that effectively. They control the health care system in many ways. They're able to get away with this, and they are, as we're seeing.</p><p>HAYES: Yes. It was a promise that now appears that they could not themselves keep. Wendell Potter from the Center for Public Integrity -- thank you so much.</p><p>All right, Congressman Barney Frank's name was brought up more than once today on the House floor, cited as the authority, the man supporting the bill that is essentially a big wet kiss from politicians to Wall Street. But that's actually not exactly the case. He will be here to react, coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HAYES: A big day for Congress today, back in the swing of things, back to work. House of Representatives holding one of its first floor votes since the government shutdown ended two weeks ago. And what did they vote on? They voted to gut a major part of Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEITH ELLISON (D), MINNESOTA: I think we're a day in front of Halloween, and here we are handing out treats to the likes of J.P. Morgan Chase, Citi, and Bank of America. You know, it is fitting on this day that we should be doing the people's business. And yet, here we are, handing out treats and goodies to huge banks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: The bill, which would allow big mega banks greater leeway in the kind of risky trading that caused the great crash, prevailed, capturing 70 Democrats along with all but three Republicans, in a touching display of bipartisan moxy.</p><p>But get this, though, the bill, HR-992, known as the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act was pretty much written by Citibank, along with its big bank cohorts. Here is a key section of the draft legislation as written by Citigroup courtesy of \"Mother Jones\", and here is the final bill, as voted out of committee by a 53-6 months ago and passed today by the full House.</p><p>As \"The New York Times\" notes, Citigroup's recommendations were reflective in more than 70 lines of the House Committee's 85-line bill, two crucial paragraphs prepared by Citigroup in conjunction with other Wall Street banks were copied nearly word for word.</p><p>In justifying his support of the bill, the current chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling, cited the former chair of the committee, Barney Frank.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JEB HENSARLING (R), TEXAS: And those who are loathe to ever amend Dodd-Frank, no less of an authority, than Barney Frank himself, former chairman of the committee, said, quote, \"It addresses the valid criticisms of Section 716 without weakening the financial reform law's important safeguards or prohibitions on bank proprietary trading.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Joining me now is former Congressman Barney Frank, Democrat from Massachusetts, former chair of the House Financial Services Committee, co- author of the Dodd-Frank financial reform, and cited many times today in the House debate as someone who favored this bill.</p><p>Barney Frank, did you favor this bill?</p><p>BARNEY FRANK (D-MA), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: No, I never did. And I am touched by this invocation.</p><p>It reminds me what I have always felt about a lot of Republicans. They have a great fondness for dead Democrats. You know, Harry Truman, John Kennedy. They always like them -- I guess they have developed a new fondness now, for nonmembers of the house. Because that is certainly not a deference any of them paid to my judgment when I was there.</p><p>The fact is, I did say in 2009, 2010, when the bill came out in the Senate, that I didn't think it was necessary and I thought we could do it other ways. On the other hand, I had consistently said since then, while it is not in my judgment, one of the critical elements is in the bill, it is a great mistake, I believe, at this point, to start picking it apart. One of the things that the Tea Party fundamentally missed in the effort to relitigate the health care bill is, there is an important issue in the legislating, when you passed something, when you had your fight and won or lost, you don't immediately, if you get a temporary advantage undo it.</p><p>These people say, oh, well, the business community needs predictability. You don't want to keep changing things. Well, they shouldn't change things. Others (INAUDIBLE), we didn't think it was necessary at the times, we've gone on from things. Things have evolved. It has now became part of the expectations, part of the -- so no, I never said -- I did say that it wasn't one of the critical elements.</p><p>At the same time, I have consistently said I didn't think it should be repealed on the principle that it is now too early to start undoing this. And, there is another factor, this restriction on the derivatives giving them out of the banks, to semi set overlaps revocable.</p><p>Well, if we have in place a very strong vocal rule, which keeps banks from doing some of this, that might after some years of experience lead you to a different conclusion. But, we are not there yet. So, this is frankly a fairly hypocritical invocation of me, this radioactive imputation of me, of great wisdom, which I never noticed in doing when I was there.</p><p>It was out of context. I know I was against the bill. I never voted for the bill. As a fact, when I heard they were saying that, I called my former colleague, Maxine Waters, her staff -- repudiating that.</p><p>HAYES: Yes. Here is Congressman Maxine Waters speaking today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAXINE WATERS, (D) CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN: And in case America forgot, J.P. Morgan reminded all of us the importance in setting limits on bank activity. In 2012, four years after the crisis, J.P. Morgan Chase, London well caused the bank to lose more than $6 billion in a few months. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: And, here is one of the things about Dodd Frank. It was crafted in such a way so that a fair amount of the granular rule making was left to regulators. And, my question to you as the architect of this bill, how do you feel about the house and congress coming back to essentially micro- manage a lot the stuff that was intentionally left in the bill for regulators to make decisions on.</p><p>FRANK: First, let me defend that matter for you because you are right. To the extent that we got very specific in the regulation, we would have had two problems. First of all, things evolve. Things change.</p><p>We didn't want to just prevent the bad practices of the past. We wanted all empower regulators to anticipate or deal with new evolving practices in the future. Secondly, the most specific you make a provision, the more easily it can be evaded --</p><p>HAYES: That is right.</p><p>FRANK: -- you just change a few pieces of it. But, here is the real problem, I am happy about that. But, this is what most bothers me and this is why I would never be for this kind of legislation right now. Once again, if you have the vocable and you have an adequate set of regulations, I'm willing to author this again.</p><p>But, here is the problem, the biggest single grant of new authority in the bill was to the commodity futures trading commission, which has the major responsibility for regulating derivatives -- financial derivatives. They were set up to do agricultural things.</p><p>Now, they got into this very complicated hundred of trillions of dollars derivative. They got a budget of a couple of hundred million. The serious attack the republicans have been unfortunately successfully making so far - -</p><p>HAYES: Is billing after that budget.</p><p>FRANK: -- is to refuse to fund, they wouldn't fund the commodities futures trading commission. So, that is the problem --</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>FRANK: They have choked off the regulator and kept them from being able to do this. That, while taken together is why I would never support a bill like this.</p><p>HAYES: Really important point, former Congressman Barney Frank, thank you so much. We will be right back with Click Three.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HAYES: Coming up, you definitely want to see this. An exclusive report from our reporters on a big deadline that is hitting this Friday that no one is talking of it that has millions of people panicking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>But, first, I want to show you the three awesomest things on the internet today. We begin with some evidence making the case for an actual -- Perhaps, like the one used by the seniors. The mildly rumored 80's movie, \"Cocoon.\"</p><p>You see, if you are remaking the movie \"Cocoon\" today, and you did come up with an age appropriate movie star, the role of Ben, the kindly old grandfather played by mustache old character actor Wilford Brimley, who would you get? Why you could get George Clooney, who is a year older than Wilford Brimley was when \"Cocoon\" was released.</p><p>That shocking information was reviewed by bosure.com today, showing how well-preserved today's movie stars really are. For instance, would you have get that dashing Denzel Washington is one year frankly for being old enough to play Matt Lock, or Betty Davis playing the Baby Jane is only one year older than dancing nimble, Ellen Degeneres is today.</p><p>When Jack Lemmon starred in \"Grumpy Old Men,\" he was only two years older than today's Samuel L. Jackson and while we can't picture Jackson as a grumpy old man, there has been a lot of time using himself to Jack Lemmon in \"Pulp Fiction.\"</p><p>The second most awesome thing on the internet today, windows to the soul. You are not looking at some kind of post-modern jack-o-lantern. It is actually a house, bought for just about $500 and made entirely out of recycled windows. Photographer Nick Olsen, designer Lilah Horwitz spent seven months constructing this west Virginia cabin. That is not their primary home, it is a wonderful retreat back to nature. No plumbing or electricity. There is a whole lot of sunshine.</p><p>Whatever the deficiencies, it sure beats this building, which you could call its pole opposite. That is a high-rise in china ha upon further inspection, has fake windows painted on it. Fine, if you're a vampire, not fine if you ever want to see outside. But to be fair, it is a lot safer for birds flying through the air than this place.</p><p>And, the third awesomest thing on the internet today. I'm not the only one who loves the pope. This kid loves him, too. During the Vatican celebration, children were seated around the Pope Francis' platform. And, this little fellow decided to do a little free-lancing.</p><p>Before long, the children sudden became a duo, begging for their own sitcom. At first, the youngster was protective of the Holy Father wanting Pop Francis' attention -- and started helping people up to the stage for a meeting with the pontiff. Pope Francis was totally cool with it. It all ended in a touching embrace.</p><p>It is quite an achievement in Grantsville upstaging so much so, we're convinced this kid went to the -- Giuliani Academy of public events interruptions. You can find all the links for tonight's Click Three on our website, allinwithchris.com, we'll be right back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HAYES: This Friday, 47 million poor people are going to have their benefits cut. You probably haven't heard about it, but food agencies that are struggling to feed the growing ranks of America's hungry are in full- out panic mode. It is called the hunger cliff, and as you are about to see in our exclusive report we are about to go over it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): The sun has not come up yet outside the river fun food pantry in Queens, New York. But, many of the hundreds who line up here every Saturday have already been here for hours, bundled up against the cold. They come before sunrise for free food, cereal, vegetables, sometimes meat so that can feed themselves and their kids for another week. For many here on food stamps, it is not enough.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER: I went here to exercise 45 because the line is so long. I try to come up 10. The line is all the way to that corner and I spent four hours on the line.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): Last year, 47 million people, a full 15% of the population depended on food stamp assistance. And, their lives are about to get harder. When provisions for the 2009 stimulus package expire tomorrow night, $5 billion in cuts to the food stamp program will take effect.</p><p>That means a lot to the people who need food the most. Average food stamp recipient gets about $133 in benefits per month, or less than a $1.50 per meal. For a family of four, the cuts coming down the line work out to 24 fewer meals every month.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER: I read on the newspaper that today there will be a cutback. I reached to the point, I didn't know what to do. I don't know, maybe I may have to go somewhere else to see if I could get some more food. I really don't know. I really don't know, but it would really hit me hard.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): The cuts to food stamps also called snap benefits are the first big hit in what activists have taken to calling the hunger cliff. The second hit may come soon. In Washington, a committee met today, starting to reconcile the house and senate version of the farm bill, which has long been the vehicle for food stamp legislation.</p><p>The senate version of the bill cuts more than $4 billion to food stamps over a decade. The house wants to cut who whopping $39 billion and kick nearly 4 million people off the program. While <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>had promised to veto major cuts with the snap program, it is likely additional cuts are coming.</p><p>Some republicans have tried to spin these cuts as humane. Representatives from Sutherland, Florida has led the charge for the food stamp cuts in the house told \"The Washington Post\" that being dependent on food stamps makes you more vulnerable. Paul Ryan suggested that cutting food stamps is doing the poor a favor.</p><p>PAUL RYAN, (R) WISCONSIN CONGRESSMAN: We don't want to turn the safety net into a hammock that lulls able-bodied people to lives of dependency and complacency that drains them of their will and their incentive to make the most of their lives.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): And, others, just seem to want to punish the hunger.</p><p>STEPHEN FINCHER, (R) TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE: The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): That was Stephen Fincher, republican of Tennessee, who himself has taken nearly $3.5 million from taxpayers to finance farm -- provided by the very single farm bill -- food stamp recipients as leads to vultures. But, the truth is that nearly half of food stamp recipients are children.</p><p>And, more than four in ten will live in household or someone works. Many of those without a job desperately want one. Elizabeth Ferrera is a single mother with a master's degree.</p><p>ELIZABETH FERRERA, SINGLE MOTHER: I need food stamps and I need food in order to survive, you know to feed my three children. It is really hard to get a job out there. Even though I have all the qualifications, you know, they still don't hire all the people.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): Zurica Abdul have to stay home to take care of her disabled 15-year-old daughter.</p><p>ZURICA ABDUL, MOTHER OF DISABLED DAUGHTER: I am with my 6-year-old, sometimes, she told me she is hungry and I have nothing to give her. So, it is very hard. You know, when you just have milk and you have to warm it and give to child of 6. You need money to go to school without food.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): Abdul is one of thousands in New York alone who depends on food pantries to make ends meet. But, because of the sequester, food pantries are already dealing with a 5% reduction in federal subsidies, even as they see needs increasing due to the cuts to food stamps.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: The senior who is getting $700, our rent is $500, their medicine is $5 to $10 per prescription. So, you put that altogether, what is left? So, you know? So, I think if you can get food, you know some of it is actually a dire need just to meet the essentials.</p><p>But, some of it is actually trying to put together a picture that they can survive. I know a lot of people think that people come here for food. You know, a lot of times they hear the word moocher and things like that. I have to say it is offensive to me because I want to challenge anyone out there to come during the winter, to come at 3:00 in the morning, stand in this line and wait for food.</p><p>HAYES (voice-over): If house republicans have their way, that line is only get longer.</p><p>ABDUL: Every day you come to get money, if you have $307, you come, you are going to spend 300 this week, you can't go over, you know? Once you go over, then before the month is up, it is three or four days sometimes you don't have enough food to eat. So, it is very hard. If they cut it, you know, a lot of people is going to suffer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER: What about all the years I paid taxes? You know? I worked so hard. And, when it is time now, I believe that I should get some help. Look what happens now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: For more on the Hunger Cliff, check out our reporter Ned Resnikoff's great piece on msnbc.com. Fantastic companion photos from John Trotter. A congressman who is fighting the GOP food stamp cuts and people on the frontlines of the hunger battle will join me next, stick around.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HAYES: We are back, and joining me now is Joel Berg, Executive Director of the New York Coalition Against Hunger, author of \"All You Can Eat: How Hungry Is America?\" Margarette Purvis, president and CEO of Food Bank from New York City and Congressman Jim McGovern, democrat from Massachusetts, a member of the house agriculture committee and co-chair of House Hunger Caucus.</p><p>Joe and Margarette, I want to start with you, $5 billion in cuts happen on Friday. That money goes away. Now, it is an $80 billion a year program more or less. That is, you know, a little more than 5%, but how big a deal is this really?</p><p>MARGARETTE PURVIS, CEO OF FOOD BANK FOR NEW YORK CITY: This is the biggest of deals. You know, just in New York City alone, these cuts will wipe out 76 million meals from people who need it the most.</p><p>Already, we know that a family, who typically have their benefits -- their food stamps, it will last until about the third week without the cuts. You know, the fourth week of the month that they decided to do this, it is for thanksgiving --</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>PURVIS: -- it is for Hanukkah. It makes absolutely no sense, especially since we all know that nothing has happened differently with our economy.</p><p>HAYES: How about, can private charities kicked in? Is this -- you know, I give money to food banks, people give money to food banks.</p><p>JOEL BERG, NEW YORK COALITION AGAINST HUNGER: And, you should, but no one should be fooled into thinking this can solve the problem. Every food bank, soup kitchen, food pantry in America distributes about $5 billion worth of food. So, this cut goes into effect now, this is as if all of these charities didn't exist for a year. And, the cuts being proposed --</p><p>HAYES: The cuts that happen on Friday, automatically that no one is talking about, they're not like a political issue. Those just are equal to the sum total of privately charity funded food assistance in the entire nation. That is the size of the cut.</p><p>BERG: Correct. As media matters pointed out until this segment as far as we know this is the first network news show to even discuss 48 million people losing food. And, the house cuts on top of this would be eight times what charities distribute in a year.</p><p>HAYES: And, Congressman, I want to go to you on that. The republicans have proposed a $39 billion cuts to programs. That is over 10-year window that is to be scored about $4 billion a year. One of the things that I think is interesting here is it seems to me like these food stamps were something there was a political consensus around, until recently.</p><p>I wanted to show you just an image from Fox News who has been doing a lot of reporting, I guess you can call. This is just an image. Quote, unquote, \"Poor households reviewed that 99.6% of them have a refrigerator.\" The implication being that these people are not really poor. They don't actually need this. Have you seen the political consensus around this very basic aspect of safety net necessity, erode?</p><p>JIM MCGOVERN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS CONGRESSMAN: Unfortunately, yes. There used to be a bipartisan consensus that any hunger was something that we ought to be committed to. Unfortunately, that bipartisan consensus disappeared. And, what we have seen as republicans belittle poor people, and diminish their struggle, and basically use them as political funds in their budget struggle.</p><p>Every family tried to find savings, it comes from programs like SNAP or programs that help poor people and it is very frankly now unfortunate. It is really sad. And, if government stands for anything, we ought to be there for the people who are most vulnerable.</p><p>HAYES: Is there going to be any way to avoid further cuts when you are considering reconciling a senate bill that has got $4 billion in cuts over ten years and a house bill that has got $39 billion in cuts over ten years?</p><p>MCGOVERN: Well, I'm on the conference committee of the farm bill, and I said today that you know I am willing to be flexible. I am willing to be reasonable but I'm not going to support a farm bill that makes more people hungry in America. We ought to at least agree on that.</p><p>And, I don't believe that we should have anymore cuts in SNAP. We should be talking about how to end hunger, not just talking about trying to protect the program. We ought to have some White House leadership quite frankly. We need to have White House conference on food and nutrition to bring people together and actually have a road map to end hunger.</p><p>That is what we should -- That is where our discussion should be focused, not on these cutbacks to SNAP. But, we're going to fight hard to make sure there is no further damage to SNAP. But, it is an uphill battle, given the makeup of the House of Representatives.</p><p>HAYES: One of the things that have attracted kind of the political attention by conservative and Fox News and republicans is that there has been massive growth in the food stamp program. That is not a right wing lie. That program has gotten much more expensive. $80 billion is a lot of money. We shouldn't not mince words about the size of the program. Why has the size of the program expanded so much?</p><p>PURVIS: The size of the program reflects the size of the problem. It is not growing off on its own. It reflects that there is a huge hunger crisis. The problem is that we are treating the issue as the people, rather than the issue of being why is hunger this bad in this country? Everyone should be upset about this, not upset at the people who are suffering through it.</p><p>HAYES: Why is it so bad in this country? And, what is the answer to that question?</p><p>BERG: Living wages, jobs. People complaining about food stamps and Snap having to fill in the gap are the very same people wrecking economy. They are not really anti-government. They are anti-government for other people. Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida. who is complaining bitterly about the food stamp program. He admitted he received benefits earlier in life. So, my organization sent him a letter with a mirror in it, and said if you want to see what a food stamp recipient looks like, check this out.</p><p>(LAUGHING)</p><p>MCGOVERN: And, Chris, may I just add. Look, the majority of people on food stamps are senior citizens and children. All of the able-bodied you know, people that can actually work, majority of those people work. Many of them work full-time and they still earn so little that they qualify for this benefit. So, we have a lousy economy, when the economy gets better, fewer people will be on food stamps.</p><p>HAYES: But congressman, to push you more on that, it is now -- we are now four years in this recovery. And, when we are going into the reporting of this and looking into the numbers -- I mean 15% of Americans are poor. 47 million people, I look at that and I say America, this is not working.</p><p>What we are doing right now, our system, the system we're running is failing. 47 million people in poverty, hungry in this country is a failing grace. It is American capital is not producing at this moment, broad gains for people. It is not.</p><p>MCGOVERN: That is why we need a broader discussion. That is why we need a White House conference on food and nutrition to talk about how you end this problem. Not just how you put band aids on it. But, we need to be talking about increasing the minimum wage. We need to be talking about increasing the minimum wage.</p><p>We need to be talking about how you extend letters of opportunity to help people get out of poverty. But, in the meantime, we need to make sure that we are there with the safety net to make sure people have at least enough to eat.</p><p>Boy, what a radical idea that everybody in this country, the richest country in the history of the world ought to have enough to eat. Surely, we should be able to get a bipartisan consensus on that, but unfortunately in Washington that consensus has blown up.</p><p>HAYES: We declared the war on poverty. We actually won that poverty. That is incredibly in successful social and then we just decided to turn tail and run. Joel Berg from the New York Coalition Against Hunger, Margarett Purvis from Food Bank for New York City, and Congressman Jim McGovern, thank you very much. That is all in for this evening. \"RACHEL MADDOW SHOW\" starts right now. Good evening, Rachel.</p><p>RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Good evening, Chris.

This was after the technology major temporarily removed the mobile payment platform's app from its Play Store for running a scratch card-based cricket promotion which breached its gambling policies. He said the company would also seek government and regulatory intervention.\u00a0Sharma, who tore into Google's practice of barring apps which were compliant with Indian laws, said his \"fight\" will be a long-drawn one. He told ET in an hour-long interview that he had full faith in the Indian government and its antitrust body, the Competition Commission of India (CCI). \"We would like to amplify the voice of the Indian startup community and our technology companies,\" Sharma said.\u00a0He added that the company will demand an explanation for being arbitrarily yanked off the Play Store. </p><p>\"This is a concern for every regulator in this country and for the government because our app is not a gambling app. I feel agitated to the level that it won't stop today or tomorrow, this fight will go long,\" he said. Paytm was being \"singled out\" and \"targeted\" while other similar features were running elsewhere and on Google's own payments app, he added.\u00a0In an emailed statement, a Google spokesperson said, \"Offering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies. Our policies don't allow online casinos or support any unregulated gambling apps that facilitate sports betting, including daily fantasy sports in India.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0Sharma criticised industry bodies such as Nasscom and Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) for being dominated by US tech majors, and called for formation of a new grouping that would fairly represent the voice of local technology firms. \"Founders are coming together and there is a discussion on this topic. We will be talking to the government, lawmakers, regulators,\" he said.\u00a0<br/>Last week on Friday, Google pulled Paytm from its Play store due to a scratch card based cricket promotion which it had launched to coincide with the Indian Premier League. Google said in a blog post that it was removing apps which breached its gambling policies without naming Paytm specifically. It also said, the regulation does not permit apps which direct users to such \"websites that allow them to participate in paid tournaments to win real money or cash prizes, it is a violation of our policies.\"\u00a0<br/>The Noida-based digital payments app, which is backed by Alibaba's payments affiliate, Ant Group and Japan's SoftBank, and is currently valued at $16 billion, which took off the feature subsequently and went back up on Google Play store, however, maintains it was not in the wrong. Sharma said, \"Google owns the gate and the gateway to the digital ecosystem of this country, we may choose to accept it or not. Just like the borders of this country are protected by our armed forces and governed by the Indian establishment, our digital ecosystem needs safeguards, too. It cannot be just an additional layer over a layer, controlled by these large big tech organizations.\" How can an\u00a0<br/>app store<br/>\u00a0put a layer above the government and regulator, Sharma questioned. This is effectively a sanction by an American company on an Indian company and by extension to Indian customers. Can I get the court to say anything in this case? No, it's beyond their jurisdiction, he pointed out.\u00a0<br/>The Paytm founder's attack on Google comes amid a larger, worldwide political backlash against Big Tech, comprising Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon, questioning their ever increasing power they wield through their platforms and devices. Sharma said, while India as a market for these technology biggies is big on the user front, the business which the country contributes is meagre. \"Countries with large economies can get an ear of these companies and they are ready to come and listen.. You can talk about tax trials in Ireland, France's issue of privacy, and Australia's regulations. So when you matter on a balance sheet you get heard. India is a trial ground, bully ground, let me do what I want to do ground.\"\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1536430</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XF-K0V1-JBYT-H102-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 25, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This was after the technology major temporarily removed the mobile payment platform's app from its Play Store for running a scratch card-based cricket promotion which breached its gambling policies. He said the company would also seek government and regulatory intervention.  Sharma, who tore into Google's practice of barring apps which were compliant with Indian laws, said his \"fight\" will be a long-drawn one. He told ET in an hour-long interview that he had full faith in the Indian government and its antitrust body, the Competition Commission of India (CCI). \"We would like to amplify the voice of the Indian startup community and our technology companies,\" Sharma said.   He added that the company will demand an explanation for being arbitrarily yanked off the Play Store. \"This is a concern for every regulator in this country and for the government because our app is not a gambling app. I feel agitated to the level that it won\u2019t stop today or tomorrow, this fight will go long,\" he said. Paytm was being \"singled out\" and \"targeted\" while other similar features were running elsewhere and on Google\u2019s own payments app, he added.  In an emailed statement, a Google spokesperson said, \u201cOffering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies. Our policies don\u2019t allow online casinos or support any unregulated gambling apps that facilitate sports betting, including daily fantasy sports in India.\u201d  Sharma criticised industry bodies such as Nasscom and Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) for being dominated by US tech majors, and called for formation of a new grouping that would fairly represent the voice of local technology firms. \u201cFounders are coming together and there is a discussion on this topic. We will be talking to the government, lawmakers, regulators,\u201d he said.   Last week on Friday, Google pulled Paytm from its Play store due to a scratch card based cricket promotion which it had launched to coincide with the Indian Premier League. Google said in a blog post that it was removing apps which breached its gambling policies without naming Paytm specifically. It also said, the regulation does not permit apps which direct users to such \u201cwebsites that allow them to participate in paid tournaments to win real money or cash prizes, it is a violation of our policies.\u201d  The Noida-based digital payments app, which is backed by Alibaba\u2019s payments affiliate, Ant Group and Japan\u2019s SoftBank, and is currently valued at $16 billion, which took off the feature subsequently and went back up on Google Play store, however, maintains it was not in the wrong. Sharma said, \u201cGoogle owns the gate and the gateway to the digital ecosystem of this country, we may choose to accept it or not. Just like the borders of this country are protected by our armed forces and governed by the Indian establishment, our digital ecosystem needs safeguards, too. It cannot be just an additional layer over a layer, controlled by these large big tech organizations.\u201d How can an app store put a layer above the government and regulator, Sharma questioned. This is effectively a sanction by an American company on an Indian company and by extension to Indian customers. Can I get the court to say anything in this case? No, it\u2019s beyond their jurisdiction, he pointed out.  The Paytm founder\u2019s attack on Google comes amid a larger, worldwide political backlash against Big Tech, comprising Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon, questioning their ever increasing power they wield through their platforms and devices. Sharma said, while India as a market for these technology biggies is big on the user front, the business which the country contributes is meagre. \u201cCountries with large economies can get an ear of these companies and they are ready to come and listen.. You can talk about tax trials in Ireland, France's issue of privacy, and Australia\u2019s regulations. So when you matter on a balance sheet you get heard. India is a trial ground, bully ground, let me do what I want to do ground.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43124490988</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WJ-JNP1-JCSC-J052-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ETCIO.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 21, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Financial institutions may see a 28% improvement in their cost-to-income ratios.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Additionally, financial firms will spend more than $1.5 billion this year on AI-related technologies and $2.8 billion annually by 2021, not including their investments in AI startups, the Opimas report estimated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's clear that AI will change Wall Street, but it is probably too simple to merely attribute the change to the promises of AI. Instead, it is several technologies that fall under the broader umbrella of artificial intelligence that are attacking the industry from all sides.</p><p>Process-oriented jobs are being killed by robotic process automation, a lower-IQ form of AI in which small pieces of software are programmed to do simple tasks, like looking up a document or a piece of information.</p><p>More analytical jobs are being replaced with things like machine learning, deep learning and the like that can digest large volumes of real-time data quickly and learn to find telling patterns with a speed the human brain can't match.</p><p>This has implications for jobs all over capital markets, from the front office to risk, fraud and even HR. And it will create some new jobs - though not entry-level ones.</p><p>\"AI is going to touch every aspect of jobs in the capital markets,\" said Ed Donner, co-founder and CEO of untapt, a startupthat presented at the last Accenture fintech demo dayand that uses deep learning to match tech job candidates to the right positions. \"It's not just support functions, it's not just operations; it's also the front office. And retail banking and private wealth management are affected as well.\"</p><p>Some of this is buzz, for sure, but AI's boom is due to the convergence of several trends: costs associated with the advanced computing and data-storage hardware behind AI have come down. It's now possible to feed AI engines the massive amounts of data they need to learn to do the job of people. And major vendors have all come out with products that can work with existing technology, rather than requiring systems to be ripped out.</p><p>Quieter front office</p><p>Front-office sales and trading jobs have already dropped, partly because so many firms use algorithmic trading. There's been a 20% to 30% headcount reduction overall in the front office over the past few years, said David Weiss, senior analyst at Aite Group.</p><p>\"Trade floors are a shadow of their former selves,\" and \"market making and high-touch trading now employ fewer people,\" Weiss said.</p><p>This trend will accelerate as AI advances.</p><p>\"Natural language processing is helping to gain a greater understanding of conversations people are having, the intent of conversations in the front office,\" said Terry Roche, head of fintech research at the TABB Group. \"And mining data to gain greater insight to what's happening\" so it can give sales traders alerts about investment opportunities for their clients.</p><p>Analysts and researchers in the front office are being replaced by AI that can monitor vast arrays of data sources in real time, detect signals and put together analyst reports, Donner noted. The startup Kensho, in which Goldman Sachs has invested, is one example. A smaller startup called Agolo is another.</p><p>Emptying middle and back offices</p><p>Manyjobs have been lostin middle and back offices, because those areas tend to be loaded with processes that are connected by human manual intervention, said Axel Pierron, managing director at Opimas.</p><p>\"What AI brings there is the ability to do handwriting recognition and image recognition, as well as robotic process automation,\" he said. \"We're already seeing the huge efficiency gains that AI can provide to the industry.\"</p><p>AI is also making a dent incompliancestaff.</p><p>\"Compliance went on a huge hiring spree over the past several years in response to global regulatory mandates and regional enforcement actions,\" Weiss said. \"Artificial intelligence tech is being deployed to get a better holistic view as well as finally reduce false-positives - in ways that more bodies failed to. So that is the next area for attrition and reduced staffing needs.\"</p><p>IBM has fed the contents of the Dodd-Frank Act into its \"Jeopardy!\"-winning AI machine, Watson.

Financial institutions may see a 28% improvement in their cost-to-income ratios.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Additionally, financial firms will spend more than $1.5 billion this year on AI-related technologies and $2.8 billion annually by 2021, not including their investments in AI startups, the Opimas report estimated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's clear that AI will change Wall Street, but it is probably too simple to merely attribute the change to the promises of AI. Instead, it is several technologies that fall under the broader umbrella of artificial intelligence that are attacking the industry from all sides.</p><p>Process-oriented jobs are being killed by robotic process automation, a lower-IQ form of AI in which small pieces of software are programmed to do simple tasks, like looking up a document or a piece of information.</p><p>More analytical jobs are being replaced with things like machine learning, deep learning and the like that can digest large volumes of real-time data quickly and learn to find telling patterns with a speed the human brain can't match.</p><p>This has implications for jobs all over capital markets, from the front office to risk, fraud and even HR. And it will create some new jobs - though not entry-level ones.</p><p>\"AI is going to touch every aspect of jobs in the capital markets,\" said Ed Donner, co-founder and CEO of untapt, a startupthat presented at the last Accenture fintech demo dayand that uses deep learning to match tech job candidates to the right positions. \"It's not just support functions, it's not just operations; it's also the front office. And retail banking and private wealth management are affected as well.\"</p><p>Some of this is buzz, for sure, but AI's boom is due to the convergence of several trends: costs associated with the advanced computing and data-storage hardware behind AI have come down. It's now possible to feed AI engines the massive amounts of data they need to learn to do the job of people. And major vendors have all come out with products that can work with existing technology, rather than requiring systems to be ripped out.</p><p>Quieter front office</p><p>Front-office sales and trading jobs have already dropped, partly because so many firms use algorithmic trading. There's been a 20% to 30% headcount reduction overall in the front office over the past few years, said David Weiss, senior analyst at Aite Group.</p><p>\"Trade floors are a shadow of their former selves,\" and \"market making and high-touch trading now employ fewer people,\" Weiss said.</p><p>This trend will accelerate as AI advances.</p><p>\"Natural language processing is helping to gain a greater understanding of conversations people are having, the intent of conversations in the front office,\" said Terry Roche, head of fintech research at the TABB Group. \"And mining data to gain greater insight to what's happening\" so it can give sales traders alerts about investment opportunities for their clients.</p><p>Analysts and researchers in the front office are being replaced by AI that can monitor vast arrays of data sources in real time, detect signals and put together analyst reports, Donner noted. The startup Kensho, in which Goldman Sachs has invested, is one example. A smaller startup called Agolo is another.</p><p>Emptying middle and back offices</p><p>Manyjobs have been lostin middle and back offices, because those areas tend to be loaded with processes that are connected by human manual intervention, said Axel Pierron, managing director at Opimas.</p><p>\"What AI brings there is the ability to do handwriting recognition and image recognition, as well as robotic process automation,\" he said. \"We're already seeing the huge efficiency gains that AI can provide to the industry.\"</p><p>AI is also making a dent incompliancestaff.</p><p>\"Compliance went on a huge hiring spree over the past several years in response to global regulatory mandates and regional enforcement actions,\" Weiss said. \"Artificial intelligence tech is being deployed to get a better holistic view as well as finally reduce false-positives - in ways that more bodies failed to. So that is the next area for attrition and reduced staffing needs.\"</p><p>IBM has fed the contents of the Dodd-Frank Act into its \"Jeopardy!\"-winning AI machine, Watson. Itbought regulatory compliance firm Promontoryand wants Watson to imbibe the firm's experts' knowledge. The startup Quarule is also working on AI for financial compliance.</p><p>Asset management firms first</p><p>Employees atasset management firmsare especially vulnerable, Pierron said.</p><p>\"You have a combined effect of the trend toward exchange-traded funds and self-investment, so it becomes harder to justify the management fee.

And as someone who's sat in front of the box since the days of Davy Crockett, it's undeniable that there's a supernova of video competition, including cable, satellite, fiber and Internet-streaming video. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From portal apps such as Roku, Apple TV or Sling to free and paid streams such as those created by YouTube, HBO, CBS and various professional sports leagues, the video consumer today is king.</p><p>But those basic facts about \"television\" -- as undeniable as they seem -- are being challenged at the FCC right now by a group of Big Tech companies that want to put all these competing sources of entertainment and information in one place where they can monitor and control them. It's a proposal called \"AllVid,\" and unless the FCC finds the common sense and backbone to give it the quick burial it deserves, the future of television is going to change -- and not for the better.</p><p>Companies such as Google, Tivo, Sony and others that support AllVid want the FCC to require every provider of pay TV -- Verizon, AT&amp;T, Comcast, Time Warner, Cox, Charter, Dish, DirecTV, every last one of them -- to let these Allvid companies put a box on top of your TV that intercepts the shows and channels that you paid for and repackage them, allowing them to move channels around the dial, manage the flow of content and monitor and track your choices in order to sell more information about you to hungry advertisers, much as Google does already to your email and Internet searches.</p><p>And not only would they not pay one thin dime for this privilege, they also would be allowed to wrap their own advertising around the programs you watch. In fact, by shredding the arrangements under which distributors cut deals with content providers, and by forcing all cable boxes to interact with their technical standards, the Big Tech firms would be adding costs while they benefit at the viewers' expense.</p><p>Their proposal sounds bizarre, but their rationale is even more otherworldly. AllVid proponents claim in their FCC filings that this proposal would increase competition and choice in the video marketplace.</p><p>How's that again? Is there anybody who thinks that between traditional pay and broadcast TV, the new streams flooding over the Internet (whether free ones such as YouTube or paid ones such as Netflix), or devices such as Apple TV or Amazon Fire, that there's not enough to watch? There's a reason why today's world is already called \"TV Everywhere.\"</p><p>In fact, the AllVid proponents are trying to manage competition, not defend or enhance it. They're looking for a sweetheart deal that would let them scrape programming off of other systems that have cut distribution deals with studios and other content providers, and then repackage and resell them through AllVid.</p><p>When USA buys Mr. Robot, for example, it carefully negotiates the time it will be shown, the extent and nature of commercials and a plethora of other terms. And USA in turn negotiates with the big multichannel distributors for additional terms, like what other channels it will be near and whether it will be on a basic or premiere tier of service. But all those economically vital terms would be upended by AllVid, disrupting the revenue streams that fund production of these great new shows in the first place. This isn't about \"disruption\" -- it's about asking for a free ride on something that others have worked hard to deliver to an enthusiastic audience of consumers.</p><p>One of the few ideas the political spectrum gathers around, particularly in a campaign season, is that regulation isn't about helping the regulated. The left bemoans regulators who are held captive by the companies they're there to regulate. The right assails \"crony capitalism,\" by which political influence is turned into economic gain for the favored few. Both sides, therefore, ought to take a cold and hard look at this attempt to poach the entire television system by asking the FCC to do something the market never would.</p><p>Ev Ehrlich is president of ESC Co., an economics consulting firm, and was undersecretary of commerce from 1993 to 1997.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MIAMIH-B974096188Z1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MIAMIH2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HG8-YDY1-DYJM-M0SH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"700\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Miami Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Miami Herald</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"11090\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>November 27, 2015 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Established programmers such as HBO and AMC are pumping out one critically acclaimed hit after another. New streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon have launched their own award-winning original content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New \"over-the-top\" services such as SlingTV let cord-cutters watch huge libraries of programming via apps through a growing variety of devices \u2014 from smart TVs and tablets to video game consoles and Roku or Apple TV streaming boxes. Even traditional pay TV providers have launched apps that let subscribers watch their favorite shows on hundreds of millions of connected devices.</p><p> This sea change shows no sign of slowing. In September, <person><nameText>Apple CEO </nameText></person>Tim Cook declared \"the future of TV is apps.\" Weeks later, Google unveiled its app-enabled Chromecast device. Consumers today have more choices for programming, services and devices than at any time in the history of television.</p><p> But in Washington, D.C., special interests and their lobbyists are always lurking just beneath the surface, ready to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. It's often easier to limit rivalry by using the government to regulate, rather than competing in the marketplace. And sure enough, a coalition of Big Tech giants is pushing for sweeping new rules that would turn the Federal Communications Commission into a federal Department of TV, with the power to regulate how television programs are delivered to consumers.</p><p> This is a TV show no consumer would want to watch.</p><p> This \"AllVid\" proposal would require cable, satellite and telecom TV providers to \"unbundle\" their video streams for any third-party device or app-maker to repackage. It would put the power of the FCC behind Big Tech companies laying claim to video programming that they did not create and haven't paid to license. This free riding would allow Big Tech to annex a portion of whatever screen you use for video, selling their own advertising and skimming profits from the actual creators.</p><p> Producing quality television programs is not cheap. Studios rely on the revenue from licensing agreements \u2014 and from the advertising sold against their content \u2014 to fund production. But AllVid would stripmine these shows as the tech giants claim the profits and leave little behind for everyone else.</p><p> This new rule would destroy carefully negotiated agreements on vital terms such as channel placement, advertising and anti-piracy, devaluing existing programming and drying up funds needed to produce quality new shows. The new rules would cripple programmers' ability to forge new revenue streams and create new security vulnerabilities for hackers and pirates to exploit.</p><p> And as is usually the case, consumers would bear the brunt of this regulatory overreach. No one makes a product for free. Audiences would soon see this golden age turn to rust as the torrent of high-quality shows dries up. Smaller, more diverse content producers would be the first to fall.</p><p> Re-architecting delivery networks and developing the new in-home devices required by AllVid would be enormously expensive, and these costs would inevitably drive up monthly bills. And consumers would also lose the strict consumer privacy protections that prevent cable and satellite providers from selling information about their viewing habits to third parties \u2014 protections that don't apply to the tech companies pushing AllVid.</p><p> AllVid's supporters claim that the new rules are needed to create competition for set-top boxes. But given the pace of innovation in the video device marketplace, the cable set-top box already looks to be destined for history's scrap heap. Companies such as TiVo already are competing directly with provider-supplied set-top boxes, and app-enabled streaming devices from Roku, Apple, Google and Amazon give consumers even more options \u2014 all without requiring a destructive government mandate.</p><p> This is not the first time that Big Tech has pushed the AllVid idea. Five years ago, the same coalition of special interests made the same case to the FCC, which thankfully had the foresight to reject the idea.</p><p> At the time, nearly all video subscription programming was viewed on TV screens, piped in through leased set-top boxes. Netflix didn't yet offer a streaming-only service. The first generation iPad tablet had just hit shelves.</p><p> Flash forward five years, and it's clear that the FCC's hands-off approach has worked. By rejecting AllVid five years ago and giving new business models and services a chance to evolve on their own, the FCC helped usher in the revolution in consumer video technology that we're witnessing today. With the proposal's big-money backers now demanding a do-over, the commission would be wise to once again reject this ill-advised proposal.</p><p> \u2014 David Balto served as policy director at the Federal Trade Commission and as an attorney in the Justice Department's antitrust division.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNV-4016179</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E1147E54C7789 NWBKNV2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HH6-16F1-JD6S-R221-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401961</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"820\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Greenspun Media Group (Niche Media Holdings, LLC)<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

They were worried about Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The article, published in 2005 by the Associated Press, addressed concerns that Amazon was amassing too much data about what its customers bought, thought about buying or wished others would buy for them -- not to mention credit card information.</p><p>For nearly as long as the current crop of internet giants have existed, there has been scrutiny over how much data they collect and how it's used. And yet we've only continued to hand over more and more of our personal information to these businesses as they've become more embedded in our daily lives.</p><p>Call it the grand bargain. You let a tech company eavesdrop on your searches, contacts and whereabouts. In return, the company directs you to the perfect people, products and experiences, free of charge. Or, as Amazon CTO Werner Vogels put it in the 2005 article: \"We collect as much information as possible such that we can provide you with the best feedback.\"</p><p>Now, the calculus may be changing. News broke this month that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm with ties to President Donald Trump's campaign, reportedly accessed information from about 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.</p><p>The resulting scandal has sparked a long awaited data awakening among internet users.</p><p>\"People are digging in and looking at the data that's been collected on them,\" says Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT. \"In the past, a lot of us have been willing to say we understand we are in this constant dance with commercial providers.\"</p><p>What's changed is people waking up to the fact that their data isn't just used to sell products, but also potentially to affect elections. \"It just feels different,\" Zuckerman said.</p><p>Numerous outlets have published articles in recent days detailing the vast amount of data Facebook has collected on its users. In response to a CNN article on the subject, dozens of readers wrote to the author with questions about what Facebook knows and whether the information is ever really deleted.</p><p>It's not just Facebook. This week, hundreds of thousands of people engaged with a Twitter thread from a web developer sharing the trove of information that Google collects, including web search history, location data and hobbies.</p><p>Even some experts were taken aback by what they found.</p><p>\"I had turned off YouTube history under my Google account settings. Today, I find out YouTube has been keeping my history for years anyway,\" Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist who studies the intersection of emerging technology and society, wrote on Twitter. \"I track this stuff for a living. HOW THE HECK IS AN ORDINARY PERSON SUPPOSED TO MANAGE THIS?\"</p><p/><p>Inside the tech industry, employees have long been conscious of the potential damaging impact that a data breach could have on user trust.</p><p>\"We were always paranoid about that,\" says Wesley Chan, an early product manager at Google who left the company in 2014. \"They're trusting us with their information.\"</p><p>But there is also an awareness in Silicon Valley that today's internet users face a \"Hotel California\" dilemma. They can sign out anytime they like, but they can never leave.</p><p>\"The problem is with Facebook and Google and even Apple, you're already bought into the service. What alternative do you have?\" Chan says. \"You're switching from Apple to Android or Android to Apple, but you're unfortunately locked onto one of those systems, or both.\"</p><p>Case in point: Each of these companies have faced privacy issues before, only to keep adding users and their data.</p><p>Years ago, the FTC found Facebook allowed third-party applications to access more user data than they needed to operate. Apple was criticized in 2011 for how it stored user location data. And Google was fined in 2013 for scooping up data from unknowing users while gathering mapping images for its Streetview product.</p><p>Critics say that the feeling of being locked in to these services is very much by design.</p><p>\"Google, Facebook and other companies put a lot of resources into making that the case,\" says Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that advocates for user privacy.</p><p>But Gebhart says it's not too late to change our data relationship with the big tech companies, whether it be through new company practices, more educated user choices, or regulation.</p><p>\"The surveillance-based business model that runs in most of the popular web is something that's not inevitable,\" she said. \"Right now, there is a broader opportunity to rethink and reset that.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180326facebook-data-awakening1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S04-FK81-DY60-K068-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"788\"/><timeReceived>9:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 26, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They were worried about Amazon. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The article, published in 2005 by the Associated Press, addressed concerns that Amazon was amassing too much data about what its customers bought, thought about buying or wished others would buy for them -- not to mention credit card information.</p><p>For nearly as long as the current crop of internet giants have existed, there has been scrutiny over how much data they collect and how it's used. And yet we've only continued to hand over more and more of our personal information to these businesses as they've become more embedded in our daily lives.</p><p>Call it the grand bargain. You let a tech company eavesdrop on your searches, contacts and whereabouts. In return, the company directs you to the perfect people, products and experiences, free of charge. Or, as Amazon CTO Werner Vogels put it in the 2005 article: \"We collect as much information as possible such that we can provide you with the best feedback.\"</p><p>Now, the calculus may be changing. News broke this month that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm with ties to President Donald Trump's campaign, reportedly accessed information from about 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.</p><p>The resulting scandal has sparked a long awaited data awakening among internet users.</p><p>\"People are digging in and looking at the data that's been collected on them,\" says Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT. \"In the past, a lot of us have been willing to say we understand we are in this constant dance with commercial providers.\"</p><p>What's changed is people waking up to the fact that their data isn't just used to sell products, but also potentially to affect elections. \"It just feels different,\" Zuckerman said.</p><p>Numerous outlets have published articles in recent days detailing the vast amount of data Facebook has collected on its users. In response to a CNN article on the subject, dozens of readers wrote to the author with questions about what Facebook knows and whether the information is ever really deleted.</p><p>It's not just Facebook. This week, hundreds of thousands of people engaged with a Twitter thread from a web developer sharing the trove of information that Google collects, including web search history, location data and hobbies. </p><p>Even some experts were taken aback by what they found. </p><p>\"I had turned off YouTube history under my Google account settings. Today, I find out YouTube has been keeping my history for years anyway,\" Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist who studies the intersection of emerging technology and society, wrote on Twitter. \"I track this stuff for a living. HOW THE HECK IS AN ORDINARY PERSON SUPPOSED TO MANAGE THIS?\"</p><p>Inside the tech industry, employees have long been conscious of the potential damaging impact that a data breach could have on user trust. </p><p>\"We were always paranoid about that,\" says Wesley Chan, an early product manager at Google who left the company in 2014. \"They're trusting us with their information.\"</p><p>But there is also an awareness in Silicon Valley that today's internet users face a \"Hotel California\" dilemma. They can sign out anytime they like, but they can never leave.</p><p>\"The problem is with Facebook and Google and even Apple, you're already bought into the service. What alternative do you have?\" Chan says. \"You're switching from Apple to Android or Android to Apple, but you're unfortunately locked onto one of those systems, or both.\"</p><p>Case in point: Each of these companies have faced privacy issues before, only to keep adding users and their data.</p><p>Years ago, the FTC found Facebook allowed third-party applications to access more user data than they needed to operate. Apple was criticized in 2011 for how it stored user location data. And Google was fined in 2013 for scooping up data from unknowing users while gathering mapping images for its Streetview product.</p><p>Critics say that the feeling of being locked in to these services is very much by design. </p><p>\"Google, Facebook and other companies put a lot of resources into making that the case,\" says Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that advocates for user privacy.</p><p>But Gebhart says it's not too late to change our data relationship with the big tech companies, whether it be through new company practices, more educated user choices, or regulation.</p><p>\"The surveillance-based business model that runs in most of the popular web is something that's not inevitable,\" she said. \"Right now, there is a broader opportunity to rethink and reset that.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The agency\u2019s abstract says only that it will revise the definition \u201cto increase focus on obtaining the best and the brightest foreign nationals via the H-1B program, and revise the definition of employment and employer-employee relationship to better protect U.S. workers and wages.\u201d</p><p> The new rule would also add requirements designed to make sure employers pay \u201cappropriate wages\u201d to H-1B workers, according to the abstract.</p><p> High-profile immigration law firm Fragomen said in a blog post Friday that the White House budget office has up to 90 days to review the proposed regulation, \u201cbut could take less time given the rule\u2019s importance to the Trump administration.\u201d The rule would then be published in the Federal Register, \u201cand is expected to take effect immediately or shortly after publication,\u201d Fragomen said. \u201cThe regulation is expected to be challenged in court.\u201d</p><p> Another prominent immigration law firm, Berry Appleman &amp; Leiden, said Friday in an emailed advisory that the government had indicated earlier there would be a public comment period before the rule was finalized, as is typical with federal rule-making. \u201cThe government is now expected to argue that compliance with the comment period obligations would be \u2018impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest,\u2019\u201d the firm said.</p><p> \u201cThe government may also argue that good cause exists to make the regulation effective upon publication and without the standard 30-day delayed effective date.\u201d Berry Appleman &amp; Leiden also predicted that the rule, if finalized, would end up in court.</p><p> The H-1B, used heavily by the Silicon Valley technology industry, whose major firms push for an increase to the annual 85,000 cap on new visas, has become a target for the Trump administration, which has dramatically increased denials for outsourcing, consulting and staffing companies. Critics allege that those companies, along with big tech firms employing contracted H-1B labor, use the visa to drive down wages, supplant U.S. workers and facilitate outsourcing.</p><p> Current regulations allow companies to pay H-1B workers less than the prevailing wage. The tech giants argue that the visa is an essential tool for securing the world\u2019s top talent. The staffing, consulting and outsourcing companies say they\u2019re providing needed skilled foreign labor.</p><p> Andrew Greenfield, a partner at Fragomen, said Friday in an emailed advisory that he expects the H-1B rule change to focus on placement of foreign workers at third-party sites, an employment model dominated by the staffing, consulting and outsourcing companies that have been a target for the Trump administration.</p><p> \u201cWe also expect it to address H-1B wages and a new method of allocation of H-1B cap numbers to give priority to the highest-paid beneficiaries,\u201d Greenfield said.</p><p> In various versions of the proposed rule\u2019s abstract, posted twice a year, Homeland Security has said the changes are expected to reduce H-1B fraud and abuse, ensure the visa is only given out for appropriately specialized jobs, and that it \u201csupplements the U.S. workforce and strengthens U.S. worker protections.\u201d The new rule would also enhance effective management and monitoring of the program, the agency has said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SWTREC-6325218</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SWTREC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SV-KW11-DXVP-V4KJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"653\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Stephens Media Group, LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The FTC announced the fine alongside a sweeping set of regulations being imposed on the company. The regulations are aimed at protecting user data in response to repeated mishandling of user data by Facebook. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] It's official \u2014 Facebook was hit with a$5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission[4] due to mishandling of user data. The fine is a record for the FTC \u2014 a move seemingly intended to set a precedent for the kind of punishment that tech giants could receive for mishandling their users' data \u2014 and is a direct response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data from over 50 million Facebook users was obtained without permission by a political data analytics firm. The data was then used by Cambridge Analytica to target American voters in the 2016 US Presidential election. More than just a record-setting fine, the FTC is also imposing a set of regulations on Facebook aimed at protecting user data. Here's the full list: 1. \"Facebook must exercise greater oversight over third-party apps, including by terminating app developers that fail to certify that they are in compliance with Facebook's platform policies or fail to justify their need for specific user data.\" Pablo Martinez Monsivais/APThe first regulation on the list directly address the root of the FTC's complaints: That a third-party company was able to access a massive amount of user data through Facebook without the social media giant stepping in to stop them. In this particular case, the third-party in question was Cambridge Analytica, and the data taken was from over 50 million Facebook users.2. \"Facebook is prohibited from using telephone numbers obtained to enable a security feature (e.g., two-factor authentication) for advertising.\" ComparablyThe second regulation directly concerns users inputting their personal phone number into Facebook for so-called \"two-factor\" authentication. This type of security requires users to receive either a text message or phone call with a unique numerical code before they're allowed to access their Facebook account. That phone number is being explicitly given for a security reason, and thus Facebook is being required to not use this data for financial gain (such as advertising).3. \"Facebook must provide clear and conspicuous notice of its use of facial recognition technology, and obtain affirmative express user consent prior to any use that materially exceeds its prior disclosures to users.\" AppleThe third regulation pertains specifically to Facebook's ability to recognize faces from photos uploaded to the social media network, and forces Facebook to alert users when facial recognition software is being used.See the rest of the story at Business Insider[5] See Also: Facebook's scandals aren't enough for people to stop using it.

Visit Business insider's homepage for more stories[1]. A longtime Amazon engineer and VP says he resigned \"in dismay\" over Amazon's firing of whistleblowers who raised concerns about warehouse employees scared of contracting COVID-19. Writing on his personal blog[2], Tim Bray said remaining in his job \"would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised.\" His last day at the company was May 1. He wrote: \"I quit in dismay at Amazon firing whistleblowers who were making noise about warehouse employees frightened of COVID-19. \"What with big-tech salaries and share vestings, this will probably cost me over a million (pre-tax) dollars, not to mention the best job I've ever had, working with awfully good people. So I'm pretty blue.\" The tech giant has fired multiple employees who have criticized working conditions at its warehouses[3]. User-experience designer Emily Cunningham and another designer, Maren Costa - two of the most active advocates of Amazon's warehouse staff - told The Washington Post they were relieved of their duties, while a third employee, Chris Hayes, was asked not to come back to work. The Post happens to be owned by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. In his blog post, Bray says Cunningham and Costa were \"fired on the spot.\" Bray had worked at Amazon since December 2014, according to his LinkedIn profile, having previously spent four years at Google. Bray is known as an outspoken software developer, having previously taken public potshots[4] at Apple over the iPhone's closed ecosystem. Emily Cunningham publicly thanked Bray for his stance in a tweet[5]. She wrote: \"Amazon VP @timbray resigns over #covid firings of me, @marencosta, and others. Says Amazon \"firing whistleblowers\" is \"evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink that poison.\"Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1257208574788243457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Amazon VP, @timbray[6] resigns over #covid[7] firings of me, @marencosta[8] and others. ;Says Amazon \"firing whistleblowers\" is \"evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture.

And with the U.K. set to hold a crucial parliamentary election on Dec. 12, it still is not clear whether, when and how Brexit will happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But assuming the U.K. does leave the EU, its next government will need to begin the long, difficult process of negotiating new relationships with the rest of the world. That will involve tough choices, one of the thorniest of which is whether the U.K. should align its regulations in key economic sectors with those of the EU or the United States. Where, then, is Britain headed?</p><p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the U.K. to reach a trade and investment agreement with the U.S. after Brexit. After all, America is the U.K.'s largest single-country trade partner and its biggest source (and destination) of foreign direct investment.</p><p>In seeking such a deal, however, the U.K. would have to decide how far it is willing to realign its regulatory regimes with those of the U.S. (as American firms and investors want). Closer alignment with the U.S. would create new barriers to trade with the EU, which is a much larger market for U.K. exports. Moreover, the prospect of adopting U.S. standards - on drug pricing, the environment, food standards and animal welfare, for example - is already creating a public backlash in Britain.</p><p>As the U.K. prepares for life after Brexit, regulatory tensions with the U.S. and EU could potentially flare up in two other important sectors.</p><p>The first is banking and finance. In 2018, the U.K.'s financial services sector contributed 132 billion pounds ($170 billion) to the economy, or 6.9 percent of total output, provided 1.1 million jobs (3.1 percent of the total), and paid some 29 billion pounds in tax (in the 2017-18 U.K. tax year). The sector also generated 60 billion pounds worth of exports in 2017 (against 15 billion pounds in imports).</p><p>But the financial services sector poses huge risks if it is not adequately regulated. The 2007-08 financial crisis reduced U.K. national output by 7 percent, wiped out 1 million jobs, caused wages to fall by 5 percent below 2007 levels, and brought bank lending to a halt. All parts of the U.K. (and much of the rest of the world) felt the catastrophic impact. After the crisis, an independent commission made a clear case for regulatory reform to protect the British public (and the public purse) from reckless bank lending. Policymakers in the EU and the U.S. also accepted the need for robust regulation.</p><p>Today, however, America and Europe are pursuing sharply divergent approaches. EU regulators continue to strengthen prudential rules and capital requirements (especially for very large banks), and are widening the ambit of regulation to cover every asset and profession in the financial services industry.</p><p>The U.S., by contrast, has reversed course under President Donald Trump, whose administration has set about undoing core elements of the regulations implemented after the financial crisis. The U.S. government's agenda now includes lowering capital requirements, weakening stress testing and \"living wills\" for banks, and allowing more proprietary trading and unregulated derivatives dealing. It is also intent on rolling back consumer and investor protections, reducing prudential regulation of systemically significant banks, undermining the regulation of nonbanks and the shadow banking system, reducing funding for research and monitoring of the financial industry, and taking a hands-off approach to enforcing securities laws.</p><p>Some investors would benefit hugely from U.S.-style financial deregulation in the U.K., and will continue to push for it. But their quest for profits over systemic safety would jeopardize the hard-won regulatory measures that currently protect the U.K. public from a repeat of the 2007-08 crisis. It would also damage the City of London's place at the heart of European finance.</p><p>To date, the U.K. has taken a robust approach to financial regulation and implemented measures that go beyond those introduced by EU regulators. These include a new regime aimed at holding senior bankers accountable for their decisions, and ring-fencing large banks' retail operations to protect customers' deposits from shocks to the wider financial system. And because the U.K. public broadly supports these measures, the post-Brexit government will presumably be hesitant to weaken them.</p><p>The second challenge for the U.K. after Brexit will be handling the big U.S. technology companies. Earlier this year, a U.K. Parliament report found that Facebook \"intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws.\" Yet the size and global reach of the big tech firms make it hard for any non-U.S. government to regulate or influence them.</p><p>Instead, the EU has led the way in enshrining citizens' rights to data privacy, through its General Data Protection Regulation. Furthermore, the European Commission has adopted a stance strongly in favor of protecting competition and limiting the digital giants' market dominance. In March, the commission fined Google 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) for blocking rivals in the online advertising market - the third time it has penalized the company for antitrust violations.</p><p>The U.S. government, however, strongly supports the free movement of data (which the big American tech companies want), while Trump has previously been quick to criticize the commission for fining Google.</p><p>The U.K. relies heavily on the big global tech firms, all of which are American or Chinese, and must therefore try to regulate them. Once it leaves the EU, it will face a choice between giving in to U.S. pressure or finding a way to mirror EU regulation (including the GDPR and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework).</p><p>Brexiteers claim that the U.K. can create its own \"global strategy\" and do things \"Britain's way\" after it leaves the EU. In 2016, for example, then-premier Theresa May said that after Brexit, the U.K. would rely upon its \"steadfast allies\" to establish an alternative to the EU's Galileo satellite navigation system.</p><p>Three years later, however, with Trump in the White House and the U.K. in a much weaker negotiating position with the EU, it is not clear who these steadfast allies are. And even harder choices await the government that emerges after Dec. 12.</p><p>Ngaire Woods is dean of the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford.

And with the U.K. set to hold a crucial parliamentary election on Dec. 12, it still is not clear whether, when and how Brexit will happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But assuming the U.K. does leave the EU, its next government will need to begin the long, difficult process of negotiating new relationships with the rest of the world. That will involve tough choices, one of the thorniest of which is whether the U.K. should align its regulations in key economic sectors with those of the EU or the United States. Where, then, is Britain headed?</p><p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the U.K. to reach a trade and investment agreement with the U.S. after Brexit. After all, America is the U.K.'s largest single-country trade partner and its biggest source (and destination) of foreign direct investment.</p><p>In seeking such a deal, however, the U.K. would have to decide how far it is willing to realign its regulatory regimes with those of the U.S. (as American firms and investors want). Closer alignment with the U.S. would create new barriers to trade with the EU, which is a much larger market for U.K. exports. Moreover, the prospect of adopting U.S. standards - on drug pricing, the environment, food standards and animal welfare, for example - is already creating a public backlash in Britain.</p><p>As the U.K. prepares for life after Brexit, regulatory tensions with the U.S. and EU could potentially flare up in two other important sectors.</p><p>The first is banking and finance. In 2018, the U.K.'s financial services sector contributed 132 billion pounds ($170 billion) to the economy, or 6.9 percent of total output, provided 1.1 million jobs (3.1 percent of the total), and paid some 29 billion pounds in tax (in the 2017-18 U.K. tax year). The sector also generated 60 billion pounds worth of exports in 2017 (against 15 billion pounds in imports).</p><p>But the financial services sector poses huge risks if it is not adequately regulated. The 2007-08 financial crisis reduced U.K. national output by 7 percent, wiped out 1 million jobs, caused wages to fall by 5 percent below 2007 levels, and brought bank lending to a halt. All parts of the U.K. (and much of the rest of the world) felt the catastrophic impact. After the crisis, an independent commission made a clear case for regulatory reform to protect the British public (and the public purse) from reckless bank lending. Policymakers in the EU and the U.S. also accepted the need for robust regulation.</p><p>Today, however, America and Europe are pursuing sharply divergent approaches. EU regulators continue to strengthen prudential rules and capital requirements (especially for very large banks), and are widening the ambit of regulation to cover every asset and profession in the financial services industry.</p><p>The U.S., by contrast, has reversed course under President Donald Trump, whose administration has set about undoing core elements of the regulations implemented after the financial crisis. The U.S. government's agenda now includes lowering capital requirements, weakening stress testing and \"living wills\" for banks, and allowing more proprietary trading and unregulated derivatives dealing. It is also intent on rolling back consumer and investor protections, reducing prudential regulation of systemically significant banks, undermining the regulation of nonbanks and the shadow banking system, reducing funding for research and monitoring of the financial industry, and taking a hands-off approach to enforcing securities laws.</p><p>Some investors would benefit hugely from U.S.-style financial deregulation in the U.K., and will continue to push for it. But their quest for profits over systemic safety would jeopardize the hard-won regulatory measures that currently protect the U.K. public from a repeat of the 2007-08 crisis. It would also damage the City of London's place at the heart of European finance.</p><p>To date, the U.K. has taken a robust approach to financial regulation and implemented measures that go beyond those introduced by EU regulators. These include a new regime aimed at holding senior bankers accountable for their decisions, and ring-fencing large banks' retail operations to protect customers' deposits from shocks to the wider financial system. And because the U.K. public broadly supports these measures, the post-Brexit government will presumably be hesitant to weaken them.</p><p>The second challenge for the U.K. after Brexit will be handling the big U.S. technology companies. Earlier this year, a U.K. Parliament report found that Facebook \"intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws.\" Yet the size and global reach of the big tech firms make it hard for any non-U.S. government to regulate or influence them.</p><p>Instead, the EU has led the way in enshrining citizens' rights to data privacy, through its General Data Protection Regulation. Furthermore, the European Commission has adopted a stance strongly in favor of protecting competition and limiting the digital giants' market dominance. In March, the commission fined Google 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) for blocking rivals in the online advertising market - the third time it has penalized the company for antitrust violations.</p><p>The U.S. government, however, strongly supports the free movement of data (which the big American tech companies want), while Trump has previously been quick to criticize the commission for fining Google.</p><p>The U.K. relies heavily on the big global tech firms, all of which are American or Chinese, and must therefore try to regulate them. Once it leaves the EU, it will face a choice between giving in to U.S. pressure or finding a way to mirror EU regulation (including the GDPR and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework).</p><p>Brexiteers claim that the U.K. can create its own \"global strategy\" and do things \"Britain's way\" after it leaves the EU. In 2016, for example, then-premier Theresa May said that after Brexit, the U.K. would rely upon its \"steadfast allies\" to establish an alternative to the EU's Galileo satellite navigation system.</p><p>Three years later, however, with Trump in the White House and the U.K. in a much weaker negotiating position with the EU, it is not clear who these steadfast allies are. And even harder choices await the government that emerges after Dec. 12.</p><p>Ngaire Woods is dean of the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford.

But it was like a sharpshooter aiming for the broad sign of a barn: Yes, the bullets all hit, but who cares? Who can\u2019t hit the broad side of a barn?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Much more fun was the Pied Piper office politics subplot in which Monica (Amanda Crew) and Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) band together to overthrow the HR lady\u2019s annoying scoring system for managers\u2019 people skills. The two characters\u2019 chemistry recalled their bonding over good whisky and skepticism in last season\u2019s finale. As in that episode, a little bit of sparring turns into a respectful and mutually productive alliance. In this case, they bond over their shared misanthropy.</p><p> It\u2019s interesting, because Gilfoyle\u2019s misanthrophy is expected; he\u2019s the stereotypical arrogant programmer who respects machines more than people.</p><p> CFO Monica, who came up in venture capital, generally hides it more under a veneer of business manners and business casual \u2014 but like Gilfoyle, she has no interest in making nice. And she has no idea how to do it anyway. Her attempts to bond with Pied Piper\u2019s workers range from awkward small talk to wearing Princess Leia side buns, and none of it works.</p><p> In a neat twist, it\u2019s actually Gilfoyle who is savvy enough to make connections when he deems it necessary. Even if he calls it \u201csocial engineering.\u201d</p><p> Do you also hate employee \u201cpulse surveys\u201d? Then you will feel pretty satisfied at Monica\u2019s and Gilfoyle\u2019s victory cup clink.</p><p> \u2018Tethics\u2019</p><p> In a bid for relevance, ousted Hooli chief Gavin Belson (Matt Ross) has turned into a tech ethics evangelist, asking companies to sign a high-flown but toothless ethics pledge that\u2019s one big list of platitudes (plagiarized from a host of companies from Starbucks to Applebee\u2019s.) His brand name for it is cringe-inducing: \u201ctethics.\u201d He\u2019s ready to break ground on an institute and everything.</p><p> Now Gavin is a world-class egomaniac and hypocrite who has never felt an ethical qualm in his life. Pied Piper founder Richard (Thomas Middle-ditch), who tries hard to live up to his own ideals, is floored that the Valley seems to be taking Gavin seriously. People at his own company are wearing tethics T-shirts. It makes him furious, which makes him stupid.</p><p> He should put his ire aside and sign the pledge. It\u2019s all stuff he actually believes. He\u2019s getting ready to make a massive deal to partner with AT&amp;T, and when he makes trouble publicly, the AT&amp;T lawyer reads him the riot act:</p><p> \u201cLoudmouths like you got up in front of Congress and whined about how someone needed to do something about big tech. And now Gavin has managed to paint himself as that guy. And we all have to fall in line or we\u2019ll be in PR hell. Or worse, we\u2019ll face government regulation. \u2026 It\u2019s totally toothless. Do not f*** this all up over a pointless moral stand.\u201d</p><p> One disappointing thing about this show is that the characters rarely learn from previous mistakes. I mean, I get it that stock characters are what comedies are made of, but at some point it becomes grating to watch people go through one extreme situation after another because they refuse to wise up.</p><p> Repeating mistakes</p><p> So, despite promising to sign the tethics pledge, Richard can\u2019t leave well enough alone. After ferreting out the plagiarism, he thinks he will gain the upper hand by using Gavin\u2019s sins against him. But that backfired with game developer Colin a few episodes ago, and of course it does here, because Gavin is a spite ninja par excellence. Spite is actually his superpower. Next thing you know, Gavin has publicly confessed his hypocrisy \u2026 and asked for an investigation from the state attorney general into the many misdeeds of Hooli. Which, of course, now belongs to Pied Piper. The pure,</p><p> devastating elegance of Gavin\u2019s spitefulness has Richard\u2019s attorney in awe. \u201cYou gotta separate the artist from the art,\u201d he says admiringly.</p><p> After his confession, the injunction comes down, the massively promising deal with AT&amp;T is on the rocks and once again the company could just die.</p><p> Friends in low places</p><p> Enter Russ Hanneman, the flamboyant and foul-mouthed billionaire who returns after a few seasons of absence, brilliantly brought to life by actor Chris Diamantopoulos. He wants to put on \u201cRussFest\u201d in the Nevada desert.</p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be like Burning Man, except I\u2019ll make a (expletive) of money,\u201d he says. His Mad Max-like promotional video shows him riding a motorcycle and blowing up hot women in trucks labeled \u201cfamine,\u201d \u201cracism\u201d and the like. Is RussFest going to be another Fyre Festival? I will be shocked if it\u2019s not.</p><p> He wants Pied Piper to provide internet for his desert orgy, and he\u2019s imposing a highly unethical deal. He\u2019ll blackmail the attorney general into lifting the injunction. And Richard is out of options. So, tethics be damned?</p><p> Other notes:</p><p> \u2022 Best line of the episode: \u201cTracy, I appreciate you wanting to participate in the world of numbers,\u201d Gilfoyle tells the head of HR. \u201cI find it endearing.

A former federal prosecutor says the circumstances leading to the deadly violence at a white nationalist rally were fueled by a series of failures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANTHONY MASON: The independent report commissioned by the city found fault in preparation, communications, even the coordination between city and state police. Here`s Kris Van Cleave.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(Begin VT)</p><p>WOMAN: You`re presenting your report as if you were there. I was there. I know what took place.</p><p>KRIS VAN CLEAVE (CBS News Correspondent): Tempers flared months after the violence played out on the streets of Charlottesville. An independent investigation found the police plan for the Unite The Right protest was \"flawed.\" There was a \".stunning and obvious failure in preparation.\" And communication was so poor, \".the right hand didn`t know what the left hand was doing.\"</p><p>(Crowd protesting)</p><p>KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Commanders failed to use tactics that could have kept marchers and counter-demonstrators separated.</p><p>TIM HEAPHY: They didn`t protect public safety.</p><p>KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Tim Heaphy is a former U.S. attorney.</p><p>TIM HEAPHY: A lot of them had never even tried on the ballistic helmet or used the shield that they were given for that day.</p><p>KRIS VAN CLEAVE: The report says officers \".failed to stand up to protect human life\" because some were told to stay behind barricades while others were ordered to break up only the most serious physical altercations and available SWAT Teams weren`t used.</p><p>(Crowd protesting)</p><p>KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Police also dismissed suggestions to block intersections with barriers or dump trucks that could have prevented James Fields from driving through this crowd of people, killing Heather Heyer and injuring nineteen others. The lone officer assigned to that intersection was pulled as violence began and commanders were unaware the area was left unstaffed. Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas:</p><p>AL THOMAS: It`s not a time for finger-pointing. It`s a time to come together. I am committed to implementing the recommendations in this report.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>KRIS VAN CLEAVE: The report also found the city received bad legal advice and as a result did not ban things like clubs, sticks, and shields from the protest. White supremacist Jason Kessler claims the report shows organizers had peaceful aims. He wants a federal civil rights investigation of the city and police. Anthony.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Kris Van Cleave, thanks.</p><p>2017 has been an incredible year of major and astonishing news events. Coming up, one publication`s take on the key players and the turning points that shaped life and culture.</p><p>But first, here`s a look at the weather for your weekend.</p><p>(LOCAL WEATHER BREAK)</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: While Congress grapples with overhauling the nation`s tax code, another branch of government will address several issues that could alter the nation for many years to come from the right to deny service to same-sex couples to the privacy of our cell phone records. We`ll see what`s coming up before the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>You`re watching CBS THIS MORNING: SATURDAY.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: The U.S. Supreme Court is two months into its current term and in the coming months will take up potential landmark cases, including one that could determine how we draw up congressional districts. Two other cases before the court could also have major implications.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: One involves government access to our cell phone records. The other looks at whether business owners can refuse to accommodate same-sex couples due to religious objections. To break it all down, we are joined by CBS News justice reporter Paula Reid. Paula, good morning.</p><p>PAULA REID (CBS News Justice Reporter): Good morning.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Let`s start first with the cell phone records. What`s on tap in terms of that case?</p><p>PAULA REID: So this case comes amid this larger national conversation about how much access law enforcement can get to our digital records. There is no doubt there is more information about me on this cell phone than there is in my entire home. So in this case, law enforcement was investigating a string of armed robberies.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Mm-Hm.</p><p>PAULA REID: And as part of this without a warrant they were able to get cell phone location data. That`s-- that`s when your cell phone pings to a tower. And for the suspect who got all the way to the Supreme Court, he was convicted partially on this data. They had almost thirteen thousand points of location data for him and he`s sued saying they shouldn`t have been able to get this without a warrant.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Hmm.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: So this case involves the Fourth Amendment which was literally written centuries ago, but now is implied-- being applied to new technology. How difficult is it to interpret this?</p><p>PAULA REID: Well, there is a longstanding principle that once you give your information or your data over to a third party that it`s fair game for law enforcement.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Mm-Hm.</p><p>PAULA REID: But again let`s look at our phones, think of how much information--</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.</p><p>PAULA REID: --you almost have to hand over to a third party if you want a cell phone. Now there are some laws on the books that speak this to, but they`re from the mid-eighties.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.</p><p>PAULA REID: Think about-- think about what technology was like at that time.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Yeah.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.</p><p>PAULA REID: They really just don`t apply. So the justices know that they are in a spot here. They need-- need to clarify this so law enforcement can do their job, but they absolutely seem open in all argument. They`re perhaps curtailing this a little bit.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Hmm. Another case that`s heard next week involves a Colorado cake shop could have very significant implications for same-sex couples. Tell us about it?</p><p>PAULA REID: Absolutely. The only thing more stressful, I guess, than the law enforcement and technology right now is-- is wedding planning. And in this case-- I`m still here right now. In this case, you had a Christian business owner, Jack Phillips. He-- he is a Christian businessman and he employs a lot of his Christian principles in his business. For example, he`s not open on Sundays. He has refused to make cakes that involve alcohol or for Halloween or that celebrate divorce. So, of course, a same-sex couple came to his bake shop and wanted a cake and he refused. They sued, arguing that Colorado`s anti-discrimination laws does not allow-- do not allow him to refuse to bake this cake, but he has actually challenged that on First Amendment grounds.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Mm-Hm.</p><p>PAULA REID: And that`s what so interesting is he`s not arguing about religious freedom or anything like that. He`s saying the state cannot compel me--</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.</p><p>PAULA REID: --to create a message that I disagree with.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Huh.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: What are the implications here potentially for businesses?</p><p>PAULA REID: Well, the sweeping implications. There are some concerns that now anyone who`s in a quote, unquote, \"Artistic business\" so that would be in terms of marriage, florists or hair salons, tailors, perhaps--</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Mm-Hm.</p><p>PAULA REID: --calligraphers as well that they could now refuse to provide services. And while some people say, \"Oh, look, this is just a pretextual argument,\" it`s a pretty good one. And there was-- there`s a hunt for a while after the Supreme Court decided that same-sex marriage is marriage. There`s a hunt for cases that could get back up to the Supreme Court to really try to carve out some exceptions just like what they`re seeking here.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Interesting. Well, not at the Supreme Court level, Paula, you`ve been reporting on a Department of Justice investigation that involves prominent Ivy League University and affirmative action policies.</p><p>PAULA REID: That`s right. I mean, this could potentially go back to the Supreme Court. And I think that`s part of the idea. The President himself has said perhaps it is time for affirmative action to be revisited. Do we still need it?</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Hmm.</p><p>PAULA REID: So under that umbrella, the Justice Department is currently investigating Harvard University for possibly discriminating against Asian students in its affirmative action policies. Now, Harvard has declined to provide the Justice Department with everything it wants in this investigation.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Hmm.</p><p>PAULA REID: Just late last night, I spoke with Harvard. They said that they have complied, they have given the Justice Department everything they want, but so far we`ve seen in this case that compliance, having a little trouble agreeing on what exactly--</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: That is--</p><p>PAULA REID: --what exactly that means. So we`ll see on Monday whether or not the Justice Department sues them or if the two sides will continue to proceed with this investigation, but it is unprecedented. It`s unusual for the Justice Department to investigate systemic discrimination at the university and this also happens amid a time when the Justice Department`s civil rights division is rolling back.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: And this is political appointees at the Justice Department that are leading this investigation, right?</p><p>PAULA REID: Yes. It`s-- the civil rights division at the Justice Department and we tried to ask the attorney general about this earlier this week. And as I`m sure you`ve seen on CBS THIS MORNING and EVENING NEWS, those questions were-- were shut down, which is something I`ve never seen before at a press conference.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Intrepid Paula Reid. Thanks for-- as always, Paula.</p><p>They`ve had an outsized influence on the world we live in. Up next, one news organization pulled it`s thousands of journalists to come up with the people who have most defined the year 2017. We will run down the list coming up next.</p><p>You`re watching CBS THIS MORNING: SATURDAY.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: It is an understatement to say that a lot has happened in the past year, but who are the transformative figures who have impacted and shaped 2017?</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: That`s a question Bloomberg Businessweek sought to answer in a new special issue out now. A large group of Bloomberg journalists put their heads together to come up with the first annual Bloomberg 50. Some of the figures are in the news right now, such as Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Others are household names, such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: The list includes entertainment figures like Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins and those noted for their humanitarian work, including Nobel Peace Prize recipient Beatrice Fihn. To break down other names on the list, we welcome Bret Begun, an editor of Bloomberg Businessweek who helped to compile the list. Bret, thanks for joining us.</p><p>BRET BEGUN (Bloomberg Businessweek): Yes. You`re welcome.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Let`s start with a man who is on many lists, but that does not diminish his reason for being on this list, Jeff Bezos.</p><p>BRET BEGUN: Yeah, Jeff Bezos. It`s hard to argue that he didn`t have a massive year. On June sixteenth of this year, decides to drop 13.7 billion dollars on Whole Foods. Really, what he did in doing that is essentially signal to the world that he doesn`t want Amazon just to be the biggest online retailer in the world but the biggest retailer in the world.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Right.</p><p>BRET BEGUN: And within hours of that announcement, the Walmarts or the world Costco`s, the Kroger`s lost a combine thirty billion dollars.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Wow.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Wow. Speaking of Amazon, another name on the list helped develop Amazon`s Alexa technology. Tell us about Geoffrey Hinton?</p><p>BRET BEGUN: Yeah, Geoffrey Hinton is really a fascinating guy. He`s considered the godfather of AI. In many ways he invented something that is called the neural net. And if you used Amazon Alexa, if you`ve watched as Facebook identified your friends` photos--</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Mm-Hm.</p><p>BRET BEGUN: --and more people use autopilot on Tesla.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.</p><p>BRET BEGUN: That`s actually all goes back to research he did and Canada this year opened up a nearly two-hundred-million-dollar institute to be able to keep him there and other AI-- AI experts in Canada.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: And when Hinton started that research, he was kind of dismissed. This isn`t going to go anywhere, right?</p><p>BRET BEGUN: Right. This is the mid-seventies, late seventies. And people had sort of said, \"You know what, neural nets are, they`re kind of done. There`s really not much of a future here.\" And then this thing called the internet came along and it turned out that you could actually program these neural nets with a ton more information.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Yep.</p><p>BRET BEGUN: And lo and behold, all of the big tech firms decided, \"Hey, we need more Geoffrey Hintons out there.\"</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Well, we do. Okay. Well, another person that readers may not be familiar with, Diane Greene.</p><p>BRET BEGUN: Mm-Hm.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: What has her contribution been?</p><p>BRET BEGUN: Right. Diane Greene is Google`s Cloud chief and Google`s Cloud business grew about eighty percent year over year. And while Google only has a very small portion of the Cloud business, Amazon really is the giant. She said this year that she expects Google`s Cloud business to overtake Amazons by 2022.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Wow.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: There`s an entity that made the list, but it`s not a specific person. Russian botnets. Tell us about their-- their achievements?</p><p>BRET BEGUN: Yeah. We had-- we had fun with this one. So if you recall about a year ago right after President Trump was elected, Mark Zuckerberg came out and said that it was a crazy idea that there had been any sort of fake news influencing the election.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Mm-Hm.</p><p>BRET BEGUN: Well, a year later, what we learned in congressional testimony is that there actually were a hundred and twenty-six million people that saw some form of fake news connected to Russian botnet. So they obviously had a huge influence and we`re still trying to actually figure out exactly what that influence is.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Bret, there are administration officials on the list, but maybe not ones you thought would be on the list.</p><p>BRET BEGUN: Right.</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator, is one of them. Why?</p><p>BRET BEGUN: Right. So as we`ve been having these discussions all year about what accomplishments does the Trump administration have, quietly over at the EPA Scott Pruitt has basically been dismantling Obama-era regulations. What we saw happen this year is really that this is a man who spent his entire career sort of fighting the EPA from the outside and now he`s on the inside and really trying to repeal a lot of what came to fruition over the last administration.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: All right. It`s a--</p><p>ALEX WAGNER: Big changes over there.</p><p>BRET BEGUN: Yeah.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: It`s a fascinating list, the Bloomberg 50. Bret Begun, thanks so much for being with us this morning.</p><p>BRET BEGUN: Yeah.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Long before digital special effects, epic movies required incredibly elaborate sets. Now one of the greatest from the early days of Hollywood is emerging from its sandy tomb.

But the former vice president also supports revoking the law, putting him at odds with the broader tech industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the Obama administration was known as being tech-friendly, Biden appears ready to break with that precedent. In addition to revoking the liability shield, he has signaled an openness to policy reforms on other hot-button tech issues, calling for stronger privacy standards, increased investment in rural broadband and a look at whether large online platforms should be broken up.</p><p>Section 230</p><p>Among other provisions, Trump's May 28 executive order seeks a petition to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to review and clarify certain legal protections provided under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a landmark piece of legislation that protects internet platforms from civil and criminal liability for content created and posted by users.</p><p>The action came after Twitter Inc. posted fact-check disclaimers on two of Trump's tweets on May 26. The disclaimers said the tweets' claims that mail-in voting will lead to voter fraud were unsubstantiated.</p><p>Derek Slater, global director of information policy for Alphabet Inc.'s Google LLC has previously said the Section 230 law is \"part of the reason we [the U.S.] have been a leader in economic growth and innovation and technological development.\"</p><p>In response to the executive order, Bill Russo, a spokesperson for Biden's campaign, reportedly said in a statement that \"it will not be the position of any future Biden Administration   that the First Amendment means private companies must provide a venue for, and amplification of, the President's falsehoods, lest they become the subject of coordinated retaliation by the federal government.\"</p><p>Despite this reported opposition to the order itself, Biden told The New York Times in 2019 that Section 230 should be \"revoked, immediately.\"</p><p>Biden's campaign maintains the former vice president still supports revoking the law and that Biden would seek to propose legislation to \"hold social media companies accountable for knowingly platforming falsehoods,\" Vox Media's The Verge reported May 29.</p><p>Biden's campaign did not respond to multiple requests to confirm his position on the executive order and the law.</p><p>Privacy</p><p>On the issue of privacy, Biden has said the U.S. should be \"setting standards not unlike the Europeans are doing relative to privacy.\"</p><p>In 2016, the European Union adopted a landmark privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation. Among other provisions, the GDPR requires companies to receive unambiguous consent from a user before collecting or processing the user's personal data, and it instructs companies to alert users of certain types of data breaches within 72 hours of learning of the occurrence. Companies found in noncompliance can face steep fines.</p><p>Expanding access to broadband</p><p>As part of an infrastructure plan on his campaign site, Biden has a stated goal to bring broadband to every American household.</p><p>The policy plan says that, as president, he will invest $20 billion in rural broadband infrastructure and triple funding to expand broadband access in rural areas.</p><p>The campaign also writes that Biden will direct the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a division of the U.S. Commerce Department that advises the president on telecommunications policy issues, to work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to \"support cities and towns that want to build municipally-owned broadband networks.\"</p><p>Municipal broadband has been seen as controversial by some because the practice involves government entities becoming part of a commercial marketplace.</p><p>Supporters of the service believe local governments should be able to offer broadband services that meet community needs and boost economic development, according to a 2016 report from the U.S. Congressional Research Service. However, opponents believe that municipally owned broadband networks are unfair competition for private sector businesses.</p><p>Biden would also like to work with the FCC to reform its Lifeline program, which provides a discount on wireline and wireless services for certain Americans with low incomes, by increasing the number of participating broadband providers and reducing fraud and abuse, according to his campaign website.</p><p>Among other provisions, the former vice president also supports passage of the Digital Equity Act, a Democratic-backed bill that would require NTIA to establish grant programs to support digital inclusion activities and other programs.</p><p>Breaking up big tech</p><p>Many large technology platforms are facing antitrust scrutiny at the federal and state level. The U.S. Department of Justice is preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against Google as early as this summer, with state attorneys general likely to file a similar case in the fall, The Wall Street Journal reported in May.</p><p>In 2019, Biden told The Associated Press that dismantling large technology companies, such as Facebook Inc., should be looked at but said it was \"premature\" to make a final judgment on the matter.</p><p>In the same interview, Biden also praised a plan from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., that called for appointing regulators committed to unwinding previously approved \"illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers.\"</p><p>Specifically, Biden said Warren \"has a very strong case to be made\" for cracking down on tech giants, according to The Associated Press.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-58906867</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603C-M641-F19Y-C05K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although broader issues like healthcare and immigration have dominated the Democratic debates, big tech platforms have also come under the microscope in the wake of high-profile data breaches and antitrust investigations. Though the top two Democratic candidates broadly align on key tech policy issues such as breaking up big tech, enhancing data privacy protections and reforming big tech's liability shield, key distinctions separate their approaches to these issues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also helping to shape the conversation around big tech is the other Democratic presidential hopeful, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who sits as a distant third in delegates after Super Tuesday's voting.</p><p>Breaking up big tech</p><p>Bipartisan sentiment has been growing in Congress that large tech companies have too much power.</p><p>Sanders has specifically said Facebook Inc. needs to be broken up.</p><p>Furthermore, Sanders told Vox in December 2019 that as president, he would \"reinvigorate the [U.S. Federal Trade Commission] and appoint an attorney general who will aggressively investigate and break up these tech giants and other conglomerates that have monopolized nearly every sector of our economy.\"</p><p>On his campaign website, Sanders pledges to direct the FTC to thoroughly review all mergers and acquisitions since President Donald Trump took office and undo \"those that have created highly concentrated markets, demonstrably caused harm to workers, raised prices, or reduced competition.\"</p><p>Additionally, Sanders claims on his campaign website that as president he would use existing antitrust authority to break up internet service provider and cable monopolies.</p><p>Biden is less ambitious. In 2019, Biden told The Associated Press that dismantling large technology companies should be looked at but said it was \"premature\" to make a final judgment on the matter.</p><p>Warren has possibly the most ambitious plan of any of the candidates.</p><p>One element of her proposal would appoint regulators to unwind previously approved \"illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers.\" The plan specifically targets Facebook's purchase of apps Instagram LLC and WhatsApp Inc.; Amazon.com Inc.'s acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc. and Zappos.com Inc.; and Google LLC's purchases of DoubleClick Inc., an internet advertising services company, Waze Inc. a navigation software app, and Nest Labs Inc., a manufacturer of smart home products.</p><p>Reforming Section 230</p><p>Another hot-button tech issue in recent years has been whether a law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, needs to be reformed. The law generally protects internet platforms from being held legally responsible for what users say and do on their sites.</p><p>Members of both parties, and U.S. Attorney General William Barr, have recently called the liability shield for big tech into question.</p><p>Biden has directly criticized the law, telling The New York Times in 2019 that it \"immediately should be revoked.\" In particular, he said Facebook and other platforms should not be allowed to propagate falsehoods without risk of penalty.</p><p>Sanders was less critical of Section 230 specifically, but told Vox in 2019 that large tech platforms \"should not be shielded from responsibility when they knowingly allow content on their platforms that promotes and facilitates violence.\" He added that he intends to work with experts and advocates to \"ensure that these large, profitable corporations are held responsible when dangerous activity occurs on their watch, while protecting the fundamental right of free speech in this country.\"</p><p>Warren said on her campaign site that as president, she will \"push for new laws that impose tough civil and criminal penalties for knowingly disseminating   [digital disinformation]\" about the voting process in U.S. elections.</p><p>Encryption</p><p>Tech companies have recently clashed with lawmakers and law enforcement over providing access to encrypted devices and communications.</p><p>Some industry executives have said there is no way to weaken encryption without also making data more vulnerable to criminal hacking.</p><p>However, Barr has encouraged Facebook not to implement end-to-end encryption across messaging services without ensuring a way for communications content to be lawfully accessed.</p><p>Sanders told Vox that he firmly opposes \"the Trump administration's efforts to compel firms to create so-called 'backdoors' to encrypted technologies.\"</p><p>However, he also said that due process should be respected in cases where encrypted messages are accessed during a criminal or national security investigation by law enforcement.</p><p>Biden's current position on the issue is a little less clear, though in the 1990s, he introduced a series of bills that included anti-encryption language or that focused on giving law enforcement access to Americans' phone calls, emails and financial records. In particular, Biden's Comprehensive Counter-Terrorism Act of 1991, which never passed into law, said communications equipment and service providers should ensure their systems permit the government to obtain the plain text contents of voice, data and other communications when appropriately authorized by law.</p><p>Warren told Vox that the government \"can enforce the law and protect our security without trampling on Americans' privacy.\" She also noted that citizens have a Fourth Amendment right against warrantless searches and seizures and that she believes that should not change in \"the digital era.\"</p><p>Privacy</p><p>Biden has not said much publicly on the issue of privacy, but he told The New York Times that the U.S. should be setting privacy standards similar to Europe.</p><p>In 2016, the European Union adopted a landmark privacy law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation. Among other provisions, the GDPR requires companies to receive unambiguous consent from a user before collecting or processing the user's personal data, and it instructs companies to alert users of certain types of data breaches within 72 hours of learning of the occurrence. Companies found in noncompliance can face steep fines.</p><p>Sanders, meanwhile, told Vox that there should be \"strict accountability and oversight over the collection and sale of consumer data.\" He specifically named Facebook as one company that should be subjected to this oversight.</p><p>He also noted that as president, he would hold executives accountable for breaches of consumer privacy and prosecute them if there is evidence of negligence.</p><p>In 2019, Warren introduced a bill that would expand criminal liability to executives of corporations with more than $1 billion in annual revenue in cases involving civil law violations that affect the personal data of 1% of the U.S. population or 1% of the population of a state.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-57398885</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCS-9FT1-JDVW-N05V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1145\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Buzz it got. I also said that version 1.0 of the Apple Watch would be just that, a version 1.0 product, one with enormous promise but also growing pains. Bingo.</p><p>And I wondered aloud whether Apple Watch would deliver sales that far exceed other wearables and become the catalyst for the entire category. That isn't perhaps as clear-cut.</p><p>Still, while Apple Watch may not be the runaway hit that folks in Cupertino or elsewhere might have hoped for, Apple's smartwatch has certainly bludgeoned the competition in the still relatively nascent smartwatch grouping.</p><p>According to the research firm IDC, the watch OS on which Apple Watch runs had a 61.3% market share in 2015, compared to just 15.2% for Android Wear, 8.6% for the Pebble OS and 8.2% for Samsung's Tizen OS. And IDC predicts Apple will hold onto that lead in 2019, with a 51.1% share compared to 38.8% for Android Wear.</p><p>\"While there is much room for improvement and additional features, there is enough momentum to keep it ahead of the rest of the market,\" IDC wrote.</p><p>I echo those words.</p><p>I also said at the end of last year that Apple would deliver a refresh of the Apple TV set-top box, though I doubted Apple would make its own television, which had been a rumor for years. Apple did finally update the set-top box with a spiffy new interface and terrific voice-activated remote control, and, no, it didn't make a TV. But the company still faces tremendous competition among all the streaming boxes out there, from Roku, Amazon, Google and others.</p><p>Windows 10 was the other big tech story in 2015, and you didn't have to be Nostradamus to see that coming. According to Microsoft, the improved operating system, which formally launched at the end of July, is now actively in use on more than 110 million devices, a pretty darn impressive total.</p><p>What I didn't foresee was something as potentially innovative as Microsoft HoloLens, the mixed-reality Windows 10 platform in which digital objects blend with your physical surroundings. Granted, HoloLens hasn't hit the market yet, but the firsthand demos I've gotten to try this year are mind-blowing.</p><p>Shifting gears, I was hardly alone in suggesting that Tesla and other car companies would make notable progress toward producing self-driving vehicles but said that having a vehicle chauffeur itself around still seemed down the road some. Somehow, a year later, through all the testing and, yes, ongoing regulatory and safety concerns, that road seems a heck of a lot shorter.</p><p>Several of the other areas I said to watch out for a year ago have also come to be, sort of, but are also holdover trends moving into 2016 and beyond: A bigger year for drones (maybe), more wearables, especially those that cater to health and fitness, and the slow but sure rollout of faster broadband networks, covering the wired type (through fiber and other methods) and wireless (through various flavors of LTE). <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>photo JUNG YEON-JE, AFP/Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-78459900</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HP1-8H91-DYRR-90M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"507\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Gannett Company, Inc.

Here is a look back at these and other events that marked the year. Protests sweep Latin America On January 23, Venezuela's opposition chief Juan Guaido declares himself interim president, escalating a long-running political and economic crisis. He is recognised by more than 50 countries, including the United States. But the army backs President Nicolas Maduro and he remains in his post. </p><p>In mid-September major demonstrations erupt in Haiti after fuel shortages, demanding the resignation of President Jovenel Moise. Violence claims more than 40 lives. A metro ticket hike in Chile's capital mid-October is the trigger for protests that claim more than 20 lives before a referendum on reforms is agreed. Bolivia is gripped by three weeks of demonstrations after President Evo Morales claims to win a fourth term on October 20. Dozens are killed. Morales resigns on November 10 and flees into exile as the government works on new elections. Ecuador is paralysed by nearly two weeks of protests in October and in Colombia strikes and demonstrations against the right-wing government begin mid-November. North Africa/Mideast fury On February 22, unprecedented protests break out in Algeria against a fifth term for frail President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in power for 20 years. He loses the army's backing and resigns on April 2. But demonstrations continue, demanding an overhaul of the entire political establishment and rejecting new president Abdelmadjid Tebboune, elected on December 12 in polls marked by record abstention. In Sudan, the military on April 11 ends Omar al-Bashir's three decades in power, a key demand in four months of nationwide protests. Demonstrations continue until a hard-won agreement in August sets up a joint governing council to oversee a transition to civilian rule. More than 250 people are killed, according to protesters. In Iraq, mass demonstrations erupt on October 1 against unemployment, corruption and poor public services, degenerating into violence that claims more than 460 lives. On December 1, parliament accepts the government's resignation. In Lebanon, rolling mass protests start on October 17, triggered by plans for a messaging app tax and turning against the political elite. They continue even after Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigns on October 29, with protesters rejecting new premier-designate Hassan Diab, an engineering professor backed by Hezbollah chosen on December 19 to form a government. Iran sees an explosion of riots on November 15 after a fuel price hike. Authorities crush the unrest but Amnesty International says more than 304 people were killed, most shot by security forces, a toll denied by the authorities. IS leader killed After a five-year offensive to seize vast Islamic State (IS) territory in Iraq and Syria, the jihadists were driven out of their last bastion in March by Kurdish-led forces. On October 27, President Donald Trump announces that IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a US special forces raid in Syria, blowing himself up as he was pursued. Boeing MAX grounded A March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash leads to the global grounding of Boeing 737 MAX planes. It follows a Lion Air crash involving the same model six months earlier, with 346 lives lost in the two incidents. Boeing faces investigations and lawsuits, and is forced to upgrade its systems, in a crisis that costs it billions of dollars. In mid-December production of the plane is suspended. On December 23, Boeing chief Dennis Muilenburg resigns. Brexit saga Britain's March 29, 2019, deadline for leaving the European Union following a 2016 referendum is postponed three times, with the British parliament unable to agree to the divorce terms negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May with Brussels, nor a second accord negotiated by her successor Boris Johnson. After widely winning early elections on December 12, Johnson gets support at the first reading by the lower house for his accord. He seeks final adoption on January 9, and to leave the EU on January 31, 2020. First black hole photo On April 10, astronomers unveil the first photograph of a black hole, a phenomenon they were convinced existed even if it had never been seen before. Drawn from mountains of data captured two years earlier by telescopes across the world, it shows a supermassive black hole 50 million lightyears away. Notre Dame burns On April 15, flames destroy the spire and roof of Paris's beloved Notre-Dame cathedral, but firefighters manage to save the gothic building, while many of its arts, relics and other treasures are rescued. Amid a global outpouring of emotion, nearly one billion euros ($1.1 billion) is pledged for its reconstruction, which will take years. For the first time since 1803, Notre-Dame does not celebrate Christmas mass. Iran escalation On May 8, Tehran announces its first step back from the 2015 nuclear accord -- exactly a year after the United States quit the deal and reimposed sanctions. Over the next months Iran re-engages components of its nuclear programme that it had halted, including uranium enrichment. Tensions mount when Washington blames Tehran for a series of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf from mid-May. On September 14, Iran is again blamed when major Saudi oil facilities are attacked by Yemen's Huthi rebels, which it supports. It denies involvement. In six months Tehran has surpassed the stock of enriched uranium, the level of enrichment and heavy water reserves fixed by the accord and modernised its centrifuges. Hong Kong erupts June 9 sees the start of the biggest crisis in the former British colony of Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, with almost-daily pro-democracy protests. Demonstrations are initially sparked by a now-abandoned attempt to allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland but develop into a popular revolt against Beijing's rule. On November 24, pro-democracy campaigners win a landslide victory in local elections. Hottest month ever July temperatures were the hottest ever recorded, US and European Union authorities announce in August. Temperature records rise in Europe and the North Pole, and in August, Iceland loses its first glacier to climate change. Fires ravage Brazil's Amazon and Australia, while Venice is swamped by flooding not seen in decades. The extreme weather raises climate concerns, and rallies for action, initiated by Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg, spread worldwide. US disengagement On August 2, the US officially quits the Cold War-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty (INF) with Russia. Trump's \"America First\" regime also strikes out alone by pursuing trade wars with China and the EU. It also withdraw from the Paris accord on climate change and its troops from northeastern Syria. Trump impeachment bid On September 24, the Democrats in Congress launch an impeachment enquiry into Trump after claims he pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a rival in his 2020 reelection bid. Trump is impeached in a historic rebuke by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on two counts of abuse of office and obstruction of Congress, but conviction is unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate in a trial expected to begin in January. Turkey moves into Syria On October 9, Turkey launches an offensive into northern Syria to push back from the border Kurdish fighters it considers \"terrorists\". Two days earlier Trump had announced the withdrawal of US troops in the area, leading to charges that Washington had abandoned Kurdish allies who were vital in the battle against Islamic State jihadists. Turkey halts its operation on October 23 after the US and Russia agree in separate deals to ensure the fighters leave the border region. Big Tech tackled On July 24, US regulators fine Facebook a record $5 billion for data protection violations amid mounting concerns about the dominance of it and other internet giants Apple, Amazon and Google. Criticised for failing to protect consumers as well as over tax and advertising issues, the tech titans come under pressure to reform, with threats of investigation, fines and even dismantlement. Social crisis in France France is confronted from December 5 by a three-week standoff between French transport workers and the government over pension reforms, which causes havoc to Christmas travel. Workers at the national SNCF and Parisian RATP rail and public transport companies walk off the job to protest at the government's plan to meld France's 42 pension schemes into a single points-based one, which would see some public employees lose certain privileges, including early retirement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYMNT-163149671</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYMNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV0-W8W1-JDJN-64N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417368</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nation Media Group Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Monitor</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35477\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp;

Disruptive investigations, federal lawsuits and new rules could loom for Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The companies and their executives don't need to look far for guidance about how this could all play out. One of their top competitors, Microsoft, faced the government's ire in the 1990s, leading to a bruising battle in federal court. The company was found to have repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws, and it agreed to change its corporate behavior as part of an eventual settlement. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''The Microsoft case is incredibly front and center, the road map, in all these discussions about big tech and antitrust,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University and co-author of ''The Microsoft Antitrust Cases: Competition Policy for the Twenty-First Century.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Interviews with several of the people at the center of the government's case against the company, as well as antitrust experts, suggest that tech executives will need to be careful and flexible in navigating their turn in the cross hairs.</p><p>  Here are five lessons that today's executives might want to take away from the Microsoft experience, according to the people who lived through it.</p><p>  1. Antitrust law may be old, but it can apply to the modern tech industry. </p><p>  There was a great deal of skepticism about that when the Justice Department and 20 states sued Microsoft in 1998. The tech world was young, fast and freewheeling. Old antitrust laws from the 19th century, created in an industrial era of corporate trusts, when deals were done in smoke-filled railroad cars, could never keep pace, the thinking went. Determining winners and losers was best left to the marketplace.</p><p>  That view was supported by the previous big antitrust case in tech, against IBM. Filed in 1969, the suit was simply dropped in 1982. It was regarded as a 13-year misadventure. Robert H. Bork, a leading antitrust expert at the time, termed it the Justice Department antitrust division's ''Vietnam.'' A few years before it was finally abandoned, even one of IBM's competitors called the case ''a historical curiosity.''</p><p>  In the Microsoft case, the government was able to fashion traditional antitrust law to the digital age, by obtaining enough evidence and casting the company as a bullying monopolist.</p><p>  The federal government and states demonstrated that ''antitrust law works,'' said Senator Richard Blumenthal, who was the attorney general of Connecticut during the Microsoft investigation and trial.</p><p>  2. Consumer harm extends well beyond the price of products.</p><p>  For decades, the litmus test of consumer harm in antitrust had been high prices charged by a dominant company. But the Microsoft case departed from that convention, defining harm broadly as stifling competition by upstart rivals and thus impeding the arrival of innovative new products and services.</p><p>  The main focus of the case was Netscape, the commercial pioneer in browsing software. Microsoft regarded the newcomer as a threat to its grip on the market for desktop personal computer software and its operating system, Windows. One tactic Microsoft employed was to bundle its browser, Internet Explorer, to Windows, which held more than 90 percent of the personal computer operating system market. The additional charge for Internet Explorer? Zero.</p><p>  ''The case didn't hang on pricing, and it couldn't,'' said Rebecca Henderson, an economist at the Harvard Business School, who submitted expert testimony on behalf of the government. ''It was the threat to competition and future innovation.'' Microsoft declined to comment for this article.</p><p>  That point resonates today. Google and Facebook offer their services to consumers free. But as the Microsoft case shows, free is not a free pass from antitrust.</p><p>  3. Fight, but be flexible.</p><p>  ''It always seemed to me that Microsoft waged a kind of holy war,'' said A. Douglas Melamed, who was the second-in-command at the Justice Department's antitrust division during the investigation and trial. ''Their attitude was: We're tech. We're innovators. We understand this industry. There's plenty of competition.''</p><p>Microsoft could have settled, but resisted. David Boies, who was recruited as the Justice Department's chief litigator, initially thought that the case should be settled. Get Microsoft to agree to refrain from some anti-competitive behavior, he figured, and do not risk losing in court in a detail-filled technology case against a company with an all but unlimited budget for legal talent.</p><p>  But Mr. Boies said his view changed as more evidence surfaced. For example, a senior Microsoft executive, in a private meeting, described the software giant's strategy against Netscape as a campaign to ''cut off their air supply,'' according to witness testimony.</p><p>  Mr. Boies said that in an antitrust case, the corporate target begins with a ''huge knowledge advantage, but that will erode'' as the inquiry proceeds. If the facts look incriminating, he said, the best course for a defendant is to ''settle early before the other side knows what you do.''</p><p>  4. Politics and public opinion matter a lot.</p><p>  Antitrust cases are built on facts and evidence, but also legal theory and the climate of the times.</p><p>  Early in the pursuit of Microsoft, Netscape and its allies faced an uphill struggle trying to enlist public support for its cause. Microsoft was a tech superstar, Bill Gates was a business hero, and its products were used by hundreds of millions of people every day. Why punish success?</p><p>  But gradually, government officials, politicians and other companies became convinced that Microsoft's power should be curbed to keep the door open for innovators.</p><p>  The idea was to rally support broadly and create ''safety in numbers'' for potential industry witnesses, recalled Christine Varney, an antitrust expert and a former F.T.C. commissioner who served as an outside counsel to Netscape.</p><p>  Today, the big tech companies face more antagonism than Microsoft did at the outset. They are under fire for their role in undermining privacy, distributing disinformation and thwarting competition.</p><p>  So far, American antitrust authorities have been far less aggressive than their European counterparts in challenging the tech giants. But that could change if public concerns intensify, more complaints surface and evidence accumulates.</p><p>  ''And if they do take bold action, the political system will not trash them,'' said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and former chairman of the F.T.C. ''No one will be accusing them of trying to destroy a national treasure.''</p><p>  5. The Microsoft case changed the industry ... or so it seems.</p><p>  There is no way to know what would have happened without the Microsoft case. Some believe that it mattered little. Technology surged on. Search, smartphones and social networks became the new platforms.</p><p>  David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School and a former Intel board member, used to be in that camp.</p><p>  But his thinking has changed, Mr. Yoffie said, as he has studied the early years of Google's rise. Without the restrictions on its behavior that were in the settlement in 2001, Microsoft could have unleashed the tactics it used against Netscape, like pressuring personal computer makers to agree to exclusive deals that would feature Microsoft's Bing search service and exclude Google search.</p><p>  ''Google may have never emerged in its current form if Microsoft had not been restrained,'' Mr. Yoffie said.</p><p>  Of course, Microsoft eventually found a new path. It missed the shift to smartphones and its Bing search service trails well behind Google. But under Satya Nadella, who became chief executive in 2014, Microsoft has made the transition to catch the next big wave in tech platforms -- cloud computing.</p><p>  In the cloud market, Microsoft is a strong and fast-growing No. 2, behind Amazon, safely outside the gaze of antitrust watchdogs. Last week, with its shares up a bit, the market value of Microsoft's shares topped $1 trillion, ahead of the other tech giants.</p><p>  Pointing to that performance, Mr. Yoffie added another lesson from the Microsoft case.</p><p>  ''An antitrust battle,'' he said, ''doesn't necessarily spell doom for any of these big tech companies.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: In the 1990s, regulators gradually became convinced that Microsoft's growing power should be curbed.

But that isn't clear-cut.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">new york - I didn't exactly go out on a limb a year ago when I predicted the Apple Watch would generate the kind of buzz we often see when a new Apple product arrives. Buzz it got. I also said that version 1.0 of the Apple Watch would be just that, a version 1.0 product, one with enormous promise but also growing pains. Bingo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And I wondered aloud whether Apple Watch would deliver sales that far exceed other wearables and become the catalyst for the entire category. That isn't perhaps as clear-cut.</p><p>Still, while Apple Watch may not be the runaway hit that folks in Cupertino or elsewhere might have hoped for, Apple's smartwatch has certainly bludgeoned the competition in the still relatively nascent smartwatch grouping.</p><p>According to the research firm IDC, the watch OS on which Apple Watch runs had a 61.3% market share in 2015, compared with just 15.2% for Android Wear, 8.6% for the Pebble OS and 8.2% for Samsung's Tizen OS. And IDC predicts Apple will hold onto that lead in 2019, with a 51.1% share compared with 38.8% for Android Wear.</p><p>\"While there is much room for improvement and additional features, there is enough momentum to keep it ahead of the rest of the market,\" IDC wrote.</p><p>I echo those words.</p><p>I also said at the end of last year that Apple would deliver a refresh of the Apple TV set-top box, though I doubted Apple would make its own television, which had been a rumor for years. Apple did finally update the set-top box with a spiffy new interface and terrific voice-activated remote control, and, no, it didn't make a TV. But the company still faces tremendous competition among all the streaming boxes out there, from Roku, Amazon, Google and others.</p><p>Windows 10 was the other big tech story in 2015, and you didn't have to be Nostradamus to see that coming. According to Microsoft, the improved operating system, which formally launched at the end of July, is now actively in use on more than 110 million devices, a pretty darn impressive total.</p><p>What I didn't foresee was something as potentially innovative as Microsoft HoloLens, the mixed-reality Windows 10 platform in which digital objects blend with your physical surroundings. Granted, HoloLens hasn't hit the market yet, but the firsthand demos I've gotten to try this year are mind-blowing.</p><p>Shifting gears, I was hardly alone in suggesting that Tesla and other car companies would make notable progress toward producing self-driving vehicles but said that having a vehicle chauffeur itself around still seemed down the road some. Somehow, a year later, through all the testing and, yes, ongoing regulatory and safety concerns, that road seems a heck of a lot shorter.</p><p>Several of the other areas I said to watch out for a year ago have also come to be, sort of, but also are holdover trends moving into 2016 and beyond: A bigger year for drones (maybe), more wearables, especially those that cater to health and fitness, and the slow but sure rollout of faster broadband networks, covering the wired type (through fiber and other methods) and wireless (through various flavors of LTE).</p><p>personal</p><p>tech</p><p>I wondered aloud whether Apple Watch would become the catalyst for the entire category.

The flip side to the great promise these companies offer could be new forms of bias, threats to data privacy, security violations, misleading marketing and even systemic risk, according to Petrou.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Congress and other policymakers examine big tech companies like Facebook for privacy, antitrust, cybersecurity and political-integrity weaknesses, they should also review the potential impact on economic equality and systemic safety as these companies delve more into financial services, Petrou said in a recent interview.</p><p>\"My goal with this paper is to get finance on the agenda so that solutions can be put on the table because the real lesson we learn over and over again in banking is that retroactive consumer protection leaves a lot of badly hurt, vulnerable households in the ditch,\" she said. \"It needs to be thought of now, before these products become even larger and more dominant in the financial system.\"</p><p>To be sure, fintechs and challenger banks accuse banks of failing to protect their customers' best interests and of gouging customers living paycheck to paycheck with fees that make their financial lives impossible. They also say they are heavily regulated by state bank regulators and federal authorities such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The real risk, from a fintech point of view, is continuing the status quo.</p><p>But Petrou, co-founder and managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, is a veteran observer of banking in politics who has a history of insightful reads on the operational, reputational and political pitfalls that often lie ahead of banks (especially big ones), secondary markets, lawmakers and regulators.</p><p>If anything, her views will add to a brewing argument over the future of financial services, providing a counterbalance to the feel-good idealism that drives a lot of innovation today.</p><p>\"I am all for technology,\" Petrou said. \"But I spent a lot of time when I was a student at MIT studying tech policy, and there is one after another example of seemingly promising technologies with terrible, unintended consequences.\"</p><p>Bias and discrimination</p><p>In the worst-case scenario, big-tech companies and fintechs could discriminate against lower-income households, people of color and people with disabilities - behaviors that banks have been punished for and prevented from doing through fair lending and disparate-impact rules.</p><p>One example of the type of tech-related risk she worries about is the recent experimentation with facial recognition.</p><p>\"It's astonishing to me thatone company underwrites life insurance based on what it thinks of somebody's face,\" Petrou said.</p><p>Facial recognition systems are only as good as the models they are built on, she noted. There have been numerous examples in consumer and security products where systems failed to recognize minority faces because of insufficient data or faulty programming.</p><p>\"When these models are built by white men, they're going to think like white men,\" Petrou said. \"That's one of the reasons why facial recognition does not work well on minority people.\"</p><p>Another example is the kind of predictive modeling tech companies use for employment ads that end up only being offered to white men.</p><p>\"We've seen a lot of this risk in nonfinancial technology based on big data and other very powerful techniques,\" Petrou said. \"We are taking a tremendous risk assuming that none of that would be used in financial product delivery or have a bias impact. It's almost certain that some of it will and there will be bias unless policy intervenes quickly to prevent it.\"</p><p>Another interesting case is Discovery Bank, which plans to launch in South Africa in March as a \"behavioral bank\" that will offer better deals to those who live healthier lives. For example, those who use the company's Vitality rewards program can earn points for visiting the gym, getting a flu shot or buying healthy groceries.</p><p>Petrou questions the wisdom of this.</p><p>\"It's unclear to me that people who smoke don't pay their bills,\" she said. \"Clearly, people who live in dangerous neighborhoods aren't likely to go out for a jog. It's not going to happen because they don't want to die.\"</p><p>People who work three jobs can't necessarily take 10,000 steps a day, and they may not be able to afford to drink carrot juice or eat organic foods.</p><p>\"These are extremely judgmental measures of healthy living,\" she said. \"That's implicitly very discriminatory if some elite view of what is good behavior is used in allocating credit based on it, or pricing deposits or offering securities. It's a very slippery slope to a tremendous amount of disparate treatment.\"</p><p>Current consumer protection rules might be inadequate to deal with such products, Petrou said.</p><p>\"The models are opaque, the assumptions are hidden,\" she said. \"It's already difficult to prove disparate impact, and this would be far more opaque.\"</p><p>In this same vein, Petrou also worries about online lenders that use artificial intelligence in their underwriting and include data such as SAT scores in their decisions.</p><p>Some fintechs unabashedly go after wealthier segments like HENRYs (high earners, not rich yet).</p><p>\"If it's a business-model decision, that's one thing, because that's fair,\" Petrou said. \"As long as it's not overtly discriminatory, you can target products based on wealth. When it turns to only white wealth, that's where I get worried. And how will we know?\"</p><p>Invasive analytics</p><p>Big tech companies that integrate finance with commerce, media and other types of business expose consumers to \"misrepresented or complex products that put financial security at grave risk due to the absence of critical safeguards such as capital reserves, clear disclosures, transaction-audit and error-correction systems, conflict-of-interest restrictions, and even federal deposit insurance on products any consumer would consider a bank account,\" Petrou wrote in her report.</p><p>One specific danger of a company like Amazon getting into finance is the possibility of analytics-based price manipulation. A consumer might try to buy a pair of sneakers and be offered a more expensive pair of sneakers because Amazon knows how much money he or she has.</p><p>\"It's watching your payment speed, estimating your pain threshold, and all of a sudden prioritizing products based on what it thinks it knows about what you can afford,\" she said.</p><p>The U.S. has separated banking from commerce for decades, she noted, because of conflicts like these.</p><p>\"I'm trying to say, let's take a look before people get hurt,\" Petrou said.</p><p>Remedies</p><p>Addressing these issues, Petrou said, needs to start with attention from Congress and regulators, who often talk about responsible innovation.</p><p>\"But if you push them, as I have, and ask what that means, nobody knows,\" she said. \"They're \"~monitoring.' Everybody's running around monitoring. Can we monitor Amazon?\"</p><p>The same principles around illegal, improper, deceptive or confusing practices that are applied to regulated financial institutions need to be applied to nontraditional providers, Petrou said.</p><p>\"If we have an asymmetric safety and soundness and consumer protection framework, which now we do, it will be a lot more profitable to offer product outside the reach of all the rules,\" she said. \"And a lot of people are going to get hurt.\"</p><p>Fintechs such as online lenders often say they are regulated by national and state authorities. Petrou argues this is not enough.</p><p>\"They're regulated in certain consumer protection areas but not in others,\" she said. \"Do they have money at risk when they make loans? No, because they don't have capital. Do they have servicing capacity to support vulnerable borrowers who miss a payment? No. Are there clear protections against cross-marketing? No.</p><p>\"I'm not suggesting that all fintech or big-tech providers are predators. They're not. I am saying the absence of a meaningful, prudential and consumer protection framework favors bad providers and high-risk behavior.\"</p><p>Innovation can indeed enhance inclusion, but only if critical safeguards are in place.</p><p>For instance, clarity is needed around who is responsible for mistakes in the providing of fintech products, and how able those entities are to remedy them. Transparency is also needed, she said.</p><p>\"What do your models look at? When did you change them? What are their results?\" she said.</p><p>Fintech models also need to be tested the way the Federal Reserve requires banks to test and validate their capital models.</p><p>\"The burden of proof needs to be on the provider, not the hapless customer,\" Petrou said.</p><p>Reporting requirements for personal and small-business loans that mimic the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act would help provide transparency, she said.</p><p>Clear codes of conduct need to be established and disclosed in a way that make the provider liable to the Federal Trade Commission if the codes are violated, Petrou said. These should cover how products are packaged and on what terms financial products are offered and priced.</p><p>And the codes need to be enforceable. Otherwise, companies will end up offering what is most profitable to them, without taking the time to worry about the customer.</p><p>\"The enforcement mechanism has got to be powerful and prepositioned,\" Petrou said.</p><p>Banks are not perfect, as fintechs will eagerly point out. There are high fees, product structures that adversely impact low-income people and scandalously bad practices.</p><p>\"The difference is that they can be and are punished,\" Petrou said. \"A lot of rules don't apply outside the banking system.\"</p><p>If a large fintech or tech company were to create fake accounts, for instance, \"what rights would you as a consumer have? None.\"</p><p>The overall risks are to economic equality, Petrou said.</p><p>\"The U.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000168-aa57-d7a0-a37e-bedf177b0000-24</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VBW-5J41-JCRW-51XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

The flip side to the great promise these companies offer could be new forms of bias, threats to data privacy, security violations, misleading marketing and even systemic risk, according to Petrou.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Congress and other policymakers examine big tech companies like Facebook for privacy, antitrust, cybersecurity and political-integrity weaknesses, they should also review the potential impact on economic equality and systemic safety as these companies delve more into financial services, Petrou said in a recent interview.</p><p>\"My goal with this paper is to get finance on the agenda so that solutions can be put on the table because the real lesson we learn over and over again in banking is that retroactive consumer protection leaves a lot of badly hurt, vulnerable households in the ditch,\" she said. \"It needs to be thought of now, before these products become even larger and more dominant in the financial system.\"</p><p>To be sure, fintechs and challenger banks accuse banks of failing to protect their customers' best interests and of gouging customers living paycheck to paycheck with fees that make their financial lives impossible. They also say they are heavily regulated by state bank regulators and federal authorities such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The real risk, from a fintech point of view, is continuing the status quo.</p><p>But Petrou, co-founder and managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, is a veteran observer of banking in politics who has a history of insightful reads on the operational, reputational and political pitfalls that often lie ahead of banks (especially big ones), secondary markets, lawmakers and regulators.</p><p>If anything, her views will add to a brewing argument over the future of financial services, providing a counterbalance to the feel-good idealism that drives a lot of innovation today.</p><p>\"I am all for technology,\" Petrou said. \"But I spent a lot of time when I was a student at MIT studying tech policy, and there is one after another example of seemingly promising technologies with terrible, unintended consequences.\"</p><p>Bias and discrimination</p><p>In the worst-case scenario, big-tech companies and fintechs could discriminate against lower-income households, people of color and people with disabilities - behaviors that banks have been punished for and prevented from doing through fair lending and disparate-impact rules.</p><p>One example of the type of tech-related risk she worries about is the recent experimentation with facial recognition.</p><p>\"It's astonishing to me thatone company underwrites life insurance based on what it thinks of somebody's face,\" Petrou said.</p><p>Facial recognition systems are only as good as the models they are built on, she noted. There have been numerous examples in consumer and security products where systems failed to recognize minority faces because of insufficient data or faulty programming.</p><p>\"When these models are built by white men, they're going to think like white men,\" Petrou said. \"That's one of the reasons why facial recognition does not work well on minority people.\"</p><p>Another example is the kind of predictive modeling tech companies use for employment ads that end up only being offered to white men.</p><p>\"We've seen a lot of this risk in nonfinancial technology based on big data and other very powerful techniques,\" Petrou said. \"We are taking a tremendous risk assuming that none of that would be used in financial product delivery or have a bias impact. It's almost certain that some of it will and there will be bias unless policy intervenes quickly to prevent it.\"</p><p>Another interesting case is Discovery Bank, which plans to launch in South Africa in March as a \"behavioral bank\" that will offer better deals to those who live healthier lives. For example, those who use the company's Vitality rewards program can earn points for visiting the gym, getting a flu shot or buying healthy groceries.</p><p>Petrou questions the wisdom of this.</p><p>\"It's unclear to me that people who smoke don't pay their bills,\" she said. \"Clearly, people who live in dangerous neighborhoods aren't likely to go out for a jog. It's not going to happen because they don't want to die.\"</p><p>People who work three jobs can't necessarily take 10,000 steps a day, and they may not be able to afford to drink carrot juice or eat organic foods.</p><p>\"These are extremely judgmental measures of healthy living,\" she said. \"That's implicitly very discriminatory if some elite view of what is good behavior is used in allocating credit based on it, or pricing deposits or offering securities. It's a very slippery slope to a tremendous amount of disparate treatment.\"</p><p>Current consumer protection rules might be inadequate to deal with such products, Petrou said.</p><p>\"The models are opaque, the assumptions are hidden,\" she said. \"It's already difficult to prove disparate impact, and this would be far more opaque.\"</p><p>In this same vein, Petrou also worries about online lenders that use artificial intelligence in their underwriting and include data such as SAT scores in their decisions.</p><p>Some fintechs unabashedly go after wealthier segments like HENRYs (high earners, not rich yet).</p><p>\"If it's a business-model decision, that's one thing, because that's fair,\" Petrou said. \"As long as it's not overtly discriminatory, you can target products based on wealth. When it turns to only white wealth, that's where I get worried. And how will we know?\"</p><p>Invasive analytics</p><p>Big tech companies that integrate finance with commerce, media and other types of business expose consumers to \"misrepresented or complex products that put financial security at grave risk due to the absence of critical safeguards such as capital reserves, clear disclosures, transaction-audit and error-correction systems, conflict-of-interest restrictions, and even federal deposit insurance on products any consumer would consider a bank account,\" Petrou wrote in her report.</p><p>One specific danger of a company like Amazon getting into finance is the possibility of analytics-based price manipulation. A consumer might try to buy a pair of sneakers and be offered a more expensive pair of sneakers because Amazon knows how much money he or she has.</p><p>\"It's watching your payment speed, estimating your pain threshold, and all of a sudden prioritizing products based on what it thinks it knows about what you can afford,\" she said.</p><p>The U.S. has separated banking from commerce for decades, she noted, because of conflicts like these.</p><p>\"I'm trying to say, let's take a look before people get hurt,\" Petrou said.</p><p>Remedies</p><p>Addressing these issues, Petrou said, needs to start with attention from Congress and regulators, who often talk about responsible innovation.</p><p>\"But if you push them, as I have, and ask what that means, nobody knows,\" she said. \"They're \"~monitoring.' Everybody's running around monitoring. Can we monitor Amazon?\"</p><p>The same principles around illegal, improper, deceptive or confusing practices that are applied to regulated financial institutions need to be applied to nontraditional providers, Petrou said.</p><p>\"If we have an asymmetric safety and soundness and consumer protection framework, which now we do, it will be a lot more profitable to offer product outside the reach of all the rules,\" she said. \"And a lot of people are going to get hurt.\"</p><p>Fintechs such as online lenders often say they are regulated by national and state authorities. Petrou argues this is not enough.</p><p>\"They're regulated in certain consumer protection areas but not in others,\" she said. \"Do they have money at risk when they make loans? No, because they don't have capital. Do they have servicing capacity to support vulnerable borrowers who miss a payment? No. Are there clear protections against cross-marketing? No.</p><p>\"I'm not suggesting that all fintech or big-tech providers are predators. They're not. I am saying the absence of a meaningful, prudential and consumer protection framework favors bad providers and high-risk behavior.\"</p><p>Innovation can indeed enhance inclusion, but only if critical safeguards are in place.</p><p>For instance, clarity is needed around who is responsible for mistakes in the providing of fintech products, and how able those entities are to remedy them. Transparency is also needed, she said.</p><p>\"What do your models look at? When did you change them? What are their results?\" she said.</p><p>Fintech models also need to be tested the way the Federal Reserve requires banks to test and validate their capital models.</p><p>\"The burden of proof needs to be on the provider, not the hapless customer,\" Petrou said.</p><p>Reporting requirements for personal and small-business loans that mimic the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act would help provide transparency, she said.</p><p>Clear codes of conduct need to be established and disclosed in a way that make the provider liable to the Federal Trade Commission if the codes are violated, Petrou said. These should cover how products are packaged and on what terms financial products are offered and priced.</p><p>And the codes need to be enforceable. Otherwise, companies will end up offering what is most profitable to them, without taking the time to worry about the customer.</p><p>\"The enforcement mechanism has got to be powerful and prepositioned,\" Petrou said.</p><p>Banks are not perfect, as fintechs will eagerly point out. There are high fees, product structures that adversely impact low-income people and scandalously bad practices.</p><p>\"The difference is that they can be and are punished,\" Petrou said. \"A lot of rules don't apply outside the banking system.\"</p><p>If a large fintech or tech company were to create fake accounts, for instance, \"what rights would you as a consumer have? None.\"</p><p>The overall risks are to economic equality, Petrou said.</p><p>\"The U.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000168-aa57-d7a0-a37e-bedf177b0000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VBS-52V1-F06X-W1XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple are all showing solid gains year to date.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're almost one full quarter into 2019 so now is the right time to step back and take a look at the wider picture. The general correction of the second half last year has passed, stocks are up so far year to date, and if the market indexes are a reliable indicator investors are confident. The numbers show it - year to date, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 12% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 15%.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That confidence is clear in the tech sector. After five big tech companies - Facebook  , Amazon  , Apple  , Netflix  and Alphabet  - collectively known as the FAANGs - drove a huge portion of the market's gains and losses last year it's no surprise to see some of them leading the gainers. Now let's dive into the  , and see what Wall Street's top analysts have to say about Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet</emphasis><br/></p><p>Alphabet's core strength is the Google search engine, whose near-total market dominance and near-infinite reach have given the company an unparalleled data mine on potential customers. That data also gives the company an Achilles heel, in the form of data privacy, online security, and governmental oversight and regulation into the matter. It is part and parcel of the problems that have plagued Facebook for the last year or more.</p><p>And like Facebook, Alphabet has a powerful online advertising model to rest on as a steady source of revenue. It's a business model that has proven itself successful for the digital age.</p><p>But the company is also looking ahead. MoffettNathanson analyst  examined Alphabet's recent capital expenditures, which have been rising sharply, and concluded that the bulk of it is going into real estate investment and data centers - new facility construction. He sees it as a net positive and a sign that the company is thinking strategically: \"As artificial intelligence becomes a greater driver of its businesses ... we believe Alphabet is building now to support human capital and processing power needs in the near future. Accordingly, we anticipate Alphabet will soon gain leverage from these investments, powering top-line growth and cementing its competitive positioning in the market.\"</p><p>Nathanson gives GOOGL shares a $1,380 price target, suggesting a 16% upside to the stock.</p><p>This was only the most recent analyst to take a bullish stance on Alphabet. Last month, just after the company released its fourth-quarter earnings, SunTrust's  set a $1,350 target for GOOGL. In his comments, Squali anticipates \"Alphabet to sustain its mid-teen growth over the next several years with a focus on incremental profit and free cash flows, making the stock an attractive growth story at a compelling valuation.\" He sees a 13% upside potential in GOOGL shares.</p><p>Overall, Alphabet's GOOGL shares get a  rating on the analyst consensus, based on 25 buys and just a single hold. The average price target is $1,345, suggesting a 13% upside from the current $1,190 price.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon.com</emphasis><br/></p><p>Of the tech giants, Amazon suffered the least from last year's market slowdown, but it has also shown the slowest gains in 2019. In part, this is an artifact of the stock's high share price - at just more than $1,700, it takes a serious tremor to move the needle on AMZN. Even so, the online retail giant has recovered over $350 per share since hitting bottom on Dec. 24.</p><p>Amazon's strength is in its sheer size. It is the fourth-largest publicly traded company in the world (it has been sharing the top four spots with Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft  for most of the last two years), and it dominates the landscape of online retail. As UBS analyst  said, Amazon \"cannot be ignored.\" His price target, $2,100, suggests a high 22% upside for AMZN.</p><p>Morgan Stanley's  agreed that Amazon's size is an asset, especially as the company plans \"to open dozens of grocery stores in several major U.S. cities, with a wider variety of products, less of a focus on organic items, and lower price points.\" He sees the move toward brick-and-mortar stores as a response to the increasing costs of e-commerce, and a way to extend products to the pharmacy sector. In addition, physical locations will put Amazon in closer touch with customers. Nowak gives AMZN shares a sky-high $2,200 price target, implying an upside of 28%.</p><p>Amazon's consensus rating is another  , derived from a unanimous 31 buy reviews. The stock is trading at a price of $1,712, and the $2,125 average price target suggests a potential 24% upside.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis><br/></p><p>Apple suffered one of the hardest hits among the FAANG grouping, dropping 38% from its peak last October to a low of $141 just after the new year. The decline was fueled by slowing iPhone sales, the ongoing contraction in Chinese consumer demand, and concerns over the simmering U.S.-China trade tensions. As 2018 ended, each of those factors began to show signs of resolution.</p><p>First, the slowdown in iPhone sales was attributable to a general maturation of the smartphone market. Believe it or not smartphones have been around for 10 years now; the replacement cycle is starting to lengthen as improvements appear in smaller increments and users keep their devices longer rather than snap up every new model with every new bell.</p><p>Second, while China's economy is undoubtedly slowing Apple is showing signs that it can compensate for a smaller market there - and for the longer device replacement cycle - by expanding its services sector. iPhones have brought Apple a loyal customer base, which can now be leveraged to increase revenue from the App Store, Apple Music and other services. The most recent quarterly earnings showed that this is already happening.</p><p>And finally, as we've all seen in the news, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping both have expressed confidence in the progress of trade negotiations as their diplomatic teams continue to talk. Their confidence has had at least one salutary effect: Trump has delayed the threatened imposition of retaliatory tariffs on Chinese trade.</p><p>That's the news. Wall Street analysts are starting to take it all into account. From Wedbush,  predicted that Apple's new streaming service will expand the company's presence in the gaming and video content segments. Gaming, especially, is a profit engine, and likely will power the services division's continued growth. Ives sees Apple streaming, which is scheduled to be unveiled on March 25 and expected to go live in the fall, bringing in up to 100 million subscribers in the first few years. He gives AAPL an optimistic $200 price target, suggesting a 7% potential upside for the stock.</p><p>In Apple's most recent analyst review,  of UBS looked at smartphone data released by the Chinese government. While he sees a steep decline in iPhone sales, he described is as \"already baked into expectations.\" He's confident that AAPL remains a buy option, although his $185 price target may be out of date as AAPL closed above that on March 15.</p><p>Merrill Lynch's  sets out a more bullish case for Apple shares. He upgraded the stock to a buy rating, and his $210 target suggests a potential upside of 12%. Among the strengths he enumerates for Apple: a consistently loyal user base; competitive products in the higher price ranges; the acceleration in the services division; and the stability of the supply chain. It's a solid foundation for future growth.</p><p>Apple's recent surge in the markets - the stock is up 32% since it's low point in January - seems to have taken analysts by surprise. AAPL shares have powered straight through the average price target, and at $186 now stand $7 above that level. Look for analysts to reevaluate this stock soon, considering last week's gains. Right now, AAPL holds a  from the consensus rating, with 17 buys and 13 holds. It's a stock in the process of turning around.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are holdings in Jim Cramer's  .

Determinar si estas cuatro empresas han realizado pr\u00e1cticas monop\u00f3licas.    Este fue el pretexto perfecto para exponer c\u00f3mo es que el derecho en todo el mundo debe evolucionar para dar respuesta a las exigencias tecnol\u00f3gicas. Para entender la trascendencia, profundidad e impacto de los temas discutidos, es necesario analizar la situaci\u00f3n de cada una de las corporaciones de forma separada porque, aunque fue una audiencia conjunta, la situaci\u00f3n era distinta para cada una de ellas.       Ilustraci\u00f3n: Patricio Betteo   Un bocado del 30\u202f%   En 2001, distintos due\u00f1os de dispositivos IPhone interpusieron una demanda contra la corporaci\u00f3n de la manzana mordida. 5 Los demandantes alegaban que la \u00fanica opci\u00f3n de descargar aplicaciones en su m\u00f3vil era a trav\u00e9s de la App Store. Su argumento principal era que Apple hab\u00eda monopolizado el mercado de las aplicaciones en sus celulares, y utilizaba este poder para cobrar un 30% de comisi\u00f3n a cualquier venta de aplicaciones en su plataforma. 6 Esto ocasion\u00f3 que los precios de \u00e9stas fueran m\u00e1s altos que en otras plataformas de distintas marcas de celulares. La empresa no dio respuesta expl\u00edcita a estas acusaciones; sin embargo, defendi\u00f3 que los due\u00f1os de los celulares no pueden demandarlo por pr\u00e1cticas monop\u00f3licas ya que no son compradores directos. 7    En 2019, sin embargo, la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos determin\u00f3 que los due\u00f1os de los celulares s\u00ed eran compradores directos de las aplicaciones. Por lo tanto, ten\u00edan el derecho a demandar a Apple por pr\u00e1cticas monop\u00f3licas. 8 Aunque la sentencia de esta Corte s\u00f3lo reconoci\u00f3 que los due\u00f1os pod\u00edan demandar, dej\u00f3 entrever que los argumentos jur\u00eddicos de Apple s\u00f3lo favorecer\u00edan pr\u00e1cticas monop\u00f3licas y monops\u00f3nicas.    Especialistas en la materia establecieron que aun teniendo el poder de interponer demandas, ser\u00edan litigios largos y complicados. 9 , 10 Timothy Cook estuvo en la audiencia del Congreso; su empresa no fue el centro de inter\u00e9s de los legisladores, despu\u00e9s de pocas preguntas al inicio de la primera ronda, Apple dej\u00f3 de ser prioridad para los congresistas.   El AmazonasAmazon est\u00e1 peleando en distintos frentes. Por una parte, la empresa del hombre m\u00e1s rico del mundo 11 ha estado bajo investigaci\u00f3n por la Comisi\u00f3n Europea, desde julio del a\u00f1o pasado. \u00c9sta busca esclarecer si el uso de los datos confidenciales de los vendedores independientes que ofrecen sus productos v\u00eda Amazon afecta a la competencia, as\u00ed como el rol que tienen para seleccionar a qui\u00e9nes estar\u00e1n en la Buy Box . 12 , 13 La investigaci\u00f3n tiene como objetivo determinar si estas pr\u00e1cticas violentan los art\u00edculos 101 y 102 del Tratado de Funcionamiento de la Uni\u00f3n Europea. 14 , 15    Por otra, en marzo de este a\u00f1o, Deborah Frame y Christian Sabol interpusieron una demanda colectiva en contra de la corporaci\u00f3n de Jeff Bezos por pr\u00e1cticas monop\u00f3licas fundamentada en la Ley Sherman y la Ley Clayton. 16 Los demandantes alegan que las pol\u00edticas de la empresa proh\u00edben a vendedores independientes en la plataforma Amazon   ofrecer sus productos a un precio m\u00e1s bajo a trav\u00e9s de canales de comercio electr\u00f3nico de minoristas competidores. 17    Las mayores preocupaciones de los congresistas eran la utilizaci\u00f3n de datos, propiedad de terceros, para lanzar productos de marca privada; reuniones con empresas para utilizar su informaci\u00f3n de forma inadecuada; as\u00ed como soportar p\u00e9rdidas por periodos largos para que otras corporaciones no pudieran competir. En otras palabras, la inquietud era que Amazon se rige bajo la ley de la selva.    Jeff  Bezos se comprometi\u00f3 a proporcionar al subcomit\u00e9 los resultados de una investigaci\u00f3n interna respecto a las acusaciones relacionadas a que la compa\u00f1\u00eda est\u00e1 utilizando incorrectamente los datos para competir con los comerciantes. Tambi\u00e9n reconoci\u00f3 que Amazon s\u00ed usa su plataforma para promocionar sus propios productos sobre rivales que no tienen esa misma capacidad. 18   Un dislike como reacci\u00f3n   Mark Zuckerberg no est\u00e1 frente un panorama agradable. El a\u00f1o pasado, el Bundeskartellamt impuso a Facebook restricciones de largo alcance en el procesamiento de datos de los usuarios. 19 , 20 La decisi\u00f3n determin\u00f3 que s\u00f3lo mediante consentimiento expl\u00edcito, los datos de Instagram, Whatsapp y Facebook pueden combinarse y la recopilaci\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n de sitios web de terceros podr\u00e1 asignarse a una cuenta de usuario de Facebook. 21    Aunque Facebook apel\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n, la Corte Federal de Justicia Alemana confirm\u00f3 la acusaci\u00f3n de abuso. 22 , 23 El presidente del Bundeskartellamt, Andreas Mundt, expres\u00f3 que \u201ccomo empresa dominante, Facebook est\u00e1 sujeto a obligaciones especiales seg\u00fan la ley de competencia europea\u201d. 24 , 25    Pero \u00e9ste no ha sido el \u00fanico problema de esta empresa en Europa. En julio del presente a\u00f1o, el Tribunal de Justicia de la Uni\u00f3n Europea anul\u00f3 el escudo de privacidad, un acuerdo que permit\u00eda la transferencia de datos personales de ciudadanos europeos a empresas estadounidenses 26 ya que consideran que en Estados Unidos no se garantiza adecuadamente el tratamiento de datos. 27 Esto dificultar\u00e1 la forma de actuaci\u00f3n de Facebook y su modelo de negocio.    Adem\u00e1s, en octubre del 2019, 47 fiscales generales iniciaron una investigaci\u00f3n antimonopolio en contra de esta empresa, 28 separada de la que lleva la Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Comercio. 29 En la audiencia, los cuestionamientos para Zuckerberg no s\u00f3lo fueron por las pr\u00e1cticas anticompetitivas. Los legisladores enfocaron sus preguntas en temas como la libertad de expresi\u00f3n, derechos electorales, el tratamiento de datos e intervenci\u00f3n extranjera. 30 La pregunta que deber\u00e1 resolverse es la planteada por el cofundador de esta empresa, Chris Hughes: \u00bfes tiempo de disolver Facebook? 31   \u00a1Don\u2019t be evil!   En 2015, Alphabet, consorcio que aglutina entre muchas otras empresas al famoso buscador de Internet Google, cambi\u00f3 el lema de no seas malvado , estandarte del comportamiento \u00e9tico de la empresa, comprometi\u00e9ndose a utilizar los datos meramente para ofrecer un mejor servicio a sus usuarios. Mas el cambio no se limit\u00f3 al eslogan . En los a\u00f1os siguientes, la empresa ha sido multada diversas ocasiones por incumplir con las normas europeas. En 2017, la Comisi\u00f3n Europea decret\u00f3 que la sanci\u00f3n era de 2.42 mil millones de euros, ya que la compa\u00f1\u00eda llev\u00f3 a cabo pr\u00e1cticas abusivas en la publicidad en l\u00ednea. 32 Un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s, la Comisi\u00f3n los mult\u00f3 con 4.34 mil millones de euros por actividades monop\u00f3licas. 33 En 2019, Google volvi\u00f3 a ser sancionado por acciones similares, aunque la suma fue menor (1.49 mil millos de euros). 34    La ley europea exige que las empresas con un mejor posicionamiento no utilicen su fortaleza para acabar con la competencia, tal como lo establecen los art\u00edculos 12 y 54 del Tratado de Funcionamiento de la Uni\u00f3n Europea. 35 , 36    En Estados Unidos, los fiscales generales de 50 estados anunciaron una investigaci\u00f3n por pr\u00e1cticas monop\u00f3licas por parte de la empresa. 37 En este sentido, Sundar Pichai fue quien recibi\u00f3 m\u00e1s atenci\u00f3n por parte de los congresistas. Si bien hubiera sido relevante el tema sobre las pr\u00e1cticas monop\u00f3licas de la empresa, los legisladores enfocaron sus preguntas en la cooperaci\u00f3n de Alphabet con el gobierno chino, mecanismos de recopilaci\u00f3n de datos, y la censura del contenido conservador.    Desde este mes, la Uni\u00f3n Europea los investigar\u00e1 por la adquisici\u00f3n de Fitbit, empresa que produce relojes inteligentes, ya que se teme que Google favorezca su posici\u00f3n de anunciante al utilizar datos de salud recabados por medio de estos dispositivos. Despu\u00e9s de sanciones en el extranjero e investigaciones en su pa\u00eds de origen, Google debe replantearse volver a su lema de origen: estandarte del comportamiento \u00e9tico de la empresa. 38   \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasar\u00e1?   Competidores tecnol\u00f3gicos de estas compa\u00f1\u00edas apoyaron la comparecencia. 39 No obstante, al d\u00eda siguiente inclusive aumentaron las ganancias de Amazon, Apple y Facebook. 40 Tim Wu, abogado especialista en derecho de las nuevas tecnolog\u00edas de informaci\u00f3n, se pronunci\u00f3 por la detenci\u00f3n de las actividades anticompetitivas, pues de lo contrario las audiencias se convertir\u00e1n en una pantalla. 41 Sin duda, la decisi\u00f3n de los \u00f3rganos estadounidenses tendr\u00e1 repercusi\u00f3n mundial.    En la Uni\u00f3n Europea, ya est\u00e1n discutiendo propuestas de ley para que Amazon y Apple no den a sus productos un trato preferencial sobre los de rivales; proponen obligar a Facebook a hacer que sus servicios sean amigables con las redes sociales rivales; plantean que Google comparta datos de b\u00fasqueda con competidores peque\u00f1os; y pretenden permitir a los reguladores detener ciertas pr\u00e1cticas comerciales en las compa\u00f1\u00edas tecnol\u00f3gicas durante investigaciones. 42    Ahora bien, \u00bfhay alguna relevancia de este tema para M\u00e9xico? En nuestro pa\u00eds existen m\u00e1s de 80 millones de personas que utilizan Internet. 43 Es el quinto pa\u00eds con m\u00e1s usuarios de Facebook en el mundo y, como en Estados Unidos, el buscador Google es la multiplataforma con m\u00e1s visitantes. 44 , 45 Es un hecho que la tecnolog\u00eda forma parte de la vida de los mexicanos. Por esto, la protecci\u00f3n de los datos de los ciudadanos, como la lucha contra las pr\u00e1cticas anticompetitivas, protegidas por los art\u00edculos 6, 16 y 28 de la Constituci\u00f3n mexicana, deben de ser una prioridad para el Estado.    Es necesario hacer caso a la pregunta de los juristas Mario Tavares Moyr\u00f3n y Le\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez Dom\u00ednguez, expertos en competencia econ\u00f3mica y regulaci\u00f3n de nuevas tecnolog\u00edas, \u00bfestamos listos para las investigaciones digitales? 46 Ellos exclaman que los casos en el extranjero deben ser referencia para los \u00f3rganos gubernamentales mexicanos. 47 Estas cuatro empresas han acrecentado su poder hasta convertirse en verdaderos gigantes. Es cierto, el dominio comercial no es en s\u00ed mismo una infracci\u00f3n a la ley , pero las corporaciones dominantes tienen la responsabilidad de no abusar de su posici\u00f3n en el mercado al restringir la competencia. Por esto, el Estado mexicano debe entender que tiene el deber de salvaguardara los ciudadanos ante la monstruosidad en tama\u00f1o y poder de estas empresas. Lo cual, sobra mencionar, implica repensar y modernizar nuestro derecho para afrontar estos nuevos retos regulatorios.    Iv\u00e1n Alejandro Ruiz Mijangos .

Brokers and banks are worried about everything from data breaches to technology firms making one of their biggest inroads yet into the financial world.</p><p>\"This is a huge opportunity for Amazon and Google,\" said Jo Ann Barefoot, a senior fellow at Harvard University who studies fintech and a former official at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. \"Their involvement in this project I do think is a threat to the incumbents. If big tech firms can win more trust in Washington, that's one of the biggest challenges facing banks.\"</p><p>Data is playing an increasingly important role in the financial services industry as services such as lending and managing money become more reliant on analysing market trends.</p><p>The big data market for financial services is expected to increase to $53.4bn in 2017 from $32.1bn in 2015, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p><p>Right now if the SEC wants trading information it can take days. That's because it often has to cobble it together from different systems run by the exchanges and Wall Streetfunded overseer, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Under the CAT system, regulators would be able to see data from the previous day's orders by noon the following day.</p><p>That information could be stored in a cloud, where it would be encrypted and the SEC would be able to access it remotely, rather than on in-house servers.</p><p>Amazon and Google's cloud businesses already keep data for other companies, including rivals, without providing the tech firms with access to it. The agency declined to comment on the teams bidding to run CAT.</p><p>\"We think CAT will certainly facilitate our ability to do our job,\" Steve Luparello, the SEC's director of the division of trading and markets, said. \"As the August event of 2015 pointed out, we have access to all the data we need, but it's labour-intensive and time-consuming to aggregate all that data and begin that analysis.\"</p><p>Luparello said the SEC expects the initial phase of CAT, which will include stock and options data collected from the exchanges and Finra, but not order information from broker-dealers, will be operational by the end of next year.</p><p>Lobbying by industry trade groups has mounted, with the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which represents the biggest broker-dealers, complaining about potential costs for its members in a July letter to the SEC. The agency estimates that CAT implementation costs for exchanges and broker-dealers could be about $2.4bn, while the firms' expenses for maintaining the records would be about the same at $1.7bn.</p><p>The Investment Company Institute, whose members include some of the biggest asset managers, also sent a letter last month, outlining its security concerns. \"This treasure trove of order and execution information has tremendous commercial value, and we are gravely concerned that cyber criminals and others will seek to access and use it for their personal gain to the detriment of funds and their shareholders,\" David Blass, general counsel at ICI, wrote. Amazon is working with Finra in its bid to build CAT, after the regulator migrated 90pc of its data, such as brokerage transaction records, to Amazon's cloud services. Financial technology firm Fidelity National Information Services has partnered with Google to vie for the contract. Winning would help expand the technology firms' cloud computing, one of their fastest growing businesses. Building CAT could cost as much as $92m initially and then $93m annually for maintenance, according to estimates published in April.</p><p>Last month, Amazon said that in the second quarter its cloud-computing division delivered operating income of $718m - 56pc of the company's total, while accounting for only 9.5pc of revenue. Meanwhile, Alphabet beat analyst estimates last quarter in part due to gains in its cloud-computing business.</p><p>Amazon and Google's potential role in CAT has also stoked fears about what the technology giants' broader, long-term goals may be in financial services, but neither company has said it has plans to get involved in the trading business. It's also specified in the CAT proposal that whoever wins the bid must ensure the security and confidentiality of the data, and agree to use it only for appropriate surveillance and regulatory activities. Spokesmen for the firms declined to comment on their involvement to build CAT.</p><p>Werner Vogels, chief technology officer at Amazon, said at an event earlier this month that lower costs and greater security were two of the primary reasons customers shift data from their own servers to Amazon's. The SEC is expected to weigh in on the CAT plan in November and the winner will be chosen by January by the exchanges. Since Finra is one of the finalists, it's removed itself from the selection process. The third contender is led by Thesys Technologies, a financial technology firm. Given the technology overhaul required, and controversy over security and costs, the project could be years away from completion.</p><p>Finra's move to the cloud cut costs, while also bolstering data security and surveillance capabilities, according to Steve Randich, the regulator's chief information officer. Firms, banks, brokerdealers and other regulators have asked for information on how Finra outsourced its data storage, he said.</p><p>\"There is resistance, but it is fading,\" said Randich. \"You could measure the sentiment change by the week.\" (Bloomberg)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-116614915</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KKR-JR71-JBVM-Y2YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1084\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>September 1, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00028V0</classCode><className>PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SECURITIES &amp;

The title for the company with the biggest financial reserves, held by Apple for a decade, has passed to Google's parent, Alphabet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The switch in leadership follows a concerted effort by the iPhone maker to reduce its liquid reserves, six years after it first came under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn to pay out more of its cash hoard. Apple's holdings of cash and marketable securities, net of debt, has fallen to $102 billion, down from a peak of $163 billion at the end of 2017.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alphabet's financial reserves have been moving in the opposite direction. At $117 billion, its cash pile has risen by almost $20 billion over the same period.</p><p>The rise of Google's parent to the top of the corporate liquidity rankings puts its corporate wealth and power on conspicuous display at a politically sensitive moment. After being hit with $9 billion in antitrust fines by the European Union in the last two years, it now faces intense scrutiny in Washington.</p><p>The company's preference for hoarding its money and spending it on trying to break into new markets, rather than using it to reward shareholders with buybacks or dividends, as Apple has done, also antagonizes some investors.</p><p>\"In general, their attempts to reinvent themselves with their new initiatives aren't working out,\" said Walter Price, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors. \"I wish they'd return more cash to shareholders and waste less.\"</p><p>The cash buildup has come despite a surge in capital spending. At $25 billion last year -- up from around $13 billion in 2017 -- much of the money has been pouring into real estate, as Google has added to its office holdings in cities such as New York and built data centers to support its growing cloud computing business.</p><p>Ruth Porat, chief financial officer, has been at pains to downplay the real estate investments, emphasizing that they are a one-off and that, in a normal quarter, 70% of capital spending goes into servers and other new equipment.</p><p>The infrastructure to support artificial intelligence that Google had been building \"requires a ton of compute power,\"said Youssef Squali, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. But he added that, like some other big tech companies, it had seen higher spending on machine learning feed through directly into higher revenue. That had left Wall Street generally comfortable with the spending surge.</p><p>It is in areas beyond Google's core business that the complaints persist.</p><p>Alphabet's cash is produced almost entirely by its search advertising business, which has been supplemented by strong growth from online video service YouTube.</p><p>By contrast, Google's other businesses -- such as cloud computing, smartphones and home automation -- are believed to have been consuming cash. Alphabet has also lost $15 billion in the six years since disclosures began in businesses beside Google -- something it describes as its \"Other Bets,\" which include the Waymo driverless car unit and the Verily healthcare division.</p><p>Google had done enough to \"make the cut\" in cloud computing, where it is chasing market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft, Price said. But he added that it had had little effect in breaking into other markets.</p><p>Until last week, Alphabet also stood out among big tech companies for not taking a more aggressive stance on returning cash to shareholders after the passage of U.S. tax law at the end of 2017. The new law applied an immediate -- though reduced -- tax rate to companies' overseas cash reserves, in the process removing the incentive to sit on the money rather than start paying it out.</p><p>Apple has responded to the change by spending $122 billion on buying back stock and paying dividends in the last 18 months.</p><p>Other companies to dig deep include Cisco Systems, which has cut its cash holdings from $35 billion at the time of the new tax law to only $11 billion.</p><p>Alphabet's stock buybacks, by contrast, have been paltry. In the nearly four years since it began repurchasing its own stock, it has spent an average of only $1.7 billion a quarter.</p><p>In that time, it has handed out more new shares in the form of employee stock benefits than it has bought back through its repurchase program. As a result, the payments have done nothing to lift its earnings per share -- the reason investors generally welcome buybacks.</p><p>Things could be about to change. Last week, Alphabet said its board had added $25 billion to its stock buyback program, taking total new repurchase authorizations to $37.5 billion since the start of this year.</p><p>Porat said the increase did not reflect any change in Alphabet's financial priorities, and that its two top goals were unchanged: to invest in the long-term growth of its existing businesses, and to support acquisitions. However, the move contributed to a strong stock-price rebound on the same day that the company reported a rebound in revenue growth, dispelling worries about a sharp secular slowdown in its advertising business.</p><p>Even the heightened rate of buybacks may not cap the growth in Alphabet's cash mountain. Its free cash flow this year was forecast to top $30 billion, rising to almost $40 billion next year, said George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The new buyback intentions \"don't represent a step change\" big enough to reduce the company's total reserves, he said.</p><p>Many investors are now counting on a steady increase in Alphabet's stock repurchases as its search advertising business continues to mature.</p><p>One potential avenue for using the money -- making acquisitions -- looks less likely given the regulatory backdrop, according to some investors.</p><p>\"The U.S. government is going to take care of the [mergers and acquisitions] question by making it more difficult to do deals,\" said Jim Tierney, a chief investment officer at AllianceBernstein. Along with growing maturing in the core business, that was likely to make the $25-billion repurchase authorization announced last week \"the tip of the iceberg,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook, with less than half the cash reserves, has also turned its thoughts to distributing more of its excess cash, heavily outspending Google last year on stock repurchases.</p><p>--</p><p>Copyright The Financial Times Ltd. 2019.

He did not provide specific proposals.</p><p>Pichai spoke on the same day he was scheduled to meet the EU's powerful competition regulator, Margrethe Vestager.</p><p>Vestager has in previous years hit the Silicon Valley giant with multibillion-dollar fines for allegedly abusing its market dominance to choke off competition. After being reappointed for a second term last autumn with expanded powers over digital technology policies, Vestager has now set her sights on artificial intelligence, and is drawing up rules on its ethical use.</p><p>Pichai's comments suggest the company may be hoping to head off a broad-based crackdown by the EU on the technology. Vestager and the EU have been among the more aggressive regulators of big tech firms, an approach US authorities have picked up with investigations into the dominance of companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>\"Sensible regulation must also take a proportionate approach, balancing potential harms with social opportunities,\" he said, adding that it could incorporate existing standards like Europe's tough General Data Protection Regulation rather than starting from scratch.</p><p>While it promises big benefits, he raised concerns about potential downsides of artificial intelligence, citing as one example its role in facial recognition technology, which can be used to find missing people but also for \"nefarious reasons\" which he didn't specify.</p><p>In 2018, Google pledged not to use AI in applications related to weapons, surveillance that violates international norms, or that works in ways that go against human rights.</p><p>Giants dispute</p><p>Meanwhile, the EU's proposal for a temporary ban on facial-recognition technology won backing from Pichai on Monday but got a cool response from Microsoft President Brad Smith.</p><p>While Pichai cited the possibility that the technology could be used for nefarious purposes as a reason for a moratorium, Smith said a ban was akin to using a meat cleaver instead of a scalpel to solve potential problems, Reuters reported.</p><p>\"I think it is important that governments and regulations tackle it sooner rather than later and give a framework for it,\" Pichai said.</p><p>\"It can be immediate but maybe there's a waiting period before we really think about how it's being used,\" he said. \"It's up to governments to chart the course\" for the use of such technology.</p><p>Smith, who is also Microsoft's chief legal officer, however cited the benefits of facial recognition technology in some instances such as NGOs using it to find missing children.</p><p>\"I'm really reluctant to say let's stop people from using technology in a way that will reunite families when it can help them do it,\" Smith said.</p><p>\"The second thing I would say is you don't ban it if you actually believe there is a reasonable alternative that will enable us to, say, address this problem with a scalpel instead of a meat cleaver,\" he said.</p><p>Smith said it was important to first identify problems and then craft rules to ensure that the technology would not be used for mass surveillance.</p><p>\"There is only one way at the end of the day to make technology better and that is to use it,\" he said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/319/1056/73/157960464566.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/319/1056/73/157960464566.jpeg</url></p><p>Alphabet CEO calls for regulation of AI<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRNDLY-165092514</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRNDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1J-SKY1-F11P-X2CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"632\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Iran Cultural &amp;

The only question is how to approach it.\"</p><p>Artificial intelligence is often defined as computer systems that have been developed to perform functions normally done by humans. Among the areas that AI has been touted as being used for are visual perception, speech recognition and language translation.</p><p>Pichai noted that while as CEO of Google, in 2018 the company published its own set of principles to serve as a guide for what he called \"the ethical development and use\" of AI. However, Pichai added that \"principles that remain on paper are meaningless\" and that there is a role for governments to play in setting stronger guidelines for the use of AI as its use become more public. Pichai said the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation rules on the use of personal data can serve as a guideline for further governmental involvement in AI supervision.</p><p>\"Good regulatory frameworks will consider safety, explainability, fairness and accountability to ensure we develop the right tools in the right ways,\" Pichai said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/23/23andme-cuts-100-jobs-as-dna-testing-market-slows/\">23andMe cuts 100 jobs as DNA testing market slows       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/20/revamped-plans-sprout-at-key-downtown-san-jose-site/\">           Hotel, housing plans sprout at downtown San Jose site       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/18/bloomberg-breaking-big-tech/\">           Bloomberg says Warren, Sanders don't 'know what they're talking about' on breaking up big tech firms       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/17/google-protesters-disrupt-future-of-downtown-san-jose-event/\">Google protesters disrupt 'Future of Downtown San Jose' event       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/16/google-crafts-changes-improve-downtown-san-jose-transit-village-tech-real-estate-office-housing/\">Google downtown San Jose transit village update       </url>   Pichai's comments came ahead of a policy speech on AI he was scheduled to give at the European Union headquarters in Brussels on Monday.</p><p>The rise of AI has been controversial, as such technology has been used to create deepfake videos, or videos that have been altered to make a person appear as if they are saying something they didn't actually say.

network access to previously uncovered populations via stratospheric internet balloons<br/>Mountain View, CA, May 13, 2020 -- Alphabet's Loon and Vodacom have signed a deal to use Loon's balloon-powered internet solution to expand the Vodacom network in Mozambique. In terms of the agreement, Loon will help Vodacom provide service to un-served and under-served parts of the country with a network of floating cell phone towers that operate 20 kilometres above Earth. <br/>Using the Loon solution, Vodacom will expand mobile network access to Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, two regions that have proven hard to cover in the past due to the vast and logistically challenging geographical areas, together with low population density. The Loon solution will provide a 4G service that supports Data, Voice, SMS and USSD, which will also enable mobile financial services. The service will be available to any Vodacom subscriber with a standard 4G-VoLTE enabled handset and SIM card. Users will not need to do anything special to connect to the service; they will connect just as they would to a normal cell tower. In fact, it's unlikely that a user will know that they are connected to the service provided by a high altitude balloon, except for the fact that they may have a signal in a location where it previously did not exist.<br/>Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub says \"Vodacom's partnership with Loon is a perfect example of how technological innovation can connect the most rural communities in Africa. We are pleased to be part of this initiative in Mozambique, which is helping to bridge the digital divide. This is even more pertinent in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, where more Mozambicans will now have access to healthcare information through our Loon partnership.</p><p>1.4 People's News<br/>Thu Jul 30, 2020<br/>David C.

Ken Buck (R-Colo.) about it's 'monopolistic advantage during a hearing in front of the House antitrust subcommittee.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 29: Watch Google parent Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai's opening testimony to Congress<br/>The CEOs from four of the largest tech companies are testifying in front of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust Wednesday.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 28: Google CEO Sundar Pichai plans to tell Congress the company faces plenty of competition<br/>Google CEO Sundar Pichai says the company has offered a competitive platform that has lowered prices advertisers, giving consumers more choice, according to prepared remarks the executive made ahead of Wednesday's hearing before the House Antitrust Subcommittee.<br/>\"A competitive digital ad marketplace gives publishers and advertisers, and therefore consumers, an enormous amount of choice,\" Pichai stated. \"For example, competition in ads - from Twitter, Instagram, Comcast and others - has helped lower online advertising costs by 40% over the last 10 years, with these saving passed down to consumers through lower prices.\"<br/>Nonetheless, Google remains the largest digital ad platform by market share. Last year, Google held 31.6% of total digital advertising spending with Facebook and Amazon holding 22.7% and 7.8% respectively, according to eMarketer.<br/>The statement comes ahead of Pichai joining Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before the House Antitrust Subcommittee on Wednesday. The committee's probe is expected to result in a report and legislative proposals for how to address antitrust issues in the digital marketplace. Potential laws could inform how state regulators crack down on anti-competitive practices in the future.<br/>Google's most common critics ask questions about whether it favors its own products or suppresses competitors through its dominance in search and digital advertising. The company has already faced fines from the European Commission's competition authority over its shopping search tool and Android mobile operating system, which Pichai said in his prepared remarks was \"deliberately\" built to encourage competition.<br/>Pichai goes on to cite Amazon's Alexa, Twitter, Snapchat, and Facebook-owned WhatsApp as competitive platforms where people get information.<br/>\"In areas like travel and real estate, Google faces strong competition for search queries from many businesses that are experts in those areas,\" Pichai stated in the written remarks.</p><p>July 27: Google will keep employees home until July 2021<br/>CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" crew discuss Google's decision to have employees work from home until July 2021.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 24: Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google CEO congressional hearing officially delayed<br/>The highly anticipated antitrust hearing featuring CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google has officially been postponed by the House Judiciary Committee. A new date has not been announced.<br/>The hearing was initially set to take place on Monday, but is now delayed due to memorial services for the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., which are scheduled to take place on the same day.<br/>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, were prepared to testify virtually on Monday before the House Antitrust Subcommittee. The hearing is meant to be a culmination of an investigation into the four tech giants that began in June 2019 to assess their competitive practices and the efficacy of antitrust laws for the new digital marketplace. Following the hearing, the subcommittee is expected to issue a report of its findings as well as legislative proposals aiming to update the antitrust laws.<br/>The probe had already been delayed by the pandemic, pushing back the timeline for issuing the report from early April to likely sometime in the Fall.<br/>While Congress' investigation won't directly result in any enforcement actions on the companies, probes by U.S. antitrust regulators, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, could. The DOJ is reportedly preparing a case against Google while the FTC continues to investigate Facebook and Amazon, according to reports. Regulators have also been asking questions about Apple, though formal scrutiny has so far only been announces in the abroad. The company is facing two antitrust investigations in the European Union.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 23: Microsoft's slowdown in search advertising could spell tough news ahead for Google<br/>Microsoft's advertising business struggled last quarter, as advertisers cut their budgets during the coronavirus pandemic and corresponding spike in U.S. unemployment.<br/>That outcome could spell bad news for search advertising rival Google, whose parent company Alphabet reports second quarter earnings next week.<br/>On Wednesday, Microsoft said that search revenue minus traffic acquisition costs fell 18% from the year-ago quarter as customers spent less on ads.<br/>One quarter ago, that part of Microsoft's business was up 1% year-over-year, while Google search ad revenue declined 9.4%. Google's search engine is more widely used than Microsoft's Bing; Google had about 84% market share in June, while Bing had 6%, according to NetMarketShare.<br/>Microsoft as a whole saw slower growth as the coronavirus affected many parts of its business last quarter, but portions of its business like gaming, cloud infrastructure and productivity software helped smooth out the results as people remained at home around the world to reduce spread of the coronavirus. Alphabet is less diversified than Microsoft, with 84% of its revenue coming from Google advertising in the first quarter.<br/>Analysts polled by Refinitiv currently expect $37.35 billion in second-quarter revenue from Alphabet, suggesting a 4% year-over-year decline. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<br/>Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said Wednesday that the company expects search revenue for the current quarter, excluding traffic acquisition costs, to be down \"in the low 20% range.\" (Microsoft's fiscal year ended June 30.)<br/>Amid a broad sell-off in tech stocks on Thursday, Alphabet Class A shares were down as much as 3.5% and Microsoft stock traded as much as 4.4% lower.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 22: Homebuyers can now turn to Google Search for detailed info about mortgages<br/>Google on Wednesday updated its search engine with new tools for people shopping for mortgages, including a calculator, recent average mortgage rates and key terms homebuyers may need to know during the mortgage shopping process.<br/>Google teamed up with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to launch the new tools because it found that a lot of people were asking questions like \"what is a mortgage?\" and \"what is APR?\" among others.<br/>The tools are available on phones when you search \"mortgage.\" Just scroll down past the ads and you'll see it.<br/>Here's the kind of information it provides.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 21: Apple, Google and Sony will be critical to MLB season shortened by coronavirus<br/>Major League Baseball will look to Big Tech companies like Apple and Google to help with its shortened season that is scheduled to begin Thursday.<br/>On Monday, MLB provided a preview of how games will look and sound during the pandemic, with features like artificial crowd noise and an upgraded replay system for fans watching from home.<br/>Two games are scheduled for opening night: The defending World Series champion Washington Nationals host the New York Yankees at 7 p.m. ET, followed by the Los Angeles Dodgers hosting the San Francisco Giants at 10 p.m. ET.<br/>As part of the league's Covid-19 health and safety protocols, MLB said it would ban traditional video stations shared throughout clubhouses. The league took advantage of its 2016 partnership with Apple to expand the dugout iPad program. It will now distribute 15 iPads to each team for players and staff to dissect performances and additional team content like scouting reports.<br/>Google will also play a part, with all 30 teams using Google Cloud to run MLB's stat-tracking system, Statcast, and provide digital infrastructure for everything from team websites to online ticket sales.<br/>MLB partnered with the Google in March to be the league's official cloud partner. Jason Gaedtke, MLB chief technology officer, said Monday that the league selected Google for the firm's \"strength in large scale data processing, analytics and specifically machine-learning.\"<br/>With its Statcast 3D platform powered by Google, MLB said broadcasts can re-create game footage in a variety of virtual perspectives. Concepts like displaying a player's home run trails, pitching angles from a catcher and umpire's perspective and how play is affected by weather conditions will now be available for national and regional broadcast partners.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 20: Alphabet Class A<br/>Credit Suisse hiked its price target on the Google parent to $1,850 per share from $1,600 per share. The new price target implies an upside of 22% from Friday's close of $1,516.85. The analyst cited: \"1) ongoing monetization improvements in Search advertising through product/AI driven updates, 2) greater-than expected revenue contribution from non-Search businesses (YouTube, Cloud, and Play), 3) optionality and shareholder value creation from new monetization initiatives such as Maps\" positive catalysts for the stock. Alphabet shares rose more than 2%.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 17: Google will ban ads from running on stories spreading debunked coronavirus conspiracy theories<br/>Google next month will ban publishers from using its ad platform to show advertisements next to content that promotes conspiracy theories about Covid-19. It will also ban ads that promote those theories. In cases where a particular site publishes a certain threshold of material that violates these policies, it will ban the entire site from using its ad platforms.<br/>Alphabet's Google already prohibits ads from running against content that makes harmful claims about disease prevention and unsubstantiated cures, including anti-vaccine promotions or content that encourages users to forgo treatment. The company is now taking it a step further and banning ads against content that make claims going against authoritative scientific consensus. Banned claims would include conspiracy theories like vaccines being attempts to genetically modify the population, that Bill Gates created Covid-19 or that the disease was a bioweapon made in a Chinese lab.<br/>Google received nearly $135 billion in advertising revenue in 2019, in part through programs like AdSense and Ad Manager, in which websites that are approved can run programmatic advertising on their sites and make money using Google. About 15% of Google's revenue in the first quarter came from \"Google Network Members' properties,\" which the company said in its annual report primarily comes from sites participating in AdMob, AdSense and Google Ad Manager programs.<br/>Google will begin enforcing the change on Aug. 18, and can remove ads from single articles or, in some cases, entire sites. When it comes to removing ads from an entire site, the company said for most of its policies it has a percentage threshold for policy violations before it will fully demonetize a website. (The violation of some policies, like one preventing child sex abuse material, is considered by the company to be so egregious that they result in immediate site-level action).<br/>The news comes the same week as CNBC first reported that Google had begun running ads again on financial market website Zero Hedge.</p><p>1.6 Stock Buzz</p><p>1.7 Analyst Recommendations: Past Month<br/><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"160\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"264\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Brokerage</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Current Rating</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 27, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Buy</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 26, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Buy</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 25, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Buy</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 24, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Buy</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>SECTION 2 Corporate Profile and Independent Ratings<br/>2.1 Activities<br/>Alphabet Inc maintains an index of Websites and other online content, and makes this information freely available through its search engine to anyone with an Internet connection.

network access to previously uncovered populations via stratospheric internet balloons<br/>Mountain View, CA, May 13, 2020 -- Alphabet's Loon and Vodacom have signed a deal to use Loon's balloon-powered internet solution to expand the Vodacom network in Mozambique. In terms of the agreement, Loon will help Vodacom provide service to un-served and under-served parts of the country with a network of floating cell phone towers that operate 20 kilometres above Earth. <br/>Using the Loon solution, Vodacom will expand mobile network access to Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, two regions that have proven hard to cover in the past due to the vast and logistically challenging geographical areas, together with low population density. The Loon solution will provide a 4G service that supports Data, Voice, SMS and USSD, which will also enable mobile financial services. The service will be available to any Vodacom subscriber with a standard 4G-VoLTE enabled handset and SIM card. Users will not need to do anything special to connect to the service; they will connect just as they would to a normal cell tower. In fact, it's unlikely that a user will know that they are connected to the service provided by a high altitude balloon, except for the fact that they may have a signal in a location where it previously did not exist.<br/>Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub says \"Vodacom's partnership with Loon is a perfect example of how technological innovation can connect the most rural communities in Africa. We are pleased to be part of this initiative in Mozambique, which is helping to bridge the digital divide. This is even more pertinent in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, where more Mozambicans will now have access to healthcare information through our Loon partnership.</p><p>1.4 People's News<br/>Tue Jun 30, 2020<br/>Alphabet Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai holds 1,459 shares worth USD2.1 million at the last price of USD1,418.05, a fall in value by USD27,648 (1.3%).

A new date has not been announced.<br/>The hearing was initially set to take place on Monday, but is now delayed due to memorial services for the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., which are scheduled to take place on the same day.<br/>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, were prepared to testify virtually on Monday before the House Antitrust Subcommittee. The hearing is meant to be a culmination of an investigation into the four tech giants that began in June 2019 to assess their competitive practices and the efficacy of antitrust laws for the new digital marketplace. Following the hearing, the subcommittee is expected to issue a report of its findings as well as legislative proposals aiming to update the antitrust laws.<br/>The probe had already been delayed by the pandemic, pushing back the timeline for issuing the report from early April to likely sometime in the Fall.<br/>While Congress' investigation won't directly result in any enforcement actions on the companies, probes by U.S. antitrust regulators, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, could. The DOJ is reportedly preparing a case against Google while the FTC continues to investigate Facebook and Amazon, according to reports. Regulators have also been asking questions about Apple, though formal scrutiny has so far only been announces in the abroad. The company is facing two antitrust investigations in the European Union.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 23: Microsoft's slowdown in search advertising could spell tough news ahead for Google<br/>Microsoft's advertising business struggled last quarter, as advertisers cut their budgets during the coronavirus pandemic and corresponding spike in U.S. unemployment.<br/>That outcome could spell bad news for search advertising rival Google, whose parent company Alphabet reports second quarter earnings next week.<br/>On Wednesday, Microsoft said that search revenue minus traffic acquisition costs fell 18% from the year-ago quarter as customers spent less on ads.<br/>One quarter ago, that part of Microsoft's business was up 1% year-over-year, while Google search ad revenue declined 9.4%. Google's search engine is more widely used than Microsoft's Bing; Google had about 84% market share in June, while Bing had 6%, according to NetMarketShare.<br/>Microsoft as a whole saw slower growth as the coronavirus affected many parts of its business last quarter, but portions of its business like gaming, cloud infrastructure and productivity software helped smooth out the results as people remained at home around the world to reduce spread of the coronavirus. Alphabet is less diversified than Microsoft, with 84% of its revenue coming from Google advertising in the first quarter.<br/>Analysts polled by Refinitiv currently expect $37.35 billion in second-quarter revenue from Alphabet, suggesting a 4% year-over-year decline. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<br/>Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said Wednesday that the company expects search revenue for the current quarter, excluding traffic acquisition costs, to be down \"in the low 20% range.\" (Microsoft's fiscal year ended June 30.)<br/>Amid a broad sell-off in tech stocks on Thursday, Alphabet Class A shares were down as much as 3.5% and Microsoft stock traded as much as 4.4% lower.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 22: Homebuyers can now turn to Google Search for detailed info about mortgages<br/>Google on Wednesday updated its search engine with new tools for people shopping for mortgages, including a calculator, recent average mortgage rates and key terms homebuyers may need to know during the mortgage shopping process.<br/>Google teamed up with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to launch the new tools because it found that a lot of people were asking questions like \"what is a mortgage?\" and \"what is APR?\" among others.<br/>The tools are available on phones when you search \"mortgage.\" Just scroll down past the ads and you'll see it.<br/>Here's the kind of information it provides.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 21: Apple, Google and Sony will be critical to MLB season shortened by coronavirus<br/>Major League Baseball will look to Big Tech companies like Apple and Google to help with its shortened season that is scheduled to begin Thursday.<br/>On Monday, MLB provided a preview of how games will look and sound during the pandemic, with features like artificial crowd noise and an upgraded replay system for fans watching from home.<br/>Two games are scheduled for opening night: The defending World Series champion Washington Nationals host the New York Yankees at 7 p.m. ET, followed by the Los Angeles Dodgers hosting the San Francisco Giants at 10 p.m. ET.<br/>As part of the league's Covid-19 health and safety protocols, MLB said it would ban traditional video stations shared throughout clubhouses. The league took advantage of its 2016 partnership with Apple to expand the dugout iPad program. It will now distribute 15 iPads to each team for players and staff to dissect performances and additional team content like scouting reports.<br/>Google will also play a part, with all 30 teams using Google Cloud to run MLB's stat-tracking system, Statcast, and provide digital infrastructure for everything from team websites to online ticket sales.<br/>MLB partnered with the Google in March to be the league's official cloud partner. Jason Gaedtke, MLB chief technology officer, said Monday that the league selected Google for the firm's \"strength in large scale data processing, analytics and specifically machine-learning.\"<br/>With its Statcast 3D platform powered by Google, MLB said broadcasts can re-create game footage in a variety of virtual perspectives. Concepts like displaying a player's home run trails, pitching angles from a catcher and umpire's perspective and how play is affected by weather conditions will now be available for national and regional broadcast partners.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 20: Alphabet Class A<br/>Credit Suisse hiked its price target on the Google parent to $1,850 per share from $1,600 per share. The new price target implies an upside of 22% from Friday's close of $1,516.85. The analyst cited: \"1) ongoing monetization improvements in Search advertising through product/AI driven updates, 2) greater-than expected revenue contribution from non-Search businesses (YouTube, Cloud, and Play), 3) optionality and shareholder value creation from new monetization initiatives such as Maps\" positive catalysts for the stock. Alphabet shares rose more than 2%.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 17: Google will ban ads from running on stories spreading debunked coronavirus conspiracy theories<br/>Google next month will ban publishers from using its ad platform to show advertisements next to content that promotes conspiracy theories about Covid-19. It will also ban ads that promote those theories. In cases where a particular site publishes a certain threshold of material that violates these policies, it will ban the entire site from using its ad platforms.<br/>Alphabet's Google already prohibits ads from running against content that makes harmful claims about disease prevention and unsubstantiated cures, including anti-vaccine promotions or content that encourages users to forgo treatment. The company is now taking it a step further and banning ads against content that make claims going against authoritative scientific consensus. Banned claims would include conspiracy theories like vaccines being attempts to genetically modify the population, that Bill Gates created Covid-19 or that the disease was a bioweapon made in a Chinese lab.<br/>Google received nearly $135 billion in advertising revenue in 2019, in part through programs like AdSense and Ad Manager, in which websites that are approved can run programmatic advertising on their sites and make money using Google. About 15% of Google's revenue in the first quarter came from \"Google Network Members' properties,\" which the company said in its annual report primarily comes from sites participating in AdMob, AdSense and Google Ad Manager programs.<br/>Google will begin enforcing the change on Aug. 18, and can remove ads from single articles or, in some cases, entire sites. When it comes to removing ads from an entire site, the company said for most of its policies it has a percentage threshold for policy violations before it will fully demonetize a website. (The violation of some policies, like one preventing child sex abuse material, is considered by the company to be so egregious that they result in immediate site-level action).<br/>The news comes the same week as CNBC first reported that Google had begun running ads again on financial market website Zero Hedge.</p><p>July 17: Alphabet Class A<br/>Alongside Netflix, the so-called FANG stocks slid, continuing technology stocks weakness this week. Facebook lost 0.5% and Alphabet dropped nearly 1%. Microsoft and Amazon lost 0.6% and 0.9%, respectively. All of the FANG stocks are headed for big weekly declines.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 16: Alphabet Class A<br/>SunTrust raised its price target on the Google parent to a Street high $1,805 per share, based on what it sees as better-than-expected trends in the company's search ad business among other factors.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 15: Google takes on Zoom and Slack by bundling video calls and chat into Gmail for business users<br/>Google is making its popular Gmail app more of a productivity powerhouse.<br/>The Alphabet subsidiary is incorporating more applications into the business version of Gmail so that users don't need to switch to other apps or browser tabs, It could help keep employees satisfied with the company's business software and not want to adopt alternative services, such as Slack or Zoom.<br/>That's an important consideration for building up the cloud business that augments Google and Alphabet's advertising core. The coronavirus hurt Google's ad revenue in the first quarter, but as schools and offices closed, people began to lean more on digital services that could help them continue to communicate, which led to greater adoption of Google services like the Meet calling service.<br/>Now Meet will be accessible inside of Gmail for business customers, along with Google Docs and the the Google Chats service for team communication. In 2018 Google did something similar to Gmail, enhancing it with stripped-down versions of Google Calendar and the Google Keep to-do list app.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 15: Alphabet Class A<br/>Alphabet's Google unit will pay $4.5 billion for a 7.7% stake in the digital arm of India's Reliance Industries.

In terms of the agreement, Loon will help Vodacom provide service to un-served and under-served parts of the country with a network of floating cell phone towers that operate 20 kilometres above Earth. <br/>Using the Loon solution, Vodacom will expand mobile network access to Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, two regions that have proven hard to cover in the past due to the vast and logistically challenging geographical areas, together with low population density. The Loon solution will provide a 4G service that supports Data, Voice, SMS and USSD, which will also enable mobile financial services. The service will be available to any Vodacom subscriber with a standard 4G-VoLTE enabled handset and SIM card. Users will not need to do anything special to connect to the service; they will connect just as they would to a normal cell tower. In fact, it's unlikely that a user will know that they are connected to the service provided by a high altitude balloon, except for the fact that they may have a signal in a location where it previously did not exist.<br/>Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub says \"Vodacom's partnership with Loon is a perfect example of how technological innovation can connect the most rural communities in Africa. We are pleased to be part of this initiative in Mozambique, which is helping to bridge the digital divide. This is even more pertinent in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, where more Mozambicans will now have access to healthcare information through our Loon partnership.</p><p>April 29: Alphabet Class A HAPS Alliance Members Outline Commercial Opportunity in Earth's Stratosphere<br/>Mountain View, CA, April 29, 2020 -- Loon LLC, Airbus Defence and Space, HAPSMobile Inc., Intelsat US LLC, and Nokia Corporation see a rare, untapped commercial opportunity in the skies above Earth's atmosphere. All members of the recently-formed HAPS Alliance, the companies outlined in a White Paper published today a multi-billion dollar market opportunity in Earth's stratosphere, spanning telecommunications, high-resolution earth observation, and weather prediction and modeling.<br/>Earth's stratosphere - which spans from just above the lower atmosphere to the edge of space - has long been deemed unsuitable for commercial operations because of its harsh conditions. However, advances in technology over the last decade have made operating in the stratosphere possible, making the region ripe for commercial activity going forward.<br/>The White Paper outlines significant opportunity in the telecommunications sector, with the ability of stratospheric technologies to drive significant growth in the $3.9 trillion mobile technologies and services business by bringing millions of people online, reconnecting people after disasters, building out the next generation of 5G networks, and connecting the future of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.<br/>Another area of commercial opportunity outlined in the White Paper is earth observation (EO) and weather prediction and modeling. The $3 billion satellite segment of the EO market is growing steadily, as is the $4.4 billion drone service market. As stratospheric technologies develop, they will tap into portions of both markets, while stimulating new market demand due to their unique capabilities. Potential use-cases include: collecting data around natural and man-made disasters to enable more effective responses to wildfires, oil spills, floods and more; tracking meteorology to improve weather forecasts; monitoring natural resources, agriculture and infrastructure; and tracking large stretches of oceans for illegal fishing, pollution, or piracy.</p><p>1.4 People's News<br/>Tue Jun 30, 2020<br/>Alphabet Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai holds 1,459 shares worth USD2.1 million at the last price of USD1,418.05, a fall in value by USD27,648 (1.3%).

The value of the deal was not disclosed, but the Globe and Mail, which first reported Google's interest, placed the price at around $180 million, which is less than the $200 million the company had raised, according to Crunchbase.<br/>Google was an early pioneer in the field of augmented reality, where computer-generated images are superimposed over the real world, often in a pair of computerized glasses. Google Glass, one of the first such devices, was unveiled in 2012, but high initial pricing and privacy concerns -- the glasses contained a video camera -- doomed its appeal among consumers. Nonetheless, Google continues to make a version of Google Glass available to enterprises, where it competes with Microsoft's HoloLens.<br/>Google said that the acquisition would help realize its vision of \"ambient computing,\" where ubiquitous connected devices work together.<br/>\"We're building towards a future where helpfulness is all around you, where all your devices just work together and technology fades into the background,\" Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of devices and services at Google said in a statement. \"North's technical expertise will help as we continue to invest in our hardware efforts and ambient computing future.\"<br/>The Canadian company, formerly known as Thalmic Labs, rebranded in 2018 when it unveiled its holographic smart glasses, called Focals. North said Tuesday that it will not ship its updated version of glasses, Focals 2.0, which were to hit the market this year after the company announced it would wind down production of its first-generation model.<br/>The company will remain in Canada.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 10: Chamath Palihapitiya: Here's why you go short big tech stocks Facebook and Alphabet right now<br/>Former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya on Friday laid out his bearish case for the social media giant as well as Google parent Alphabet.<br/>Palihapitiya, founder and CEO of investment firm Social Capital, said in a series of tweets that there are a handful of negative catalysts to drive these shares down over the next few years, including increased regulatory scrutiny, taxes and new product experiences.<br/>\"Big Tech's long term success is no longer about better products,\" Palihapitiya said in a Friday tweet. \"They are incumbents and their success is now a multi-variate/multi-dimensional problem of competition, anti-trust, tax and regulatory multiplied by EVERY city, state, country and jurisdiction in which the operate.\"<br/>Facebook and Alphabet have been a relatively bright spot in a market that experienced unprecedented disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic. Shares of Facebook have climbed 17% this year, while Alphabet has gained more than 13%.<br/>Investors piled into mega-cap technology companies this year for their insulation from the global health crisis. Thanks to the resilience of Big Tech, the Nasdaq Composite became the first major U.S. equity benchmark to hit a new high.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 10: Google bans ads for products and services that secretly track or monitor people<br/>Google says it will no longer allow ads for products or services marketed for tracking or monitoring another person without their authorization.<br/>In an ad policy update, Google said this will apply to spyware and technology used for intimate partner surveillance, including tech used to monitor texts, phone calls or browsing history. It also applies to GPS trackers marketed to spy on someone without their consent, along with surveillance equipment such as cameras, audio recorders, dash cams and nanny cams marketed for the purpose of spying.<br/>Google said private investigation services and products and services for parents to track or monitor their underage children will not apply. The \"Enabling Dishonest Behavior\" policy update will be enforced beginning Aug. 11.<br/>In 2018, a group of researchers conducting a study on the ecosystem of intimate partner surveillance spyware found thousands of Google ads appeared for search terms that showed explicit intention of conducting surveillance.<br/>The ads discovered included: \"How to catch a cheating spouse with his cell phone\" and \"Track My Wife's Phone - Want to Spy on your Wife? Track your Wife without her knowing. Discover Who Are They messaging. Download! 24-Hour Support Price Superiority No Jailbreaking and App Results Guaranteed.\"<br/>The researchers said in the study that Google had started to restrict ads for those types of search terms. Ads were not being shown on explicit search terms for intimate partner surveillance at the time the study was published.<br/>\"We constantly evaluate and update our ad policies to ensure we are protecting users,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"We routinely update our language with examples to help clarify what we consider policy violating. Spyware technology for partner surveillance was always in scope of our policies against dishonest behavior.\"</p><p>July 09: Google parent company Alphabet just launched balloons that beam high-speed internet in Kenya<br/>Alphabet's Loon said its balloon-powered internet service will initially cover 50,000 square kilometers in western and central parts of Kenya. It aims to take a fleet of 35 balloons to the skies above eastern Africa \"in the coming weeks.\" The news represents a significant milestone after years of publicity about the Alphabet-owned venture.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 09: Google's chief compliance officer Andy Hinton left in March, advising start-up for reporting workplace issues<br/>Google's chief compliance officer for more than a decade, Andy Hinton, has departed the company, following a wave of executive departures that started in December.<br/>Hinton left the company in late March, he told CNBC in an interview. He's becoming an advisor to a start-up called #NotMe, which claims to allow employees to make anonymous complaints about workplace issues, including the types of complaints Google has faced in recent years. However, Hinton said the mounting controversies at Google weren't the reason for his departure, and that he wanted to spend more time with family.<br/>Hinton served as vice-president and chief compliance officer at Google for more than 13 years. Compliance chiefs at large companies like Google typically help them comply with regulations and internal guidelines and bylaws.<br/>His departure comes in amid of a slow-rolling executive shakeup over the last several months. In December, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin stepped down from their roles as the CEO and President of Google's holding company, Alphabet. The company's long-time chief legal officer David Drummond retired at the end of January. In February, Google human resources chief Eileen Naughton said she'd be stepping down from her role.<br/>It also comes amid growing tensions between employees and management.<br/>A shareholder lawsuit launched last year alleged several senior execs mishandled claims of sexual misconduct at the company (Hinton was not named in that lawsuit), and the company's board of directors has investigated some of those claims. Other employees have alleged that when they did try to report misconduct to the company's human resources department, they were instead faced with retaliation. Alphabet also faces a number of issues related to data privacy and an imminent antitrust hearing with the U.S.</p><p>July 08: Alphabet's Loon starts beaming internet from balloons in Kenya<br/>Alphabet's Loon project has finally launched its internet-delivery balloons in Africa following a deal with the Kenyan government.<br/>It marks a significant milestone for Loon, once one of Google's \"moonshot\" projects, and follows years of publicity about the venture. Loon said its service would initially cover 50,000 square kilometers in western and central parts of Kenya.<br/>The firm has partnered with local telecommunications operator Telkom Kenya to beam 4G internet from its solar-powered balloons. It aims to take a fleet of 35 balloons to the skies above eastern Africa \"in the coming weeks.\"<br/>Loon calls the project a \"floating network of cell towers,\" aimed at providing internet from high altitudes to vast swathes of the Earth where service is not available. Rather than delivering connectivity from the ground through cell towers and cables, or from space via satellites, Loon says it is building a \"third layer\" in the stratosphere.<br/>\"While this sounds like a far-off, science-fiction future, it's not. Just look to Kenya,\" Loon CEO Alastair Westgarth said in a blog post.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 07: Needham lowers Google estimates amid 'search weakness' and growing threat from Amazon<br/>Needham analysts predict Google's second quarter revenue will be down 7% year-over-year because of the company's declining U.S. search revenue. That's a downgrade from the firm's previous expectations of a 5% drop.<br/>In June, eMarketer estimated that U.S. net search ad revenue would drop 7.2% this year. Needham analysts said they agree with the firm's call for declining U.S. search revenue, and said their sources suggest international ad revenues are down even more than in the U.S.<br/>Google's ad weakness is being driven by \"material declines in travel, auto, entertainment, media and retail ads - both search and video ads,\" Needham analysts said.<br/>\"Until COVID-19 is controlled enough that the economy strengthens and consumer demand returns,\" analysts said they expected those travel, entertainment, media and retail categories would remain weak.<br/>Travel-related ad spend, which Google relies on heavily, was greatly affected by the pandemic amid stay-at-home orders and travel limitations. Needham analysts added that rising unemployment and GDP declines are driving lower consumer spending during Covid-19, which lowers advertising return-on-investments and, thus, search ad revenue.<br/>Needham now expects Google's revenue to be flat or slightly down for the full year. It previously expected growth of between 2% and 3%.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 01: UK competition watchdog seeks to curb Google and Facebook's dominance of online advertising<br/>Britain's competition watchdog has set out recommendations for new regulations to tackle the dominance of Google and Facebook in the online advertising market.<br/>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Wednesday that it had proposed the creation of a \"Digital Markets Unit\" designed to rein in platforms with \"a position of market power\" when it comes to digital ads.<br/>The new unit would enforce a code of conduct on Google, Facebook and other major players in the industry to make sure they don't \"engage in exploitative or exclusionary practices.\" It would have the power to impose fines on the companies if necessary.<br/>Under newly proposed rules, the CMA is asking for the ability to order Google to share click and query data with rival search engines, force Facebook to give consumers a choice over whether to accept targeted advertising and to impose a \"separation of platforms where necessary.\"<br/>The CMA said it wants to \"lift the lid on how advertising revenue drives the business model of major platforms.\" According to the regulator, around 80% of the Pound14 billion ($17 billion) of U.K. spending on digital ads in 2019 went to Google and Facebook. Google has a more than 90% share of the search advertising market in the U.K., the CMA said, while Facebook controls more than 50% of the display advertising sector.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>June 30: Google raises price of YouTube TV, its cable-like bundle, to $65 a month<br/>Google-owned YouTube is raising its price for its television subscription service to $64.99 a month, an increase of $15, the company said Tuesday.<br/>This new price takes effect June 30 for new members and the July 30 billing cycle for existing subscribers. The service, which allows customers to watch more than 80 TV channels over the internet, had 2 million subscribers as of the end of 2019, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the company's Q4 2019 earnings call. By way of comparison, market-leading U.S. cable TV provider Comcast reported 19.9 million residential video customers in Q1 2020.<br/>\"We don't take these decisions lightly, and realize how hard this is for our members,\" Google said about the price increases in a Tuesday blog post. \"That said, this new price reflects the rising cost of content and we also believe it reflects the complete value of YouTube TV, from our breadth of content to the features that are changing how we watch live TV.\"<br/>The latest price bump comes at the three-year anniversary of YouTube TV and follows a $10 price increase last April. It suggests streaming TV providers are having a difficult time competing with traditional cable networks as they scale and add channels, despite originally being touted as a lower-cost alternative to cable.<br/>YouTube TV said earlier this year that it would be adding more of ViacomCBS brands to YouTube TV, including BET, CMT, Comedy Central, and Paramount Network. It went on to defend the price increase by saying it's the only streaming service that includes a DVR with unlimited storage space and allows six accounts per household.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>June 25: Alphabet Class A<br/>Alphabet's Google unit agreed to pay some publishers in Australia, Brazil and Germany for certain content, and said it expects to sign similar deals with others.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>1.6 Stock Buzz</p><p>SECTION 2 Corporate Profile and Independent Ratings<br/>2.1 Activities<br/>Alphabet Inc maintains an index of Websites and other online content, and makes this information freely available through its search engine to anyone with an Internet connection.

Q1/2019], year-over-year [y.o.y.] EPS was up 4%, Revenue was up 13.3% and Net Profit was up 2.7%.</p><p>1.3 Press Releases<br/>May 13: Alphabet Class A Alphabet's Loon and Vodacom partner to increase rural internet access in Mozambique<br/>Loon and Vodacom partner to bring network access to previously uncovered populations via stratospheric internet balloons<br/>Mountain View, CA, May 13, 2020 -- Alphabet's Loon and Vodacom have signed a deal to use Loon's balloon-powered internet solution to expand the Vodacom network in Mozambique. In terms of the agreement, Loon will help Vodacom provide service to un-served and under-served parts of the country with a network of floating cell phone towers that operate 20 kilometres above Earth. <br/>Using the Loon solution, Vodacom will expand mobile network access to Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, two regions that have proven hard to cover in the past due to the vast and logistically challenging geographical areas, together with low population density. The Loon solution will provide a 4G service that supports Data, Voice, SMS and USSD, which will also enable mobile financial services. The service will be available to any Vodacom subscriber with a standard 4G-VoLTE enabled handset and SIM card. Users will not need to do anything special to connect to the service; they will connect just as they would to a normal cell tower. In fact, it's unlikely that a user will know that they are connected to the service provided by a high altitude balloon, except for the fact that they may have a signal in a location where it previously did not exist.<br/>Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub says \"Vodacom's partnership with Loon is a perfect example of how technological innovation can connect the most rural communities in Africa. We are pleased to be part of this initiative in Mozambique, which is helping to bridge the digital divide. This is even more pertinent in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, where more Mozambicans will now have access to healthcare information through our Loon partnership.</p><p>April 29: Alphabet Class A HAPS Alliance Members Outline Commercial Opportunity in Earth's Stratosphere<br/>Mountain View, CA, April 29, 2020 -- Loon LLC, Airbus Defence and Space, HAPSMobile Inc., Intelsat US LLC, and Nokia Corporation see a rare, untapped commercial opportunity in the skies above Earth's atmosphere. All members of the recently-formed HAPS Alliance, the companies outlined in a White Paper published today a multi-billion dollar market opportunity in Earth's stratosphere, spanning telecommunications, high-resolution earth observation, and weather prediction and modeling.<br/>Earth's stratosphere - which spans from just above the lower atmosphere to the edge of space - has long been deemed unsuitable for commercial operations because of its harsh conditions. However, advances in technology over the last decade have made operating in the stratosphere possible, making the region ripe for commercial activity going forward.<br/>The White Paper outlines significant opportunity in the telecommunications sector, with the ability of stratospheric technologies to drive significant growth in the $3.9 trillion mobile technologies and services business by bringing millions of people online, reconnecting people after disasters, building out the next generation of 5G networks, and connecting the future of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.<br/>Another area of commercial opportunity outlined in the White Paper is earth observation (EO) and weather prediction and modeling. The $3 billion satellite segment of the EO market is growing steadily, as is the $4.4 billion drone service market. As stratospheric technologies develop, they will tap into portions of both markets, while stimulating new market demand due to their unique capabilities. Potential use-cases include: collecting data around natural and man-made disasters to enable more effective responses to wildfires, oil spills, floods and more; tracking meteorology to improve weather forecasts; monitoring natural resources, agriculture and infrastructure; and tracking large stretches of oceans for illegal fishing, pollution, or piracy.</p><p>1.4 People's News<br/>Tue Jun 30, 2020<br/>Alphabet Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai holds 1,459 shares worth USD2.1 million at the last price of USD1,418.05, a fall in value by USD27,648 (1.3%).

The company has raised a total of about $45.5 million to date from investors including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.<br/>The deal, announced Tuesday, expands on an existing partnership with Microsoft on Kano's bright orange Windows-powered PC. It also sees Kano join the ranks of large IT players like Lenovo and Dell in obtaining original equipment manufacturer licensing from Microsoft.<br/>That means Kano is now able to ship its PCs with Windows 10 Pro - a premium version of Microsoft's operating system - to schools and has also formed a co-selling agreement with Microsoft.<br/>Kano has received a tender from the Japanese government to sell 3 million of its devices in the country and is in talks to sell thousands of units in the United Arab Emirates. The firm's PC retails at $299, cheaper than Microsoft's Surface Go hybrid PC and on par with some of Google's cheaper Chromebook computers.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 14: Alphabet Class A:<br/>According to a Bloomberg report, Alphabet's Google unit is in advanced talks to invest $4 billion for a stake in Jio Platforms, the digital arm of India-based conglomerate Reliance Holdings.

All the listed stocks closed in the green except for Netflix, which dropped 0.1%,and Amazon, which fell 0.6%.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 14: Google says Zero Hedge can run Google ads again after removing 'derogatory' comments<br/>Google is once again allowing financial web site Zero Hedge to make money using Google's ad platform.<br/>In mid-June, Google told CNBC it had banned Zero Hedge from using its ad platform because of the comments section of the site, which Google said consistently violated its policy against dangerous and derogatory material. Zero Hedge removed the content and implemented moderation on the comments section, then appealed Google's move.<br/>On Tuesday, Google said its team had re-reviewed the site, confirmed the material had been removed and began allowing it to begin running ads again on June 21. CNBC verified ads were running through Google on the site as of Tuesday.<br/>\"We work with publishers to keep them aware of our monetization policies, which cover user comments on sites, and offer guidance on how to address policy violations if they wish to be reinstated,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"We have policies like these for many reasons, including to ensure companies advertising with us have confidence their ads aren't running against dangerous, derogatory or hateful content.\"<br/>In mid-June, NBC News reported Google had also warned conservative publication The Federalist about the content in its comments section and gave it an opportunity to address the issues to prevent removal from its ads platform. The Federalist said last month it had deleted its comments section.

It also applies to GPS trackers marketed to spy on someone without their consent, along with surveillance equipment such as cameras, audio recorders, dash cams and nanny cams marketed for the purpose of spying.<br/>Google said private investigation services and products and services for parents to track or monitor their underage children will not apply. The \"Enabling Dishonest Behavior\" policy update will be enforced beginning Aug. 11.<br/>In 2018, a group of researchers conducting a study on the ecosystem of intimate partner surveillance spyware found thousands of Google ads appeared for search terms that showed explicit intention of conducting surveillance.<br/>The ads discovered included: \"How to catch a cheating spouse with his cell phone\" and \"Track My Wife's Phone - Want to Spy on your Wife? Track your Wife without her knowing. Discover Who Are They messaging. Download! 24-Hour Support Price Superiority No Jailbreaking and App Results Guaranteed.\"<br/>The researchers said in the study that Google had started to restrict ads for those types of search terms. Ads were not being shown on explicit search terms for intimate partner surveillance at the time the study was published.<br/>\"We constantly evaluate and update our ad policies to ensure we are protecting users,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"We routinely update our language with examples to help clarify what we consider policy violating. Spyware technology for partner surveillance was always in scope of our policies against dishonest behavior.\"</p><p>July 09: Google parent company Alphabet just launched balloons that beam high-speed internet in Kenya<br/>Alphabet's Loon said its balloon-powered internet service will initially cover 50,000 square kilometers in western and central parts of Kenya. It aims to take a fleet of 35 balloons to the skies above eastern Africa \"in the coming weeks.\" The news represents a significant milestone after years of publicity about the Alphabet-owned venture.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 09: Google's chief compliance officer Andy Hinton left in March, advising start-up for reporting workplace issues<br/>Google's chief compliance officer for more than a decade, Andy Hinton, has departed the company, following a wave of executive departures that started in December.<br/>Hinton left the company in late March, he told CNBC in an interview. He's becoming an advisor to a start-up called #NotMe, which claims to allow employees to make anonymous complaints about workplace issues, including the types of complaints Google has faced in recent years. However, Hinton said the mounting controversies at Google weren't the reason for his departure, and that he wanted to spend more time with family.<br/>Hinton served as vice-president and chief compliance officer at Google for more than 13 years. Compliance chiefs at large companies like Google typically help them comply with regulations and internal guidelines and bylaws.<br/>His departure comes in amid of a slow-rolling executive shakeup over the last several months. In December, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin stepped down from their roles as the CEO and President of Google's holding company, Alphabet. The company's long-time chief legal officer David Drummond retired at the end of January. In February, Google human resources chief Eileen Naughton said she'd be stepping down from her role.<br/>It also comes amid growing tensions between employees and management.<br/>A shareholder lawsuit launched last year alleged several senior execs mishandled claims of sexual misconduct at the company (Hinton was not named in that lawsuit), and the company's board of directors has investigated some of those claims. Other employees have alleged that when they did try to report misconduct to the company's human resources department, they were instead faced with retaliation. Alphabet also faces a number of issues related to data privacy and an imminent antitrust hearing with the U.S.</p><p>July 08: Alphabet's Loon starts beaming internet from balloons in Kenya<br/>Alphabet's Loon project has finally launched its internet-delivery balloons in Africa following a deal with the Kenyan government.<br/>It marks a significant milestone for Loon, once one of Google's \"moonshot\" projects, and follows years of publicity about the venture. Loon said its service would initially cover 50,000 square kilometers in western and central parts of Kenya.<br/>The firm has partnered with local telecommunications operator Telkom Kenya to beam 4G internet from its solar-powered balloons. It aims to take a fleet of 35 balloons to the skies above eastern Africa \"in the coming weeks.\"<br/>Loon calls the project a \"floating network of cell towers,\" aimed at providing internet from high altitudes to vast swathes of the Earth where service is not available. Rather than delivering connectivity from the ground through cell towers and cables, or from space via satellites, Loon says it is building a \"third layer\" in the stratosphere.<br/>\"While this sounds like a far-off, science-fiction future, it's not.

That's a downgrade from the firm's previous expectations of a 5% drop.<br/>In June, eMarketer estimated that U.S. net search ad revenue would drop 7.2% this year. Needham analysts said they agree with the firm's call for declining U.S. search revenue, and said their sources suggest international ad revenues are down even more than in the U.S.<br/>Google's ad weakness is being driven by \"material declines in travel, auto, entertainment, media and retail ads - both search and video ads,\" Needham analysts said.<br/>\"Until COVID-19 is controlled enough that the economy strengthens and consumer demand returns,\" analysts said they expected those travel, entertainment, media and retail categories would remain weak.<br/>Travel-related ad spend, which Google relies on heavily, was greatly affected by the pandemic amid stay-at-home orders and travel limitations. Needham analysts added that rising unemployment and GDP declines are driving lower consumer spending during Covid-19, which lowers advertising return-on-investments and, thus, search ad revenue.<br/>Needham now expects Google's revenue to be flat or slightly down for the full year. It previously expected growth of between 2% and 3%.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>1.6 Stock Buzz</p><p>SECTION 2 Corporate Profile and Independent Ratings<br/>2.1 Activities<br/>Alphabet Inc maintains an index of Websites and other online content, and makes this information freely available through its search engine to anyone with an Internet connection.

In terms of the agreement, Loon will help Vodacom provide service to un-served and under-served parts of the country with a network of floating cell phone towers that operate 20 kilometres above Earth. <br/>Using the Loon solution, Vodacom will expand mobile network access to Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, two regions that have proven hard to cover in the past due to the vast and logistically challenging geographical areas, together with low population density. The Loon solution will provide a 4G service that supports Data, Voice, SMS and USSD, which will also enable mobile financial services. The service will be available to any Vodacom subscriber with a standard 4G-VoLTE enabled handset and SIM card. Users will not need to do anything special to connect to the service; they will connect just as they would to a normal cell tower. In fact, it's unlikely that a user will know that they are connected to the service provided by a high altitude balloon, except for the fact that they may have a signal in a location where it previously did not exist.<br/>Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub says \"Vodacom's partnership with Loon is a perfect example of how technological innovation can connect the most rural communities in Africa. We are pleased to be part of this initiative in Mozambique, which is helping to bridge the digital divide. This is even more pertinent in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, where more Mozambicans will now have access to healthcare information through our Loon partnership.</p><p>April 29: Alphabet Class A HAPS Alliance Members Outline Commercial Opportunity in Earth's Stratosphere<br/>Mountain View, CA, April 29, 2020 -- Loon LLC, Airbus Defence and Space, HAPSMobile Inc., Intelsat US LLC, and Nokia Corporation see a rare, untapped commercial opportunity in the skies above Earth's atmosphere. All members of the recently-formed HAPS Alliance, the companies outlined in a White Paper published today a multi-billion dollar market opportunity in Earth's stratosphere, spanning telecommunications, high-resolution earth observation, and weather prediction and modeling.<br/>Earth's stratosphere - which spans from just above the lower atmosphere to the edge of space - has long been deemed unsuitable for commercial operations because of its harsh conditions. However, advances in technology over the last decade have made operating in the stratosphere possible, making the region ripe for commercial activity going forward.<br/>The White Paper outlines significant opportunity in the telecommunications sector, with the ability of stratospheric technologies to drive significant growth in the $3.9 trillion mobile technologies and services business by bringing millions of people online, reconnecting people after disasters, building out the next generation of 5G networks, and connecting the future of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.<br/>Another area of commercial opportunity outlined in the White Paper is earth observation (EO) and weather prediction and modeling. The $3 billion satellite segment of the EO market is growing steadily, as is the $4.4 billion drone service market. As stratospheric technologies develop, they will tap into portions of both markets, while stimulating new market demand due to their unique capabilities. Potential use-cases include: collecting data around natural and man-made disasters to enable more effective responses to wildfires, oil spills, floods and more; tracking meteorology to improve weather forecasts; monitoring natural resources, agriculture and infrastructure; and tracking large stretches of oceans for illegal fishing, pollution, or piracy.</p><p>1.4 People's News<br/>Tue Jun 30, 2020<br/>Alphabet Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai holds 1,459 shares worth USD2.1 million at the last price of USD1,418.05, a fall in value by USD27,648 (1.3%).

The coronavirus hurt Google's ad revenue in the first quarter, but as schools and offices closed, people began to lean more on digital services that could help them continue to communicate, which led to greater adoption of Google services like the Meet calling service.<br/>Now Meet will be accessible inside of Gmail for business customers, along with Google Docs and the the Google Chats service for team communication. In 2018 Google did something similar to Gmail, enhancing it with stripped-down versions of Google Calendar and the Google Keep to-do list app.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 15: Alphabet Class A<br/>Alphabet's Google unit will pay $4.5 billion for a 7.7% stake in the digital arm of India's Reliance Industries.

It also sees Kano join the ranks of large IT players like Lenovo and Dell in obtaining original equipment manufacturer licensing from Microsoft.<br/>That means Kano is now able to ship its PCs with Windows 10 Pro - a premium version of Microsoft's operating system - to schools and has also formed a co-selling agreement with Microsoft.<br/>Kano has received a tender from the Japanese government to sell 3 million of its devices in the country and is in talks to sell thousands of units in the United Arab Emirates.

Zero Hedge removed the content and implemented moderation on the comments section, then appealed Google's move.<br/>On Tuesday, Google said its team had re-reviewed the site, confirmed the material had been removed and began allowing it to begin running ads again on June 21. CNBC verified ads were running through Google on the site as of Tuesday.<br/>\"We work with publishers to keep them aware of our monetization policies, which cover user comments on sites, and offer guidance on how to address policy violations if they wish to be reinstated,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"We have policies like these for many reasons, including to ensure companies advertising with us have confidence their ads aren't running against dangerous, derogatory or hateful content.\"<br/>In mid-June, NBC News reported Google had also warned conservative publication The Federalist about the content in its comments section and gave it an opportunity to address the issues to prevent removal from its ads platform. The Federalist said last month it had deleted its comments section. At the time, Federalist co-founder Sean Davis called the matter a \"pretty terrifying example of the power that you have of the unholy union of corrupt media and monopolistic tech oligarchs.\"<br/>Zero Hedge didn't immediately return an emailed request for comment<br/>Earlier this year, Twitter banned the Zero Hedge account from the social media platform after it published an article linking a Chinese scientist to the outbreak of the fast-spreading coronavirus last week, saying the account had violated \"platform manipulation policy.\" The account was reinstated in June, with Twitter calling the removal a mistake.</p><p>July 10: Chamath Palihapitiya: Here's why you go short big tech stocks Facebook and Alphabet right now<br/>Former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya on Friday laid out his bearish case for the social media giant as well as Google parent Alphabet.<br/>Palihapitiya, founder and CEO of investment firm Social Capital, said in a series of tweets that there are a handful of negative catalysts to drive these shares down over the next few years, including increased regulatory scrutiny, taxes and new product experiences.<br/>\"Big Tech's long term success is no longer about better products,\" Palihapitiya said in a Friday tweet. \"They are incumbents and their success is now a multi-variate/multi-dimensional problem of competition, anti-trust, tax and regulatory multiplied by EVERY city, state, country and jurisdiction in which the operate.\"<br/>Facebook and Alphabet have been a relatively bright spot in a market that experienced unprecedented disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic.

It also applies to GPS trackers marketed to spy on someone without their consent, along with surveillance equipment such as cameras, audio recorders, dash cams and nanny cams marketed for the purpose of spying.<br/>Google said private investigation services and products and services for parents to track or monitor their underage children will not apply.

In terms of the agreement, Loon will help Vodacom provide service to un-served and under-served parts of the country with a network of floating cell phone towers that operate 20 kilometres above Earth. <br/>Using the Loon solution, Vodacom will expand mobile network access to Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, two regions that have proven hard to cover in the past due to the vast and logistically challenging geographical areas, together with low population density. The Loon solution will provide a 4G service that supports Data, Voice, SMS and USSD, which will also enable mobile financial services. The service will be available to any Vodacom subscriber with a standard 4G-VoLTE enabled handset and SIM card. Users will not need to do anything special to connect to the service; they will connect just as they would to a normal cell tower. In fact, it's unlikely that a user will know that they are connected to the service provided by a high altitude balloon, except for the fact that they may have a signal in a location where it previously did not exist.<br/>Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub says \"Vodacom's partnership with Loon is a perfect example of how technological innovation can connect the most rural communities in Africa. We are pleased to be part of this initiative in Mozambique, which is helping to bridge the digital divide. This is even more pertinent in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, where more Mozambicans will now have access to healthcare information through our Loon partnership.</p><p>April 29: Alphabet Class A HAPS Alliance Members Outline Commercial Opportunity in Earth's Stratosphere<br/>Mountain View, CA, April 29, 2020 -- Loon LLC, Airbus Defence and Space, HAPSMobile Inc., Intelsat US LLC, and Nokia Corporation see a rare, untapped commercial opportunity in the skies above Earth's atmosphere. All members of the recently-formed HAPS Alliance, the companies outlined in a White Paper published today a multi-billion dollar market opportunity in Earth's stratosphere, spanning telecommunications, high-resolution earth observation, and weather prediction and modeling.<br/>Earth's stratosphere - which spans from just above the lower atmosphere to the edge of space - has long been deemed unsuitable for commercial operations because of its harsh conditions. However, advances in technology over the last decade have made operating in the stratosphere possible, making the region ripe for commercial activity going forward.<br/>The White Paper outlines significant opportunity in the telecommunications sector, with the ability of stratospheric technologies to drive significant growth in the $3.9 trillion mobile technologies and services business by bringing millions of people online, reconnecting people after disasters, building out the next generation of 5G networks, and connecting the future of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.<br/>Another area of commercial opportunity outlined in the White Paper is earth observation (EO) and weather prediction and modeling. The $3 billion satellite segment of the EO market is growing steadily, as is the $4.4 billion drone service market. As stratospheric technologies develop, they will tap into portions of both markets, while stimulating new market demand due to their unique capabilities. Potential use-cases include: collecting data around natural and man-made disasters to enable more effective responses to wildfires, oil spills, floods and more; tracking meteorology to improve weather forecasts; monitoring natural resources, agriculture and infrastructure; and tracking large stretches of oceans for illegal fishing, pollution, or piracy.</p><p>1.4 People's News<br/>Tue Jun 30, 2020<br/>Alphabet Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai holds 1,459 shares worth USD2.1 million at the last price of USD1,418.05, a fall in value by USD27,648 (1.3%).

The value of the deal was not disclosed, but the Globe and Mail, which first reported Google's interest, placed the price at around $180 million, which is less than the $200 million the company had raised, according to Crunchbase.<br/>Google was an early pioneer in the field of augmented reality, where computer-generated images are superimposed over the real world, often in a pair of computerized glasses. Google Glass, one of the first such devices, was unveiled in 2012, but high initial pricing and privacy concerns -- the glasses contained a video camera -- doomed its appeal among consumers. Nonetheless, Google continues to make a version of Google Glass available to enterprises, where it competes with Microsoft's HoloLens.<br/>Google said that the acquisition would help realize its vision of \"ambient computing,\" where ubiquitous connected devices work together.<br/>\"We're building towards a future where helpfulness is all around you, where all your devices just work together and technology fades into the background,\" Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of devices and services at Google said in a statement. \"North's technical expertise will help as we continue to invest in our hardware efforts and ambient computing future.\"<br/>The Canadian company, formerly known as Thalmic Labs, rebranded in 2018 when it unveiled its holographic smart glasses, called Focals. North said Tuesday that it will not ship its updated version of glasses, Focals 2.0, which were to hit the market this year after the company announced it would wind down production of its first-generation model.<br/>The company will remain in Canada.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 10: Chamath Palihapitiya: Here's why you go short big tech stocks Facebook and Alphabet right now<br/>Former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya on Friday laid out his bearish case for the social media giant as well as Google parent Alphabet.<br/>Palihapitiya, founder and CEO of investment firm Social Capital, said in a series of tweets that there are a handful of negative catalysts to drive these shares down over the next few years, including increased regulatory scrutiny, taxes and new product experiences.<br/>\"Big Tech's long term success is no longer about better products,\" Palihapitiya said in a Friday tweet. \"They are incumbents and their success is now a multi-variate/multi-dimensional problem of competition, anti-trust, tax and regulatory multiplied by EVERY city, state, country and jurisdiction in which the operate.\"<br/>Facebook and Alphabet have been a relatively bright spot in a market that experienced unprecedented disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic. Shares of Facebook have climbed 17% this year, while Alphabet has gained more than 13%.<br/>Investors piled into mega-cap technology companies this year for their insulation from the global health crisis. Thanks to the resilience of Big Tech, the Nasdaq Composite became the first major U.S. equity benchmark to hit a new high.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 10: Google bans ads for products and services that secretly track or monitor people<br/>Google says it will no longer allow ads for products or services marketed for tracking or monitoring another person without their authorization.<br/>In an ad policy update, Google said this will apply to spyware and technology used for intimate partner surveillance, including tech used to monitor texts, phone calls or browsing history. It also applies to GPS trackers marketed to spy on someone without their consent, along with surveillance equipment such as cameras, audio recorders, dash cams and nanny cams marketed for the purpose of spying.<br/>Google said private investigation services and products and services for parents to track or monitor their underage children will not apply. The \"Enabling Dishonest Behavior\" policy update will be enforced beginning Aug. 11.<br/>In 2018, a group of researchers conducting a study on the ecosystem of intimate partner surveillance spyware found thousands of Google ads appeared for search terms that showed explicit intention of conducting surveillance.<br/>The ads discovered included: \"How to catch a cheating spouse with his cell phone\" and \"Track My Wife's Phone - Want to Spy on your Wife? Track your Wife without her knowing. Discover Who Are They messaging. Download! 24-Hour Support Price Superiority No Jailbreaking and App Results Guaranteed.\"<br/>The researchers said in the study that Google had started to restrict ads for those types of search terms. Ads were not being shown on explicit search terms for intimate partner surveillance at the time the study was published.<br/>\"We constantly evaluate and update our ad policies to ensure we are protecting users,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"We routinely update our language with examples to help clarify what we consider policy violating. Spyware technology for partner surveillance was always in scope of our policies against dishonest behavior.\"</p><p>July 09: Google parent company Alphabet just launched balloons that beam high-speed internet in Kenya<br/>Alphabet's Loon said its balloon-powered internet service will initially cover 50,000 square kilometers in western and central parts of Kenya. It aims to take a fleet of 35 balloons to the skies above eastern Africa \"in the coming weeks.\" The news represents a significant milestone after years of publicity about the Alphabet-owned venture.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 09: Google's chief compliance officer Andy Hinton left in March, advising start-up for reporting workplace issues<br/>Google's chief compliance officer for more than a decade, Andy Hinton, has departed the company, following a wave of executive departures that started in December.<br/>Hinton left the company in late March, he told CNBC in an interview. He's becoming an advisor to a start-up called #NotMe, which claims to allow employees to make anonymous complaints about workplace issues, including the types of complaints Google has faced in recent years. However, Hinton said the mounting controversies at Google weren't the reason for his departure, and that he wanted to spend more time with family.<br/>Hinton served as vice-president and chief compliance officer at Google for more than 13 years. Compliance chiefs at large companies like Google typically help them comply with regulations and internal guidelines and bylaws.<br/>His departure comes in amid of a slow-rolling executive shakeup over the last several months. In December, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin stepped down from their roles as the CEO and President of Google's holding company, Alphabet. The company's long-time chief legal officer David Drummond retired at the end of January. In February, Google human resources chief Eileen Naughton said she'd be stepping down from her role.<br/>It also comes amid growing tensions between employees and management.<br/>A shareholder lawsuit launched last year alleged several senior execs mishandled claims of sexual misconduct at the company (Hinton was not named in that lawsuit), and the company's board of directors has investigated some of those claims. Other employees have alleged that when they did try to report misconduct to the company's human resources department, they were instead faced with retaliation. Alphabet also faces a number of issues related to data privacy and an imminent antitrust hearing with the U.S.</p><p>July 08: Alphabet's Loon starts beaming internet from balloons in Kenya<br/>Alphabet's Loon project has finally launched its internet-delivery balloons in Africa following a deal with the Kenyan government.<br/>It marks a significant milestone for Loon, once one of Google's \"moonshot\" projects, and follows years of publicity about the venture. Loon said its service would initially cover 50,000 square kilometers in western and central parts of Kenya.<br/>The firm has partnered with local telecommunications operator Telkom Kenya to beam 4G internet from its solar-powered balloons. It aims to take a fleet of 35 balloons to the skies above eastern Africa \"in the coming weeks.\"<br/>Loon calls the project a \"floating network of cell towers,\" aimed at providing internet from high altitudes to vast swathes of the Earth where service is not available. Rather than delivering connectivity from the ground through cell towers and cables, or from space via satellites, Loon says it is building a \"third layer\" in the stratosphere.<br/>\"While this sounds like a far-off, science-fiction future, it's not. Just look to Kenya,\" Loon CEO Alastair Westgarth said in a blog post.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 07: Needham lowers Google estimates amid 'search weakness' and growing threat from Amazon<br/>Needham analysts predict Google's second quarter revenue will be down 7% year-over-year because of the company's declining U.S. search revenue. That's a downgrade from the firm's previous expectations of a 5% drop.<br/>In June, eMarketer estimated that U.S. net search ad revenue would drop 7.2% this year. Needham analysts said they agree with the firm's call for declining U.S. search revenue, and said their sources suggest international ad revenues are down even more than in the U.S.<br/>Google's ad weakness is being driven by \"material declines in travel, auto, entertainment, media and retail ads - both search and video ads,\" Needham analysts said.<br/>\"Until COVID-19 is controlled enough that the economy strengthens and consumer demand returns,\" analysts said they expected those travel, entertainment, media and retail categories would remain weak.<br/>Travel-related ad spend, which Google relies on heavily, was greatly affected by the pandemic amid stay-at-home orders and travel limitations. Needham analysts added that rising unemployment and GDP declines are driving lower consumer spending during Covid-19, which lowers advertising return-on-investments and, thus, search ad revenue.<br/>Needham now expects Google's revenue to be flat or slightly down for the full year. It previously expected growth of between 2% and 3%.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 01: UK competition watchdog seeks to curb Google and Facebook's dominance of online advertising<br/>Britain's competition watchdog has set out recommendations for new regulations to tackle the dominance of Google and Facebook in the online advertising market.<br/>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Wednesday that it had proposed the creation of a \"Digital Markets Unit\" designed to rein in platforms with \"a position of market power\" when it comes to digital ads.<br/>The new unit would enforce a code of conduct on Google, Facebook and other major players in the industry to make sure they don't \"engage in exploitative or exclusionary practices.\" It would have the power to impose fines on the companies if necessary.<br/>Under newly proposed rules, the CMA is asking for the ability to order Google to share click and query data with rival search engines, force Facebook to give consumers a choice over whether to accept targeted advertising and to impose a \"separation of platforms where necessary.\"<br/>The CMA said it wants to \"lift the lid on how advertising revenue drives the business model of major platforms.\" According to the regulator, around 80% of the Pound14 billion ($17 billion) of U.K. spending on digital ads in 2019 went to Google and Facebook. Google has a more than 90% share of the search advertising market in the U.K., the CMA said, while Facebook controls more than 50% of the display advertising sector.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>June 30: Google raises price of YouTube TV, its cable-like bundle, to $65 a month<br/>Google-owned YouTube is raising its price for its television subscription service to $64.99 a month, an increase of $15, the company said Tuesday.<br/>This new price takes effect June 30 for new members and the July 30 billing cycle for existing subscribers. The service, which allows customers to watch more than 80 TV channels over the internet, had 2 million subscribers as of the end of 2019, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the company's Q4 2019 earnings call. By way of comparison, market-leading U.S. cable TV provider Comcast reported 19.9 million residential video customers in Q1 2020.<br/>\"We don't take these decisions lightly, and realize how hard this is for our members,\" Google said about the price increases in a Tuesday blog post. \"That said, this new price reflects the rising cost of content and we also believe it reflects the complete value of YouTube TV, from our breadth of content to the features that are changing how we watch live TV.\"<br/>The latest price bump comes at the three-year anniversary of YouTube TV and follows a $10 price increase last April. It suggests streaming TV providers are having a difficult time competing with traditional cable networks as they scale and add channels, despite originally being touted as a lower-cost alternative to cable.<br/>YouTube TV said earlier this year that it would be adding more of ViacomCBS brands to YouTube TV, including BET, CMT, Comedy Central, and Paramount Network. It went on to defend the price increase by saying it's the only streaming service that includes a DVR with unlimited storage space and allows six accounts per household.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>June 25: Alphabet Class A<br/>Alphabet's Google unit agreed to pay some publishers in Australia, Brazil and Germany for certain content, and said it expects to sign similar deals with others.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>1.6 Stock Buzz</p><p>SECTION 2 Corporate Profile and Independent Ratings<br/>2.1 Activities<br/>Alphabet Inc maintains an index of Websites and other online content, and makes this information freely available through its search engine to anyone with an Internet connection.

In terms of the agreement, Loon will help Vodacom provide service to un-served and under-served parts of the country with a network of floating cell phone towers that operate 20 kilometres above Earth. <br/>Using the Loon solution, Vodacom will expand mobile network access to Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, two regions that have proven hard to cover in the past due to the vast and logistically challenging geographical areas, together with low population density. The Loon solution will provide a 4G service that supports Data, Voice, SMS and USSD, which will also enable mobile financial services. The service will be available to any Vodacom subscriber with a standard 4G-VoLTE enabled handset and SIM card. Users will not need to do anything special to connect to the service; they will connect just as they would to a normal cell tower. In fact, it's unlikely that a user will know that they are connected to the service provided by a high altitude balloon, except for the fact that they may have a signal in a location where it previously did not exist.<br/>Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub says \"Vodacom's partnership with Loon is a perfect example of how technological innovation can connect the most rural communities in Africa. We are pleased to be part of this initiative in Mozambique, which is helping to bridge the digital divide. This is even more pertinent in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, where more Mozambicans will now have access to healthcare information through our Loon partnership.</p><p>April 29: Alphabet Class A HAPS Alliance Members Outline Commercial Opportunity in Earth's Stratosphere<br/>Mountain View, CA, April 29, 2020 -- Loon LLC, Airbus Defence and Space, HAPSMobile Inc., Intelsat US LLC, and Nokia Corporation see a rare, untapped commercial opportunity in the skies above Earth's atmosphere. All members of the recently-formed HAPS Alliance, the companies outlined in a White Paper published today a multi-billion dollar market opportunity in Earth's stratosphere, spanning telecommunications, high-resolution earth observation, and weather prediction and modeling.<br/>Earth's stratosphere - which spans from just above the lower atmosphere to the edge of space - has long been deemed unsuitable for commercial operations because of its harsh conditions. However, advances in technology over the last decade have made operating in the stratosphere possible, making the region ripe for commercial activity going forward.<br/>The White Paper outlines significant opportunity in the telecommunications sector, with the ability of stratospheric technologies to drive significant growth in the $3.9 trillion mobile technologies and services business by bringing millions of people online, reconnecting people after disasters, building out the next generation of 5G networks, and connecting the future of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.<br/>Another area of commercial opportunity outlined in the White Paper is earth observation (EO) and weather prediction and modeling. The $3 billion satellite segment of the EO market is growing steadily, as is the $4.4 billion drone service market. As stratospheric technologies develop, they will tap into portions of both markets, while stimulating new market demand due to their unique capabilities. Potential use-cases include: collecting data around natural and man-made disasters to enable more effective responses to wildfires, oil spills, floods and more; tracking meteorology to improve weather forecasts; monitoring natural resources, agriculture and infrastructure; and tracking large stretches of oceans for illegal fishing, pollution, or piracy.</p><p>1.4 People's News<br/>Tue Jun 30, 2020<br/>Alphabet Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai holds 1,459 shares worth USD2.1 million at the last price of USD1,418.05, a fall in value by USD27,648 (1.3%).

The value of the deal was not disclosed, but the Globe and Mail, which first reported Google's interest, placed the price at around $180 million, which is less than the $200 million the company had raised, according to Crunchbase.<br/>Google was an early pioneer in the field of augmented reality, where computer-generated images are superimposed over the real world, often in a pair of computerized glasses. Google Glass, one of the first such devices, was unveiled in 2012, but high initial pricing and privacy concerns -- the glasses contained a video camera -- doomed its appeal among consumers. Nonetheless, Google continues to make a version of Google Glass available to enterprises, where it competes with Microsoft's HoloLens.<br/>Google said that the acquisition would help realize its vision of \"ambient computing,\" where ubiquitous connected devices work together.<br/>\"We're building towards a future where helpfulness is all around you, where all your devices just work together and technology fades into the background,\" Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of devices and services at Google said in a statement. \"North's technical expertise will help as we continue to invest in our hardware efforts and ambient computing future.\"<br/>The Canadian company, formerly known as Thalmic Labs, rebranded in 2018 when it unveiled its holographic smart glasses, called Focals.

It also applies to GPS trackers marketed to spy on someone without their consent, along with surveillance equipment such as cameras, audio recorders, dash cams and nanny cams marketed for the purpose of spying.<br/>Google said private investigation services and products and services for parents to track or monitor their underage children will not apply. The \"Enabling Dishonest Behavior\" policy update will be enforced beginning Aug. 11.<br/>In 2018, a group of researchers conducting a study on the ecosystem of intimate partner surveillance spyware found thousands of Google ads appeared for search terms that showed explicit intention of conducting surveillance.<br/>The ads discovered included: \"How to catch a cheating spouse with his cell phone\" and \"Track My Wife's Phone - Want to Spy on your Wife? Track your Wife without her knowing. Discover Who Are They messaging. Download! 24-Hour Support Price Superiority No Jailbreaking and App Results Guaranteed.\"<br/>The researchers said in the study that Google had started to restrict ads for those types of search terms. Ads were not being shown on explicit search terms for intimate partner surveillance at the time the study was published.<br/>\"We constantly evaluate and update our ad policies to ensure we are protecting users,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"We routinely update our language with examples to help clarify what we consider policy violating. Spyware technology for partner surveillance was always in scope of our policies against dishonest behavior.\"</p><p>July 09: Google parent company Alphabet just launched balloons that beam high-speed internet in Kenya<br/>Alphabet's Loon said its balloon-powered internet service will initially cover 50,000 square kilometers in western and central parts of Kenya. It aims to take a fleet of 35 balloons to the skies above eastern Africa \"in the coming weeks.\" The news represents a significant milestone after years of publicity about the Alphabet-owned venture.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 09: Google's chief compliance officer Andy Hinton left in March, advising start-up for reporting workplace issues<br/>Google's chief compliance officer for more than a decade, Andy Hinton, has departed the company, following a wave of executive departures that started in December.<br/>Hinton left the company in late March, he told CNBC in an interview. He's becoming an advisor to a start-up called #NotMe, which claims to allow employees to make anonymous complaints about workplace issues, including the types of complaints Google has faced in recent years. However, Hinton said the mounting controversies at Google weren't the reason for his departure, and that he wanted to spend more time with family.<br/>Hinton served as vice-president and chief compliance officer at Google for more than 13 years. Compliance chiefs at large companies like Google typically help them comply with regulations and internal guidelines and bylaws.<br/>His departure comes in amid of a slow-rolling executive shakeup over the last several months. In December, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin stepped down from their roles as the CEO and President of Google's holding company, Alphabet. The company's long-time chief legal officer David Drummond retired at the end of January. In February, Google human resources chief Eileen Naughton said she'd be stepping down from her role.<br/>It also comes amid growing tensions between employees and management.<br/>A shareholder lawsuit launched last year alleged several senior execs mishandled claims of sexual misconduct at the company (Hinton was not named in that lawsuit), and the company's board of directors has investigated some of those claims. Other employees have alleged that when they did try to report misconduct to the company's human resources department, they were instead faced with retaliation. Alphabet also faces a number of issues related to data privacy and an imminent antitrust hearing with the U.S.</p><p>July 08: Alphabet's Loon starts beaming internet from balloons in Kenya<br/>Alphabet's Loon project has finally launched its internet-delivery balloons in Africa following a deal with the Kenyan government.<br/>It marks a significant milestone for Loon, once one of Google's \"moonshot\" projects, and follows years of publicity about the venture. Loon said its service would initially cover 50,000 square kilometers in western and central parts of Kenya.<br/>The firm has partnered with local telecommunications operator Telkom Kenya to beam 4G internet from its solar-powered balloons. It aims to take a fleet of 35 balloons to the skies above eastern Africa \"in the coming weeks.\"<br/>Loon calls the project a \"floating network of cell towers,\" aimed at providing internet from high altitudes to vast swathes of the Earth where service is not available. Rather than delivering connectivity from the ground through cell towers and cables, or from space via satellites, Loon says it is building a \"third layer\" in the stratosphere.<br/>\"While this sounds like a far-off, science-fiction future, it's not.

That's a downgrade from the firm's previous expectations of a 5% drop.<br/>In June, eMarketer estimated that U.S. net search ad revenue would drop 7.2% this year. Needham analysts said they agree with the firm's call for declining U.S. search revenue, and said their sources suggest international ad revenues are down even more than in the U.S.<br/>Google's ad weakness is being driven by \"material declines in travel, auto, entertainment, media and retail ads - both search and video ads,\" Needham analysts said.<br/>\"Until COVID-19 is controlled enough that the economy strengthens and consumer demand returns,\" analysts said they expected those travel, entertainment, media and retail categories would remain weak.<br/>Travel-related ad spend, which Google relies on heavily, was greatly affected by the pandemic amid stay-at-home orders and travel limitations. Needham analysts added that rising unemployment and GDP declines are driving lower consumer spending during Covid-19, which lowers advertising return-on-investments and, thus, search ad revenue.<br/>Needham now expects Google's revenue to be flat or slightly down for the full year. It previously expected growth of between 2% and 3%.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 01: UK competition watchdog seeks to curb Google and Facebook's dominance of online advertising<br/>Britain's competition watchdog has set out recommendations for new regulations to tackle the dominance of Google and Facebook in the online advertising market.<br/>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Wednesday that it had proposed the creation of a \"Digital Markets Unit\" designed to rein in platforms with \"a position of market power\" when it comes to digital ads.<br/>The new unit would enforce a code of conduct on Google, Facebook and other major players in the industry to make sure they don't \"engage in exploitative or exclusionary practices.\" It would have the power to impose fines on the companies if necessary.<br/>Under newly proposed rules, the CMA is asking for the ability to order Google to share click and query data with rival search engines, force Facebook to give consumers a choice over whether to accept targeted advertising and to impose a \"separation of platforms where necessary.\"<br/>The CMA said it wants to \"lift the lid on how advertising revenue drives the business model of major platforms.\" According to the regulator, around 80% of the Pound14 billion ($17 billion) of U.K. spending on digital ads in 2019 went to Google and Facebook. Google has a more than 90% share of the search advertising market in the U.K., the CMA said, while Facebook controls more than 50% of the display advertising sector.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>June 30: Google raises price of YouTube TV, its cable-like bundle, to $65 a month<br/>Google-owned YouTube is raising its price for its television subscription service to $64.99 a month, an increase of $15, the company said Tuesday.<br/>This new price takes effect June 30 for new members and the July 30 billing cycle for existing subscribers. The service, which allows customers to watch more than 80 TV channels over the internet, had 2 million subscribers as of the end of 2019, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the company's Q4 2019 earnings call. By way of comparison, market-leading U.S. cable TV provider Comcast reported 19.9 million residential video customers in Q1 2020.<br/>\"We don't take these decisions lightly, and realize how hard this is for our members,\" Google said about the price increases in a Tuesday blog post. \"That said, this new price reflects the rising cost of content and we also believe it reflects the complete value of YouTube TV, from our breadth of content to the features that are changing how we watch live TV.\"<br/>The latest price bump comes at the three-year anniversary of YouTube TV and follows a $10 price increase last April. It suggests streaming TV providers are having a difficult time competing with traditional cable networks as they scale and add channels, despite originally being touted as a lower-cost alternative to cable.<br/>YouTube TV said earlier this year that it would be adding more of ViacomCBS brands to YouTube TV, including BET, CMT, Comedy Central, and Paramount Network. It went on to defend the price increase by saying it's the only streaming service that includes a DVR with unlimited storage space and allows six accounts per household.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>June 25: Alphabet Class A<br/>Alphabet's Google unit agreed to pay some publishers in Australia, Brazil and Germany for certain content, and said it expects to sign similar deals with others.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>1.6 Stock Buzz</p><p>SECTION 2 Corporate Profile and Independent Ratings<br/>2.1 Activities<br/>Alphabet Inc maintains an index of Websites and other online content, and makes this information freely available through its search engine to anyone with an Internet connection.

In terms of the agreement, Loon will help Vodacom provide service to un-served and under-served parts of the country with a network of floating cell phone towers that operate 20 kilometres above Earth. <br/>Using the Loon solution, Vodacom will expand mobile network access to Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, two regions that have proven hard to cover in the past due to the vast and logistically challenging geographical areas, together with low population density. The Loon solution will provide a 4G service that supports Data, Voice, SMS and USSD, which will also enable mobile financial services. The service will be available to any Vodacom subscriber with a standard 4G-VoLTE enabled handset and SIM card. Users will not need to do anything special to connect to the service; they will connect just as they would to a normal cell tower. In fact, it's unlikely that a user will know that they are connected to the service provided by a high altitude balloon, except for the fact that they may have a signal in a location where it previously did not exist.<br/>Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub says \"Vodacom's partnership with Loon is a perfect example of how technological innovation can connect the most rural communities in Africa. We are pleased to be part of this initiative in Mozambique, which is helping to bridge the digital divide. This is even more pertinent in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, where more Mozambicans will now have access to healthcare information through our Loon partnership.</p><p>April 29: Alphabet Class A HAPS Alliance Members Outline Commercial Opportunity in Earth's Stratosphere<br/>Mountain View, CA, April 29, 2020 -- Loon LLC, Airbus Defence and Space, HAPSMobile Inc., Intelsat US LLC, and Nokia Corporation see a rare, untapped commercial opportunity in the skies above Earth's atmosphere. All members of the recently-formed HAPS Alliance, the companies outlined in a White Paper published today a multi-billion dollar market opportunity in Earth's stratosphere, spanning telecommunications, high-resolution earth observation, and weather prediction and modeling.<br/>Earth's stratosphere - which spans from just above the lower atmosphere to the edge of space - has long been deemed unsuitable for commercial operations because of its harsh conditions. However, advances in technology over the last decade have made operating in the stratosphere possible, making the region ripe for commercial activity going forward.<br/>The White Paper outlines significant opportunity in the telecommunications sector, with the ability of stratospheric technologies to drive significant growth in the $3.9 trillion mobile technologies and services business by bringing millions of people online, reconnecting people after disasters, building out the next generation of 5G networks, and connecting the future of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.<br/>Another area of commercial opportunity outlined in the White Paper is earth observation (EO) and weather prediction and modeling. The $3 billion satellite segment of the EO market is growing steadily, as is the $4.4 billion drone service market. As stratospheric technologies develop, they will tap into portions of both markets, while stimulating new market demand due to their unique capabilities. Potential use-cases include: collecting data around natural and man-made disasters to enable more effective responses to wildfires, oil spills, floods and more; tracking meteorology to improve weather forecasts; monitoring natural resources, agriculture and infrastructure; and tracking large stretches of oceans for illegal fishing, pollution, or piracy.</p><p>1.4 People's News<br/>Tue Jun 30, 2020<br/>Alphabet Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai holds 1,459 shares worth USD2.1 million at the last price of USD1,418.05, a fall in value by USD27,648 (1.3%).

A new date has not been announced.<br/>The hearing was initially set to take place on Monday, but is now delayed due to memorial services for the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., which are scheduled to take place on the same day.<br/>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, were prepared to testify virtually on Monday before the House Antitrust Subcommittee. The hearing is meant to be a culmination of an investigation into the four tech giants that began in June 2019 to assess their competitive practices and the efficacy of antitrust laws for the new digital marketplace. Following the hearing, the subcommittee is expected to issue a report of its findings as well as legislative proposals aiming to update the antitrust laws.<br/>The probe had already been delayed by the pandemic, pushing back the timeline for issuing the report from early April to likely sometime in the Fall.<br/>While Congress' investigation won't directly result in any enforcement actions on the companies, probes by U.S. antitrust regulators, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, could. The DOJ is reportedly preparing a case against Google while the FTC continues to investigate Facebook and Amazon, according to reports. Regulators have also been asking questions about Apple, though formal scrutiny has so far only been announces in the abroad. The company is facing two antitrust investigations in the European Union.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 23: Microsoft's slowdown in search advertising could spell tough news ahead for Google<br/>Microsoft's advertising business struggled last quarter, as advertisers cut their budgets during the coronavirus pandemic and corresponding spike in U.S. unemployment.<br/>That outcome could spell bad news for search advertising rival Google, whose parent company Alphabet reports second quarter earnings next week.<br/>On Wednesday, Microsoft said that search revenue minus traffic acquisition costs fell 18% from the year-ago quarter as customers spent less on ads.<br/>One quarter ago, that part of Microsoft's business was up 1% year-over-year, while Google search ad revenue declined 9.4%. Google's search engine is more widely used than Microsoft's Bing; Google had about 84% market share in June, while Bing had 6%, according to NetMarketShare.<br/>Microsoft as a whole saw slower growth as the coronavirus affected many parts of its business last quarter, but portions of its business like gaming, cloud infrastructure and productivity software helped smooth out the results as people remained at home around the world to reduce spread of the coronavirus. Alphabet is less diversified than Microsoft, with 84% of its revenue coming from Google advertising in the first quarter.<br/>Analysts polled by Refinitiv currently expect $37.35 billion in second-quarter revenue from Alphabet, suggesting a 4% year-over-year decline. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<br/>Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said Wednesday that the company expects search revenue for the current quarter, excluding traffic acquisition costs, to be down \"in the low 20% range.\" (Microsoft's fiscal year ended June 30.)<br/>Amid a broad sell-off in tech stocks on Thursday, Alphabet Class A shares were down as much as 3.5% and Microsoft stock traded as much as 4.4% lower.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 22: Homebuyers can now turn to Google Search for detailed info about mortgages<br/>Google on Wednesday updated its search engine with new tools for people shopping for mortgages, including a calculator, recent average mortgage rates and key terms homebuyers may need to know during the mortgage shopping process.<br/>Google teamed up with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to launch the new tools because it found that a lot of people were asking questions like \"what is a mortgage?\" and \"what is APR?\" among others.<br/>The tools are available on phones when you search \"mortgage.\" Just scroll down past the ads and you'll see it.<br/>Here's the kind of information it provides.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 21: Apple, Google and Sony will be critical to MLB season shortened by coronavirus<br/>Major League Baseball will look to Big Tech companies like Apple and Google to help with its shortened season that is scheduled to begin Thursday.<br/>On Monday, MLB provided a preview of how games will look and sound during the pandemic, with features like artificial crowd noise and an upgraded replay system for fans watching from home.<br/>Two games are scheduled for opening night: The defending World Series champion Washington Nationals host the New York Yankees at 7 p.m. ET, followed by the Los Angeles Dodgers hosting the San Francisco Giants at 10 p.m. ET.<br/>As part of the league's Covid-19 health and safety protocols, MLB said it would ban traditional video stations shared throughout clubhouses. The league took advantage of its 2016 partnership with Apple to expand the dugout iPad program. It will now distribute 15 iPads to each team for players and staff to dissect performances and additional team content like scouting reports.<br/>Google will also play a part, with all 30 teams using Google Cloud to run MLB's stat-tracking system, Statcast, and provide digital infrastructure for everything from team websites to online ticket sales.<br/>MLB partnered with the Google in March to be the league's official cloud partner. Jason Gaedtke, MLB chief technology officer, said Monday that the league selected Google for the firm's \"strength in large scale data processing, analytics and specifically machine-learning.\"<br/>With its Statcast 3D platform powered by Google, MLB said broadcasts can re-create game footage in a variety of virtual perspectives. Concepts like displaying a player's home run trails, pitching angles from a catcher and umpire's perspective and how play is affected by weather conditions will now be available for national and regional broadcast partners.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 20: Alphabet Class A<br/>Credit Suisse hiked its price target on the Google parent to $1,850 per share from $1,600 per share. The new price target implies an upside of 22% from Friday's close of $1,516.85. The analyst cited: \"1) ongoing monetization improvements in Search advertising through product/AI driven updates, 2) greater-than expected revenue contribution from non-Search businesses (YouTube, Cloud, and Play), 3) optionality and shareholder value creation from new monetization initiatives such as Maps\" positive catalysts for the stock. Alphabet shares rose more than 2%.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 17: Google will ban ads from running on stories spreading debunked coronavirus conspiracy theories<br/>Google next month will ban publishers from using its ad platform to show advertisements next to content that promotes conspiracy theories about Covid-19. It will also ban ads that promote those theories. In cases where a particular site publishes a certain threshold of material that violates these policies, it will ban the entire site from using its ad platforms.<br/>Alphabet's Google already prohibits ads from running against content that makes harmful claims about disease prevention and unsubstantiated cures, including anti-vaccine promotions or content that encourages users to forgo treatment. The company is now taking it a step further and banning ads against content that make claims going against authoritative scientific consensus. Banned claims would include conspiracy theories like vaccines being attempts to genetically modify the population, that Bill Gates created Covid-19 or that the disease was a bioweapon made in a Chinese lab.<br/>Google received nearly $135 billion in advertising revenue in 2019, in part through programs like AdSense and Ad Manager, in which websites that are approved can run programmatic advertising on their sites and make money using Google. About 15% of Google's revenue in the first quarter came from \"Google Network Members' properties,\" which the company said in its annual report primarily comes from sites participating in AdMob, AdSense and Google Ad Manager programs.<br/>Google will begin enforcing the change on Aug. 18, and can remove ads from single articles or, in some cases, entire sites. When it comes to removing ads from an entire site, the company said for most of its policies it has a percentage threshold for policy violations before it will fully demonetize a website. (The violation of some policies, like one preventing child sex abuse material, is considered by the company to be so egregious that they result in immediate site-level action).<br/>The news comes the same week as CNBC first reported that Google had begun running ads again on financial market website Zero Hedge.</p><p>July 17: Alphabet Class A<br/>Alongside Netflix, the so-called FANG stocks slid, continuing technology stocks weakness this week.

The coronavirus hurt Google's ad revenue in the first quarter, but as schools and offices closed, people began to lean more on digital services that could help them continue to communicate, which led to greater adoption of Google services like the Meet calling service.<br/>Now Meet will be accessible inside of Gmail for business customers, along with Google Docs and the the Google Chats service for team communication. In 2018 Google did something similar to Gmail, enhancing it with stripped-down versions of Google Calendar and the Google Keep to-do list app.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 15: Alphabet Class A<br/>Alphabet's Google unit will pay $4.5 billion for a 7.7% stake in the digital arm of India's Reliance Industries.

In terms of the agreement, Loon will help Vodacom provide service to un-served and under-served parts of the country with a network of floating cell phone towers that operate 20 kilometres above Earth. <br/>Using the Loon solution, Vodacom will expand mobile network access to Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, two regions that have proven hard to cover in the past due to the vast and logistically challenging geographical areas, together with low population density. The Loon solution will provide a 4G service that supports Data, Voice, SMS and USSD, which will also enable mobile financial services. The service will be available to any Vodacom subscriber with a standard 4G-VoLTE enabled handset and SIM card. Users will not need to do anything special to connect to the service; they will connect just as they would to a normal cell tower. In fact, it's unlikely that a user will know that they are connected to the service provided by a high altitude balloon, except for the fact that they may have a signal in a location where it previously did not exist.<br/>Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub says \"Vodacom's partnership with Loon is a perfect example of how technological innovation can connect the most rural communities in Africa. We are pleased to be part of this initiative in Mozambique, which is helping to bridge the digital divide. This is even more pertinent in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, where more Mozambicans will now have access to healthcare information through our Loon partnership.</p><p>1.4 Recent Business News Round Up: CNBC<br/>July 28: Google CEO Sundar Pichai plans to tell Congress the company faces plenty of competition<br/>Google CEO Sundar Pichai says the company has offered a competitive platform that has lowered prices advertisers, giving consumers more choice, according to prepared remarks the executive made ahead of Wednesday's hearing before the House Antitrust Subcommittee.<br/>\"A competitive digital ad marketplace gives publishers and advertisers, and therefore consumers, an enormous amount of choice,\" Pichai stated. \"For example, competition in ads - from Twitter, Instagram, Comcast and others - has helped lower online advertising costs by 40% over the last 10 years, with these saving passed down to consumers through lower prices.\"<br/>Nonetheless, Google remains the largest digital ad platform by market share. Last year, Google held 31.6% of total digital advertising spending with Facebook and Amazon holding 22.7% and 7.8% respectively, according to eMarketer.<br/>The statement comes ahead of Pichai joining Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before the House Antitrust Subcommittee on Wednesday. The committee's probe is expected to result in a report and legislative proposals for how to address antitrust issues in the digital marketplace. Potential laws could inform how state regulators crack down on anti-competitive practices in the future.<br/>Google's most common critics ask questions about whether it favors its own products or suppresses competitors through its dominance in search and digital advertising. The company has already faced fines from the European Commission's competition authority over its shopping search tool and Android mobile operating system, which Pichai said in his prepared remarks was \"deliberately\" built to encourage competition.<br/>Pichai goes on to cite Amazon's Alexa, Twitter, Snapchat, and Facebook-owned WhatsApp as competitive platforms where people get information.<br/>\"In areas like travel and real estate, Google faces strong competition for search queries from many businesses that are experts in those areas,\" Pichai stated in the written remarks.</p><p>July 27: Google will keep employees home until July 2021<br/>CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" crew discuss Google's decision to have employees work from home until July 2021.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 24: Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google CEO congressional hearing officially delayed<br/>The highly anticipated antitrust hearing featuring CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google has officially been postponed by the House Judiciary Committee. A new date has not been announced.<br/>The hearing was initially set to take place on Monday, but is now delayed due to memorial services for the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., which are scheduled to take place on the same day.<br/>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, were prepared to testify virtually on Monday before the House Antitrust Subcommittee. The hearing is meant to be a culmination of an investigation into the four tech giants that began in June 2019 to assess their competitive practices and the efficacy of antitrust laws for the new digital marketplace. Following the hearing, the subcommittee is expected to issue a report of its findings as well as legislative proposals aiming to update the antitrust laws.<br/>The probe had already been delayed by the pandemic, pushing back the timeline for issuing the report from early April to likely sometime in the Fall.<br/>While Congress' investigation won't directly result in any enforcement actions on the companies, probes by U.S. antitrust regulators, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, could. The DOJ is reportedly preparing a case against Google while the FTC continues to investigate Facebook and Amazon, according to reports. Regulators have also been asking questions about Apple, though formal scrutiny has so far only been announces in the abroad. The company is facing two antitrust investigations in the European Union.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 23: Microsoft's slowdown in search advertising could spell tough news ahead for Google<br/>Microsoft's advertising business struggled last quarter, as advertisers cut their budgets during the coronavirus pandemic and corresponding spike in U.S. unemployment.<br/>That outcome could spell bad news for search advertising rival Google, whose parent company Alphabet reports second quarter earnings next week.<br/>On Wednesday, Microsoft said that search revenue minus traffic acquisition costs fell 18% from the year-ago quarter as customers spent less on ads.<br/>One quarter ago, that part of Microsoft's business was up 1% year-over-year, while Google search ad revenue declined 9.4%. Google's search engine is more widely used than Microsoft's Bing; Google had about 84% market share in June, while Bing had 6%, according to NetMarketShare.<br/>Microsoft as a whole saw slower growth as the coronavirus affected many parts of its business last quarter, but portions of its business like gaming, cloud infrastructure and productivity software helped smooth out the results as people remained at home around the world to reduce spread of the coronavirus. Alphabet is less diversified than Microsoft, with 84% of its revenue coming from Google advertising in the first quarter.<br/>Analysts polled by Refinitiv currently expect $37.35 billion in second-quarter revenue from Alphabet, suggesting a 4% year-over-year decline. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<br/>Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said Wednesday that the company expects search revenue for the current quarter, excluding traffic acquisition costs, to be down \"in the low 20% range.\" (Microsoft's fiscal year ended June 30.)<br/>Amid a broad sell-off in tech stocks on Thursday, Alphabet Class A shares were down as much as 3.5% and Microsoft stock traded as much as 4.4% lower.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 22: Homebuyers can now turn to Google Search for detailed info about mortgages<br/>Google on Wednesday updated its search engine with new tools for people shopping for mortgages, including a calculator, recent average mortgage rates and key terms homebuyers may need to know during the mortgage shopping process.<br/>Google teamed up with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to launch the new tools because it found that a lot of people were asking questions like \"what is a mortgage?\" and \"what is APR?\" among others.<br/>The tools are available on phones when you search \"mortgage.\" Just scroll down past the ads and you'll see it.<br/>Here's the kind of information it provides.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 21: Apple, Google and Sony will be critical to MLB season shortened by coronavirus<br/>Major League Baseball will look to Big Tech companies like Apple and Google to help with its shortened season that is scheduled to begin Thursday.<br/>On Monday, MLB provided a preview of how games will look and sound during the pandemic, with features like artificial crowd noise and an upgraded replay system for fans watching from home.<br/>Two games are scheduled for opening night: The defending World Series champion Washington Nationals host the New York Yankees at 7 p.m. ET, followed by the Los Angeles Dodgers hosting the San Francisco Giants at 10 p.m. ET.<br/>As part of the league's Covid-19 health and safety protocols, MLB said it would ban traditional video stations shared throughout clubhouses. The league took advantage of its 2016 partnership with Apple to expand the dugout iPad program. It will now distribute 15 iPads to each team for players and staff to dissect performances and additional team content like scouting reports.<br/>Google will also play a part, with all 30 teams using Google Cloud to run MLB's stat-tracking system, Statcast, and provide digital infrastructure for everything from team websites to online ticket sales.<br/>MLB partnered with the Google in March to be the league's official cloud partner. Jason Gaedtke, MLB chief technology officer, said Monday that the league selected Google for the firm's \"strength in large scale data processing, analytics and specifically machine-learning.\"<br/>With its Statcast 3D platform powered by Google, MLB said broadcasts can re-create game footage in a variety of virtual perspectives. Concepts like displaying a player's home run trails, pitching angles from a catcher and umpire's perspective and how play is affected by weather conditions will now be available for national and regional broadcast partners.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 20: Alphabet Class A<br/>Credit Suisse hiked its price target on the Google parent to $1,850 per share from $1,600 per share. The new price target implies an upside of 22% from Friday's close of $1,516.85. The analyst cited: \"1) ongoing monetization improvements in Search advertising through product/AI driven updates, 2) greater-than expected revenue contribution from non-Search businesses (YouTube, Cloud, and Play), 3) optionality and shareholder value creation from new monetization initiatives such as Maps\" positive catalysts for the stock. Alphabet shares rose more than 2%.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 17: Google will ban ads from running on stories spreading debunked coronavirus conspiracy theories<br/>Google next month will ban publishers from using its ad platform to show advertisements next to content that promotes conspiracy theories about Covid-19. It will also ban ads that promote those theories. In cases where a particular site publishes a certain threshold of material that violates these policies, it will ban the entire site from using its ad platforms.<br/>Alphabet's Google already prohibits ads from running against content that makes harmful claims about disease prevention and unsubstantiated cures, including anti-vaccine promotions or content that encourages users to forgo treatment. The company is now taking it a step further and banning ads against content that make claims going against authoritative scientific consensus. Banned claims would include conspiracy theories like vaccines being attempts to genetically modify the population, that Bill Gates created Covid-19 or that the disease was a bioweapon made in a Chinese lab.<br/>Google received nearly $135 billion in advertising revenue in 2019, in part through programs like AdSense and Ad Manager, in which websites that are approved can run programmatic advertising on their sites and make money using Google. About 15% of Google's revenue in the first quarter came from \"Google Network Members' properties,\" which the company said in its annual report primarily comes from sites participating in AdMob, AdSense and Google Ad Manager programs.<br/>Google will begin enforcing the change on Aug. 18, and can remove ads from single articles or, in some cases, entire sites. When it comes to removing ads from an entire site, the company said for most of its policies it has a percentage threshold for policy violations before it will fully demonetize a website. (The violation of some policies, like one preventing child sex abuse material, is considered by the company to be so egregious that they result in immediate site-level action).<br/>The news comes the same week as CNBC first reported that Google had begun running ads again on financial market website Zero Hedge.</p><p>July 17: Alphabet Class A<br/>Alongside Netflix, the so-called FANG stocks slid, continuing technology stocks weakness this week.

This resistance is sitting just above $1,175 for Alphabet's class C shares and right near $1,200 in GOOGL, Alphabet's class A shares.</p><p>Simply put, as Alphabet bounces in between those two technically important price levels, shares have been getting squeezed closer and closer to a breakout through their price ceiling. When that happens, we've got a clear signal that buyers are still in control of things in Alphabet -- and that it's time to join them.</p><p>Relative strength, the indicator down at the bottom of Alphabet's chart, adds some extra confidence to the upside setup here. That's because relative strength has been in an uptrend of its own since mid-September, signaling that Alphabet's shares are systematically outperforming the rest of the broad market right now. As long as that relative strength uptrend remains intact, Alphabet is statistically predisposed to keep on outperforming.</p><p>Risk management is key, particularly in this market.

(GOOGL[1], GOOG[2]), the parent company of search engine Google, is the dominant player in internet search and advertising and is scheduled to report Q3 2019 results after the close on Oct. 28. Analysts are expecting Alphabet to report tepid earnings gains on robust revenue growth, according to consensus estimates.Advertising remains by far the biggest source of revenue for Alphabet, contributing nearly 84% of the total in Q2 2019. As a result, investors will be keen to see progress in key metrics related to advertising, particularly the year-over-year change in paid clicks by users, which has been on an uptrend. </p><p>For the year 2019 through Oct. 22, Alphabet class A shares (GOOGL) are up by 18.8%, while the class C shares (GOOG) have gained 20.0%. By comparison, the S...00 Index has advanced by 19.5%. Alphabet has been among the big tech stocks weighed down by increasing political and regulatory scrutiny, including indications that it may be the subject of an antitrust[3] probe, according to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).A recent report from Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch sees some risk to Q3 EPS from various fines and settlements. These include a French tax settlement, new French digital taxes, and fines on YouTube.A big concern for investors has been whether Alphabet can maintain the revenue growth it enjoyed for much of the past decade. Its total quarterly revenue peaked at $39.276 billion in Q4 2018, before sliding to $36.339 billion in Q1 2019 and recovering partially to $38.944 billion in Q2 2019. The Q2 figure beat the estimate by 1.91%. The estimate for Q3 2019 represents a 19% increase in revenue.Alphabet's quarterly earnings figures, as measured by EPS[4], have been more volatile than revenues. Nonetheless, the company has been consistently profitable from 2003 onwards, posting only one quarterly loss in that time frame. The Q2 2019 actual EPS figure beat the estimate by nearly 24%, and the Q3 estimate anticipates EPS growth of only 2.78%.Sources: YCharts, Alphabet Investor RelationsAlong with the change in paid clicks, investors will be watching a related metric, cost-per-click. In online advertising, the cost-per-click is what the advertiser pays when a reader clicks on a company's search ad. From the perspective of websites and search engines such as Google that sell ad space, what they report as cost-per-click actually represents revenue that they are receiving from advertisers.Analysts provide no reliable estimates for paid clicks or cost-per-click for Q3 of this year. However, Alphabet's average cost-per-click fell by 28% in the same quarter a year ago, Q3 2018. Cost-per-click also fell 18% in Q3 2017. So, while paid clicks were increasing for Alphabet, the average revenue that advertisers have been paying them per click has been decreasing. However, the rise in paid clicks has more than offset the impact of declining cost-per-click, putting advertising revenue on an uptrend.Paid clicks alone may no longer be enough to boost Alphabet's growth longterm. As a result, the company also has been bolstering its EPS through an aggressive share repurchase[5] plan that is shrinking its shares outstanding[6]. In July, the company announced that it had authorized additional spending of $25 billion on share repurchases. This figure is equal to about 2.9% of Alphabet's current market capitalization[7].

Among the positive results were lower than expected traffic acquisition costs and earnings per share of $14.21, compared to the $11.30 expected by analysts. The company recorded a $989m loss in its \"other bets\" division, which includes \"moonshot\" investments such as the autonomous vehicle company Waymo.</p><p>Alphabet's relative slump came  amid increasing regulatory pressure in the US. On Tuesday, the US Department of Justice announced a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/23/tech-companies-antitrust-review\">broad antitrust review</url> of major online platforms. The US House of Representatives has also undertaken an       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/23/tech-companies-antitrust-review\">investigation of anti-competitive behavior</url> among major technology firms, and the justice department has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/23/tech-companies-antitrust-review\">reportedly</url> launched a specific antitrust investigation of Google.</p><p>\"It's not new to us,\" said Google's chief executive officer Sundar Pichai on a conference call with investors on Thursday, in response to a question about potential scrutiny by the justice department. \"We have participated in these processes before ... To the extent we have to answer questions we will do so, and to the extent there are concerns we will address them.\"</p><p>Google has been hit with serious fines by European regulators in the past, but has been left largely unmolested by US regulators to date. The Federal Trade Commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/23/tech-companies-antitrust-review\">concluded an antitrust investigation</url> of the company in 2013 without taking any legal action, against the recommendation of the agency's staff.</p><p>Political pressure will likely only increase with the 2020 US presidential election, in which \"big tech\" is certain to be a partisan punching bag. On Thursday, the longshot candidate Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/23/tech-companies-antitrust-review\">filed a $50m federal lawsuit</url> against Google alleging that it violated her first amendment rights by briefly suspending her campaign's advertising account.</p><p>The company also faces growing competition in the digital ad space from Amazon and Alibaba, which continue to make inroads against the Google-Facebook duopoly. An <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/23/tech-companies-antitrust-review\">attempt to enter the Chinese market</url> with a censored search engine was stymied by protests by Google employees. Other challenges include       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/23/tech-companies-antitrust-review\">concerns about inappropriate content</url> on YouTube from advertisers and ongoing activism from employees.</p><p>Investors continue to complain about a lack of transparency in Alphabet's financial reporting. The company divides its financial disclosures into three categories - advertising, other revenues and other bets - without specifying results for specific products, such as YouTube or Google Cloud. The secrecy has long frustrated investors and analysts, who are largely left into the dark as to the true state of the company's business.</p><p>Pichai and the chief financial officer Ruth Porat provided a few breadcrumbs to those seeking more information on the investor call, asserting that YouTube was the second largest contributor of revenue growth, followed by Google Cloud. Pichai said that Cloud has an annual run rate of more than $8bn.</p><p>The company also reported a headcount of 107,646 employees, up 20% from a year ago. The headcount figure excludes a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/23/tech-companies-antitrust-review\">workforce of temps and contractors</url> roughly equal in size. Porat said that the headcount will grow at a slightly higher rate than expected throughout the rest of 2019 as Google plans to bring more sub-contracted positions in house.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-54772752</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN7-CV91-F021-641G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><timeReceived>9:35 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

In comments filed with the agency earlier this month supporting the FCC's proposal to unlock the set-top box, Googleencouraged the commission to move forward with a rulemaking compelling pay-TV providers to offer their services on third-party navigation devices, giving consumers an option outside of leasing the devices monthly from providers themselves. 'There is widespread agreement that consumers should have\u00a0simple and consistent ways to find and watch lawfully obtained content, whether that content is\u00a0provided by a pay-TV service or available online,' the company wrote in its filing[1]. 'Googlesupports innovation in solutions for\u00a0search and discovery of content for consumption on the TV screen, which can open newopportunities for partnerships and benefit consumers without eroding copyright, data security, or\u00a0privacy protections.' </p><p>At the same time the company pushed back against potential new privacy regulations for new entrants like Alphabet Inc, personally cited by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler as an example of a new competitor in the market. Under the Communications Act, Googlewouldn't be subject to the same consumer privacy standards cable and satellite providers must adhere to. In answer, Wheeler said he wants third parties to certify they'll follow the same rules. Subjecting traditional pay-TV providers and new entrants alike to new privacy requirements could take a large bite out of the comprehensive data dragnet Googlecollects and monetizes via its search engine and platforms like YouTube, which have positioned it as the targeted digital advertising behemoth it is today. 'Imposing new privacy rules specifically directed to new generations of devices and applications is unnecessary given the comprehensive scope of the [Federal Trade Commission] Act and state privacy laws, which can be enforced directly against equipment manufacturers and application developers in appropriate cases,' Googlewrote. Instead, the company suggested, the FCC should 'work closely with the FTC to ensure that consumers are protected if device providers fail to live up to their privacy obligations.' The FTC's case-by-case enforcement regulatory approach differs from the FCC's traditionally strict guidelines with regard to the data service providers can collect and monetize from consumers. It isn't the first time Alphabet Inchas taken a 'thee not me' approach to FCC intervention. The web giant supported[2]the agency's net neutrality rules ahead of the vote to adopt them last year, effectively ensuring equal web traffic treatment by Internet service providers without having to pay ISPs anything additional for potentially taking an outsized bite out of their bandwidth with its popular search engine and YouTube. At the same time ISPs fought against Title II reclassification, Alphabet Incencouraged the FCC not to forebear from reclassifying the Internet as a public utility service, admitting[3] it would give the company's own entrance into the market with GoogleFiber the chance to take advantage of existing public utility poles and infrastructure. An extension of the net neutrality order could soon subject ISPs, who already have an increasingly limited view[4]of consumer data, to stricter consumer privacy rules than they were previously subject to under FTC jurisdiction. The rules would make little difference to Google, with its multiple platforms for acquiring data outside of GoogleFiber. Future of TV Coalition, an industry group counting Comcast, Dish, Time Warner Cable and others among its members, described the FCC's set-top box proposal as 'an assault on consumer privacy.' 'They will strip viewers of vital safeguards for their viewing choices and add 'what we watch' to the mountains of data being mined and exploited by privacy scofflaws like Google, alongside their existing files of what we search for on the Internet; what we say in our Gmail at home, work, and school; what happens in our 'Nest'-connected homes; and where we go using Waze and GoogleMaps,' the group wrote in a blog post[5]. In his announcement of the proposal, Wheeler, citing a congressional study, said the cost of set-top boxes has risen 185 percent, while the cost of computers, TVs and mobile phones has dropped 90 percent. According to the survey, the set-top box lease market is worth almost $20 billion[6] and costs the average consumer $231 annually.

After all, Google's advertising business brought in $136 billion in revenue in 2018, giving it the cushion to lose $3.4 billion on its far-out projects last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alphabet's 14 companies work on everything from life extension and airborne wind energy to smart cities and cybersecurity. For investors looking to cash in on long-term technologies, Alphabet offers a wide-ranging window into what the future may look like. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I understand why when people look at this from the outside they say it's a little random. The bets seem disconnected and somewhat disjointed,\" said Pascal Finette, chair of entrepreneurship and open innovation at Singularity University, which focuses on the future. \"But if you peel back the layers, I think you can see how a lot of the pieces actually fit nicely together.\" </p><p>But Alphabet isn't the only company addressing these topics. It has a long list of competitors with similar aspirations who might cash in on the success of the technologies before Alphabet does.</p><p>Cities</p><p>One of Alphabet's biggest bets is rebuilding and modernizing cities, but it's been trailing competitors that have already launched projects. Alphabet's urban innovation company, Sidewalk Labs, has faced opposition as it plans to develop part of Toronto's waterfront. Critics say Sidewalk Labs' vision of a smart city --- full of cameras, sensors and self-driving cars --- raises alarming privacy concerns. Alphabet is now tackling complex social challenges like privacy rights in public spaces that weren't barriers when it rolled out its search engine years ago.</p><p>Its biggest competitors in this space include telecom giants Verizon and AT&amp;T, CNN's parent company. Both have mounted cameras high above streets in Atlanta, Portland, San Diego and Washington DC to collect data and empower cities to make better decisions. In Washington DC earlier this year, drivers using Verizon-owned Mapquest were told if parking spots were open on several blocks near the White House.</p><p>Alphabet has competition from academic institutions and cities themselves, too. In Seattle, the University of Washington Freight Lab is working with the city to put sensors in loading zones, to detect when a truck is present. The hope is to alert drivers where open loading zones are, so they won't have to double park and block traffic.</p><p>In Los Angeles, the government has launched an ambitious plan to track vehicle movements throughout the city. The program would help the city understand and manage congestion and safety issues.</p><p>To find the next big thing, Alphabet will need to make up a lot of ground.</p><p>\"There aren't many businesses that deliver returns like Google's core business, so it drives them to embark on these pretty outlandish looking missions,\" Finette said. \"They're pushing the envelope for what is the next big company in the next 5, 10, 20 years.\"</p><p>Artificial intelligence in healthcare</p><p>Alphabet's companies all have one thing in common: artificial intelligence. But its interest in the technology spans many industries, from its self-driving car unit Waymo to DeepMind, which uses AI for health care, to make data centers more efficient and to calculate the best moves in games such as Go and Starcraft.</p><p>One of the biggest new areas of focus for Alphabet is in the health care space, which accounts for a sixth of the dollars spent in the US economy. Alphabet-owned Calico, which launched in 2013 in San Francisco, is developing drugs with the help of AI to fight aging and age-related diseases, combines biology and medical experts with leaders in artificial intelligence. </p><p>Alphabet also has used AI to detect diseases by allowing the technology to recognize patterns, such as whether a clump of cells are cancerous. DeepMind has a partnership with the Cancer Research UK Imperial Centre and the Jikei University Hospital to analyze mammograms from 30,000 women and see if the technology can spot cancer better than current screening techniques.</p><p>But it's not alone in rethinking health care. Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan announced in 2018 that they are working together on a project to lower health care costs and improve the quality of US health care. The effort, called Haven, aims to change policies, contracts, technologies and systems, with the help of data and AI to ultimately improve care. Financial terms have not been disclosed, and Haven hasn't said when it will launch.</p><p>Autonomous vehicles</p><p>Alphabet believes its self-driving cars could indirectly impact the health care industry, too. Each year 1.25 million people die in traffic crashes worldwide. If autonomous vehicles are significantly safer than humans, many lives could be saved.</p><p>Google realized this possibility in 2009 and was first in the tech industry to work on self-driving cars for consumers. It has since spun off its self-driving project as Waymo, which operates a limited ride-hailing service in a Phoenix suburb. It has 600 vehicles in its fleet, most in the Phoenix area, and it's also testing in the Bay Area, Washington State and Detroit.</p><p>But many competitors have surfaced since Waymo separated from Google in 2016. Car and tech companies such as Tesla, Ford and General Motors are now investing billions of dollars to compete with Waymo. </p><p>Some former Waymo employees have left to form their own autonomous vehicle startups, too. Chris Urmson, who previously led the Google self-driving car project, launched Aurora in 2017 to deliver self-driving technology quickly, broadly and safely. Aurora develops the computer system that functions as the car's driver, safely navigating roads.</p><p>The company has raised over $530 million from investors, including Amazon. It is testing cars on the road today, and works with large automakers such as VW and Hyundai.</p><p>Bryan Salesky, who previously directed hardware development at the Google self-driving car project, created Argo AI, which is developing self-driving cars for Ford. Meanwhile, former Google engineers Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu launched Nuro, which has delivered groceries in autonomous vehicles for the Kroger grocery chain. Nuro is focused on delivering goods in local communities.</p><p>The technology is still a long ways from becoming mainstream and a part of our daily lives. While Google was early, it may not be the company that makes the most money from autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Drones and satellites</p><p>When Amazon kicked off the drone delivery space in 2013 by revealing a project to drop packages in customers' yards, experts said the concept could revolutionize how things are brought to us.</p><p>The industry has been somewhat slow to get drone deliveries off the ground due to technology and regulatory challenges, but general interest is growing.</p><p>Alphabet-owned Wing is now delivering food to 100 households in an Australian suburb during daytime hours as a part of a pilot program. Wing's drones hover over the delivery site and lower the package on a rope.</p><p>Amazon is still testing delivery drones of its own. To date, it has only launched a small trial in England with package deliveries to two customers in 2016.</p><p>Competition is happening outside of the big tech companies, as well. Zipline, a Silicon Valley startup, started delivering medical supplies in Rwanda in 2016 and expanded to Ghana this spring. Zipline says it is valued at $1.2 billion.</p><p>The industry is still in its early days, and it's unclear who the biggest winners will be or if any take off at all.</p><p>Alphabet is looking toward the sky for other innovations, too: Its subsidiary Loon provides internet access via balloons to remote areas, and it's helping a partner operate satellites, another increasingly hot area of investment. In addition, SpaceX launched 60 small satellites into space earlier this month to provide internet access to the public, and OneWeb, which recently raised $1.25 billion in new capital, plans to use satellites to give rural schools online access in the coming years.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
