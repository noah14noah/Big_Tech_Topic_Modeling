Not only have none of the predicted negative consequences occurred since Pai\u2019s more free-market version of net neutrality was enacted, but to the contrary data speeds have risen sharply, investment is up, and there have been no notable episodes of discrimination by ISPs.</p><p> The heart of the Pai order is a trans-pa rency rule, which replaces heavy-handed regulation with market discipline\u2014in effect, if you want to treat traffic in a non-neutral fashion you can, but you have to explain what you\u2019re doing to your customers.</p><p> Ironically, the Big Tech companies continue to pursue reimposition of the heavy-handed Obama neutrality regulations on ISPs even as they fend off efforts to similarly regulate themselves or limit their liability protections.</p><p> But the success of the Pai order suggests a much more elegant solution: Big Tech should be subject to a transparency rule and, if they do in fact discriminate against certain content, they should explain how to their customers.</p><p> Such a rule could require clear disclosure of how traffic is treated, and clear specification of the standards used for limiting speech, including any possible viewpoint discrimination. Platforms that represent themselves to the public as neutral could be subject to civil complaints if they violate those representations.</p><p> A transparency rule would avoid the perils of more heavy-handed government regulation, dissipate the distrust toward Big Tech from the left and right, and harmonize the rules for ISPs with the rules for the edge giants they are increasingly competing with in the advertising market.</p><p> Crafting a transparency rule for Big Tech is easier said than done, of course. But just as with regulation of ISPs, it could be the least-bad option.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKLA-1776F942CD7F84C6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28986CE7D73CB3 NWBKLA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKJ-FMM1-JBCN-40G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401937</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Franklin Banner-Tribune, Louisiana State Newspapers, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

But that's not the whole story, and some changes are coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the wake of the disclosure that nearly 90 million Facebook users' information were passed on to political ad targeting firm Cambridge Analytica without their consent, tech companies are on the defensive.</p><p>Consumers and lawmakers want to know how much their favorite apps have collected of their choices and movements and what they do with this personal information.</p><p>Apple has made a point of trying to differentiate its approach to consumers' information. On its website, it notes that it collects less data about us than the other big tech companies and then bumps up the security by scrambling it so it doesn't identify who it comes from. Additionally, it says it keeps most of the data on our devices, as opposed to Apple servers, and it's encrypted on those devices and only accessible via your passcode.</p><p>And it says it will make it easier to track the information the company collects about us, and to download or delete it, later this year. Currently, getting the data back from Apple is cumbersome and slow.</p><p>The new tools are to comply with new privacy rules, called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), that go into effect in the European Union in late May. In a nutshell, the rules look to give the user more controls over how their data is used.</p><p>Major tech companies are all beefing up their privacy stance to deal with these new rules and consumer blowout over the Facebook data scandal.</p><p>Apple's approach</p><p>So how is Apple different? The iPhone and Macbook maker can make some claims to privacy that stem from a hardware-, not advertising-, based business model. It sells products to us, primarily hardware such as phones, computers, watches and tablets.</p><p>Remember that with Facebook and Google, we are the engines that enable the companies to sell advertising. When we like a post, check in to a restaurant, ask for directions to a business or search for a hotel to visit, Facebook and Google learn more about us, and coupled with our demographic and location information, can help advertisers to reach us -- making the two companies the juggernauts of digital advertising.</p><p>Apple insists it \"doesn't gather your personal information to sell to advertisers or other organizations.\" Such a statement only goes so far -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes a point of saying Facebook doesn't sell users' data to advertisers, either. What the social network sells is advertisers' access to users, who brands can target with all the information it has gleaned from their activity.</p><p>As for Apple, our always-on iPhones gather up a lot of information, too. When we turn on our phones, the GPS knows where we are, what we do and where we go. When we ask Siri for directions or a recipe, Apple takes note. But Apple says it doesn't share that info with outside companies. It does, however, allow advertisers to target users based on their history in the App Store and News app.</p><p>The iPhone maker tries to differentiate itself further. Unlike Facebook and Google, Apple says it scrambles this information and looks at patterns of usage, not at who it's coming from.</p><p>Apple says that once scrambled, it combines it with the data of millions of others. \"So we see general patterns, rather than specifics that could be traced back to you. These patterns help us identify things like the most popular emoji, the best QuickType suggestions and energy consumption rates in Safari,\" the company says.</p><p>The company does admit that it freely collects information about what music we listen to, what movies, books and apps we download, which is \"aggregated\" and used to help Apple make recommendations. Apple says it doesn't share this information with outside companies, either.</p><p>If you want to see your data ...</p><p>As we discovered when we downloaded our data directly back from Facebook and Google, the social network had made copies of every photo I'd ever posted and held onto phone numbers, addresses and names of my friends. Google had kept copies of every search made, including ones conducted in \"Incognito\" mode, which is advertised as private searching.</p><p>What Apple won't do, at least for now, is make it easy for you to get your data so you can check out what exactly Apple has held onto. Facebook and Google offer this service, through a download request that can take a few hours to generate. Then you get an email link to download it yourself and get shocked at just how much the social network and search giant has held onto.</p><p>Apple hides the data request deep inside the privacy section of the website. To get there, it's four clicks from the main page and buried in the 11th subhead on the page.</p><p>(I put in the data request Monday just after 11 a.m. Some 22 hours later Tuesday, we heard back from Apple, saying we could get the report once we replied with our full name, Apple ID, email address, street address, phone number and serial number of an Apple product.)</p><p>Gee, and with Facebook and Google, all we had to do was click a button, and we got the data report sent, no questions asked. Look for a follow-up here soon with what I find in the download.</p><p>You can also call Apple Care at 1-800-692-7753 to request that Apple deletes your data, if that's your choice.</p><p>Apple says it will streamline the process to make it more user-friendly, making it easier to get a copy of your data and tools to deactivate and/or delete your account beginning in May in Europe. It will roll out the more consumer friendly privacy page in the U.S. later this year.</p><p>Apple does sell ads</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple also does sell ads as well, on a far smaller scale. These appear in the News app and App Store, based on your interests. By default, on the iPhone you've allowed Apple to serve you ads based on what it thinks are your interests.</p><p>\"To ensure ads are relevant, Apple's advertising platform creates groups of people, called segments, who share similar characteristics and uses these groups for delivering targeted ads,\" the policy reads.</p><p>Want to stop Apple from doing this? Go to the settings section on the iPhone, click Privacy, and click advertising at the way bottom. Click the LIMIT AD TRACKING tab.

There is a through-the-looking-glass quality to the debate for those of us who have spent the last 15 years or so in the Net Neutrality wars. The same players \u2014 including Big Tech companies themselves and their surrogates \u2014 who have told us for years that only heavy-handed government neutrality regulations can save us from ISPs manipulating traffic and acting as gatekeepers are now recoiling in horror at the prospect of a neutrality regulation for Big Tech companies that are engaging in precisely such manipulation. At the same time, many of the people who most strongly opposed Obama's mangled form of net neutrality are now insistent that we repeat the same big government mistakes to address the behavior of Big Tech. </p><p>Sen. Ted Cruz brought Section 230 \u2014 the provision of U.S. law that provides intermediary liability protection to the tech companies \u2014 into the scope of the debate by suggesting that limiting such a government-granted benefit could provide a mechanism for conservatives ideologically suspect of regulation to address the perceived thumb these companies had on the scale for Democratic candidates and their liberal allies. Sen. Josh Hawley pushed this idea to an extreme almost shocking from a Republican \u2014 a bill requiring certification of political neutrality by federal bureaucrats to retain 230 protection. Cruz and Hawley understand something too many professional analysts on the right ignore at their peril \u2014 the conservative base is nearing a boiling point in its hatred of Big Tech and sees this as a central front in the culture war, not a venue for economic policy subject to ideological constraints. How, in this context, can we chart a path forward that can satisfy this base anger without betraying free-market principles? The answer could lie in FCC Chairman Aji Pai's brilliant resolution of the net neutrality issue. Not only have none of the predicted negative consequences occurred since Pai's more free-market version of net neutrality was enacted, but to the contrary, data speeds have risen sharply, investment is up, and there have been no notable episodes of discrimination by ISPs. The heart of the Pai order is a transparency rule, which replaces heavy-handed regulation with market discipline \u2014 in effect, if you want to treat traffic in a non-neutral fashion you can, but you have to explain what you're doing to your customers. Ironically, the Big Tech companies continue to pursue reimposition of the heavy-handed Obama neutrality regulations on ISPs even as they fend off efforts to similarly regulate themselves or limit their liability protections. But the success of the Pai order suggests a much more elegant solution: Big Tech should be subject to a transparency rule and, if they do in fact discriminate against certain content, they should explain how to their customers. Such a rule could require clear disclosure of how traffic is treated, and clear specification of the standards used for limiting speech, including any possible viewpoint discrimination. Platforms that represent themselves to the public as neutral could be subject to civil complaints if they violate those representations. A transparency rule would avoid the perils of more heavy-handed government regulation, dissipate the distrust toward Big Tech from the left and right, and harmonize the rules for ISPs with the rules for the edge giants they are increasingly competing with in the advertising market. Crafting a transparency rule for Big Tech is easier said than done, of course. But just as with regulation of ISPs, it could be the least-bad option.

The company also participated in a $10 million funding round last April in Tru Optik, a tech company that specializes in over-the-top advertising.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re focused on marketing solutions that are people-based because it\u2019s the future of marketing effectiveness and delivers value to the consumer,\u201d Matt Spiegel, evp of marketing solutions and head of media at TransUnion, said in a statement.</p><p>TransUnion has acquired Signal during a pandemic that\u2019s made deal-making more complicated as work-from-home setups and a squeeze on ad spend change priorities for both buyers and sellers.</p><p>The deal also comes as ad targeting faces an existential threat from both lawmakers and Big Tech. Industry bodies are coming together to preserve addressable advertising, but regulators and giants like Apple and Google are putting pressure on how consumer data is collected and used.</p><p>\u201cWhen we talk about a people-based future, this strategy is: rooted in a stable offline foundation of consumer identity data, applies a multikey approach to identity, doesn\u2019t rely on a singular identifier and considers consent at the core. We believe that privacy and personalization are both critically important in this future\u2013and must coexist to be successful,\u201d a TransUnion spokesperson said.</p><p>Signal is based in Chicago and has 30 full-time employees, not including contracts, according to the spokesperson, who added that TransUnion\u2019s acquisition of Signal is an investment in both people and product, and that TransUnion is excited to welcome all Signal associates on board as leadership integrates solutions and teams.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1190044</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M8-DXW1-DYRK-H008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"412\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

New administration guidance sent to overseas posts Wednesday says visa applicants must prove they have a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son or daughter-in-law, or a sibling in the U.S. ROMANS: Right. Among the relationships not on the list -- grandparents, grandchildren, aunts or uncles, nieces or nephews, cousins, brothers in law, sisters in law, fiances or other extended family members.</p><p>The high court ruled those accepted to universities or workers who have taken a job at a U.S. company will be allowed in.</p><p>BRIGGS: The travel ban news coming after Homeland Security <person><nameText>Secretary John Kelly </nameText></person>announced new global aviation security measures which do not include an all-out laptop ban as some expected.</p><p>CNN's Rene Marsh has more from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RENE MARSH, CNN AVIATION AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS CORRESPONDENT: Christine and Dave, Homeland Security <person><nameText>Secretary John Kelly </nameText></person>announced new global aviation security measures on Wednesday. Now, the new measures are directed at overseas airports with direct flights to the United States. Kelly says that the measures will be both seen and unseen, and they'll be phased in over time.</p><p>These new security measures will include greater scrutiny of passengers entering the United States, enhanced screening of electronic devices, and the increased deployment of K-9s that detect explosives. It will be up to the airlines to implement the changes since DHS, the Department of Homeland Security, only has jurisdiction over carriers that fly to the United States. They don't have jurisdiction over foreign airports.</p><p>Now, if an airline refuses to follow the new security measures, they could be included in a laptop ban, face financial penalties, or they could be banned from operating direct flights to the United States.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security says that the move is a way to address the threat that intelligence suggests is looming without having to do an all-out laptop ban.</p><p>Back to you, guys.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Rene Marsh in Washington, thank you, Rene.</p><p>Cardinal George Pell, a top adviser to Pope Francis and the highest ranking member of the Catholic Church in Australia, is facing sexual assault charges this morning. Speaking at the Vatican a short time ago, Pell proclaimed his innocence, not only denying the allegations, but promising to return to Australia to fight the charges and clear his name.</p><p>CNN's Delia Gallagher is in Rome with the latest.</p><p>Delia, what can you tell us? DELIA GALLAGHER, CNNVATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Christine, as you mentioned, the cardinal came out this morning here at the Vatican to say that this was a relentless character assassination. These allegations have been swirling in the media for some time. And the cardinal has always denied them.</p><p>What's important this morning is that the Vatican as well came out and said that they are supporting the cardinal, that they have respect for the Australian justice system which will have its trial and that they are allowing him a leave of absence to return to Australia. So, there's no question of him having to be extradited or being protected by the Vatican. The cardinal saying he is going to clear his name.</p><p>What's really significant about this, not only with these charges being brought against one of the highest officials of the Catholic Church, but at a time in the pontificate of Pope Francis where he has been criticized for his handling of sex abuse. You know, he came in on a zero tolerance policy. He established a commission to advise him on sex abuse. One of his most prominent members, Marie Collins, resigned a few months ago saying it was ineffective.</p><p>So, in all of the praise for Pope Francis, there has been criticism for him on sex abuse. So, this is going to be a very important test case. Not only for the question in Australia and for the alleged victims there and for Cardinal Pell but for the Vatican and Pope Francis who will, of course, be waiting for the outcome of that trial on July 18th -- Christine.</p><p>[04:35:03] ROMANS: All right. Delia Gallagher, in Rome for us this morning, thank you, Delia.</p><p>BRIGGS: Meanwhile, pressure increasing on Senate Republicans to come up with a health care bill that can pass the Senate. They're still trying to thread an incredibly tight needle that will satisfy both moderates and conservatives. But that's not stopping <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>from sounding optimistic.</p><p>Just a day after Senate leaders called off the health care vote for this week, the president offered this thought.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Health care is working along very well. We could have a big surprise with a great health care package. So, now, they're happy.</p><p>REPORTER: What do you mean by big surprise, sir?</p><p>TRUMP: I think you're going to have a great, great surprise. It's going to be great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Promising a big surprise in the next episode.</p><p>BRIGGS: With the Chicago Cubs in the backgrounds, by the way.</p><p>ROMANS: No word -- yes, that what that was? All right. No word on what that would be.</p><p>Worth noting the president has a history of raising, then dashing expectations. Senate Republicans are said to be making progress, and the president is open to changes.</p><p>CNN's Phil Mattingly has more on that from Capitol Hill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Now, Dave and Christine, there was some optimism if no clear path forward yet, at least when it comes to health care. Look, senators are kind of moving things behind closed doors again, trying to figure out a way to hammer forward on a deal. How that deal's actually going to come about is still an open question.</p><p>But one of the biggest issues is that this isn't about one policy here or one provision there. This is about ideology. And inside the Republican Conference, all 52 senators, some have starkly different views about the government's role in health care.</p><p>Take a listen to what Maine Senator Susan Collins had to say.</p><p>SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE: There is significant opposition to the health care bill here in the Senate. The opposition comes from various quarters and ideological spectrum is really wide. So, it's going to be a challenge.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Now, guys, a key element here is this: Susan Collins very much so has fundamental, that's her word, problems with this bill. She's kind of on the moderate side of things. If you look on the complete opposite side of the spectrum, Rand Paul is in a similar place but for very different issues. And when you kind of consider those dynamics, you recognize why this is such a difficult process for Republican leaders in the U.S. Senate.</p><p>Now there's a pot of money for them to work with to try and appease the senators from Medicaid expansion states. Some of the senators who are concerned about opioid addiction and trying to address that. On the other side of things, trying to figure out ways to appease those conservatives who want those regulations cut back further.</p><p>But at this point, they haven't quite figured out that magic bullet yet. We'll see if they get there. They certainly want to get this done or at least have a compromise agreement hammered out by the end of this week. Get a CBO score next week. Come back and vote on it the week after.</p><p>They've got to get the compromise agreement first. And at least at this point, they aren't there -- Dave and Christine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIGGS: Still a heavy lift. Thank you, Phil.</p><p>Happening today, the House votes on two pillars of the president's immigration strategy. The first bill known as Kate's Law would stiffen mandatory penalties for those who reenter the country illegally after being deported. The second bill penalizes so-called sanctuary cities that don't cooperate with federal immigration enforcement measures.</p><p>ROMANS: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>touting his support for both yesterday via Twitter. Tomorrow, the House votes on Kate's Law and No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. Lawmakers must vote to put American safety first. #SaveAmericanLives.</p><p>The president also trying to build momentum by meeting with families of victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.</p><p>BRIGGS: CNN has learned senior administration officials say they are having a hard time, convincing the president that Moscow still poses a threat. A congressional source saying NSA Director Mike Rogers expressed his frustration with lawmakers in a closed door meeting, saying the president is not accepting intelligence that Russia melded in the election.</p><p>ROMANS: Another senior official says there's, quote, no evidence steps are being taken to address the issue. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer says the White House combats malicious cyber activity on a regular basis and will do so without bragging to the media.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>resuming his fight with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The president tweeting that the Amazon \"Washington Post\" is not paying, quote, Internet taxes, and that it's fake news.</p><p>First off, \"The Washington Post\" isn't owned by Amazon but Bezos personally. It's not clear what the president means by Internet taxes. If it's sales tax, that was true of Amazon, but not anymore. For years, brick and mortar stores blasted Amazon for not paying sales tax, because states only tax retailers with a physical presence, giving online companies an advantage. But since then, Amazon has opened stores and fulfillment centers. It now pays taxes in every state.</p><p>The president frequently attacked Bezos during the campaign, claiming he used the \"Washington Post\" as a toy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP</p><p>TRUMP: Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He's using the \"Washington Post\" for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[04:40:06] ROMANS: Relations seem to have warmed since the election. The Amazon CEO has met with the president several times, including with other tech executives earlier this month. So, he's sitting next to Satya Nadella and to his left then is Jeff Bezos in that --</p><p>BRIGGS: You wonder if there's pushback from Bezos, the hashtag #AmazonWashingtonPost was hysterical yesterday. There's some great memes on that.</p><p>ROMANS: Like Wonderwoman-like in there, yes, delivering a package.</p><p>BRIGGS: Check it out on Twitter.</p><p>All right. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>kicking off his bid for a second term. Yes, already. Why so early? How rare is this? And why the venue is raising some eyebrows.</p><p>BRIGGS: National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster says the U.S. has prepared a range of options to use against North Korea, quote, including a military option.</p><p>[04:45:05] Two U.S. military officials tell CNN updated options have been prepared. They'll be presented to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>if North Korea conducts a nuclear or ballistic missile test that shows it's made significant progress developing a weapon that could attack the U.S.</p><p>McMaster publicly confirmed those options in remarks Wednesday at a Washington think tank.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>H.R. MCMASTER, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: The threat is much more immediate now. And so, so, it's clear that we can't repeat the same approach, failed approach of the past. The president has directed us to not do that. And to prepare a range of options including a military option which nobody wants to take.</p><p>There's a recognition that there has to be more pressure on the regime. I think what you'll see in coming days and weeks are efforts to do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: This comes following the death of American student Otto Warmbier while in North Korean custody, and a day ahead of a visit to Washington by South Korean President Moon. McMaster says the visit will include discussions on a new approach to North Korea.</p><p>I want to talk about in and get the latest from CNN's Paula Hancocks in Seoul for us this morning.</p><p>So, the president weighing a range of new options on North Korea.</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Christine, they say they are new options, but to be honest, these options are the same as they have always been. It is understandable that a new administration wants to update those options. And certainly, the military option has to be updated considering North Korea has very clearly stated that it wants to be able to hit the mainland United States with a nuclear tipped ballistic missile.</p><p>But, basically, the options we're looking are negotiations, dialogue potentially, or you're looking at sanction, whether or not those can be strengthened against North Korea. The China option -- whether or not China can put more pressure on North Korea to stop its nuclear missile testing, and whether it wants to put more pressure on. And, then, of course, the military option which McMaster did point out nobody wants. That's not a viable option at this point.</p><p>And also at this point, six North Korea experts based in the United States have actually written an open letter to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>saying that now is the time to talk, urging him to talk in order to, quote, avoid a nuclear catastrophe. That could well be the message we hear as well from the South Korean President Moon Jae-in when he meets with <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>later today. He is pro-engagement, he is pro- dialogue.</p><p>But very interestingly, people here and certainly the media here in South Korea, is not focusing on North Korea, not focusing on matters of it substance. They're more concerned about the personal relationship between the two. They are wondering at this point whether or not the handshake will be a good handshake. Whether or not President Moon and <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>will get on.</p><p>So, certainly, the more interpersonal dimension is being discussed here in South Korea.</p><p>ROMANS: Paula Hancocks for us in Seoul, thanks, Paul.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right. <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>2020 campaign kicked off last night. Yes, you heard that right -- 2020 under a shroud of secrecy. The White House abruptly changing course, hours after saying a press pool would be allowed. Officials blaming the switch on confusion with the Republican national committee and the logistics of bringing the press in at the last moment.</p><p>This as more than two years earlier in the cycle than George W. Bush or Barack Obama held their first re-election fundraisers. Strategists say the president is sending a message to Republicans that he's not going anywhere.</p><p>BRIGGS: RNC officials say they expected to raise about $10 million from the event at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. That's right. He had a fundraiser down the street from the White House in a hotel that he owns.</p><p>A source familiar with the president's speech says he was in peak entertainer mode and that, quote, it was well-worth what everybody paid. The very fact that the fundraiser was held at Trump's Washington hotel is still not sitting well with some lawmakers. Democratic Congressman Gerry Connolly called it another example of the massive conflict of interest around the Trump Hotel and, quote, just plain wrong.</p><p>A lot of political observers have said, look, this is unprecedented. He's breaking the rules as he's done all along the campaign. He's also most comfortable campaign, potentially, not governing.</p><p>BRIGGS: No question.</p><p>ROMANS: And so, here you go. Big message to potential primary challengers and to the Republican Party that, hey, I'm not going anywhere.</p><p>BRIGGS: But also, some would argue inappropriate given how much business has not been done. No major legislation. And of the 562 key positions in the administration, 390 have no nominee. So, where should his attention be at this point?</p><p>ROMANS: Right. He should be filling up the government roles.</p><p>You know, he touted Gorsuch and he touted some of his immigration executive orders and the like. But, yes, it's totally, totally unprecedented.</p><p>All right. Wall Street losing its appetite for Blue Apron, and Amazon is to blame. That's on CNN \"Money Stream\" next.</p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>[04:54:07] BRIGGS: A bad situation in Venezuela is getting worse. The attorney general had her assets frozen as being barred from leaving the country by the Supreme Court. Luisa Ortega-Diaz has criticized the Maduro government's crackdown on protesters.</p><p>ROMANS: Authorities in Venezuela have now located the helicopter used in that attack on the country's supreme court. The pilot believed to be an officer in Venezuela's investigative police force is still at large.</p><p>Journalist Stefano Pozzebon has covered the unrest in Venezuela. He joins us live from London.</p><p>Stefano, the attorney general due in court next week. What is she accused of? Is the investigation a political message? What's going on?</p><p>STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST: Yes, Christine. What we're seeing is a massive conflict of authority between the government and attorney general's office. It's rumored that the attorney general used to be one of the close of -- President Maduro's closest allies, after a few months ago.</p><p>[04:55:04] In fact, in 2014, in the wave of unrest and protests in Venezuela, she was the one signing orders against protesters. Now in 2017, she broke the ranks and she has become, she took the baton as one of the harshest critics on Nicolas Maduro's effort to reform the constitution. So, we think we are seeing this conflict with sentences (ph) going one way, and the other.</p><p>Nicolas Maduro's allies that control the Supreme Court have called for a trial on Luisa Ortega to happen on the 4th of July. So, next week will be the next key date, and we're monitoring very closely to see how the situation develops down in Caracas.</p><p>ROMANS: It's so fascinating. You talk about the political unrest. But for the people -- for the Venezuelan people, it has been an economic crisis for some time, too. I mean, daily life is difficult.</p><p>POZZEBON: Daily life in Caracas is extremely difficult, and the rest of the country is even worse. Let's not forget that according to the latest figure published by the health ministry in March, up to 30 babies died every day in Caracas because of rising infant mortality. The economic crisis has hit every day economy, and it's hard to find every day (INAUDIBLE), milk, medicine, aspirin. These are stuff that in Caracas and elsewhere in Venezuela are getting precious by the day and harder to find.</p><p>So, the reason why people are taking to the streets every day, the reason why people keep despite growing use of public force to try to contend the protest, despite that, we are seeing these people take the street because they're hungry.</p><p>ROMANS: Stefano, thank you for bringing us up to speed on that. We look forward to your reporting in the future again. Thank you.</p><p>We'll also get a check on CNN \"Money Stream\" this morning.</p><p>Global markets, global stock markets, U.S. stock futures mostly higher today after Wall Street rebounded from Tuesday's losses. Big tech stocks boosting the Nasdaq to its biggest rally since the election. The S&amp;P 500 had its best day in two months.</p><p>You can thank bank stocks. They rose about 1.6 percent after the Fed gave U.S. banks a clean bill of health. Stocks fell Tuesday after the Senate delayed its vote on the health care bill, prompting worries about the future of the president's economic agenda. So, that's a push-pull there you're seeing.</p><p>The iPhone, happy birthday. It turns 10-years-old today. Aw. I remember when you were just a baby.</p><p>Apple has sold more than one billion phones since its birthday. Did you know the iPhone almost didn't happen? Several former Apple engineers opened up to CNN about why the iPhone shouldn't have worked.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDY GRIGNON, FORMER SENIOR MANAGER, APPLE: When you make a new laptop, you make a new desktop, whatever, you start with a thing that works. You change the screen, maybe add a new little feature here and there. But that's it. You're done.</p><p>IPhone was brand new from the chip up. We had to write everything from scratch. We hit problems in every layer of every stack. It was a nightmare.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: A nightmare that is, you know, ubiquitous. You can check out the entire story about the creation of the iPhone at CNNMoney.com.</p><p>All right. Wall Street is losing its appetite for Blue Apron just as a new threat emerges from Amazon. The meal kit company is slashing its IPO price to $10 per share. That puts the value about a billion less than it had hoped.</p><p>Competition in the meal kit industry is tough. And investors worry about Amazon's deal with Whole Foods. Whole Foods and Amazon already offer prepared meals combined. It would have the largest distribution network of any meal kit service.</p><p>Do you do a meal kit?</p><p>BRIGGS: I've never tried one. I've long wanted to try Blue Apron. I've heard great things.</p><p>ROMANS: There's a lot of competition in the space.</p><p>BRIGGS: How did it work out for you?</p><p>ROMANS: I didn't try blue apron. I used a competitor. I liked. I liked it. It forces you to try new things.</p><p>BRIGGS: I love the idea of it being included and not shopping for 19 ingredients.</p><p>All right. EARLY START continues right now.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BRIGGS: The president's travel ban takes effect tonight, and no legal challenge can stand in the way. New guidelines released overnight lay out specifics on who can and cannot enter the U.S.</p><p>ROMANS: A top Vatican official will face charges of sexual assault. But this morning, he's defending himself before heading home to face a judge.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Health care is working very well. We could have a big surprise with a great health care package.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Teasing the next episode. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>sending a message of sorts on health care. Will it be enough to get Republican senators all on the same page?</p><p>A very heavy lift remains on that health care bill.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: Good morning, everybody. Welcome to EARLY START. I'm Dave Briggs. ROMANS: Nice to see you all this morning, bright and early. I'm Christine Romans. It is 5:00 a.m. in the East, this Thursday, June 29th.</p><p>Breaking overnight: new rules for implementing the Trump administration's revised travel ban. Those new rules take effect tonight at 8:00 p.m. That's the word from a senior administration official. We're also getting specifics this morning on who will be allowed into the U.S. from these six Muslim-majority nations and who will be kept out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2017062902CNV34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NX4-CM81-DXH2-61KC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 29, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Travel</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cardinal George Pell</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Vatican</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Justice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Obamacare</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Insurance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Legislation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Venezuela</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Latin America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

His predecessor and mentor Dara Khosrowshahi, now Uber's chief executive, had transformed Expedia into an online travel powerhouse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under his leadership, the company doubled its annual revenue from 2012 to nearly $8.8bn in 2016.</p><p>The pair are still firm friends, and Khosrowshahi remains on the Expedia board.</p><p>\"I'm so happy Dara has left,\" the Canadian-born executive smiles. \"Now I get to have this job.\"</p><p>It's no small responsibility. Seattle-based Expedia, which was spun out of Microsoft in 1999, now has 375m visitors every month and is worth $18bn.</p><p>Customers spent $24.7bn (\u00a319.6bn) on bookings in the most recent quarter.</p><p>As well as Expedia itself the company owns a host of consumer names like Trivago and <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Hotels.com\">www.Hotels.com</url>.</p><p>But Okerstrom didn't always want to be a high-flying travel executive.</p><p>The 45-year-old has had a chequered career, which he describes humbly as a \"complete failure\".</p><p>He initially dreamt of becoming a policeman, but found himself in London working for an investment bank, followed by a law firm.</p><p>He came to Expedia in 2006 and in 2011 was appointed chief financial officer, serving as Khosrowshahi's right-hand man.</p><p>It is refreshing to hear where he gets his management style from.</p><p>\"When I first took the role, I started listening to podcasts with stupid names like 'how to be a good CEO and four things that great CEOs do.'\" The web tutorials seem to have paid off.</p><p>But Mr Okerstrom is acutely aware that he is at the helm of an internet company during one of the most tumultuous periods in the industry's history, save the dotcom boom.</p><p>\"We have 2bn changes to inventory in our lodging system every day. You cannot hire enough people to police that kind of activity,\" he says.</p><p>\"The only thing you can do is watch what is happening, and use artificial intelligence.\"</p><p>Shortly after stepping up to the role from chief financial officer under Khosrowshahi, Okerstrom rebranded, including a logo change and ramping up marketing spend. He has also turned the company into one he claims is now \"customer-centric\".</p><p>As part of that goal, Expedia is trying to crack down on \"dynamic pricing\".</p><p>During natural disasters, such as when prices skyrocketed during Florida's floods in October, it has tasked staff with manually policing when such events might cause temporary accommodation prices to skyrocket.</p><p>\"We have to come up with feedback mechanism so we can know what those partners say is true and probably not something we can do with humans alone,\" he says.</p><p>It's a challenge to police a site that might have 95,000 rooms or properties available one day and five million the next. But as well as cracking down on exploitative hotels, Expedia is trying to correct a peculiarly modern holiday phenomenon: the holiday filter bubble.</p><p>When travel aggregators exploded on to the scene they were praised for cutting out the middleman travel agent and handing the masses an accessible and cheaper alternative to book flights and accommodation.</p><p>But websites that act as a portal to millions of people's holidays have also been accused of creating a feedback loop, leading to a surge in tourism to areas that are now struggling to sustain the footfall. \"Over-tourism in Venice, Barcelona and Machu Picchu is an issue,\" Okerstrom says.</p><p>He believes the technology Expedia owns can manipulate tourism in the future. It is already working with government-backed Visit Britain to do just that. \"We have such a massive audience, we can drive travel patterns,\" he says.</p><p>\"I think we can absolutely influence [travel]. We don't want Venice or Angkor Wat to be closed down, we want them to be around forever for sustainable travelling and we can steer traffic, direct people to other places that are totally amazing,\" he says, wide-eyed.</p><p>Expedia has invested heavily in technology and Okerstrom says it will continue to pour money into advanced technologies it is already working on like voice bookings, eyeball tracking and facial recognition sensors that can detect whether people feel happy or sad when they see an advert.</p><p>It currently offers hotels and rental companies analytics tools that show how and what people are booking and can even suggest that a hotel releases a room with almost 100pc accuracy that it will be sold that day.</p><p>But it might want to dedicate time to cooling down its pushy customer-facing technology like the \"one room left\" prompt, as British regulators circle.</p><p>In June the Competition and Markets Authority said it would be taking companies to court if they did not end misleading practices like pressure selling.</p><p>It's something that doesn't seem to worry Mr Okerstrom, whose varied CV has afforded him the perspective some self-assured billionaire founders lack. He has never been a founder and his vast experience across industries, including that stint in London in wealth management and law, has taught him growth is important but not at all costs.</p><p>\"I believe that big tech needs big leaders,\" he says. \"But big leaders can also be on the board or they can be on the senior executive team.</p><p>\"I heard one of my colleagues say 'when you move up, shut up' and that means you need to listen and synthesise information, or bring in experts. \"That's just good governance. I don't think it comes down to one individual.\"</p><p>Expedia in numbers $18bn How much the company is worth 375m The number of visitors Expedia has every month \u00a319.6bn The total that customers spent on bookings in the most recent quarter</p><p>'I think we can absolutely influence travel. We don't want Venice or Angkor Wat to be closed down; we want them to be around forever. We can direct people to other places that are totally amazing'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mark Okerstrom, Expedia CEO, said places like Barcelona, right, can be protected from over-tourism by steering people to other places they might not have consideredDara Khosrowshahi, left, now Uber's chief executive, was Mark Okerstrom's mentor at ExpediaREUTERS, GETTY</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-144575286</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYK-7F51-JCBW-N005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"950\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 14, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002E8D</classCode><className>EXPEDIA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00025G3</classCode><className>HOTELS.COM LP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS561510 TRAVEL AGENCIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC4724 TRAVEL AGENCIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7389 BUSINESS SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>EXPE (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X8V</classCode><className>MENTORS &amp;

Companies with promising technologies tend to be sold before they get too big, creating a void in the middle.</p><p>But that won't stop the pinstriped buyers from cruising Elliott with trunks full of cash.</p><p>The unusual cluster of tempting opportunities begins with F5, the crown jewel with a market valuation of $4.4 billion as of Friday.</p><p>F5 dominates the market for application delivery systems, creating what it calls \"strategic points of control\" in corporate networks. It's expecting sales of about $200 million this quarter.</p><p>Rumors about F5 being sold have come and gone for years. Some analysts said the big opportunity passed in November when likely buyer Hewlett-Packard bought 3Com instead.</p><p>One of those analysts is Jeff Evenson, a Bremerton native at Bernstein Research in New York.</p><p>He said F5 would be a strategic fit with a number of companies but thinks it could be a challenge to get a deal done.</p><p>\"The most obvious buyers have an issue that I think is almost insurmountable for them,\" he said.</p><p>Cisco would be a natural, he said, but might have trouble getting antitrust approval for a deal if regulators focused on the niche F5 serves.</p><p>Combo in control</p><p>Within that segment of the network-switching market, an F5-Cisco combination would control 80 percent of the market.</p><p>But if regulators looked at the broader sector, it may not be an issue.</p><p>HP, Dell and even Oracle could be interested, but the stock's recent climb into the $55 range could cool their enthusiasm.</p><p>As expected, F5 won't say much about the topic.</p><p>\"F5 is a strategic point of control within people's data centers so I can understand why our name may surface in those discussions,\" said Dan Matte, senior vice president of marketing and business development.</p><p>\"I can say that the management team at F5 is pleased with the achievements the company has made, and we intend to continue to be a vibrant part of the Seattle technology scene.\"</p><p>Casual-games giant</p><p>In the building right next to F5 is Big Fish Games, a quiet giant in the casual-games business that's been hugely profitable for most of its eight years in business.</p><p>Big Fish has about 400 employees creating and publishing games and running a Web portal that handles 1 million downloads a day.</p><p>Founder Paul Thelen has said he'd like to take the company public someday, but anything could happen.</p><p>Especially after Electronic Arts last fall paid $400 million to buy another piscine casual-game giant, London-based Playfish.</p><p>Jeremy Lewis, a Goldman Sachs veteran who became Big Fish's chief executive in 2007, declined to comment specifically, but said he's expecting more deals in the industry.</p><p>\"As a practice, we do not comment on rumors,\" he said via e-mail. \"In general, we expect M&amp;A activity within digital media and entertainment to continue.\"</p><p>A bit further south is the headquarters of Isilon Systems, the maker of storage systems used by movie studios, media companies, government agencies and others to add huge storage volumes to their networks.</p><p>Storage is a hot sector, Isilon has promising technology and it turned its first profit last quarter after working through a painful restructuring and Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.</p><p>The company, valued by the market at just under $500 million, seems like an easy target, but Chief Executive Sujal Patel told me last month Isilon is \"very, very focused on growing our business into an independent, large storage company.\"</p><p>Isilon has been giving investors a similar message.</p><p>\"These guys really believe there's a substantial long-term opportunity everything they're trying to do is not focused on the near term,\" said Sid Parakh, an analyst at Seattle's McAdams Wright Ragen who watches both Isilon and F5.</p><p>\"Isilon sees a big opportunity in front of them, so unless it's a substantial premium to where the stock is, I don't think that's a company that will be sold.\"</p><p>But you never know.</p><p>Buyers who really want to shop should keep heading south on Elliott.</p><p>A few blocks further they'll come to RealNetworks, which is practically holding a garage sale, putting its music subscription and games businesses into play.</p><p>Brier Dudley's column appears Mondays.

Elizabeth Warren putting forward a plan to break up big tech.</p><p>As momentum for antitrust action builds, it is important that policymakers keep a few core principles in mind.</p><p>Don\u2019t mess with success. For the last 50 years, the consumer welfare standard has been the bedrock of American antitrust law. This standard requires the government to demonstrate that a merger or other action is likely to raise prices or reduce innovation before blocking it. Although this policy protects both consumers and workers, it does not protect competing companies unless the activity is clearly anti-competitive. Nor does it attack bigness per se, recognizing that in many cases, larger firms are more efficient, leading to lower prices or more innovation. Almost all scholars believe the consumer welfare standard has brought clarity to a field that was once plagued by subjectivity and poor results.</p><p>Breaking up is hard to do. Senator Warren recently called on regulators to break up the largest internet companies. She did not, however, specify how this should be done. Break-up cases are by far the most difficult type of antitrust action. There have been relatively few attempts, and none has produced ideal results. This is partly because regulators lack a good understanding of how specific companies operate. But it is also because various activities within these firms are closely intertwined. Separating various activities, skills and personnel into two or more viable companies is much harder than it sounds. Nor does the job end there. Regulators must remain engaged in how the various entities deal with each other and prevent one or more from capturing too much of the new market.</p><p>Don\u2019t kill the goose. The classic danger from a monopoly is the tendency to lower supply, reduce innovation, and raise prices. Yet internet companies offer many of their most valuable services for free. Rather than cut supply, they continually seek to attract users with more services. The free use of these services has delivered tremendous consumer benefits. Perhaps most importantly, these companies have become major sources of innovation. For example, Amazon and Google spend more on research than any other company in the world; Microsoft and Apple are sixth and seventh respectively; and Facebook is 14th. When competition is based on innovation, not prices, it is a major driver of technological progress.</p><p>Not everything is a nail. When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. The internet giants raise a number of important public policy questions besides antitrust. These include data privacy, censorship, and political influence. All of these issues involve trade-offs, requiring a careful balancing of costs and benefits. Antitrust policy is simply not equipped to deal with such diverse issues. Properly understood, it does one thing: curbs threats to competitive markets. Other issues demand their own policies, which should operate separate from antitrust.</p><p>The internet is not the first technology to require new policies. But history shows us three things. First, information technology has been a constant source of innovation and disruption. Second, antitrust has a long history of responding effectively to specific threats. Finally, well-developed policies can encourage faster innovation while mitigating recognized problems. Lawmakers and regulators would do well to study these facets of the issues carefully.</p><p>Joe Kennedy is a senior fellow for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a think tank for science and technology policy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The United States is poised to increase scrutiny on the nation\u2019s largest internet firms.

The big tech companies are deeply unpopular, usually with good reason. But the government has recycled demonstrable lies peddled by News Corp about how it is being robbed by Google and Facebook, with the aim of helping prop up News Corp's failing Australian media businesses.  News Corp charges that when Google (mostly) and Facebook use its headlines and automatically generated \"snippets\" of News Corp stories on their sites, they are stealing content, and should be made to pay for it via a licence fee that will \"reflect the financial benefit digital platforms derive from using snippets\".   It also complains that longer \"snippets\" deter people from clicking through the attached link to the original story because they get all they need from what's displayed.  Except the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Digital%20platforms%20inquiry%20-%20final%20report.pdf\">digital platforms inquiry</url> found that News Corp's claims don't stack up.  Headlines and snippets aren't theft of content: \"generally, digital platforms' use of article headlines is unlikely to infringe copyright protections in Australia,\" the ACCC noted. \"Digital platforms reproducing a snippet of a copyright-protected news article does not infringe copyright protections if the snippet does not reproduce a substantial part of the article.\"  And the ACCC found that the tech companies, media organisations and consumers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">all</emphasis> benefit from the use of snippets. Specifically, \"media businesses benefit because a snippet provides context and an indication to the user of the value of that content, increasing the likelihood of consumers clicking through\".  Real-world evidence backed this up. \"As a result of a German copyright law requiring Google to pay fees to publish snippets from news media websites, Google stopped showing snippets from [media company Axel Springer's] news articles. Axel Springer noted that the lack of snippets led to a nearly 40% decline in referral traffic from Google Search and an almost 80% decline in referral traffic from the Google News user interface\".  The ACCC also \"does not agree that longer snippet lengths necessarily have a negative effect on referral traffic, with users remaining on an aggregator or search platform rather than clicking through to a news media business's website\". As a result, it did not recommend that a mandatory licence fee be imposed.  Where it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">did</emphasis> agree with media companies is that they have little bargaining power with Google et al when it comes to the length and composition of snippets. They can block Google from automatically generating snippets, but beyond being able to \"opt out\", they have no way of managing them, or maximising click-through.   The ACCC thus proposed the industry-led development of a code of conduct to be agreed between media and tech companies to address this \"imbalance of power\" and enable media companies to get access to data and negotiate more effectively with the likes of Google.  Such a code of conduct might also cover how revenue is shared \"where the digital platform obtains value, directly or indirectly, from content produced by news media\".  How much value do digital platforms obtain from news content? Google doesn't show any ads on its news feed, and \"does not generally sell advertising opportunities next to search queries that are considered by Google as having a 'news intent'\". In other countries where it has been ordered to pay fees, it has simply stopped carrying snippets if it can't do so for free. In Spain, it shut down Google News.  Interestingly, the result in Spain -- and one echoed elsewhere -- was that smaller media sites lost a large volume of traffic while major media sites suffered relatively little loss. It would be to News Corp's considerable advantage if that same result eventuated in Australia, with smaller competitors in an already marginal economic environment suffering a major loss in traffic.  None of these facts stopped       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/transcripts/doorstop-interview-parliament-house-canberra-22\">Frydenberg and Fletcher</url>, who have demanded the ACCC impose a mandatory code of conduct on the tech companies, backed by legislation, that would \"get payment for original journalistic content\".   The word \"content\" was used repeatedly. Fletcher referred to \"businesses acquiring content from another without the opportunity for a fair discussion about what they pay for it\".   \"The ACCC\", Frydenberg said, \"is going to be looking at the method by which the payment for content would occur.\"  The tech companies of course are not using any \"content\" beyond the headline and metadata-generated snippets that are not considered content under copyright law. And in defiance of the evidence from the ACCC, Frydenberg reiterated News Corp's claims that it \"is very lucrative for the tech titans to use the original content on their website\", when they do no such thing.  No one, and certainly no one in the mainstream media, called out the bizarre situation of the Treasurer publicly reiterating claims by a foreign multinational that one of the country's key economic regulators -- one in his own portfolio, no less -- has publicly and at length discredited.  Nor did anyone note that one possibility as a result of Frydenberg's action is that News Corp's smaller, locally owned competitors suffer a massive hit on top of what the government has created with its lockdown restrictions.  Liberal politicians eager to hand wins to the foreign-owned News Corp are nothing new. Perhaps Frydenberg thinks that in aligning himself with News Corp, its editors and executives will promote him as a putative successor to Scott Morrison.  In which case, Frydenberg might do well to heed the fate of Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull as prime minister amended the media ownership laws to help News Corp, and slashed funding to its enemy the ABC. And all he got from the Murdochs was an extended effort to overthrow him. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSH-4ST1-F0NT-H4GT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><timeReceived>12:17:09 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The big tech companies are deeply unpopular, usually with good reason. But the government has recycled demonstrable lies peddled by News Corp about how it is being robbed by Google and Facebook, with the aim of helping prop up News Corp's failing Australian media businesses.  News Corp charges that when Google (mostly) and Facebook use its headlines and automatically generated \"snippets\" of News Corp stories on their sites, they are stealing content, and should be made to pay for it via a licence fee that will \"reflect the financial benefit digital platforms derive from using snippets\".   It also complains that longer \"snippets\" deter people from clicking through the attached link to the original story because they get all they need from what's displayed.  Except the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Digital%20platforms%20inquiry%20-%20final%20report.pdf\">digital platforms inquiry</url> found that News Corp's claims don't stack up.  Headlines and snippets aren't theft of content: \"generally, digital platforms' use of article headlines is unlikely to infringe copyright protections in Australia,\" the ACCC noted. \"Digital platforms reproducing a snippet of a copyright-protected news article does not infringe copyright protections if the snippet does not reproduce a substantial part of the article.\"  And the ACCC found that the tech companies, media organisations and consumers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">all</emphasis> benefit from the use of snippets. Specifically, \"media businesses benefit because a snippet provides context and an indication to the user of the value of that content, increasing the likelihood of consumers clicking through\".  Real-world evidence backed this up. \"As a result of a German copyright law requiring Google to pay fees to publish snippets from news media websites, Google stopped showing snippets from [media company Axel Springer's] news articles. Axel Springer noted that the lack of snippets led to a nearly 40% decline in referral traffic from Google Search and an almost 80% decline in referral traffic from the Google News user interface\".  The ACCC also \"does not agree that longer snippet lengths necessarily have a negative effect on referral traffic, with users remaining on an aggregator or search platform rather than clicking through to a news media business's website\". As a result, it did not recommend that a mandatory licence fee be imposed.  Where it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">did</emphasis> agree with media companies is that they have little bargaining power with Google et al when it comes to the length and composition of snippets. They can block Google from automatically generating snippets, but beyond being able to \"opt out\", they have no way of managing them, or maximising click-through.   The ACCC thus proposed the industry-led development of a code of conduct to be agreed between media and tech companies to address this \"imbalance of power\" and enable media companies to get access to data and negotiate more effectively with the likes of Google.  Such a code of conduct might also cover how revenue is shared \"where the digital platform obtains value, directly or indirectly, from content produced by news media\".  How much value do digital platforms obtain from news content? Google doesn't show any ads on its news feed, and \"does not generally sell advertising opportunities next to search queries that are considered by Google as having a 'news intent'\". In other countries where it has been ordered to pay fees, it has simply stopped carrying snippets if it can't do so for free. In Spain, it shut down Google News.  Interestingly, the result in Spain -- and one echoed elsewhere -- was that smaller media sites lost a large volume of traffic while major media sites suffered relatively little loss. It would be to News Corp's considerable advantage if that same result eventuated in Australia, with smaller competitors in an already marginal economic environment suffering a major loss in traffic.  None of these facts stopped       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/transcripts/doorstop-interview-parliament-house-canberra-22\">Frydenberg and Fletcher</url>, who have demanded the ACCC impose a mandatory code of conduct on the tech companies, backed by legislation, that would \"get payment for original journalistic content\".   The word \"content\" was used repeatedly. Fletcher referred to \"businesses acquiring content from another without the opportunity for a fair discussion about what they pay for it\".   \"The ACCC\", Frydenberg said, \"is going to be looking at the method by which the payment for content would occur.\"  The tech companies of course are not using any \"content\" beyond the headline and metadata-generated snippets that are not considered content under copyright law. And in defiance of the evidence from the ACCC, Frydenberg reiterated News Corp's claims that it \"is very lucrative for the tech titans to use the original content on their website\", when they do no such thing.  No one, and certainly no one in the mainstream media, called out the bizarre situation of the Treasurer publicly reiterating claims by a foreign multinational that one of the country's key economic regulators -- one in his own portfolio, no less -- has publicly and at length discredited.  Nor did anyone note that one possibility as a result of Frydenberg's action is that News Corp's smaller, locally owned competitors suffer a massive hit on top of what the government has created with its lockdown restrictions.  Liberal politicians eager to hand wins to the foreign-owned News Corp are nothing new. Perhaps Frydenberg thinks that in aligning himself with News Corp, its editors and executives will promote him as a putative successor to Scott Morrison.  In which case, Frydenberg might do well to heed the fate of Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull as prime minister amended the media ownership laws to help News Corp, and slashed funding to its enemy the ABC. And all he got from the Murdochs was an extended effort to overthrow him. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YS9-GSX1-JD6R-T36R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><timeReceived>12:17:09 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The big tech companies are deeply unpopular, usually with good reason. But the government has recycled demonstrable lies peddled by News Corp about how it is being robbed by Google and Facebook, with the aim of helping prop up News Corp's failing Australian media businesses.  News Corp charges that when Google (mostly) and Facebook use its headlines and automatically generated \"snippets\" of News Corp stories on their sites, they are stealing content, and should be made to pay for it via a licence fee that will \"reflect the financial benefit digital platforms derive from using snippets\".   It also complains that longer \"snippets\" deter people from clicking through the attached link to the original story because they get all they need from what's displayed.  Except the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Digital%20platforms%20inquiry%20-%20final%20report.pdf\">digital platforms inquiry</url> found that News Corp's claims don't stack up.  Headlines and snippets aren't theft of content: \"generally, digital platforms' use of article headlines is unlikely to infringe copyright protections in Australia,\" the ACCC noted. \"Digital platforms reproducing a snippet of a copyright-protected news article does not infringe copyright protections if the snippet does not reproduce a substantial part of the article.\"  And the ACCC found that the tech companies, media organisations and consumers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">all</emphasis> benefit from the use of snippets. Specifically, \"media businesses benefit because a snippet provides context and an indication to the user of the value of that content, increasing the likelihood of consumers clicking through\".  Real-world evidence backed this up. \"As a result of a German copyright law requiring Google to pay fees to publish snippets from news media websites, Google stopped showing snippets from [media company Axel Springer's] news articles. Axel Springer noted that the lack of snippets led to a nearly 40% decline in referral traffic from Google Search and an almost 80% decline in referral traffic from the Google News user interface\".  The ACCC also \"does not agree that longer snippet lengths necessarily have a negative effect on referral traffic, with users remaining on an aggregator or search platform rather than clicking through to a news media business's website\". As a result, it did not recommend that a mandatory licence fee be imposed.  Where it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">did</emphasis> agree with media companies is that they have little bargaining power with Google et al when it comes to the length and composition of snippets. They can block Google from automatically generating snippets, but beyond being able to \"opt out\", they have no way of managing them, or maximising click-through.   The ACCC thus proposed the industry-led development of a code of conduct to be agreed between media and tech companies to address this \"imbalance of power\" and enable media companies to get access to data and negotiate more effectively with the likes of Google.  Such a code of conduct might also cover how revenue is shared \"where the digital platform obtains value, directly or indirectly, from content produced by news media\".  How much value do digital platforms obtain from news content? Google doesn't show any ads on its news feed, and \"does not generally sell advertising opportunities next to search queries that are considered by Google as having a 'news intent'\". In other countries where it has been ordered to pay fees, it has simply stopped carrying snippets if it can't do so for free. In Spain, it shut down Google News.  Interestingly, the result in Spain -- and one echoed elsewhere -- was that smaller media sites lost a large volume of traffic while major media sites suffered relatively little loss. It would be to News Corp's considerable advantage if that same result eventuated in Australia, with smaller competitors in an already marginal economic environment suffering a major loss in traffic.  None of these facts stopped       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/transcripts/doorstop-interview-parliament-house-canberra-22\">Frydenberg and Fletcher</url>, who have demanded the ACCC impose a mandatory code of conduct on the tech companies, backed by legislation, that would \"get payment for original journalistic content\".   The word \"content\" was used repeatedly. Fletcher referred to \"businesses acquiring content from another without the opportunity for a fair discussion about what they pay for it\".   \"The ACCC\", Frydenberg said, \"is going to be looking at the method by which the payment for content would occur.\"  The tech companies of course are not using any \"content\" beyond the headline and metadata-generated snippets that are not considered content under copyright law. And in defiance of the evidence from the ACCC, Frydenberg reiterated News Corp's claims that it \"is very lucrative for the tech titans to use the original content on their website\", when they do no such thing.  No one, and certainly no one in the mainstream media, called out the bizarre situation of the Treasurer publicly reiterating claims by a foreign multinational that one of the country's key economic regulators -- one in his own portfolio, no less -- has publicly and at length discredited.  Nor did anyone note that one possibility as a result of Frydenberg's action is that News Corp's smaller, locally owned competitors suffer a massive hit on top of what the government has created with its lockdown restrictions.  Liberal politicians eager to hand wins to the foreign-owned News Corp are nothing new. Perhaps Frydenberg thinks that in aligning himself with News Corp, its editors and executives will promote him as a putative successor to Scott Morrison.  In which case, Frydenberg might do well to heed the fate of Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull as prime minister amended the media ownership laws to help News Corp, and slashed funding to its enemy the ABC. And all he got from the Murdochs was an extended effort to overthrow him. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRN-KD81-F0NT-H35X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><timeReceived>12:17:09 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The big tech companies are deeply unpopular, usually with good reason. But the government has recycled demonstrable lies peddled by News Corp about how it is being robbed by Google and Facebook, with the aim of helping prop up News Corp's failing Australian media businesses.  News Corp charges that when Google (mostly) and Facebook use its headlines and automatically generated \"snippets\" of News Corp stories on their sites, they are stealing content, and should be made to pay for it via a licence fee that will \"reflect the financial benefit digital platforms derive from using snippets\".   It also complains that longer \"snippets\" deter people from clicking through the attached link to the original story because they get all they need from what's displayed.  Except the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Digital%20platforms%20inquiry%20-%20final%20report.pdf\">digital platforms inquiry</url> found that News Corp's claims don't stack up.  Headlines and snippets aren't theft of content: \"generally, digital platforms' use of article headlines is unlikely to infringe copyright protections in Australia,\" the ACCC noted. \"Digital platforms reproducing a snippet of a copyright-protected news article does not infringe copyright protections if the snippet does not reproduce a substantial part of the article.\"  And the ACCC found that the tech companies, media organisations and consumers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">all</emphasis> benefit from the use of snippets. Specifically, \"media businesses benefit because a snippet provides context and an indication to the user of the value of that content, increasing the likelihood of consumers clicking through\".  Real-world evidence backed this up. \"As a result of a German copyright law requiring Google to pay fees to publish snippets from news media websites, Google stopped showing snippets from [media company Axel Springer's] news articles. Axel Springer noted that the lack of snippets led to a nearly 40% decline in referral traffic from Google Search and an almost 80% decline in referral traffic from the Google News user interface\".  The ACCC also \"does not agree that longer snippet lengths necessarily have a negative effect on referral traffic, with users remaining on an aggregator or search platform rather than clicking through to a news media business's website\". As a result, it did not recommend that a mandatory licence fee be imposed.  Where it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">did</emphasis> agree with media companies is that they have little bargaining power with Google et al when it comes to the length and composition of snippets. They can block Google from automatically generating snippets, but beyond being able to \"opt out\", they have no way of managing them, or maximising click-through.   The ACCC thus proposed the industry-led development of a code of conduct to be agreed between media and tech companies to address this \"imbalance of power\" and enable media companies to get access to data and negotiate more effectively with the likes of Google.  Such a code of conduct might also cover how revenue is shared \"where the digital platform obtains value, directly or indirectly, from content produced by news media\".  How much value do digital platforms obtain from news content? Google doesn't show any ads on its news feed, and \"does not generally sell advertising opportunities next to search queries that are considered by Google as having a 'news intent'\". In other countries where it has been ordered to pay fees, it has simply stopped carrying snippets if it can't do so for free. In Spain, it shut down Google News.  Interestingly, the result in Spain -- and one echoed elsewhere -- was that smaller media sites lost a large volume of traffic while major media sites suffered relatively little loss. It would be to News Corp's considerable advantage if that same result eventuated in Australia, with smaller competitors in an already marginal economic environment suffering a major loss in traffic.  None of these facts stopped       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/transcripts/doorstop-interview-parliament-house-canberra-22\">Frydenberg and Fletcher</url>, who have demanded the ACCC impose a mandatory code of conduct on the tech companies, backed by legislation, that would \"get payment for original journalistic content\".   The word \"content\" was used repeatedly. Fletcher referred to \"businesses acquiring content from another without the opportunity for a fair discussion about what they pay for it\".   \"The ACCC\", Frydenberg said, \"is going to be looking at the method by which the payment for content would occur.\"  The tech companies of course are not using any \"content\" beyond the headline and metadata-generated snippets that are not considered content under copyright law. And in defiance of the evidence from the ACCC, Frydenberg reiterated News Corp's claims that it \"is very lucrative for the tech titans to use the original content on their website\", when they do no such thing.  No one, and certainly no one in the mainstream media, called out the bizarre situation of the Treasurer publicly reiterating claims by a foreign multinational that one of the country's key economic regulators -- one in his own portfolio, no less -- has publicly and at length discredited.  Nor did anyone note that one possibility as a result of Frydenberg's action is that News Corp's smaller, locally owned competitors suffer a massive hit on top of what the government has created with its lockdown restrictions.  Liberal politicians eager to hand wins to the foreign-owned News Corp are nothing new. Perhaps Frydenberg thinks that in aligning himself with News Corp, its editors and executives will promote him as a putative successor to Scott Morrison.  In which case, Frydenberg might do well to heed the fate of Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull as prime minister amended the media ownership laws to help News Corp, and slashed funding to its enemy the ABC. And all he got from the Murdochs was an extended effort to overthrow him. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSR-F5T1-F0NT-H0JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><timeReceived>12:17:09 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The big tech companies are deeply unpopular, usually with good reason. But the government has recycled demonstrable lies peddled by News Corp about how it is being robbed by Google and Facebook, with the aim of helping prop up News Corp's failing Australian media businesses.  News Corp charges that when Google (mostly) and Facebook use its headlines and automatically generated \"snippets\" of News Corp stories on their sites, they are stealing content, and should be made to pay for it via a licence fee that will \"reflect the financial benefit digital platforms derive from using snippets\".   It also complains that longer \"snippets\" deter people from clicking through the attached link to the original story because they get all they need from what's displayed.  Except the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Digital%20platforms%20inquiry%20-%20final%20report.pdf\">digital platforms inquiry</url> found that News Corp's claims don't stack up.  Headlines and snippets aren't theft of content: \"generally, digital platforms' use of article headlines is unlikely to infringe copyright protections in Australia,\" the ACCC noted. \"Digital platforms reproducing a snippet of a copyright-protected news article does not infringe copyright protections if the snippet does not reproduce a substantial part of the article.\"  And the ACCC found that the tech companies, media organisations and consumers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">all</emphasis> benefit from the use of snippets. Specifically, \"media businesses benefit because a snippet provides context and an indication to the user of the value of that content, increasing the likelihood of consumers clicking through\".  Real-world evidence backed this up. \"As a result of a German copyright law requiring Google to pay fees to publish snippets from news media websites, Google stopped showing snippets from [media company Axel Springer's] news articles. Axel Springer noted that the lack of snippets led to a nearly 40% decline in referral traffic from Google Search and an almost 80% decline in referral traffic from the Google News user interface\".  The ACCC also \"does not agree that longer snippet lengths necessarily have a negative effect on referral traffic, with users remaining on an aggregator or search platform rather than clicking through to a news media business's website\". As a result, it did not recommend that a mandatory licence fee be imposed.  Where it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">did</emphasis> agree with media companies is that they have little bargaining power with Google et al when it comes to the length and composition of snippets. They can block Google from automatically generating snippets, but beyond being able to \"opt out\", they have no way of managing them, or maximising click-through.   The ACCC thus proposed the industry-led development of a code of conduct to be agreed between media and tech companies to address this \"imbalance of power\" and enable media companies to get access to data and negotiate more effectively with the likes of Google.  Such a code of conduct might also cover how revenue is shared \"where the digital platform obtains value, directly or indirectly, from content produced by news media\".  How much value do digital platforms obtain from news content? Google doesn't show any ads on its news feed, and \"does not generally sell advertising opportunities next to search queries that are considered by Google as having a 'news intent'\". In other countries where it has been ordered to pay fees, it has simply stopped carrying snippets if it can't do so for free. In Spain, it shut down Google News.  Interestingly, the result in Spain -- and one echoed elsewhere -- was that smaller media sites lost a large volume of traffic while major media sites suffered relatively little loss. It would be to News Corp's considerable advantage if that same result eventuated in Australia, with smaller competitors in an already marginal economic environment suffering a major loss in traffic.  None of these facts stopped       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/transcripts/doorstop-interview-parliament-house-canberra-22\">Frydenberg and Fletcher</url>, who have demanded the ACCC impose a mandatory code of conduct on the tech companies, backed by legislation, that would \"get payment for original journalistic content\".   The word \"content\" was used repeatedly. Fletcher referred to \"businesses acquiring content from another without the opportunity for a fair discussion about what they pay for it\".   \"The ACCC\", Frydenberg said, \"is going to be looking at the method by which the payment for content would occur.\"  The tech companies of course are not using any \"content\" beyond the headline and metadata-generated snippets that are not considered content under copyright law. And in defiance of the evidence from the ACCC, Frydenberg reiterated News Corp's claims that it \"is very lucrative for the tech titans to use the original content on their website\", when they do no such thing.  No one, and certainly no one in the mainstream media, called out the bizarre situation of the Treasurer publicly reiterating claims by a foreign multinational that one of the country's key economic regulators -- one in his own portfolio, no less -- has publicly and at length discredited.  Nor did anyone note that one possibility as a result of Frydenberg's action is that News Corp's smaller, locally owned competitors suffer a massive hit on top of what the government has created with its lockdown restrictions.  Liberal politicians eager to hand wins to the foreign-owned News Corp are nothing new. Perhaps Frydenberg thinks that in aligning himself with News Corp, its editors and executives will promote him as a putative successor to Scott Morrison.  In which case, Frydenberg might do well to heed the fate of Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull as prime minister amended the media ownership laws to help News Corp, and slashed funding to its enemy the ABC. And all he got from the Murdochs was an extended effort to overthrow him. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSY-D931-F0NT-H17C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><timeReceived>12:17:09 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The big tech companies are deeply unpopular, usually with good reason. But the government has recycled demonstrable lies peddled by News Corp about how it is being robbed by Google and Facebook, with the aim of helping prop up News Corp's failing Australian media businesses.  News Corp charges that when Google (mostly) and Facebook use its headlines and automatically generated \"snippets\" of News Corp stories on their sites, they are stealing content, and should be made to pay for it via a licence fee that will \"reflect the financial benefit digital platforms derive from using snippets\".   It also complains that longer \"snippets\" deter people from clicking through the attached link to the original story because they get all they need from what's displayed.  Except the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Digital%20platforms%20inquiry%20-%20final%20report.pdf\">digital platforms inquiry</url> found that News Corp's claims don't stack up.  Headlines and snippets aren't theft of content: \"generally, digital platforms' use of article headlines is unlikely to infringe copyright protections in Australia,\" the ACCC noted. \"Digital platforms reproducing a snippet of a copyright-protected news article does not infringe copyright protections if the snippet does not reproduce a substantial part of the article.\"  And the ACCC found that the tech companies, media organisations and consumers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">all</emphasis> benefit from the use of snippets. Specifically, \"media businesses benefit because a snippet provides context and an indication to the user of the value of that content, increasing the likelihood of consumers clicking through\".  Real-world evidence backed this up. \"As a result of a German copyright law requiring Google to pay fees to publish snippets from news media websites, Google stopped showing snippets from [media company Axel Springer's] news articles. Axel Springer noted that the lack of snippets led to a nearly 40% decline in referral traffic from Google Search and an almost 80% decline in referral traffic from the Google News user interface\".  The ACCC also \"does not agree that longer snippet lengths necessarily have a negative effect on referral traffic, with users remaining on an aggregator or search platform rather than clicking through to a news media business's website\". As a result, it did not recommend that a mandatory licence fee be imposed.  Where it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">did</emphasis> agree with media companies is that they have little bargaining power with Google et al when it comes to the length and composition of snippets. They can block Google from automatically generating snippets, but beyond being able to \"opt out\", they have no way of managing them, or maximising click-through.   The ACCC thus proposed the industry-led development of a code of conduct to be agreed between media and tech companies to address this \"imbalance of power\" and enable media companies to get access to data and negotiate more effectively with the likes of Google.  Such a code of conduct might also cover how revenue is shared \"where the digital platform obtains value, directly or indirectly, from content produced by news media\".  How much value do digital platforms obtain from news content? Google doesn't show any ads on its news feed, and \"does not generally sell advertising opportunities next to search queries that are considered by Google as having a 'news intent'\". In other countries where it has been ordered to pay fees, it has simply stopped carrying snippets if it can't do so for free. In Spain, it shut down Google News.  Interestingly, the result in Spain -- and one echoed elsewhere -- was that smaller media sites lost a large volume of traffic while major media sites suffered relatively little loss. It would be to News Corp's considerable advantage if that same result eventuated in Australia, with smaller competitors in an already marginal economic environment suffering a major loss in traffic.  None of these facts stopped       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/transcripts/doorstop-interview-parliament-house-canberra-22\">Frydenberg and Fletcher</url>, who have demanded the ACCC impose a mandatory code of conduct on the tech companies, backed by legislation, that would \"get payment for original journalistic content\".   The word \"content\" was used repeatedly. Fletcher referred to \"businesses acquiring content from another without the opportunity for a fair discussion about what they pay for it\".   \"The ACCC\", Frydenberg said, \"is going to be looking at the method by which the payment for content would occur.\"  The tech companies of course are not using any \"content\" beyond the headline and metadata-generated snippets that are not considered content under copyright law. And in defiance of the evidence from the ACCC, Frydenberg reiterated News Corp's claims that it \"is very lucrative for the tech titans to use the original content on their website\", when they do no such thing.  No one, and certainly no one in the mainstream media, called out the bizarre situation of the Treasurer publicly reiterating claims by a foreign multinational that one of the country's key economic regulators -- one in his own portfolio, no less -- has publicly and at length discredited.  Nor did anyone note that one possibility as a result of Frydenberg's action is that News Corp's smaller, locally owned competitors suffer a massive hit on top of what the government has created with its lockdown restrictions.  Liberal politicians eager to hand wins to the foreign-owned News Corp are nothing new. Perhaps Frydenberg thinks that in aligning himself with News Corp, its editors and executives will promote him as a putative successor to Scott Morrison.  In which case, Frydenberg might do well to heed the fate of Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull as prime minister amended the media ownership laws to help News Corp, and slashed funding to its enemy the ABC. And all he got from the Murdochs was an extended effort to overthrow him. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YS9-5KS1-F0NT-H3VD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><timeReceived>12:17:09 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The big tech companies are deeply unpopular, usually with good reason. But the government has recycled demonstrable lies peddled by News Corp about how it is being robbed by Google and Facebook, with the aim of helping prop up News Corp's failing Australian media businesses.  News Corp charges that when Google (mostly) and Facebook use its headlines and automatically generated \"snippets\" of News Corp stories on their sites, they are stealing content, and should be made to pay for it via a licence fee that will \"reflect the financial benefit digital platforms derive from using snippets\".   It also complains that longer \"snippets\" deter people from clicking through the attached link to the original story because they get all they need from what's displayed.  Except the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Digital%20platforms%20inquiry%20-%20final%20report.pdf\">digital platforms inquiry</url> found that News Corp's claims don't stack up.  Headlines and snippets aren't theft of content: \"generally, digital platforms' use of article headlines is unlikely to infringe copyright protections in Australia,\" the ACCC noted. \"Digital platforms reproducing a snippet of a copyright-protected news article does not infringe copyright protections if the snippet does not reproduce a substantial part of the article.\"  And the ACCC found that the tech companies, media organisations and consumers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">all</emphasis> benefit from the use of snippets. Specifically, \"media businesses benefit because a snippet provides context and an indication to the user of the value of that content, increasing the likelihood of consumers clicking through\".  Real-world evidence backed this up. \"As a result of a German copyright law requiring Google to pay fees to publish snippets from news media websites, Google stopped showing snippets from [media company Axel Springer's] news articles. Axel Springer noted that the lack of snippets led to a nearly 40% decline in referral traffic from Google Search and an almost 80% decline in referral traffic from the Google News user interface\".  The ACCC also \"does not agree that longer snippet lengths necessarily have a negative effect on referral traffic, with users remaining on an aggregator or search platform rather than clicking through to a news media business's website\". As a result, it did not recommend that a mandatory licence fee be imposed.  Where it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">did</emphasis> agree with media companies is that they have little bargaining power with Google et al when it comes to the length and composition of snippets. They can block Google from automatically generating snippets, but beyond being able to \"opt out\", they have no way of managing them, or maximising click-through.   The ACCC thus proposed the industry-led development of a code of conduct to be agreed between media and tech companies to address this \"imbalance of power\" and enable media companies to get access to data and negotiate more effectively with the likes of Google.  Such a code of conduct might also cover how revenue is shared \"where the digital platform obtains value, directly or indirectly, from content produced by news media\".  How much value do digital platforms obtain from news content? Google doesn't show any ads on its news feed, and \"does not generally sell advertising opportunities next to search queries that are considered by Google as having a 'news intent'\". In other countries where it has been ordered to pay fees, it has simply stopped carrying snippets if it can't do so for free. In Spain, it shut down Google News.  Interestingly, the result in Spain -- and one echoed elsewhere -- was that smaller media sites lost a large volume of traffic while major media sites suffered relatively little loss. It would be to News Corp's considerable advantage if that same result eventuated in Australia, with smaller competitors in an already marginal economic environment suffering a major loss in traffic.  None of these facts stopped       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/transcripts/doorstop-interview-parliament-house-canberra-22\">Frydenberg and Fletcher</url>, who have demanded the ACCC impose a mandatory code of conduct on the tech companies, backed by legislation, that would \"get payment for original journalistic content\".   The word \"content\" was used repeatedly. Fletcher referred to \"businesses acquiring content from another without the opportunity for a fair discussion about what they pay for it\".   \"The ACCC\", Frydenberg said, \"is going to be looking at the method by which the payment for content would occur.\"  The tech companies of course are not using any \"content\" beyond the headline and metadata-generated snippets that are not considered content under copyright law. And in defiance of the evidence from the ACCC, Frydenberg reiterated News Corp's claims that it \"is very lucrative for the tech titans to use the original content on their website\", when they do no such thing.  No one, and certainly no one in the mainstream media, called out the bizarre situation of the Treasurer publicly reiterating claims by a foreign multinational that one of the country's key economic regulators -- one in his own portfolio, no less -- has publicly and at length discredited.  Nor did anyone note that one possibility as a result of Frydenberg's action is that News Corp's smaller, locally owned competitors suffer a massive hit on top of what the government has created with its lockdown restrictions.  Liberal politicians eager to hand wins to the foreign-owned News Corp are nothing new. Perhaps Frydenberg thinks that in aligning himself with News Corp, its editors and executives will promote him as a putative successor to Scott Morrison.  In which case, Frydenberg might do well to heed the fate of Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull as prime minister amended the media ownership laws to help News Corp, and slashed funding to its enemy the ABC. And all he got from the Murdochs was an extended effort to overthrow him. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSH-FXC1-JD6R-T3W1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><timeReceived>12:17:09 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The big tech companies are deeply unpopular, usually with good reason. But the government has recycled demonstrable lies peddled by News Corp about how it is being robbed by Google and Facebook, with the aim of helping prop up News Corp's failing Australian media businesses.  News Corp charges that when Google (mostly) and Facebook use its headlines and automatically generated \"snippets\" of News Corp stories on their sites, they are stealing content, and should be made to pay for it via a licence fee that will \"reflect the financial benefit digital platforms derive from using snippets\".   It also complains that longer \"snippets\" deter people from clicking through the attached link to the original story because they get all they need from what's displayed.  Except the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Digital%20platforms%20inquiry%20-%20final%20report.pdf\">digital platforms inquiry</url> found that News Corp's claims don't stack up.  Headlines and snippets aren't theft of content: \"generally, digital platforms' use of article headlines is unlikely to infringe copyright protections in Australia,\" the ACCC noted. \"Digital platforms reproducing a snippet of a copyright-protected news article does not infringe copyright protections if the snippet does not reproduce a substantial part of the article.\"  And the ACCC found that the tech companies, media organisations and consumers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">all</emphasis> benefit from the use of snippets. Specifically, \"media businesses benefit because a snippet provides context and an indication to the user of the value of that content, increasing the likelihood of consumers clicking through\".  Real-world evidence backed this up. \"As a result of a German copyright law requiring Google to pay fees to publish snippets from news media websites, Google stopped showing snippets from [media company Axel Springer's] news articles. Axel Springer noted that the lack of snippets led to a nearly 40% decline in referral traffic from Google Search and an almost 80% decline in referral traffic from the Google News user interface\".  The ACCC also \"does not agree that longer snippet lengths necessarily have a negative effect on referral traffic, with users remaining on an aggregator or search platform rather than clicking through to a news media business's website\". As a result, it did not recommend that a mandatory licence fee be imposed.  Where it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">did</emphasis> agree with media companies is that they have little bargaining power with Google et al when it comes to the length and composition of snippets. They can block Google from automatically generating snippets, but beyond being able to \"opt out\", they have no way of managing them, or maximising click-through.   The ACCC thus proposed the industry-led development of a code of conduct to be agreed between media and tech companies to address this \"imbalance of power\" and enable media companies to get access to data and negotiate more effectively with the likes of Google.  Such a code of conduct might also cover how revenue is shared \"where the digital platform obtains value, directly or indirectly, from content produced by news media\".  How much value do digital platforms obtain from news content? Google doesn't show any ads on its news feed, and \"does not generally sell advertising opportunities next to search queries that are considered by Google as having a 'news intent'\". In other countries where it has been ordered to pay fees, it has simply stopped carrying snippets if it can't do so for free. In Spain, it shut down Google News.  Interestingly, the result in Spain -- and one echoed elsewhere -- was that smaller media sites lost a large volume of traffic while major media sites suffered relatively little loss. It would be to News Corp's considerable advantage if that same result eventuated in Australia, with smaller competitors in an already marginal economic environment suffering a major loss in traffic.  None of these facts stopped       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/transcripts/doorstop-interview-parliament-house-canberra-22\">Frydenberg and Fletcher</url>, who have demanded the ACCC impose a mandatory code of conduct on the tech companies, backed by legislation, that would \"get payment for original journalistic content\".   The word \"content\" was used repeatedly. Fletcher referred to \"businesses acquiring content from another without the opportunity for a fair discussion about what they pay for it\".   \"The ACCC\", Frydenberg said, \"is going to be looking at the method by which the payment for content would occur.\"  The tech companies of course are not using any \"content\" beyond the headline and metadata-generated snippets that are not considered content under copyright law. And in defiance of the evidence from the ACCC, Frydenberg reiterated News Corp's claims that it \"is very lucrative for the tech titans to use the original content on their website\", when they do no such thing.  No one, and certainly no one in the mainstream media, called out the bizarre situation of the Treasurer publicly reiterating claims by a foreign multinational that one of the country's key economic regulators -- one in his own portfolio, no less -- has publicly and at length discredited.  Nor did anyone note that one possibility as a result of Frydenberg's action is that News Corp's smaller, locally owned competitors suffer a massive hit on top of what the government has created with its lockdown restrictions.  Liberal politicians eager to hand wins to the foreign-owned News Corp are nothing new. Perhaps Frydenberg thinks that in aligning himself with News Corp, its editors and executives will promote him as a putative successor to Scott Morrison.  In which case, Frydenberg might do well to heed the fate of Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull as prime minister amended the media ownership laws to help News Corp, and slashed funding to its enemy the ABC. And all he got from the Murdochs was an extended effort to overthrow him. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRF-M5P1-JD6R-T2HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><timeReceived>12:17:09 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The big tech companies are deeply unpopular, usually with good reason. But the government has recycled demonstrable lies peddled by News Corp about how it is being robbed by Google and Facebook, with the aim of helping prop up News Corp's failing Australian media businesses.  News Corp charges that when Google (mostly) and Facebook use its headlines and automatically generated \"snippets\" of News Corp stories on their sites, they are stealing content, and should be made to pay for it via a licence fee that will \"reflect the financial benefit digital platforms derive from using snippets\".   It also complains that longer \"snippets\" deter people from clicking through the attached link to the original story because they get all they need from what's displayed.  Except the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Digital%20platforms%20inquiry%20-%20final%20report.pdf\">digital platforms inquiry</url> found that News Corp's claims don't stack up.  Headlines and snippets aren't theft of content: \"generally, digital platforms' use of article headlines is unlikely to infringe copyright protections in Australia,\" the ACCC noted. \"Digital platforms reproducing a snippet of a copyright-protected news article does not infringe copyright protections if the snippet does not reproduce a substantial part of the article.\"  And the ACCC found that the tech companies, media organisations and consumers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">all</emphasis> benefit from the use of snippets. Specifically, \"media businesses benefit because a snippet provides context and an indication to the user of the value of that content, increasing the likelihood of consumers clicking through\".  Real-world evidence backed this up. \"As a result of a German copyright law requiring Google to pay fees to publish snippets from news media websites, Google stopped showing snippets from [media company Axel Springer's] news articles. Axel Springer noted that the lack of snippets led to a nearly 40% decline in referral traffic from Google Search and an almost 80% decline in referral traffic from the Google News user interface\".  The ACCC also \"does not agree that longer snippet lengths necessarily have a negative effect on referral traffic, with users remaining on an aggregator or search platform rather than clicking through to a news media business's website\". As a result, it did not recommend that a mandatory licence fee be imposed.  Where it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">did</emphasis> agree with media companies is that they have little bargaining power with Google et al when it comes to the length and composition of snippets. They can block Google from automatically generating snippets, but beyond being able to \"opt out\", they have no way of managing them, or maximising click-through.   The ACCC thus proposed the industry-led development of a code of conduct to be agreed between media and tech companies to address this \"imbalance of power\" and enable media companies to get access to data and negotiate more effectively with the likes of Google.  Such a code of conduct might also cover how revenue is shared \"where the digital platform obtains value, directly or indirectly, from content produced by news media\".  How much value do digital platforms obtain from news content? Google doesn't show any ads on its news feed, and \"does not generally sell advertising opportunities next to search queries that are considered by Google as having a 'news intent'\". In other countries where it has been ordered to pay fees, it has simply stopped carrying snippets if it can't do so for free. In Spain, it shut down Google News.  Interestingly, the result in Spain -- and one echoed elsewhere -- was that smaller media sites lost a large volume of traffic while major media sites suffered relatively little loss. It would be to News Corp's considerable advantage if that same result eventuated in Australia, with smaller competitors in an already marginal economic environment suffering a major loss in traffic.  None of these facts stopped       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/transcripts/doorstop-interview-parliament-house-canberra-22\">Frydenberg and Fletcher</url>, who have demanded the ACCC impose a mandatory code of conduct on the tech companies, backed by legislation, that would \"get payment for original journalistic content\".   The word \"content\" was used repeatedly. Fletcher referred to \"businesses acquiring content from another without the opportunity for a fair discussion about what they pay for it\".   \"The ACCC\", Frydenberg said, \"is going to be looking at the method by which the payment for content would occur.\"  The tech companies of course are not using any \"content\" beyond the headline and metadata-generated snippets that are not considered content under copyright law. And in defiance of the evidence from the ACCC, Frydenberg reiterated News Corp's claims that it \"is very lucrative for the tech titans to use the original content on their website\", when they do no such thing.  No one, and certainly no one in the mainstream media, called out the bizarre situation of the Treasurer publicly reiterating claims by a foreign multinational that one of the country's key economic regulators -- one in his own portfolio, no less -- has publicly and at length discredited.  Nor did anyone note that one possibility as a result of Frydenberg's action is that News Corp's smaller, locally owned competitors suffer a massive hit on top of what the government has created with its lockdown restrictions.  Liberal politicians eager to hand wins to the foreign-owned News Corp are nothing new. Perhaps Frydenberg thinks that in aligning himself with News Corp, its editors and executives will promote him as a putative successor to Scott Morrison.  In which case, Frydenberg might do well to heed the fate of Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull as prime minister amended the media ownership laws to help News Corp, and slashed funding to its enemy the ABC. And all he got from the Murdochs was an extended effort to overthrow him. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRN-87C1-F0NT-H2J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><timeReceived>12:17:09 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

And all he got from the Murdochs was an extended effort to overthrow him. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YT5-CGN1-JD6R-T0KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><timeReceived>12:17:09 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

This is not our first choice - it is our last,\" Mr Easton said.</p><p>The move would mean users and publishers could not publish or distribute any news articles on Facebook or Instagram.</p><p>ACCC chairman Rod Sims said the threat by Facebook was poorly timed: \"Facebook's threat today to prevent any sharing of news on its services in Australia is ill-timed and misconceived.\"</p><p>The code, announced by the ACCC in July, will try to make global tech giants pay news media for content through an arbitrative model which includes other provisions such as notice of algorithm changes. Regulators in other markets such as France and Germany have been trying to introduce legislation to make the tech giants pay for content, but have not had success so far.</p><p>One industry observer said Google and Facebook appeared to be \"playing to the international gallery\" with their warnings, out of concern the Australian code might set an example for other countries.</p><p>Facebook's retaliation is similar to competitive rival Google, which launched a public attack on the code and the competition regulator two weeks ago and asked users to complain to the government about the proposal.</p><p>Historically, both platforms have been reluctant to pay for news (Facebook has made changes to its algorithm in the past that have impacted where news sits in its feed). While both have since said they are willing to remunerate publishers, there is still disagreement between publishers and the tech giants over how much the content is worth.</p><p>Facebook is particularly concerned that the model proposed by the ACCC could allow publishers to claim endless amounts of money from them. Google is more concerned about a requirement to disclose algorithm changes and with the sharing of user data.</p><p>Nine Entertainment Co (owner of this masthead) said the response was \"strange\" and failed to recognise the importance of balancing reliable news content with fake news made available on the platform.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7c50dbibi4l10us7ouo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RB-B3Y1-JD34-V15T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

They need to be held to account and their activities need to be more transparent,\" Mr Frydenberg said.</p><p>The recommendations include a new unfair practices provision for Australian Consumer Law along similar lines to those in the US, UK and the EU and the creation of a new digital markets branch within the ACCC, which will act as an ombudsman for disputes related to Google and Facebook.</p><p>This branch will tackle the controversial issue of policing the algorithms used by Google and Facebook to position news and advertising. They have been accused of using this to advantage their own commercial interests.</p><p>\"One of the purposes behind this new ACCC branch is to actually better understand the use of these algorithms to ensure that they're not being used for misleading or deceptive or anti-competitive conduct,\" Mr Frydenberg said.</p><p>\"This particular branch of the ACCC will be able to be approached by various companies who believe that the algorithms have been misused in that particular way and it is the ACCC itself which will focus on those algorithms and ensure they are used in a way that is compliant with the law.\"</p><p>The recommendations include changes to merger laws to prevent big tech companies hoovering up potential rivals; the removal of Google as the default search option on Android devices; an inquiry into the activities of advertising technology agencies and a new platform-neutral regulatory framework to ensure consistent regulatory oversight of all entities involved in content production or delivery in Australia.</p><p>That would open up the highly controversial possibility of Facebook, Google and Twitter being held legally responsible for the content published on their platforms.</p><p>Another related recommendation is the creation of a digital platforms code to counter disinformation or \"fake news\", to be governed by a regulator like ACMA. This would be able to impose \"sufficiently large sanctions\" to act as an effective deterrent against code breaches, the ACCC report said.</p><p>World-first report</p><p>The inquiry has been closely watched around the world, as it was the first to seek to tackle the negative impacts on other businesses, and broader society of the rampant growth of online platforms.</p><p>Its draft report in December had recommended a new regulatory body be set up to make sure Google and Facebook don't abuse their market power in digital advertising, as well as a regulator to have oversight of the algorithms used to position news stories and advertising content.</p><p>It also proposed a digital platforms ombudsman with the power to rule on disputes between local companies and global platforms, which are currently fought entirely on \"take it or leave it\" terms, and are very much weighted in the platforms' favour, and one to rule on disputes with local individuals and organisations.</p><p>Since the ACCC first announced its inquiry, and also released its draft findings last December, the US Federal Trade Commission has begun investigating <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/us-justice-department-launches-big-tech-antitrust-probe-20190724-p52a51\">both Facebook and Google</url> on antitrust grounds, and whacked Facebook with a $US5 billion fine for misleading its users about privacy breaches.</p><p>Submissions to the inquiry expressed a wish for strong measures, such as a News Corp call for a functional separation of Google's search and advertising businesses, in order to prevent it favouring content that benefited its own commercial interests.</p><p>The government has been increasingly outspoken in its wish to come down hard on the regulation of big global tech platforms operating in Australia in recent times.</p><p>Following the Christchurch Mosque shootings, which were live-streamed and widely shared on Facebook and other online platforms, Prime Minister Scott Morrison dragged representatives of the companies to a crisis meeting in Brisbane, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/news/politics/national/tech-execs-face-three-years-jail-over-violent-broadcasts-20190329-p518xs\">where executives were threatened with possible jail terms</url> if they didn't smarten their acts up.</p><p>He also used the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/news/policy/foreign-affairs/morrison-wins-g20-support-for-online-terrorism-crackdown-20190629-p522hx\">global spotlight of the G20</url> in June to organise and international edict that insisted that social media companies do more to police their conduct, under the threat of legislation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520159831</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNB-3TY1-DY19-C090-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><timeReceived>11:49 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

But the Treasury makes a pronouncement that is much sought to avoid saying, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">and that is that VAT will end up moving to end user,</emphasis>because, inevitably, it is your responsibility to take over the Value Added Tax. The initiative reads verbatim:<br/><br/>\"It should be noted that the tax burden on VAT on the digital services they intend to tax will fall on the final consumer, who from an economic point of view is the tax payer. Where the services mentioned are purchased by undertakings, the economic effect is neutral, since the VAT transferred by the digital service provider is atissueable against the VAT caused by the company in the same month in which this happens\"<br/><br/>The determination, however stark it may seem, does not really correspond to Hacienda, namely Gonzalo Rojo, associate director of The Competitive Intelligence Unit. The Treasury does not really have any interference as to whether or not technology platforms decide to absorb the extra VAT expenditure they must pay, or, although, they decide to transfer it to their users.<br/><br/>But yes, in some cases it will be inevitable that VAT will end up being moved to the end user.<br/><br/>That is not to say, according to the telecommunications specialist Javier Tejado and the director of The CIU, Ernesto Piedras, that technology companies should not pay taxes. In the end, regulations for taxing the digital economy are advancing at a slow but steady pace outside Mexico. Both in an interview with W Radio have agreed that the digital economy must be taxed, but the subject of the G20, G7, and to be discussed for the 2020 revenue in Mexico, is in the how.<br/><br/>All digital economy contributors in the same basket<br/><br/>The big problem with the Treasury's proposal is that all technology platforms are being considered equal. Thus, Treasury will tax in the same way a Finnish developer with mail management service that offers a monthly subscription, as to Google. In France, in fact, a very clear distinction has been made, where the four great tech companies, known by their acronyms as GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple), already have a 3% tax on their income in the country.<br/><br/>The Treasury doesn't make that distinction. Rojo explains that the Treasury proposal includes any foreign company, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">regardless of the size of revenue they generate in Mexico.</emphasis> There, the proposal is different from that put forward by the deputy of Morena, Ram\u00edrez Cuellar, earlier this year, and the proposal by the senator of Morena, Ricardo Monreal, which establishes a profit floor of 800 million pesos: if a company generates more than this in M\u00e9xic or, then you should pay the corresponding VAT.<br/><br/>Rojo is concerned about the vastness of categories included in the Treasury proposal, which includes everything from online dating services, cloud storage, streaming services, and even education. \"I was very struck by the inclusion of educational services,\" says Rojo, which would involve platforms like Coursera and Khan Academy. The proposal reads in textual form:<br/><br/>\"The proposal under consideration does not apply to all digital services but exclusively to a category of services that are generally final consumer in households or used by individuals for theirindividual consumption, such as downloading or accessing images, movies, text, information, video, audio, music, games, including gambling, as well as other multimedia content, multiplayer environments, obtaining mobile ringtones, viewing online news, traffic information, weather forecasts and statistics. Examples of the above are audio or video streaming services to watch movies or listen to music, among others. Also in this category are digital services of online clubs and dating pages, data storage, as well as distance learning services or tests or exercises\".<br/><br/>Rojo explains that the leap that is taking place in Mexico is huge. While other countries are discussing which platforms to tax, there has been a consensus that streaming platforms should top the list, but from there, the debate continues. \"I<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">think we did something very upto us, very quickly</emphasis> (...) you can't put everything in the same basket, especially talking about education.\"<br/><br/>Streaming platforms lead the first places on technology platforms to record because they arrive directly at end-user, have entertainment purposes, and mainly reach medium and high socio-economic levels<br/><br/>In this sense Senator Monreal's proposal is much more <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">measured.</emphasis> It only mentions streaming platforms, although it does indicate that the rest should be taxed, only in time.<br/><br/>In fact, the initiative expresses support for Europe's GAFA tax, and in a transitional article states that no later than 360 days after its approval, Mexico must impose a new excise duty of 3% on the profits of the rest of the companies always in the light of what happens in the next year of global platform tax debate and the comments it makes to the OECD about it.<br/><br/>No waiting for the Treasury. If all technology companies are approved, they should be responding for their VAT and ISR by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1 April 2020.</emphasis><br/><br/>The SAT, the new executioner of the connection to the network of companies in Mexico<br/><br/>Of the most interesting items of the Treasury's proposal is that for companies residing abroad to pay their taxes, they must have a legal representative residing in Mexico. To say of Rojo, large companies would not have the least of the problems, considering that most of them already have offices in the country. The problem would be more in medium and small businesses, with digital services the size of small iOS and Android apps.<br/><br/>In fact, many of the big tech companies in Mexico are already issuing an invoice. For Javier Tejado, the matter of the Treasury proposal is rather important because it sets the collection procedure, which to this day shines because of its non-existence in Mexico's tax laws.<br/><br/>The most interesting part is when we get to the sanctions. The Treasury initiative states that, if a global technology company that is not resident in Mexico refuses to register with the SAT, then the SAT will have the power to go to broadband service dealers<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(read Telmex, Izzi, AT&amp;T; or other ),</emphasis>and ask you to unsubscribe the connection that companies make to provide their service in the country.<br/><br/>\"There I think it's also not very functional,\" says Rojo, adding convinced,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"it's virtually impossible.\"</emphasis> Not only is it the issue of the technological and human resource arm that would be needed to find every digital service provider globally that providessome kind of service in Mexico, but the inability to trace their connections in the country. \"The government doesn't even have time to do that kind of thing, and we'd become China because we were blocking services,\" says Rojo.<br/><br/>But if for some reason the procedure could be carried out, and dealers took more than five days to make the connection cut, then would be creditors to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">fines ranging from 500,000 pesos per million pesos.</emphasis><br/><br/>\"Given the possibility of non-compliance that could occur, it is necessary to impose a penalty for such non-compliance, for which it is proposed to establish in the CFF an article 90 Bis to establish a fine of $500,000.00 to $1'000,000.00 for the non-compliance, a penalty that will also apply for each calendar month that occurs without complying with the suspension order\"<br/><br/>The other two proposals are rather less elaborate. Ram\u00edrez Cuellar's establishes a VAT withholding procedure facilitated through banks and other financial institutions, similar to that of Monreal's proposal, where banks must also take charge of the collection when payment is made debit, credit, departmental or prepaid card.<br/><br/>If digital platforms serve as intermediaries then the scheme is different. In the case of Uber, ARBNB and similar companies that serve as a link between a service or product provider and the end consumer, it would be the platforms that must be responsible for the collection of the ISR of the transactions, according to the Initiative of the Treasury. \"This is justified by the fact that these platforms have control and record of transactions that are carried out between their users (as much as alaw, service providers and their customers)\" reads in the initiative.<br/><br/>There's a minimum income floor here. If the total income of natural persons does not exceed 300 thousand pesos per year, then the ISR can be paid under the law, but if the limit is exceeded or natural persons earn income from different salaries then the withholding made by the platform would be provisional only.<br/><br/>The scheme is not a very different one from the one that Uber and the like have started to apply in Mexico since the end of 2018, only that until now it has remained as a project in pilot phase and with optional application by the platforms.<br/><br/>With so many changes happening rapidly, Rojo's main concern is that the necessary discussion about the most optimal regulation around the levy on technology companies simply <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">hasn't happened.</emphasis> \"I think it's a new world, it's a complex world, in which serious analysis and time is required to be able to do something serious.

Now to get into the matter is to burst the bubble in the least shrill way possible.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NAFENG-6164856</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NAFENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1K-SJJ1-DY1R-B1KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468746</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1650\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NAFTA (English)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Jornal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\"</p><p>If they want to get into the financial business, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies in the venture will have to accept the kind of tight regulation that banks are under, the president said.</p><p>The Treasury chief's comments went further, though, tying Libra directly to concerns over potential use for money laundering, drug and human trafficking, tax evasion and other crimes.</p><p>The Treasury Department has \"very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financers,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook has \"a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we're comfortable with it,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p>On Tuesday, Congress begins two days of hearings on Facebook's Libra plan. The head of the Federal Reserve also raised an alarm about the plan last week.</p><p>Facebook's plan \"raises a lot of serious concerns, and those would include around privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony. \"Those are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds.\"</p><p>Unlike Mnuchin, Powell - as head of the central bank - is an independent regulator who is separate from the administration and political influence.</p><p>Already under intense scrutiny from regulators and Congress over privacy and market dominance, Facebook stirred anger on Capitol Hill last month with the unveiling of its plan to create a new financial ecosystem based on a digital currency. Senate and House hearings went on the calendar, and the Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p><p>Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said that Facebook, with some 2 billion users around the world, \"is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.\" She called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says in his testimony prepared for Tuesday's hearing by the Financial Services panel that Libra \"is about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.\"</p><p>Facebook agrees with Powell's view that the government's review of Libra must be \"patient and thorough, rather than a sprint to implementation,\" Marcus' statement says. \"The time between now and launch is designed to be an open process and subject to regulatory oversight and review. In fact, I expect that this will be the broadest, most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight by regulators and central banks in FinTech's history. We know we need to take the time to get this right.\"</p><p>The planned digital currency is billed as a \"stablecoin\" backed by deposits in sovereign currencies such as the dollar, euro and Japanese yen - unlike bitcoin, ether or other digital currencies. Promising low fees, it could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders. But it also raises concerns over the privacy of users' data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud.</p><p>To address privacy concerns, Facebook created a nonprofit oversight association, with dozens of partners including PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Visa and MasterCard to govern Libra. As one among many in the association, Facebook says it won't have any special rights or privileges. It also created a \"digital wallet\" subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business. While Facebook owns and controls Calibra, it won't see financial data from Calibra, the company says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-de2a6154d0334f128ff3d0df60da8d40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK6-MPF1-JC65-51X1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><timeReceived>10:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\"</p><p>If they want to get into the financial business, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies in the venture will have to accept the kind of tight regulation that banks are under, the president said.</p><p>The Treasury chief's comments went further, though, tying Libra directly to concerns over potential use for money laundering, drug and human trafficking, tax evasion and other crimes.</p><p>The Treasury Department has \"very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financers,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook has \"a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we're comfortable with it,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p>On Tuesday, Congress begins two days of hearings on Facebook's Libra plan. The head of the Federal Reserve also raised an alarm about the plan last week.</p><p>Facebook's plan \"raises a lot of serious concerns, and those would include around privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony. \"Those are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds.\"</p><p>Unlike Mnuchin, Powell - as head of the central bank - is an independent regulator who is separate from the administration and political influence.</p><p>Already under intense scrutiny from regulators and Congress over privacy and market dominance, Facebook stirred anger on Capitol Hill last month with the unveiling of its plan to create a new financial ecosystem based on a digital currency. Senate and House hearings went on the calendar, and the Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p><p>Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said that Facebook, with some 2 billion users around the world, \"is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.\" She called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says in his testimony prepared for Tuesday's hearing by the Financial Services panel that Libra \"is about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.\"</p><p>Facebook agrees with Powell's view that the government's review of Libra must be \"patient and thorough, rather than a sprint to implementation,\" Marcus' statement says. \"The time between now and launch is designed to be an open process and subject to regulatory oversight and review. In fact, I expect that this will be the broadest, most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight by regulators and central banks in FinTech's history. We know we need to take the time to get this right.\"</p><p>The planned digital currency is billed as a \"stablecoin\" backed by deposits in sovereign currencies such as the dollar, euro and Japanese yen - unlike bitcoin, ether or other digital currencies. Promising low fees, it could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders. But it also raises concerns over the privacy of users' data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud.</p><p>To address privacy concerns, Facebook created a nonprofit oversight association, with dozens of partners including PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Visa and MasterCard to govern Libra. As one among many in the association, Facebook says it won't have any special rights or privileges. It also created a \"digital wallet\" subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business. While Facebook owns and controls Calibra, it won't see financial data from Calibra, the company says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-de2a6154d0334f128ff3d0df60da8d40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK6-MSK1-JC65-54D5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><timeReceived>10:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\"</p><p>If they want to get into the financial business, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies in the venture will have to accept the kind of tight regulation that banks are under, the president said.</p><p>The Treasury chief's comments went further, though, tying Libra directly to concerns over potential use for money laundering, drug and human trafficking, tax evasion and other crimes.</p><p>The Treasury Department has \"very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financers,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook has \"a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we're comfortable with it,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p>On Tuesday, Congress begins two days of hearings on Facebook's Libra plan. The head of the Federal Reserve also raised an alarm about the plan last week.</p><p>Facebook's plan \"raises a lot of serious concerns, and those would include around privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony. \"Those are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds.\"</p><p>Unlike Mnuchin, Powell - as head of the central bank - is an independent regulator who is separate from the administration and political influence.</p><p>Already under intense scrutiny from regulators and Congress over privacy and market dominance, Facebook stirred anger on Capitol Hill last month with the unveiling of its plan to create a new financial ecosystem based on a digital currency. Senate and House hearings went on the calendar, and the Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p><p>Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said that Facebook, with some 2 billion users around the world, \"is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.\" She called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says in his testimony prepared for Tuesday's hearing by the Financial Services panel that Libra \"is about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.\"</p><p>Facebook agrees with Powell's view that the government's review of Libra must be \"patient and thorough, rather than a sprint to implementation,\" Marcus' statement says. \"The time between now and launch is designed to be an open process and subject to regulatory oversight and review. In fact, I expect that this will be the broadest, most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight by regulators and central banks in FinTech's history. We know we need to take the time to get this right.\"</p><p>The planned digital currency is billed as a \"stablecoin\" backed by deposits in sovereign currencies such as the dollar, euro and Japanese yen - unlike bitcoin, ether or other digital currencies. Promising low fees, it could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders. But it also raises concerns over the privacy of users' data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud.</p><p>To address privacy concerns, Facebook created a nonprofit oversight association, with dozens of partners including PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Visa and MasterCard to govern Libra. As one among many in the association, Facebook says it won't have any special rights or privileges. It also created a \"digital wallet\" subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business. While Facebook owns and controls Calibra, it won't see financial data from Calibra, the company says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-de2a6154d0334f128ff3d0df60da8d40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK6-MR91-JC65-52JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><timeReceived>10:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\"</p><p>If they want to get into the financial business, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies in the venture will have to accept the kind of tight regulation that banks are under, the president said.</p><p>The Treasury chief's comments went further, though, tying Libra directly to concerns over potential use for money laundering, drug and human trafficking, tax evasion and other crimes.</p><p>The Treasury Department has \"very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financers,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook has \"a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we're comfortable with it,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p>On Tuesday, Congress begins two days of hearings on Facebook's Libra plan. The head of the Federal Reserve also raised an alarm about the plan last week.</p><p>Facebook's plan \"raises a lot of serious concerns, and those would include around privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony. \"Those are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds.\"</p><p>Unlike Mnuchin, Powell - as head of the central bank - is an independent regulator who is separate from the administration and political influence.</p><p>Already under intense scrutiny from regulators and Congress over privacy and market dominance, Facebook stirred anger on Capitol Hill last month with the unveiling of its plan to create a new financial ecosystem based on a digital currency. Senate and House hearings went on the calendar, and the Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p><p>Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said that Facebook, with some 2 billion users around the world, \"is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.\" She called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says in his testimony prepared for Tuesday's hearing by the Financial Services panel that Libra \"is about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.\"</p><p>Facebook agrees with Powell's view that the government's review of Libra must be \"patient and thorough, rather than a sprint to implementation,\" Marcus' statement says. \"The time between now and launch is designed to be an open process and subject to regulatory oversight and review. In fact, I expect that this will be the broadest, most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight by regulators and central banks in FinTech's history. We know we need to take the time to get this right.\"</p><p>The planned digital currency is billed as a \"stablecoin\" backed by deposits in sovereign currencies such as the dollar, euro and Japanese yen - unlike bitcoin, ether or other digital currencies. Promising low fees, it could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders. But it also raises concerns over the privacy of users' data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud.</p><p>To address privacy concerns, Facebook created a nonprofit oversight association, with dozens of partners including PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Visa and MasterCard to govern Libra. As one among many in the association, Facebook says it won't have any special rights or privileges. It also created a \"digital wallet\" subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business. While Facebook owns and controls Calibra, it won't see financial data from Calibra, the company says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-de2a6154d0334f128ff3d0df60da8d40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK6-MN31-DYN6-W1WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><timeReceived>10:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\"</p><p> If they want to get into the financial business, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies in the venture will have to accept the kind of tight regulation that banks are under, the president said.</p><p> The Treasury chief 's comments went further, though, tying Libra directly to concerns over potential use for money laundering, drug and human trafficking, tax evasion and other crimes.</p><p>Facebook has \"a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we're comfortable with it,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p> On Tuesday, Congress begins two days of hearings on Facebook's Libra plan. The head of the Federal Reserve also raised an alarm about the plan last week.</p><p>Facebook's plan \"raises a lot of serious concerns, and those would include around privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony. \"Those are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds.\"</p><p> Unlike Mnuchin, Powell \u2014 as head of the central bank \u2014 is an independent regulator who is separate from the administration and political influence.</p><p> Already under intense scrutiny from regulators and Congress over privacy and market dominance, Facebook stirred anger on Capitol Hill last month with the unveiling of its plan to create a new financial ecosystem based on a digital currency. Senate and House hearings went on the calendar, and the Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p><p> Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said that Facebook, with some 2 billion users around the world, \"is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.\" She called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p> David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says in his testimony prepared for Tuesday's hearing by the Financial Services panel that Libra \"is about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.\"</p><p>Facebook agrees with Powell's view that the government's review of Libra must be \"patient and thorough, rather than a sprint to implementation,\" Marcus' statement says. \"The time between now and launch is designed to be an open process and subject to regulatory oversight and review. In fact, I expect that this will be the broadest, most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight by regulators and central banks in FinTech's history. We know we need to take the time to get this right.\"</p><p> The planned digital currency is billed as a \"stablecoin\" backed by deposits in sovereign currencies such as the dollar, euro and Japanese yen \u2014 unlike bitcoin, ether or other digital currencies. Promising low fees, it could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders. But it also raises concerns over the privacy of users' data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud.</p><p> To address privacy concerns, Facebook created a nonprofit oversight association, with dozens of partners including PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Visa and MasterCard to govern Libra. As one among many in the association, Facebook says it won't have any special rights or privileges. It also created a \"digital wallet\" subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business. While Facebook owns and controls Calibra, it won't see financial data from Calibra, the company says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-174BC072321C9CA8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289855AE9253E4 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKH-7RX1-JBCN-452P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"786\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Santa Monica Daily Press<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behaviour, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\"</p><p>If they want to get into the financial business, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies in the venture will have to accept the kind of tight regulation that banks are under, the president said.</p><p>The Treasury chief's comments went further, though, tying Libra directly to concerns over potential use for money laundering, drug and human trafficking, tax evasion and other crimes.</p><p>The Treasury Department has \"very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financers,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook has \"a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we're comfortable with it,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p>On Tuesday, Congress begins two days of hearings on Facebook's Libra plan. The head of the Federal Reserve also raised an alarm about the plan last week.</p><p>Facebook's plan \"raises a lot of serious concerns, and those would include around privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony. \"Those are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds.\"</p><p>Unlike Mnuchin, Powell - as head of the central bank - is an independent regulator who is separate from the administration and political influence.</p><p>Already under intense scrutiny from regulators and Congress over privacy and market dominance, Facebook stirred anger on Capitol Hill last month with the unveiling of its plan to create a new financial ecosystem based on a digital currency. Senate and House hearings went on the calendar, and the Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p><p>Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said that Facebook, with some 2 billion users around the world, \"is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.\" She called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says in his testimony prepared for Tuesday's hearing by the Financial Services panel that Libra \"is about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.\"</p><p>Facebook agrees with Powell's view that the government's review of Libra must be \"patient and thorough, rather than a sprint to implementation,\" Marcus' statement says. \"The time between now and launch is designed to be an open process and subject to regulatory oversight and review. In fact, I expect that this will be the broadest, most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight by regulators and central banks in FinTech's history. We know we need to take the time to get this right.\"</p><p>The planned digital currency is billed as a \"stablecoin\" backed by deposits in sovereign currencies such as the dollar, euro and Japanese yen - unlike bitcoin, ether or other digital currencies. Promising low fees, it could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders. But it also raises concerns over the privacy of users' data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud.</p><p>To address privacy concerns, Facebook created a non-profit oversight association, with dozens of partners including PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Visa and MasterCard to govern Libra. As one among many in the association, Facebook says it won't have any special rights or privileges. It also created a \"digital wallet\" subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business. While Facebook owns and controls Calibra, it won't see financial data from Calibra, the company says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-de2a6154d0334f128ff3d0df60da8d40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK8-1F01-JBVR-30JV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><timeReceived>06:24 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\" </p><p>If they want to get into the financial business, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies in the venture will have to accept the kind of tight regulation that banks are under, the president said. </p><p>The Treasury chief's comments went further, though, tying Libra directly to concerns over potential use for money laundering, drug and human trafficking, tax evasion and other crimes. </p><p>Facebook has \"a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we're comfortable with it,\" Mnuchin said. </p><p>Congress today begins two days of hearings on Facebook's Libra plan. The head of the Federal Reserve also raised an alarm about the plan last week.</p><p>Facebook's plan \"raises a lot of serious concerns, and those would include around privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony. \"Those are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds.\" </p><p>Unlike Mnuchin, Powell - as head of the central bank - is an independent regulator who is separate from the administration and political influence. </p><p>Already under intense scrutiny from regulators and Congress over privacy and market dominance, Facebook stirred anger on Capitol Hill last month with the unveiling of its plan to create a new financial ecosystem based on a digital currency. Senate and House hearings went on the calendar, and the Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it. </p><p>Gordon writes for The Associated Press.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0097755327</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK7-YDP1-JBM5-R0SS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"425\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They had all previously endorsed an earlier version of the bill.</p><p>Medicare for all has reshaped the debate over healthcare among Demcorats, pushing the center of gravity on the issue far to the left of what was under consideration when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. Republicans have accused the Democrats of trying to bring socialism to the US. Sanders envisions a complete transformation of the US healthcare system. Under Medicare for all, the US would transition to a single payer system run entirely by the federal government. </p><p>The bill is largely the same as the one he introduced in 2017. The transition would take place over a four year period, with the age of eligibility for Medicare dropping by 10 years until it reaches age 35 in year three. This differs from a House version of this bill, introduced earlier this year that calls for a two-year transition period. </p><p>The plan would cover all medically necessary care including vision and dental. There is, however, one notable change: the newer vision of the bill expands coverage to include home-and community based long-term care services. Private insurers could stay in business only to provide for care that is not covered by Medicare for all, such as elective surgery. </p><p>While Sanders likes to proudly point to polling that shows public support for universal healthcare has spiked since his 2016 run, the major barrier for would-be supporters is the price tag. </p><p>In an accompanying fact sheet, Sanders says the plan \"does not represent any new spending at all.

AP reports:</p><p> Four of Sanders' fellow senators and rivals for the Democratic nomination are set to sign onto the updated single-payer health care proposal. The bill's reintroduction promises to shine a bright light on Democratic presidential candidates' disparate visions for the long-term future of American health care. </p><p>Under fire from President Donald Trump and Republicans for the astronomical price tag of Medicare for All, some candidates who support the plan tout it as one of several ways to achieve more affordable coverage and lower the number of uninsured. And others who don't back it are instead focusing on safeguarding popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as the one that protects coverage of pre-existing conditions. </p><p>\"Of course, our No. 1 goal should be to make sure we keep in place those protections so people don't get kicked off their insurance,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar , a Minnesota Democrat who isn't signed onto Sanders' bill, told reporters Tuesday. \"Then we also have to see the Affordable Care Act as a beginning and not an end.\" </p><p>Klobuchar supports a so-called public option, versions of which would allow Americans to buy into Medicare or Medicaid. Four other Democratic senators also running for president Elizabeth Warren , Cory Booker , Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand back Sanders' single-payer plan, which would replace the current mix of private and government health insurance in the U.S. with a new system run by the government. But they have also signed onto at least one version of a public option. </p><p>Warren pointed to \"a lot of different pathways\" to universal coverage during a televised CNN town hall last month. \"What we're all looking for is the lowest cost way to make sure that everybody gets covered.\" </p><p>The debate is unfolding in the early stages of a Democratic primary in which some candidates have pointed to their support of Medicare for All to prove their progressive bona fides. But other Democratic contenders, including former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper , have criticized Sanders' measure as politically infeasible. </p><p>Under Medicare for All, Americans would no longer pay premiums or face insurance deductibles as the government-run system replaced private health insurance offered through employers, the mainstay of coverage for more than 160 million Americans. </p><p>Big tax increases would be needed to finance such a system. The transition is likely to be complicated, dismantling the private health insurance industry and making major changes for hospitals, doctors, drug companies and other medical providers. </p><p>\"What our system does is get rid of insurance companies and drug companies making billions of dollars in profit every single year,\" Sanders told CBS News for an interview set to air Wednesday, adding that private insurance would largely exist solely for elective medical care such as cosmetic surgery. </p><p>block-time published-time 1.44pm BST </p><p> William Barr to testify before Senate subcommittee  </p><p>Attorney General William Barr will return to Capitol Hill today, testifying before a Senate appropriations subcommittee.</p><p>On Tuesday, testifying before the House, Barr said he would be ready to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller 's Russia report within a week. </p><p>Today's hearing, like yesterday's, is ostensibly about the justice department budget but lawmakers are expected to grill the attorney general about the Mueller report.</p><p>More from the Associated Press:</p><p> Justice department officials are scouring the report to remove grand jury information and details relating to pending investigations, among other materials. Democrats have escalated criticism over Barr's handling of the document and say they will not accept any redactions. The House judiciary committee has approved, but not sent, subpoenas for the report , and top Democrats have said they are willing to take the battle to court. </p><p>At the House hearing, Barr bluntly defended himself, arguing that portions of the document need to be redacted to comply with the law. He said he's open to eventually releasing some of the redacted material after consulting with congressional leaders, but he drew a line at releasing grand jury material, which would require court approval.

Here's what happened Wednesday evening: A new bill in Ohio that just passed the legislature would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected - which is typically before most women even know they are pregnant. Ohio is one of several states introducing legislation in an attempt to push a Roe v Wade reconsideration from the newly conservative-heavy supreme court. Republicans grilled tech executives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter about conservative censorship on their platforms, a move Democrats called a strategy to increase bias and favorable treatment online. The treasury department declined to hand over Trump's tax returns before a deadline set in a request from the House ways and means committee chairman, Richard Neal. In a letter, Secretary Steve Mnuchin said his department was still deciding whether to comply, and seeking support from the justice department. Jeff Bezos will meet with federal prosecutors this week, CNN reports, as investigators deepen their inquiry into the Amazon CEO's claims that Saudi Arabia was behind the National Enquirer extortion scandal that exposed his affair. Bezos believes the Saudis targeted him because of he owns the Washington Post, and has in recent weeks provided prosecutors with documents uncovered by his personal investigators to support the accusation. American Media Inc (AMI), which owns the National Inquirer, denies the allegations and a spokesperson told CNN the company \"does not have nor have we ever had, any editorial or financial ties to Saudi Arabia\". Prosecutors are now seeking access to Bezos's electronic devices as part of their investigation, the results of which could show that AMI violated a non-prosecution agreement. Per CNN: As part of that agreement, company officials admitted to its involvement in a hush-money scheme to influence the 2016 presidential election by silencing a woman who claimed an affair with then-candidate Donald Trump and agreed not to commit any crimes for three years. The agreement stemmed from prosecutors' investigation of Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen, who helped orchestrate that hush-money payment\". The Treasury Department will not turn over Trump's tax returns by today's deadline. In a letter to Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin cited concerns over \"an abuse of authority\" and wrote that the law cited in Neal's request could not be used \"for purposes of embarrassing or attacking political figures of another party\". Emphasizing the political weight of the request, he adds that the Department is seeking counsel from the Department of Justice \"to ensure that our response is fully consistent with the law and the Constitution\". Mnuchin's letter was supported by Congressman Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, who referred to his Committee's request for the returns as \"political fishing expeditions\". \"The Treasury Department is right to carefully review the privacy impact this request would have on every taxpayer,\" he added in a statement. Trump has repeatedly refused to release the returns and has told reporters, despite the requests made by Congress, they would not become public. Last week, Mick Mulvaney, the president's chief of staff vowed they would never get released. On Tuesday, Mnuchin told lawmakers during a hearing, that his department's lawyers had discussed the decision with White House counsel before the official request for the returns was made but did not seek \"permission\", even though he had been told by Trump's lawyers not to hand over the returns until the Justice Department weighed in. At a Senate panel hearing today, Republican lawmakers grilled tech executives for more than three hours, over a perceived conservative bias they believe is exhibited across the highly-trafficked platforms, the Washington Post reports. Representatives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter were questioned by Republicans on the panel, which is headed by Ted Cruz, who accused the tech giants of a \"consistent pattern of political bias and censorship\". Per the Post: 'Not only does big tech have the power to silence voices with which they disagree, but big tech likewise has the power to collate a person's feed so they only receive the news that comports with their own political agenda', Cruz said. But Democrats sharply rebuked Cruz and his GOP allies for convening the hearing in the first place. 'For decades, Republicans have bashed the supposedly liberal mainstream media in an effort to work the refs' said Senator. Mazie Hirono. 'Now that two-thirds of Americans get their news from social media, Republicans have a new boogeyman to target - big tech'. A bill in Ohio banning any abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected - which is usually before most women know they are pregnant - has passed the state's legislature today with a promised signature from Republican governor, Mike DeWine. Choice advocates are already preparing their legal responses. Seven other states have filed similar legislation, AP reports, Kentucky and Mississippi already have enacted laws, and other states, like Alabama, are making moves to criminalize the women who terminate their pregnancies. In Texas, legislators are considering a bill that would qualify abortion as homicide - a crime that could mean the death penalty in the state. The bills are expected to serve as a direct challenge to Roe v Wade, to set the stage for reconsideration from the newly conservative-heavy Supreme Court. \"To me this is an issue the court simply got wrong years ago,\" Alabama representative Terri Collins, who sponsored her state's anti-abortion bill told AP. It's unlikely they will reach the court soon and Federal judges on lower courts have blocked some of the state bills, including the Kentucky ban. But, with a Trump-stacked 5th circuit, the path is much less bumpy. Per AP: If even one circuit breaks with Roe v. Wade and upholds a heartbeat ban, that could be enough for the Supreme Court to take up the issue, said Justin Dyer, a political science professor at the University of Missouri......What might happen at the Supreme Court is far from clear. Legal experts are unsure what effect the Trump appointees might have, or where Chief Justice John Roberts stands in regard to Roe...If the Supreme Court ever did overturn Roe v. Wade, states would presumably be left to decide for themselves whether abortion would be legal\". Gabrielle Canon here, taking over for Erin Durkin. Today, California Congresswoman Karen Bass did her part to ensure the impact of Nipsey Hussle, a rapper and activist from her district who was gunned down on March 31, would not soon be forgotten. The Grammy-nominated musician's legacy was officially submitted into Congressional record. Calling him a \"humble visionary\", the record details how he helped uplift his community, as a musician, entrepreneur, and advocate, highlighting his advocacy efforts against inequality, police brutality and gang violence. Throughout his projects, Nipsey Hussle brought the neighborhood with him. In working to ensure that the community was knowledgeable about their economic power, Nipsey Hussle made sure to give jobs to residents in the neighborhood who were struggling, some of which were homeless and formerly incarcerated......He taught and reminded our community that the power we hold is the power welcome from and that awareness of our power is something no one can take from us. Nipsey Hussle will be remembered as a visionary, as a protector, as an inspiration, as a philanthropist, as a father, as a brother and as an unabashed son of South LosAngeles. For all he was given, he gave back. And for that legacy, South Los Angeles has been changed forever\". Attorney General William Barr said he believes the government spied on Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. \"I think spying did occur,\" he said before a Senate committee, adding he would look into whether the surveillance was justified. Donald Trump launched a new attack on the Mueller investigation, calling it crooked and treasonous. At the same time, he claimed not to care about Mueller's report and said he hasn't read it. The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Ron Vitiello, resigned, the latest in an apparent purge of top homeland security officials. Donald Trump last week withdrew Vitiello's nomination to lead the agency on a permanent basis, saying he wanted someone \"tougher.\" The Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director, Ron Vitiellohas, has resigned, according to Bloomberg News. Donald Trump last week withdrew his nomination to lead the agency on a permanent basis. Former Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley has joined e-cigarette company Juul Labs, the Boston Globe reports. The company has been criticized by regulators and advocates for marketing geared to teens, and current Massachusetts AG Maura Healey has launched an investigation into their practices. Another Republican Senator is urging Donald Trump to stop his purge of the top ranks of the Department of Homeland Security. The Washington Post reports: Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Reform Committee, said he is worried that [DHS General Counsel John] Mitnick could be dismissed. Johnson is preparing a letter to the administration advising \"against even considering getting rid of the counsel.\" Johnson emphasized that Mitnick was a consensus pick, having been confirmed unanimously to the job. \"You need management in the department and particularly a counsel that will shoot straight,\" Johnson said. \"I just think the current counsel is a good person and we want to make sure he stays on the job.\" He said [acting Homeland Security secretary Kevin] McAleenan is facing a job that is an \"almost impossible task for anybody.\" \"And it's not getting any easier whatsoever,\" Johnson said. \"But right now, I've got a great deal of confidence in the commissioner.\" Senator Bernie Sanders says he is not surprised by the opposition to his Medicare for All plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that Attorney General William Barr's comments about \"spying\" on the Trump campaign undermine his role as the chief US law enforcement officer. \"He is not the attorney general of Donald Trump. He is the attorney general of the United States,\" Pelosi said in an interview with the Associated Press. \"I don't trust Barr, I trust Mueller.\" She said she was \"she was \"very concerned\" about Barr's handling of the Mueller report. Pelosi said Barr's comments about spying undermine the Constitution and his role in the Justice Department. Donald Trump again attacks the Mueller probe, this time via tweet. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos told a congressional committee Wednesday she is \"not familiar\" with affirmative action rules the administration reversed this year, Politico reports. The Obama-era guidance told school districts and colleges they could consider race in some cases in trying to diversify their student bodies. Asked about the decision in testimony before a House committee Wednesday, DeVos said she's \"not familiar with that particular document,\" according to Politico. She also said she was \"not familiar\" with a Supreme Court ruling on race-based admissions, on which the scrapped guidelines were partially based. Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani accused House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler of \"diarrhea of the mouth.\" Nadler has said he will subpoena a full version of the Mueller report if it's not turned over to Congress soon. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement blasting the Medicare for All bill introduced today by Senator Bernie Sanders: \"Self-proclaimed socialist Senator Bernie Sanders is proposing a total government takeover of healthcare that would actually hurt seniors, eliminate private health insurance for 180 million Americans, and cripple our economy and future generations with unprecedented debt. Americans deserve relief from the empty promises of Obamacare. The Trump Administration is working on realistic solutions to provide Americans with the options and control they want, the affordability they need, the ease they expect, and the quality they deserve, rather than forcing a government takeover of the healthcare system. We will protect people with pre-existing conditions, lower prices for care and prescription drugs even further, end surprise medical bills, and make sure Americans get the absolute best quality of care.\" Senator Chuck Schumer, never one to neglect local concerns after becoming Senate minority leader, is urging a federal investigation after 14 Friendly's restaurants closed in upstate New York, the Binghamton Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin reports. Donald Trump, on a trip to Texas, called his son in law Jared Kushner's upcoming immigration proposal \"very exciting\" and \"very important,\" the Washington Post reports. Kusher has reportedly been working on a plan that would increase legal immigration, even as Republicans introduced a bill in the Senate Wednesday that would slash legal immigration. Donald Trump is pleased to see a Trump flag waved at Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's re-election party. After Netanyahu's opponent conceded, Trump says he called the Israeli prime minister to congratulate him. Washington Gov. and presidential candidate Jay Inslee has been writing and illustrating children's books for his grandkids for the last decade, CNN reports. And they're very on brand, with several of the books focusing on the warming climate and its effect on the environment. \"These books are more for fun and being able to read to your grandkids. That is a treasure, that is priceless and that is why we wrote the books,\" Inslee told CNN. Senator Elizabeth Warren raised $6 million for her presidential campaign in the first three months of the year. She got 213,000 contributions from more than 135,000 donors, with an average donation of $28, according to the New York Times. She trailed the top fundraisers in the Democratic field, Beto O'Rourke and Bernie Sanders, but about matched Senator Kamala Harris in small dollar donations. Senator Mark Warner said he was \"amazed\" that Attorney General William Barr would say there was \"spying\" against Donald Trump's campaign. The Virginia Democrat and vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee told CNN it was \"disrespectful\" to the law enforcement professionals who work at the Justice Department to make such a claim. It shows a \"lack of understanding or willful ignorance of what goes into a counter-intelligence investigation,\" he said. \"He almost seems to be endorsing one of these theories that has been debunked time and time again,\" Warner said. Of the 18 Democrats running for president, six own guns, the Washington Post reports. Beto O'Rourke inherited several guns from a great uncle but says they're not in operating condition. Pete Buttigieg owns two antique guns, which he also says he doesn't use. Rep. Tim Ryan said he has a Remington 12-gauge shotgun that he won in a raffle and doesn't use (he does hunt, but not with that gun). Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper owns a shotgun and a rifle and uses them for bird hunting. Kamala Harris and John Delaney are also gun owners, according to the Post. The field generally supports stronger gun control. Republican senators Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, and Cory Gardner have said they would vote against confirming Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve board, according to Politico. Senator Chuck Grassley said he has received no assurances that Donald Trump won't fire US Citizenship and Immigration Services director Francis Cissna, according to CNN. Grassley has been pushing Trump not to oust him, amid a larger purge of Homeland Security leaders. \"They're taking it under consideration. I don't know whether I'll be satisfied or not when it's all done,\" Grassley said. Three Republican senators introduced a bill Wednesday that would slash legal immigration. Senators Tom Cotton, David Perdue, and Josh Hawley are sponsoring the bill, the Hill reports. It would reduce the total number of immigrants allowed into the US and end preferences for family members other than spouses and minor children. It would instead prioritize would-be immigrants with higher job skills. Former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley is writing a book about her time in the Trump administration, CNN reports. Haley \"will talk candidly about her tenure as UN Ambassador and the consequential actions, decisions, confrontations, and behind-the-scenes negotiations that shaped national and world events,\" according to her publisher. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy is meeting today with ex-Rep. Michael Grimm, who is once again attempting a comeback after serving prison time on tax charges, according to the Hill. Grimm is eyeing a run for his old Staten Island seat, which was won last year by Democrat Max Rose after Grimm ran and lost in the primary. McCarthy's PAC has already donated to Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican assemblywoman who has launched a campaign for the seat. The House passed legislation Wednesday to reinstate net neutrality rules, the Hill reports. Federal Communications Commission in 2017 reversed the Obama-era rules, which prohibit internet providers from slowing down or blocking certain websites. The bill passed by a 232-190 vote, according to the Hill, but is unlikely to get through the Senate. Twitter removed a campaign video posted by President Trump after Warner Bros. Pictures complained about the use of the score from its 2012 movie ''The Dark Knight Rises.'' From AP: Trump on Tuesday tweeted the video, which featured images of Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton juxtaposed with images from Trump's two years in office. The text, set against the movie's score, read: ''First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they call you a racist. Donald J. Trump. Your vote. Proved them all wrong.'' Warner Bros. said use of the score from the Batman movie starring Christian Bale was ''unauthorized.'' Twitter replaced the video with this message: ''This media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.'' Willam Barr clarifies his prior comments about spying on the Trump campaign: \"I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred. I am saying that I am concerned about it and looking into it. That's all.\" Attorney General William Barr declined to say what basis he has for believing there was spying on Donald Trump's campaign. Invoking past surveillance of civil rights groups, he said it was worth looking into even if it didn't rise to the level of a criminal investigation. Vice President Mike Pence has asked the United Nations to recognize Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader, per AFP. The United States has recognized Guaido, the head of the opposition, as the rightful president rather than Nicolas Maduro. Donald Trump said his adviser Stephen Miller - an immigration hardliner who appears to be gaining influence amid a purge of Department of Homeland Security leaders - is a \"wonderful person\" and \"brilliant man.\" But he insisted he is in charge of his own immigration policy. \"Frankly there's only one person that's running it. You know who that is? It's me,\" he told reporters outside the White House. Here's a transcript of Attorney General William Barr's comments on alleged FBI \"spying\" on Donald Trump's campaign, via Lawfare. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday re-introduced his Medicare for all healthcare plan, the Vermont senator's signature domestic policy proposal that has moved from a fringe, leftwing idea to a progressive litmus test. The new bill has support from Sanders' fellow rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, including Senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren. They had all previously endorsed an earlier version of the bill. Medicare for all has reshaped the debate over healthcare among Demcorats, pushing the center of gravity on the issue far to the left of what was under consideration when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. Republicans have accused the Democrats of trying to bring socialism to the US. Sanders envisions a complete transformation of the US healthcare system. Under Medicare for all, the US would transition to a single payer system run entirely by the federal government. The bill is largely the same as the one he introduced in 2017. The transition would take place over a four year period, with the age of eligibility for Medicare dropping by 10 years until it reaches age 35 in year three. This differs from a House version of this bill, introduced earlier this year that calls for a two-year transition period. The plan would cover all medically necessary care including vision and dental. There is, however, one notable change: the newer vision of the bill expands coverage to include home-and community based long-term care services. Private insurers could stay in business only to provide for care that is not covered by Medicare for all, such as elective surgery. While Sanders likes to proudly point to polling that shows public support for universal healthcare has spiked since his 2016 run, the major barrier for would-be supporters is the price tag. In an accompanying fact sheet, Sanders says the plan \"does not represent any new spending at all. Instead, it represents a rebalance of how our current dollars are spent.\" The fact sheet includes several proposals to offset the costs, including several ideas based on raising taxes on the wealthy individuals. Attorney General William Barr declined to say whether he believes, as Donald Trump does, that the Mueller investigation was illegal or a witch hunt. \"I'm not going to characterize. It is what it is,\" he said. Senator Elizabeth Warren released her 2018 tax return today. It showed more than $900,000 in family income, the Washington Post reports. She and her husband, Bruce Mann, reported earning $905,742 in total income, including $176,280 from her Senate salary and $324,687 from her books. They paid $230,965 in taxes and donated $50,138 to charity. Warren had already released ten prior years of her taxes, according to the Post. Other Democratic presidential candidates including Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar and Jay Inslee have already released their taxes. Robert Mueller did not indicate whether he wanted Attorney General William Barr to make a judgment about Donald Trump's culpability for obstruction of justice. Mueller's report did not make a conclusion on whether Trump was guilty of obstruction of justice, instead laying out evidence on both sides. Barr, in his own summary, said he believes Trump did not commit obstruction. Senator Patrick Leahy asked Barr whether Mueller told him that he wanted to let Congress decide about obstruction. \"He didn't say that to me, no,\" Barr said. Leahy then asked if Mueller said that Barr should decide. \"He didn't say that either. But that's generally how the Department of Justice works,\" he said. Barr said he would explain his conclusion that Trump was not guilty of obstruction, but not yet. \"I don't feel I can do it until the report is out. I think the report contains a lot of the information that would give meaning and content to the decision,\" he said. Attorney General William Barr is defending the Justice Department's decision to argue in court that Obamacare should be thrown out in its entirety. Reversing course, the Justice Department backed a judge's ruling that the healthcare rule is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court had previously upheld it. \"It is a defensible and reasonable legal position,\" Barr said. Attorney General William Barr elaborated on his statement yesterday that he is putting together a team to review the origins of the FBI's investigation into Trump's campaign. He said he believes there was \"spying\" on Trump's campaign, a claim the president has frequently made, and he wants to determine whether that surveillance was justified. Attorney General William Barr said he would not redact information from the Mueller report to protect Donald Trump's reputation. One of the categories of redactions he plans to make is to protect the privacy and reputational interest of third parties not charged with a crime. But when asked in Senate testimony, he said those parties do not include Trump. \"I'm talking about people in private life, not public office holders,\" Barr said. Donald Trump congratulated Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on his likely election victory. \"It may be a little early, but I'm hearing he's won it,\" Trump said Wednesday morning outside the White House, according to footage aired by CNN. \"He's been a great ally, and he's a friend. I'd like to congratulate him.\" Trump went on to say he believes the Israeli hardliner's victory makes peace in the Middle East more likely. \"Everybody said you can't have peace in the Middle East,\" he said. \"I think we have a chance and I think we have now a better chance with Bibi having won.\" Attorney General William Barr tells the Senate he intends to release a redacted version of the Mueller report itself, as oppose to his own summary of the report. He plans to make redactions in four categories, the most controversial of which may be protecting the privacy of people who have not been charged with crimes. On the day of the deadline House Democrats gave the IRS to turn over Donald Trump's taxes, Trump again refused to release them. \"I would love to give them, but I'm not going to do it while I'm under audit. It's very simple,\" Trump said outside the White House. The House Ways and Means committee has requested the returns from the IRS under a law that allows them to obtain the taxes of any citizen. Trump noted he won the election despite breaking with the practice of all nominees in recent history and refusing to release them. \"Frankly the people don't care,\" he said. Attorney General William Barr is now before a Senate appropriations subcommittee. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking Democrat on the committee, tells him she is concerned about reports that Robert Mueller's investigators were not satisfied with his summary of the Mueller report, which they felt left out damaging information. \"The American people should be allowed to see the report in its entirely so they can make their own judgments,\" she said. Donald Trump is again attacking the Mueller investigation, claiming \"everything about it was crooked\" and calling it an attempted coup. \"It was an illegal investigation,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House, according to footage aired on CNN. \"It was started illegally. Everything about it was crooked. Every single thing about it.\" Trump has repeatedly claimed the investigation was illegal, although it was launched by the Justice Department according to legal procedures. Trump called Mueller's investigators \"dirty cops.\" \"There were very bad people,\" he added. \"This was an attempted coup. This was an attempted takedown of a president. And we beat them. We beat them,\" Trump said. \"What they did was treason. What they did was terrible.\" Trump said he had not seen or read the report. \"I have not read the Mueller report. I haven't seen the Mueller report. As far as I'm concerned, I don't care about the Mueller report. I've been totally exonerated,\" he said. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway makes a new pledge about the yet-to-exist GOP healthcare plan: \"People who like their Obamacare can keep their Obamacare,\" she said on CNN. It's an echo of former President Barack Obama's pledge that \"if you like your health plan, you will be able to keep your health plan,\" which, as Conway noted, was not accurate. Past proposals from the GOP would have repealed Obamacare, making Conway's pledge also untrue. But it's unclear what a new plan may look like, and Trump has now said it won't come until the 2020 election. She said protections for people with pre-existing conditions would be \"non-negotiable.\" Jeffrey Rosen, Donald Trump's pick to be deputy attorney general, faces a Senate confirmation hearing today. Rosen is currently the deputy secretary of transportation and has not previously worked in the Justice Department, the Washington Post reports. He would replace Rod Rosenstein, who as deputy AG oversaw the Mueller investigation because former AG Jeff Sessions recused himself. Rosen is likely to be pressed on his views on the Mueller probe as well as his qualifications, according to the Post. Under pressure to show they have solutions, Democrats are honing proposals to address the surge of families entering the U.S. at the southern border, a problem they say President Donald Trump's restrictive immigration policies are enflaming. AP reports: House Democrats plan to introduce legislation soon addressing the recent waves of Central American migrants reaching the border. Senate Democrats are pursuing multiple tracks, including exploring whether talks with the White House might be feasible. The House measure, described by lawmakers...is expected to increase federal resources at border entry points for processing refugees, counseling children and treating people needing medical care. It would create centers in Central America where asylum applications could be processed and provide aid to reduce poverty and violence in the region so fewer people would flee. \"You don't just wait for people to show up at the border. It's the worst way to deal with it,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who's working on the legislation with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and party leaders. In the Senate, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a senior member of the Judiciary committee, said she plans to introduce a bill that would beef up immigration courts to reduce a huge backlog of cases and prohibit separations of migrant families. The measure would face an uphill climb Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell is telling Republicans alarmed by Donald Trump's controversial Federal Reserve picks that they should speak up. CNN reports that during Tuesday's Senate Republican lunch, McConnell told senators concerned about the picks of pizza CEO Herman Cain and conservative commenter Stephen Moore that they should express their objections to the White House now, before the nominations are made official. Cain's 2012 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination was derailed by sexual harassment allegations. Moore's pick is also controversial because critics believe he is poorly qualified and overly partisan. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Republicans are increasingly doubtful Cain would be confirmed. The Manhattan US Attorney's office has gathered evidence from members of Donald Trump's inner circle in its investigation into hush money payments to women who say they had sexual encounters with him, the Wall Street Journal reports. Prosecutors interviewed Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director, and Keith Schiller, Trump's former security chief. Investigators also have a recorded phone call between Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen and a lawyer who represented the two women who got payouts, according to WSJ. The prosecutors had evidence that Trump ordered the illegal payments even before Cohen made that claim in court, the paper reports. Cohen pled guilty to campaign finance crimes for arranging the payments to porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, in exchange for their silence about alleged affairs with Trump. Those payments, for $150,000 and $130,000 respectively, were considered illegal campaign contributions. Donald Trump doesn't think much of George Washington's real estate skills. Politico reports that during a tour of Mount Vernon, the first US president's Virginia estate, Trump remarked: \"If he was smart, he would've put his name on it.\" \"You've got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you,\" he said. As the Mount Vernon president correctly pointed out, Washington did manage to get the nation's capital named after him, as well as a state, a massive monument, and countless streets and institutions around the country. Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of Vermont will unveil a new version of his \"Medicare for All\" plan on Wednesday. AP reports: Four of Sanders' fellow senators and rivals for the Democratic nomination are set to sign onto the updated single-payer health care proposal. The bill's reintroduction promises to shine a bright light on Democratic presidential candidates' disparate visions for the long-term future of American health care. Under fire from President Donald Trump and Republicans for the astronomical price tag of Medicare for All, some candidates who support the plan tout it as one of several ways to achieve more affordable coverage and lower the number of uninsured. And others who don't back it are instead focusing on safeguarding popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as the one that protects coverage of pre-existing conditions. \"Of course, our No. 1 goal should be to make sure we keep in place those protections so people don't get kicked off their insurance,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar , a Minnesota Democrat who isn't signed onto Sanders' bill, told reporters Tuesday. \"Then we also have to see the Affordable Care Act as a beginning and not an end.\" Klobuchar supports a so-called public option, versions of which would allow Americans to buy into Medicare or Medicaid. Four other Democratic senators also running for president Elizabeth Warren , Cory Booker , Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand back Sanders' single-payer plan, which would replace the current mix of private and government health insurance in the U.S. with a new system run by the government. But they have also signed onto at least one version of a public option. Warren pointed to \"a lot of different pathways\" to universal coverage during a televised CNN town hall last month. \"What we're all looking for is the lowest cost way to make sure that everybody gets covered.\" The debate is unfolding in the early stages of a Democratic primary in which some candidates have pointed to their support of Medicare for All to prove their progressive bona fides. But other Democratic contenders, including former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper , have criticized Sanders' measure as politically infeasible. Under Medicare for All, Americans would no longer pay premiums or face insurance deductibles as the government-run system replaced private health insurance offered through employers, the mainstay of coverage for more than 160 million Americans. Big tax increases would be needed to finance such a system. The transition is likely to be complicated, dismantling the private health insurance industry and making major changes for hospitals, doctors, drug companies and other medical providers. \"What our system does is get rid of insurance companies and drug companies making billions of dollars in profit every single year,\" Sanders told CBS News for an interview set to air Wednesday, adding that private insurance would largely exist solely for elective medical care such as cosmetic surgery. Attorney General William Barr will return to Capitol Hill today, testifying before a Senate appropriations subcommittee. On Tuesday, testifying before the House, Barr said he would be ready to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report within a week. Today's hearing, like yesterday's, is ostensibly about the justice department budget but lawmakers are expected to grill the attorney general about the Mueller report. More from the Associated Press: Justice department officials are scouring the report to remove grand jury information and details relating to pending investigations, among other materials. Democrats have escalated criticism over Barr's handling of the document and say they will not accept any redactions. The House judiciary committee has approved, but not sent, subpoenas for the report , and top Democrats have said they are willing to take the battle to court. At the House hearing, Barr bluntly defended himself, arguing that portions of the document need to be redacted to comply with the law. He said he's open to eventually releasing some of the redacted material after consulting with congressional leaders, but he drew a line at releasing grand jury material, which would require court approval. He said Democrats are \"free to go to court\" themselves and ask for the grand jury information. Barr wouldn't discuss the substance of Mueller's findings but did explain some of his process for receiving and reviewing the report and what to expect when it is released: he said the redactions will be color-coded and accompanied by notes explaining the decision to withhold information. 36963 false false </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-52847727</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVM-9S71-JCJY-G2K4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"13972\"/><timeReceived>2:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

It's actually-- </p><p>SORKIN: Good afternoon. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Thank you. It's actually quite fascinating getting the end of the tax briefing. </p><p>SORKIN: You're getting--you're getting the extended--Well, we have a lot--a lot of people. We have Grover's (SP) here. You can Mark Zandi is over there. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Absolutely. </p><p>SORKIN: We've got Glenn Hubbard. We've got a whole-where's Steve Rattner? I don't know. We have a whole group here, and there's some really remarkable people here, this afternoon. </p><p>I have a series of questions, and then I do want to open up because I know there are people here who do so we're going to pretend that it's like TV. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Wait, I thought I was going to get to ask you questions. </p><p>SORKIN: Oh, you can do--you want to? What do you want to do? </p><p>MNUCHIN: So, are you more famous for CNBC or Billions? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SORKIN: From the New York Times? </p><p>MNUCHIN: Or the New York Times. </p><p>SORKIN: How about that? We'll go with the times. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>We'll go with the times. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Here's where I want to start the conversation. You were on TV this morning, as it happens-- </p><p>MNUCHIN: I was? </p><p>SORKIN: Talking about China and you seem to sound a note of optimism about the state of these negotiations. It seemed like. I don't know if you think that's an accurate way to put it. But I wanted to read you because I was reading Tom Friedman in the New York Times, no less, just yesterday and he just got back from China. And he said that he left feeling that--that though--that President Xi is less likely to sign on to the kind of grand bargain and broad concessions that the president is demanding. And that's in part because Xi would get too much pushback from his state-owned industries and Communist Party hardliners. And I wanted to understand the juxtaposition of what Tom was saying and what I think you've been thinking unless you're in agreement. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Let me--let me first put this in context because these issues have been going on for the last 20 years through both parties. So, this is not necessarily a party for a philosophical issue. President Trump came into office and at the first meeting that he had with President Xi, this was on the agenda, and President Trump said that when need to rebalance the trading relationship that this is a one-way street. That you're able to invest in the U.S. freely, you're able to export freely. We want fair and reciprocal trade and President Xi agreed to that. </p><p>And I think as you know, for the last 2.5 years, we've been at different stages of executing this. I wouldn't make the comment whether I'm optimistic or pessimistic, I'd make the comment that the next month is important. I take them at good faith. We're going to have a deputy's level meeting. I believe it's next week to do preliminary work. Followed by the beginning of October a meeting with the Vice Premier and Ambassador Lighthizer and myself and we're hopeful we'll make progress if we can get the right deal. We'll do a deal. </p><p>SORKIN: Within the administration, the departure of Mr. Bolton. Does that change any of the dynamics-- </p><p>MNUCHIN: Not at all. </p><p>SORKIN: For you? </p><p>MNUCHIN: No. </p><p>SORKIN: At all? Does it make it easier? </p><p>MNUCHIN: Not--not--not--not at all. Nothing against Ambassador Bolton, but these are the president's strategies. This is executing on the president, and I--I think that we're much more unified on these issues than the external world, would in any way, like to report it. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. Here's a different question. Brad Smith was here earlier from Microsoft, and we were talking about Huawei and its role in these negotiations. Is there a way to you--it feels that Huawei has become a bit over a--a pawn, if you will, in these negotiations? Is the--could you see the president trading something on Huawei for the trade deal? </p><p>MNUCHIN: No, and--and I--I don't think it's fair to say that it's a pawn and I think you know one of the things about the--the treasury role is I spin a lot of different issues in the administration, so I sit on--on the National Security Council, and I'm obviously focused on economic issues as well, so I--I get to see both sides of this. Part of the Huawei issue is clearly a national security issue. There's no question about that, and we've had discussions with our allies on it. </p><p>There are other parts of the Huawei issue that are not, and what President Trump said to President Xi last time was we will consider licenses for things that are not of national security concern. </p><p>SORKIN: But is there--I--I think the question is when Huawei gets painted as a national security threat, how that gets--how it's possible to make a deal over that, and there are people who you know--by the way, Democrats and Republicans who think Huawei needs to effectively just be shut down completely. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Well again, I think when you say there are people who think it should be shut down. I think there are people on one side of the spectrum who would like them not to do business in the United States. I think that that's not saying they should be necessarily shut down in China. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. Let me ask you a separate question, and this is something that--that--that Brad Smith and I were also talking about, just--just earlier. What do you think the difference is between the relationship between Huawei and the Chinese government and the relationship between the U.S. government and U.S. business? And the reason-- </p><p>MNUCHIN: Very different. </p><p>SORKIN: But the reason I asked the question is because I--I think there's a view that the Chinese can ask Huawei to go use their systems to bug other people and do other things. But I also think there is a view, and we heard it actually to some degree from Brad, though I think he thinks there's more protections for him to say no. But clearly, the U.S. government is often asking U.S. businesses to help. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, you're--you're commenting on things that I obviously am--am not about to comment on because obviously I'm pretty to information and I can't comment on these things. I would just say categorically I think there is a giant difference between the two things that you're describing. </p><p>SORKIN: In terms--in terms of those relationships? </p><p>MNUCHIN: Absolutely. </p><p>SORKIN: Because one--can be a forced issue and the other-- </p><p>MNUCHIN: I mean--again, I don't want to go through all-- </p><p>SORKIN: Right. </p><p>MNUCHIN: All the details but I don't think it's fair to say in any way that the relationship in the United States between the government and private businesses-- </p><p>SORKIN: Right. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Is the same as the relationship between China and state-owned--state enterprise businesses. Now, where Huawei fits in, again, you know I'm not going to, specifically on that but you're talking about different relationships. </p><p>SORKIN: Related question, and I also asked Brad this, what do you think it means to be a patriotic company in America today? And the reason we're talking about this is there are so many American companies, especially in the Valley today who have historically done business with--with the U.S. government but have recently become--reticent and I don't know if that's a political. I don't know if you have a view that that's--that that's because they disagree with the administration. I don't know if you think it's a--an ethical or moral view but put that all sort of any frame in terms of how you think about it in terms of how business relates to the government right now. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, I--I think in the United States we support private enterprise and private rights, and there's a whole different level of spectrum in regard to how--how companies act. Obviously, companies have different constituencies, whether it's boards, or shareholders, or customers, and there's all different ways that companies can act with the government. And I would also say it depends on what industry you're in. There are certain industries where the businesses get a lot of benefits from the government, so clearly I don't think it should be a one-way street, but I think what you're touching on is--is a complicated issue, but I'd say, look, we do have--we believe in enterprise, and we believe in a capitalistic society. </p><p>SORKIN: Well let--let me--let me ask you then about that because the other related issue to this is that when you think a little bit about the way the government assigns contracts or doesn't to you-- the U.S. enter--U.S. enterprise there has been, and I'm going to give--give you an example of this, right now, there's a question about whether Amazon and AWS is going to continue to have this $10 billion Pentagon contract. And there's a view that politics are involved in that and that's why I'm trying--I'm sort of get it that--sort of central core of how you think those things come together. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, let me just say some of these issues are very complicated issues. </p><p>SORKIN: Right. </p><p>MNUCHIN: And I don't think in any way there as simple as political issues. Again, I can't comment on the specifics of the DOD contract. I can tell you that I--I am aware of and I been briefed on the issues of transferring to the cloud. </p><p>SORKIN: Right. </p><p>MNUCHIN: It is something that I've--I've spoken to many of the agencies, and we've looked at and I--I think the idea of using the cloud and using external vendors is something that's very important for the government. On the other hand, I think from the government standpoint, we do need to balance these risks, specifically in industries where there are very few providers of the services and what dependence the government ultimately has sense when we move these things these are our long-term relationships. Some of them have to do with issues of encryption and comply--complex issues, but I--I--I can assure you this is way beyond a--a--a political issue. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. </p><p>MNUCHIN: I think another complex issue on--on Amazon is you have one of the largest cloud providers attached to a giant retailer so, I mean one of the questions is, who knows what Amazon looks like 10 years down the road? Or are these--are they still attached or are they not attached? </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. Let me ask you that. We've had a conversation today about antitrust America, and right now, there's obviously a lot of attention on those big companies. When you look back--actually maybe the question is to look even at Microsoft. Do you think that it was an advantage, that it was the right thing for the U.S. government to ultimately go after Microsoft? Did that make the--the--the Silicon Valley more competitive? </p><p>MNUCHIN: I mean, to be honest with you, there's a lot of things I consider myself an expert on, that's not one of them, and I don't know enough of the facts to look back and-- </p><p>SORKIN: Right. </p><p>MNUCHIN: And have a view on that. </p><p>SORKIN: How do you look at then this crop? Apple, Amazon--I--I know they all hate being called big tech and being lobbed into one thing, but if you think about Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google together, right now. What are your-- </p><p>MNUCHIN: Again, I--I think it's easy to group all these technology companies because they are all big technology companies. I think they're all very different. I mean if you take Apple as an example. Apple is in a very competitive business with Samsung. </p><p>SORKIN: Right. </p><p>MNUCHIN: They're also in a competitive business with Huawei. So again, I think it's unfair to say , look, we should just look at the antitrust issues that all these companies have the same issues. They have very different issues. I have said, and again, this isn't in my domain, but I--I do think the Justice Department will look at some of these issues as it relates to some of these companies. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay, this is a hard one for you. Your boss--just because you mentioned Amazon. You are--your boss goes on Twitter and--and--and calls the leader of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. What do you think of that when you see that? I'm just curious. </p><p>MNUCHIN: The president going back to the campaign come up with some very creative names for people. So, I think people understand how he uses these names. </p><p>SORKIN: And--but in practice as part of this larger negotiation that's just going on every single day. Are you--do you--do you call him and say I really wish you hadn't said that? </p><p>MNUCHIN: There's lots of things on--on policies and everything else that I talked to the president about. I really don't get into these issues. </p><p>SORKIN: You--you--the name-calling. </p><p>MNUCHIN: I would call it name-calling. I would--again, but-- </p><p>SORKIN: Okay, I have a different one for but related. I don't know if you saw this earlier this week. Elliott Management, the activist firm decided they were going to go after AT&amp;T and the president put out a--a tweet saying great news an activist investor is now involved with AT&amp;T. Now, of course, he's very upset with CNN but as the Treasurer Secretary, as somebody who deals with business every day. How do you think about that? </p><p>MNUCHIN: I think it's always great if company's--if investors get more involved with companies. I think quite frankly one of the biggest problems we have is that boards are not active enough, that large shareholders are not active enough. We have obviously a huge amount of assets that are going into index funds. So, I think shareholders should be well represented. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay, so that's actually very interesting because there's a--there is a view, especially when it comes to this idea that people need to be long-term thinking, that actually activist shareholders have not been--have not helped that--that cause. </p><p>MNUCHIN: I--I think quite the opposite. I--I think many times I mean you know look, Warren Buffett. I mean, he's a very, very long-term holder. He--he's as much of an activist's as other people. </p><p>SORKIN: Why would you--why would you say Warren Buffett would be an activist in that way? </p><p>MNUCHIN: In the sense of he's focused on long-term values and a long-term creation. He's--he's a long-term holder. </p><p>SORKIN: But the view is that activist come in, make some trouble-- </p><p>MNUCHIN: And that your view. You're--you're categorizing how you referred to an activist. </p><p>SORKIN: So, how do you refer to an activist? </p><p>MNUCHIN: You're--you're using it in what I consider to be more of a derogatory term, as opposed to an activist could be an active investor. Obviously, private equity is definitely an active investor, so I mean private equity buys companies because they think they can run them better. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. I'm going to pivot the conversation. We actually, as you saw, had a big debate about taxes, just now. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Know, I actually found that quite interesting. </p><p>SORKIN: And it--and it was fascinating, but I--I do want to ask you about where we are--in this idea--one of the questions that was raised that I think you may have missed--was this idea that we need more revenue. Broadly speaking, we need more revenue. If you look at the deficit, as you very well know, it looks like it's now going to get to over $1 trillion for--for 2020, for the first time. And so, the question that I would ask you, especially given that there's even conversations about a tax cut and I want to understand what tax--what the 2.0 cut may look like. How do you raise more revenue right now? </p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, the--the--the way--the number one way you raise more revenue is through growth. So, I--I think when--when we look at you know debt and sustainability, we look at debt relative to J--GDP. I think that when the president came into office, the number one economic issue he was focused on was growing the economy, and for a long time we had very low growth. There were people who said we could never grow at high numbers again. We had wages that hadn't grown and--and we came with an economic plan and said look, you can't cut your weight of prosperity you have to grow your way and again, we've grown revenues. Now, I just want to comment on one thing. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Because people--you know when I've talked about the tax cuts paying for themselves or you look at the deficit and things like that, one of the things we did in the tax bill was we allowed for automatic expensing. So, obviously, that is the frontloading of investment and a back and in terms of revenues. We--we've actually grown tax receipts 3 percent, despite the fact that we allowed for a lot of expensing. So part of this is when you look at the deficit, you can't just look at it a moment in time, you look--you have to look at what are we going to do over a five or 10 year period to fix these issues? </p><p>SORKIN: Right. But you think it's--you think it's unfair to say that when--when--when you said initially when--when--when they're campaigning on--for the tax plan that it would pay for itself. </p><p>MNUCHIN: I still think it will, absolutely. The difference is 35 basis points of growth. </p><p>SORKIN: No, no, no. In terms of your expectations of where we would be today? </p><p>MNUCHIN: Absolutely. We're ahead of where we thought we would be today. I--I never said I thought it would pay for itself in year one. What I said is over a 10-year window, which is the way we analyze taxes it will pay for itself. And again, this is just math. If over this 10-year window we grow an extra 35 basis points a year it will pay for itself. </p><p>SORKIN: This is a longer conversation, and I know there's some--some--some tax experts in the room. I'll--I'll let them ask more on this, but I have a couple of quick other questions and then--and then we'll open it up. One, 50-year bond. Is it worth doing? </p><p>MNUCHIN: Yes. I think so. I mean you know and--and I talked about this. So again, this is something we looked at starting two years ago. I think it's--it's part of what we're looking at is we do have obviously a lot of debt at low-interest rates de-risking the government's position, so we're looking at potentially extending the portfolio and as part of that, one of the tools we'll look at, if there is proper demand we will issue fifty-year bonds. </p><p>SORKIN: A why not 100 years? </p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, we're going to start with 50 years and--and if the answer is 50 years are successful, we'll consider 100-year bonds. </p><p>SORKIN: Right. How worried are you about interest rates right now in this country and--and specifically what's happening in Europe and what it may ultimately mean here and then--then there for the power of the dollar and everything else? </p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, I think as you know in--in my role as Treasury Secretary-- </p><p>SORKIN: I know. </p><p>MNUCHIN: I'm not going to specifically comment on interest rates in the United States, but I will comment on interest rates in Europe. I think that low-interest rates are good for economic growth. I think negative interest rates, unclear whether they're good for economic growth. I think that negative interest rates are bad for banking business. It's hard to grow an economy without having a healthy banking business. It'd be interesting to see what happens in Europe. I--I don't know why--I mean, I think the other thing we're going to see is with the spread between were 10-year treasuries and 10-year German bonds. My expectations are you're going to see a big flow of funds. </p><p>SORKIN: Right. Maybe two or three others really quick and then we will open it up, I promise. First, we were talking about the business Roundtable and their proposal that--that came out two weeks ago, where it effectively--there's now a conversation about--about purpose over profits if you will. You're-- you're a former investor, what do you think of--of what's happening in corporate America today? A, is it real, and is it good? </p><p>MNUCHIN: I--I think it's--I think it's a complicated issue and I think a little bit like we were--they were--I heard talking about taxes. You know, when the VAT tax started in Europe, also it started as a very little tax, and people said oh, it's not going to really have much impact. </p><p>SORKIN: Right. </p><p>MNUCHIN: And every year they kept raising the VAT tax. I think the--the problem with this conversation is profits are what create and investments or what create jobs to be reinvested. And if you go down this road and say oh, we no longer care about profits. We only care about purpose. You're--you're not going to have a very vibrant business community . Now, that's different than saying I do think companies should be long-term oriented. </p><p>I don't think companies need to necessarily focus on quarterly profits and hitting street earnings numbers, but I think ultimately a business's job is to deploy the capital correctly and to make profits. </p><p>SORKIN: So, there was I think five holdouts that were members of the Business Roundtable. Stephen Swordsman (PH) from--from Blackstone was one of them. If you were a member of the Business Roundtable, do you think you would've signed it? </p><p>MNUCHIN: I wouldn't have. </p><p>SORKIN: You wouldn't have signed it? </p><p>MNUCHIN: No. </p><p>SORKIN: That's fascinating. And--and its--it's fundamentally because you disagree with the premise. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Again, I think it's not a--I wouldn't have signed it because I think it's not a simple answer. So, in--in other words, people on a lot of these issues want a one-sentence or two-sentence answer. So again, I don't think it's--obviously businesses should have a purpose. To be profitable, you have to have a purpose. I think it's not as simple as saying we either have a purpose or we have profits. I think the problem with creating these one--a simple answer is it--it--it doesn't fully explore the issues. So, I personally think companies need to both have a purpose and have profits. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. Let me ask you a different question then, I don't know if you saw the news today and I've been writing about this a lot in the paper recently, 145 CEOs in America wrote a letter to senators saying pass the bill on gun violence, both-- </p><p>MNUCHIN: Again, I will say I--I--again, I have a lot of expertise, gun laws are--are not my area of expertise. </p><p>SORKIN: But let me ask you this, though. You saw Walmart--just a couple weeks ago decide that they were no longer going to stock certain--certain types of products, ammunition and other things like that. Do you--there's a view--there's a view on one side that this is what business should be doing. They should be using their role to do what they think is good for their business and others who think that this is like part of a culture war and business should not be part of this conversation. And so, I'm sort of curious where--where you land on that, irrespective of the issue itself. </p><p>MNUCHIN: I think you're talking about two different things. So, one is you're talking about businesses writing to Congress about certain positions, which again, I think in general, people have the right to have their opinions. I think this is a complicated issue that Congress is looking at. </p><p>SORKIN: Right. </p><p>MNUCHIN: So again, I think it's--it's--it's up--again, it's--it's an issue that's a complicated issue that business is looking at. </p><p>SORKIN: But I'm going to throw one other piece at it--at you and it's just interesting to me because Citigroup, Bank of America, and some others last year, decided that they were not going to actually--they were trying to distance themselves effectively from gun manufacturers, and when they did that, they got a lot of atta (PH) boy's from some customers, and there were other customers who were upset but interesting this is where the political part of it becomes so--so unique. There were lawmakers in certain states that were even a member of the SCC who effectively went after some of these companies. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, again, you're talking--again, I'm just saying these are--these are complicated issues, but you're talking about banks that are regulated and have FDIC insurance. </p><p>SORKIN: Right. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Which is a benefit and again, I think as it relates to any discrimination of laws, it's not the role of banks to discriminate against any laws, so I think part of the push back specifically on banks again is part of a broader view, which is of all the sudden banks start picking we like these laws, we don't like those laws, you--you lead to discrimination. Slightly--slightly different issue. And again, banks have a different obligation because they take insurance from the government. </p><p>SORKIN: But you, by the way, work with banks right now in a--in a sort of post 9/11 world for money laundering purposes-- </p><p>MNUCHIN: Absolutely. </p><p>SORKIN: Human trafficking. You know, you--I've--I've argued you could use the banking system to look for suspicious buying patterns related to guns and that would actually be a very helpful thing. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, we do--we do a lot of things without commenting what we do. Obviously, our role of working with the banks and combating all different types of terrorist activities is something that we take great pride in. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. I want to open up. I have just one final, very quick question for you. You asked me a question about TV. So, I'll ask you a question about TV since you are a producer yourself as well and a much more successful one than I ever was. There's a whole new streaming war, that's coming as you know, between Apple with their plus service, and Disney plus service, and Amazon, and Netflix. Do you want to pick a winner? </p><p>MNUCHIN: You know I'm not allowed to pick a winner, but I will say--so I can't comment on that because that would be endorsing something, which I'm now better educated on, but I will say, look I think it's terrific there's this type of competition. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. We are going to leave it there, but I know there's so many people and there's microphones around the room, so and--and the Treasury Secretary's been kind enough to stay with us for another five or 10 minutes. We have a question there, and then I'll go to David Singer (SP). </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Secretary. I'm Vicki Aurora (SP) with Georgetown, and I'm pleased to hear you say that companies should be long-term oriented and as someone who works on climate change. I'm wondering what your philosophy is about how the government should be long-term oriented on this existential threat? </p><p>MNUCHIN: Well obviously you have a few because you've made a conclusion at the end of your question, so I--I assume you have a view on this. Again, I would put climate change is also a very, very complicated issue where you know the science is not clear on the different issues on different things. </p><p>Now, again, I would say--let me just give you an example, okay? You know, I drove an electric car when I was able to drive, and I loved my electric car, and I liked the idea of driving an electric car. Ultimately these electric cars and these batteries and everything else are going to create a lot of environmental issues. So, I--I only use this as just as an example of again, not my area of expertise so I can't comment on it. But I can tell you I do think the president and this administration, very much cares about clean air, clean water. </p><p>I do think U.S. companies have been very focused on cutting emissions, and I think one of the great things is the U.S. has an abundance of energy. I mean, liquid natural gas is a very, very clean, tremendous abundance of LNG. </p><p>SORKIN: Let me ask you, just a follow-up question, which relates to the automobile industry. In terms of some of the rollbacks that the administration was--is proposing on--on some of the automotive--automotive rules. Some of the carmakers think that the administration has gone too far. </p><p>MNUCHIN: I was kind of--I was kind of surprised to hear that the carmakers again, felt that way but again, not--not my area of expertise. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. It's a longer conversation. David Singer? </p><p>SINGER: Secretary, David singer. I'm the national security correspondent for the times. You've been very active in the Iran sanctions, and we have seen in recent days, the French issued a proposal for a $15 billion line of credit for Iran guaranteed by the oil. And we've seen the president seemingly open to thinking about a line of credit, so tell us with this undercut the sanctions as you are imagining them? Is it a relief on the maximum pressure campaign that you talk so much about? </p><p>MNUCHIN: Sure, so thank you. I think that's a good question. So, let me clarify some of these issues and--and let me first say, you know there's certain things I came into government. I knew a lot about there's certain things I didn't know anything about. Sanctions was one of the things and national security, a tremendous career staff at Treasury. You know I feel like I got a Ph.D. in my first 90 days and we're very proud of the fact that at treasury we've done more sanctions than have ever done--have ever been done before. And--and they are a very, very important national security tool. They absolutely work. </p><p>So first, let me just say as relates to Iran. The sanctions are working. There is no question that they're having an economic impact on Iran, and the only reason why they're contemplating changes, behavior, or conversation, or everything else is because of the economic issues. We have had--I've participated in direct discussions with President Trump and President Macron on these issues. </p><p>Secretary Pompeo and I work very actively together. The French understand clearly that they cannot give a line of credit without our consent that it would be a violation of the sanctions. So there is not a \"proposal\" from France right now to give the Iranians $15 billion. There are various different discussions going along the way. </p><p>I've seen some reporting recently, which is misinformation that I or other people want to loosen up on sanctions. Secretary Pompeo and I are executing the president's strategy of maximum pressure, and we think it's working. Simultaneously the president has said he's willing to sit down and have a conversation with no conditions. So that's--that's--that's our strategy. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. Let's sneak in-- </p><p>MNUCHIN: Did--did I answer your question clearly enough? </p><p>SORKIN: (OFF-MIC) I--I--I'm not sure whether we understand whether (INAUDIBLE) proposal in order to get those negotiations (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>MNUCHIN: Again, I'm not going to go into any confidential discussions, but let me just repeat, which is we are executing a maximum pressure campaign. That is what we're doing, and the French understand that they can't give a $15 billion line of credit without our consent. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. Why don't we go rapid fire because I know there's lots of hands over here? And then we'll get over to John O'Brien, as well. </p><p>QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, David Damschen, Utah State Treasurer. Thank you so much for joining us. There's roughly $26 billion in federal savings bonds that are matured and no longer accruing  interest. Senator Kennedy, as you may be aware, has dropped a bill that would allow information related to those monies be passed to state treasures. State treasures are very good at reuniting lost monies with the rightful owner. What are your feelings about Treasury assisting treasures in reuniting those lost monies with rightful owners, $26 billion? Thank you. </p><p>MNUCHIN: So, you know I--I just read this article's I was coming up. I think it was a political article on how I'm such a micromanager, which I take as a great compliment by the way, and my--looking at all the tax rags, but I can tell me being a micromanager I actually understand this issue extremely well. So part of the problem is a lot of these records are on very, very old microfiche--even if we have the records, so the problem we're trying to figure out is--I mean, first of all, we want to get the money back to the rightful holders. </p><p>We want to get them to the holders. How you go about doing that because the average amount of money that a person has is--is--is very--were talking about very, very small per person, although it's big in the aggregate. And a lot of time the cost of the government to figure out who actually has it is going to be more expensive than the person has. So I--I--I've had--I've had multiple meetings, I probably had a dozen meetings on this specific issue and us trying to figure out how we can work with the states, and I think we're starting a pilot program but I--I appreciate it, and we're working on it. </p><p>SORKIN: I think we have one more over here. By the way, real--the flipside of that, by the way, is the tax group wants to get more money. Obviously, just to get more money for--for the IRS. Would you--would you be in favor of the IRS having a much bigger budget? </p><p>MNUCHIN: I--I--I would. So, I mean, again, when I say a much bigger budget, we--we're advocating for more money for the IRS. One of the things we want more money for is--is technology modernization. I think as you know we have the largest database of personal information, particularly in this cybersecurity issue. I think that one, we need to make sure we protect it. And two, taxpayers deserve better online information. There's no reason why as a taxpayer people shouldn't have the same level of communication-- </p><p>SORKIN: But is it more about that or more about enforcement? </p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, again, if we have better technology, we can use the technology for enforcement and--and a lot of information is matched today so, yes, we--we're advocating for more money for the IRS. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. I know--I know the Treasurer may have to go on a moment-- going on. </p><p>MNUCHIN: I'll--I'll take a couple more questions and then we'll let you go. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. John O'Brien? </p><p>QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, first of all-- </p><p>MNUCHIN: Hey, John, and thank you for everything you're doing. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. </p><p>MNUCHIN: Terrific, thank you very much. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Thanks for your efforts around the Freedman's Bank. Thank you for your efforts around the qualified opportunity zones, which I think potentially--which is still in front of us. And thank you and (INAUDIBLE) for the efforts around CRA reform, which would hopefully direct billions of dollars into undeserved, still working on all of that. </p><p>With regard to repairing the latter of aspiration that was referred to by Abigail and others earlier. What would you think philosophically about providing tax relief and/or tax break? However, you want to structure it to the wealthy individuals or corporations who facilitate massive internships and massive apprenticeships for those who are not in the room. </p><p>I keep saying that you hang around nine broke people you'll be the 10th so, we've got to get folks who are brilliant and amazing but are connected back in from the streets into the suites, and I think internships and apprenticeships does that. But I think there needs to be an incentive to do it philosophically. I know it's not exactly your lane, but you have incredible influence in this whole dialogue and this discussion. Philosophically, is this something that you think might work? </p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, first of all, let me just say again. I appreciate the work you've done in these areas. I think apprenticeships are very important. I also think, and this is an area you know we've worked with you on financial literacy is also very important. So, some of these issues and Ivanka Trump has done a great job spearheading this out of the White House with--with many companies. Job training, apprenticeship--incentivizing companies to do this and cutting back regulations so that companies can do it effectively. Anything we can do to increase this area and yes, philosophically if we have to look at tax benefits that's something that we'd consider. </p><p>SORKIN: Okay. (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>QUESTION: Speaker--Secretary, people say terrible things about you online, you and your wife. Your boss, you know, is known for being uncivil to a lot of people. In term--both in terms generally of what set on Twitter and specifically about this administration's relationship with the press, which I think you know is toxic on both sides. The president has said the press is the enemy. The people--the press pursues him for what is basically an in--innocent misstatement about Alabama and our hurricane. Is there any way to put the genie back in the bottle or are we stuck with what we have right now? And--and how does it feel to be someone who is targeted this way? </p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, I can only talk for myself. I think I have good relationships with plenty of people in the process. That's why I'm here. </p><p>SORKIN: I appreciate you being here. </p><p>MNUCHIN: As it relates to online, you know I think one of the problems, and--and again, I don't have the answer, but you--you can go online you know for almost any person or any issue, and 50 percent of the things are broadly nice, and 50 percent of things are nasty. And again, not my areas of expertise, but you know as it relates to some of these companies are, they publishers? Should there be some level of responsibility for it? I--I don't know the answer, but you--you're touching on a lot of complicated issues, and you know online has taken a very, very important role, and in many ways, it's very good. </p><p>I mean I--I do think the fact that the president and other people can communicate as broadly as they can through an online channel is actually, I think a good thing. I mean there was a time where the press, you know, filtered everything.

Sources telling CNBC that American trade negotiations[5] will be heading to China either late this week or sometime next week for face-to-face talks\u2014though a final trade deal could still be months away. Joining us right now is U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and we're thrilled to have him here. Good morning to you. We want to get your take. Right now,- just we want to start off on sort of with what is going to happen in this next week and exactly what you think the timeline looks like. STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, good morning. It's great to be here with you. The timeline on the budget or the timeline on China? ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: I want to go to China first, given that markets this morning, both in China and the U.S. seem to be moving on this expectation that there's going to be a team, including Lighthizer and potentially yourself, headed there. STEVEN MNUCHIN: Right. So, Ambassador Lighthizer and I will depart on Monday. We will spend Tuesday and Wednesday in Shanghai. The reason why we're going to Shanghai is that the host country, China[6], has invited us there. There's a significance to them of the Shanghai communique and the symbolism, obviously, of that important agreement. So, hopefully I'll take that as good news that we'll be making progress next week. But I would say there's a lot of issues. So, my expectation is that this will be followed up with a meeting back in D.C. after this. And hopefully we will continue to progress. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Mr. Secretary, can you explain sort of where the White House is with Huawei at this point? Because that seems to be such a pivotal chess piece in these conversations. There are U.S. companies that clearly want to do business with Huawei. Huawei yesterday just announced that they're laying off 600 people in the United States and I wanted to get your thoughts on that. STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, I think, as you know, the President hosted a group of tech CEOs in the Oval Office. He also had Secretary Ross, myself, Ambassador Lighthizer, Director Kudlow[7]. We had a very good discussion. Part of the discussion was obviously on Huawei. Part of the discussion, actually, was on other important technology issues and immigration issues. But the Huawei issue is being driven out of Commerce. And what Commerce has said is that they will issue waivers for items that don't impact national security. So, where there are commodity products or issues that don't impact national security, Commerce will be proceeding with that. And I think it was a very productive two-way discussion for the President. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Related to that, and I think this has to do with national security, but also, corporations being patriotic. You probably saw the comments late last week from Peter Thiel saying that he thought that Google, that Alphabet was treasonous. And then President Trump said that he was going to look into those comments. There was a -- there's some people in - both Chinese officials and Chinese executives who, at least have said to me, how is that any different than what Huawei is relative to the U.S. -- to the Chinese government in terms of that relationship? STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, let me just say the President did look into that. as well as I. The CEO of Google is with us this week. We both had very direct discussions. They assured us that there is very, very limited work. The only work that they're doing is some minimal open source work. They continue to do work with us in certain areas of DOD. And I think, you, Google is an American company that wants to help out the U.S. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: So, Peter Thiel's comments were misguided? STEVEN MNUCHIN: I don't see any area -- again, the President and I did diligence on this issue and we're not aware of any areas where Google working with the Chinese government in a way that in any way raises concerns. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Okay. Let's pivot real quick to the debt ceiling[8] and the debt deal. I want to read you a comment, this is from FreedomWorks, about this deal that has all been struck. It says, 'Washington has all but abandoned economic sanity. With this deal GOP leadership has ceded the ground on fiscal responsibility for which years -- which for years was supposed to be the core tenet of the party.' What do you make of that critique? STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, first thing I'd say is that spending is an issue that has to be a bipartisan agreement. So, this can't be an issue of just what the President wants to do, what the Republicans want to do or what the Democrats wanted to do. It wasn't just because of the debt ceiling. I mean, we're very happy that we got a 2 1/2 year extension to the debt ceiling, including our special powers. But any spending required bipartisan agreement. So, the first issue is that the President was very determined to fund the military and make sure that we funded veterans. So, we held expenses to a modest 2% increase a year, which is in line with inflation. So, I think we were very careful on the spending issues. We think we'll grow revenues in excess of 4% over this period of time a year. And, you know, this had to be a bipartisan agreement. So, people who said we should have increased military and decreased nonmilitary, you know, one, we had to take care of our vets and two, we needed bipartisan support. That's a cost of losing the house. BECKY QUICK: Mr. Secretary, can we go back to what you were talking about with Google and both you and the President kind of looking into those claims? We had Ash Carter on the show last week, the former Defense Secretary. And he had said, when we asked about those same questions about whether Google was cooperating with the Chinese government in ways that could be considered treasonous, he kind of demurred from that but then focused on the idea that he's been disappointed with some of the companies in the Silicon Valley[9], the idea they have not wanted to do work for defense department, the idea that they've kind of caved to some of their employees with those feelings. He seems to be of the belief that if you're an American company you have benefited from the government and what this country has done for you and you should be willing to do work for the government in turn. Do you share those thoughts? STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, I do share those thoughts. But, you know, I would also balance that -- I want to be careful because a lot of companies cooperate with the Defense Department. Some of our most important critical technology companies. And, as I just mentioned, in my conversations with Google and we researched this, there are areas. They're cooperating. Having said that, private businesses do have the right to make decisions. They're owned by shareholders, they have boards that control them. But I do think it's important and I would say almost all the technology -- leading technology companies in the U.S. do cooperate with the government in very significant ways. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Mr. Secretary, related to technology, the Department of Justice said yesterday that they're going to look into some of the big tech companies that were at the White House yesterday, in fact, and consider the anti-trust issues that are involved. What's your take right now? Do you believe that these big companies, and I'm thinking of the Facebooks and the Googles and the Apples and the Amazons of the world, do you believe that they are -- that they're hurting competition? STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, let me just say I think it's good that the Attorney General[10] is going to look into this. I think it's an important issue and I look forward to him reporting back to the President and hearing his recommendations. I think, as you know, if you look at Amazon, although, you know, there are certain benefits to it, they have destroyed the retail industry across the United States. So, there's no question they have limited competition. There's areas where they have really hurt small businesses. So, I don't think this is a one size fits all. And I don't - you know, I don't have an opinion going in, other than I think it's absolutely right that the Attorney General is looking into these issues and I look forward to listening to his recommendations to the President. BECKY QUICK: Is Amazon's competition any different than what Walmart used to be a decade ago? STEVEN MNUCHIN: It is different. In a way, it's the same and in a way, it's different. I mean, people had the concerns about Walmart. I think, as you see, Walmart developed a business where small businesses could continue to keep -- compete with them. And look, Walmart ceded a lot of the retail business to Amazon. So, these are important issues I look forward to hearing from the Attorney General. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: How do you weigh the size and scale issue of some of the big U.S. companies versus when you think about how we compete internationally? One of the things that you hear out of Silicon Valley from the Silicon Valley executives is, they say, 'Look we're trying to compete aggressively with China, which you're going to negotiate as well on trade. And if we become smaller or hemmed in and have to limit ourselves, it's actually going to become harder to compete.' STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, I think that's a very important statement. And that's why I think there's not a one size that fits all approach. So, people talk about the FAANG stocks like they're all the same. Each company is very different. Apple competes head-to-head with Huawei[11], with Samsung, with other companies. So, I think there's no question, the size and scale of Apple is very important. They also have an ecosystem. So, you know, I don't think you can talk about competition amongst all of these companies in the same way. JOE KERNEN: Mr. Treasury Secretary, the President has overtly actually talked about a weaker dollar being in our best interests and in terms of -- on moves by Jay Powell and the Fed. And how he feels we're not on a level playing field with the rest of the world in terms of the Central Banks and accommodation. In the past, we have never had a Treasury Secretary do anything other than say we have a strong dollar policy and we advocate a strong dollar policy. So, you could be the first one in history to say we have a weak dollar policy. Is that in your view something that would benefit the United States if we could weaken the dollar for exports? STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, let me just comment that although Treasury Secretaries have always said that they believe in the strong dollar, Treasury Secretaries have also been particularly careful about commenting on the dollar. And, you know, I remember last year- JOE KERNEN: We did that to you in Davos. I know. I thought you forgot. STEVEN MNUCHIN: Davos -- my limited comments got misinterpreted, okay, all over the place. So, let me just clarify this. I think the dollar is the reserve currency of the world. It's in our interest, we want to maintain it. A stable dollar is very important. And over the long-term period of time, again, the long term, I do believe in a strong dollar which signifies a strong U.S. economy, a strong stock market and particularly because of the President's economic policies. We have growth in the U.S. that has outpaced everywhere else. We have a ton of money, as a result of tax cuts, regulatory relief coming in to the U.S. So, just as the stock market has gone up as a result of these policies, there's also -- these markets are the largest traded markets in the world. So, you know what I would say is that the dollar trades as much as anything in the world every day and there's buyers and sellers. And right now, there's a lot of people who want to invest in the U.S. and that creates a lot of demand for dollars. JOE KERNEN: Wow. That's a really nuanced answer that you give. So, you don't advocate a weak dollar policy near term, per se? STEVEN MNUCHIN: I am not going to advocate a weak dollar policy near term as the Treasury Secretary. JOE KERNEN: Although the President seems to be in some respects. STEVEN MNUCHIN: I think the President is very focused on a lot of issues. He is focused on our trade issues. He is focused on our economic issues. I think you know where he is on the Federal Reserve[12]. I don't need to make any comments on that. JOE KERNEN: Right. STEVEN MNUCHIN: But the President is very pleased with the economic performance. And, you know, the next election is really going to be an election about two different views. You know, our view is about growth, growing revenues, faster than expenses. Having free markets. Making sure the U.S. economy grows creating job opportunities. And the other view is very different. So, if you have concerns about, you know, our budget deal, you can imagine what a Democrat-controlled White House would look like. JOE KERNEN: Right. Well, it's hard to tell the difference, though. STEVEN MNUCHIN: --in terms of tax and spend. That's not fair at all-- JOE KERNEN: Some people - some people think it is. Well -- STEVEN MNUCHIN: We cut taxes - JOE KERNEN: -- definitely celebrating the deal that was -- in the second -- if there is a second term, we have heard rumor that maybe spending cuts are going to be something that the administration would focus on. Are you still going to be here for the next - STEVEN MNUCHIN: I'm definitely going to be here with the President for the second term and the President is determined on a bipartisan basis, we look at expense controls. So, whether it's something like Reagan did, you know, we're going to look at -- again we want to look at how we spend money on the military but we want to do it efficiently. So, we'll want to look at how we spend in the military. And, you know, as I said, our job is cut taxes, grow revenues faster than expenses, grow the economy. And that's what the President is doing. BECKY QUICK: Secretary Mnuchin, I know it's difficult, we keep asking you to explain the President's thought process with some of these things. Maybe you can, maybe you can't on this issue. But, if he's convinced this is a great economy, why does he also want the Fed to cut rates? STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, again, I want to be careful because these are the President's views. Because you know as Treasury Secretary I'm not going to comment on interest rates. BECKY QUICK:Right. STEVEN MNUCHIN: But the President believes that we have very low inflation. So I think when the fed - I think he believes when the Fed raised rates, they had much higher inflation expectations. And because we have had very low inflation that we should cut rates so they're more in line with the rest of the world. And, you know, again, when you look at interest rates in the United States, everybody will agree, you have to look at real interest rates. So, you know, the Fed has models. We have models. Sometimes these models turn out to be right. Sometimes they turn out to be wrong. And, again, without me commenting on what the fed is going to do, obviously, the market expects the Fed to cut. So, I -- if they do that, I think you'll see a continued improvement in the economy throughout the year. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Mr. Secretary, two other quick questions. Boeing announced their earnings this morning. There are still questions about when that 737 Max plane is going to get into the air. How concerned are you about the international reaction to Boeing[13] right now? STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, Boeing is a great American company. And they obviously -- they have a big Defense Department business. They have a big commercial business. There's no question\u2014this is very important to us. We compete, Boeing versus Airbus, every day. I think, as you know, the President has said he's concerned about the 737 Max. Quite frankly he thinks they should bring back the 757 and look at selling 757s. We want to absolutely make sure that before the 737 Max flies that it's safe. But I think there's no question, Boeing has the financial capacity to fix this. But I think we need to make sure they're fixed and we need to figure out how they continue to compete against Airbus. Because they are a leading U.S. company. JOE KERNEN: Secretary, would the fiscal restraint in the second term include entitlements? Which the President never talks about, I don't think, in terms of the unfunded liabilities which some people think -- I don't know, I hear $80 trillion, $100 trillion. Something eventually -- it's not a great subject to talk about in an election, I understand that. Medicare, things like that. But would that ever be on the President's plate, or would you put it there? Do you worry about entitlement -- not being able to deliver on all these promises? STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, I have not spoken to the President about this issue. We're really focused on the economic issues today. So, this is just my own personal thoughts and in no way, do I want to attribute them to the President. JOE KERNEN: You keep saying that a lot. STEVEN MNUCHIN: I think we need to make sure that we guarantee people who we had promises that we keep those promises. So, that's very important. But we have a $4 trillion expenses\u2014 discretionary is just part of it. There are many things in the nondiscretionary part of the budgets that we can look at without, in any way breaking promises to the people who rely on these: our seniors, veterans and other areas. And, again, this will need to be looked at on a bipartisan basis. You know, hopefully we'll take back the house but even with the house you need bipartisan support in the Senate to get these things done with 60 votes. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: And Mr. Secretary, we could not leave this interview without asking you at least a question about crypto. The last time we had you on, I think Joe tried to convince you about the merits of bitcoin. You talked about regulating or the need to regulate Libra. And the question I ultimately sort of land with is do you think that all cryptocurrencies will ultimately have to be regulated like -- I don't know, like a commodity or like a currency? Meaning that especially digital currencies like a bitcoin that don't actually have a central organizer will have to have the same kind of regulations and how that would happen? STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, all cryptocurrencies today in the United States are subject to regulation. They're subject to the Bank Secrecy Act, they're subject to our Money Laundering and they're subject to the same issues that physical. So, whether you're Moneygram or whether you're Western Union or whether you're trading bitcoin, you are subject to that. And I can tell you there was 100% agreement from the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, those rules we will enforce throughout the world. So, we will make sure that cryptocurrencies are not used for bad activities. I think, as I have said in the past, I am concerned that bitcoin is used for a lot of illicit activities[14]. We have a working group to combat that. And I'm concerned that consumers don't understand the speculative issue of these things. And as it relates to Libra, we have made very clear to Facebook that before they start this, this needs to be something that passes our regulations. And again, there was 100% support at the G7 on these issues. So, we support -- we like payment systems that reduce costs. But we don't support unregulated bad actors using anything - any type of currency or cryptocurrency. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: When you talk about the working group looking at bitcoin, what specifically are you looking at and what do you think the options are in terms of what you can do? STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, we're looking at all of the crypto assets. So, I mean, we talk about bitcoin just because it's the largest. But it has to be a level playing field. And this is a working group that includes all the regulators: the Fed, the OCC, the Consumer Protection Bureau, The S.E.C., the CFTC. So, we'll look at it, whether you're trading a derivative, whether you're trading cash, whether you're looking at it in a payment system. We're going to make sure we have a unified approach. And my guess is that there are going to be more regulations that come out from all of these agencies to make sure that we keep the U.S. financial system safe. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: You think we'll be talk about bitcoin in ten years from now? STEVEN MNUCHIN: I won't be talking about bitcoin in ten years. I can assure you that. JOE KERNEN: But you might be in at least six years as the Treasury Secretary[15], as you just said. STEVEN MNUCHIN: Exactly. I would bet even in five or six years I'm no longer talking about bitcoin as Treasury Secretary. I'll have other priorities. JOE KERNEN: You'll be loaded up on bitcoin. And a gazillionaire. STEVEN MNUCHIN: I can assure you, I will personally not be loaded up on bitcoin. JOE KERNEN: Never say never. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: It sounds like the Secretary is not convinced about bitcoin. Mr. Secretary, we appreciate you taking the time to speak with us this morning. We hope to see you very soon. STEVEN MNUCHIN: Thank you. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Thank you.

But this seemingly narrow intellectual question is increasingly becoming a central matter of urgent concern in the context of Indian democracy - and, indeed, democracy and the free flow of information around the world. Foreign governments are moving to impose new responsibilities on dominant tech firms. Australia, for instance, is forcing Facebook and Google to pay news companies for displaying their stories; French antitrust officials have ordered Google to negotiate with local media firms to pay for displaying their content; and in the United States, a fierce political war rages on between liberals and conservatives on this very issue.</p><p>Let's go back to that philosophical question for a moment, though. Publishers have always held a vaunted position in society. Traditional media formats - daily newspapers, broadcast television networks and radio stations - once consumed the public's attention. My grandfather would comb through newspapers and news magazines every day, while my grandmother listened to the radio all day, every day - not uncommon for those of their generation. The result was that we came to know not only the voices and faces that graced these outlets, but the publishing houses and media personalities behind the businesses. This intense aura about the media ecosystem - a world that could make someone famous - gave news organisations great power. They had the power to convey the news - and with that power, came great responsibility.</p><p>As with any line of business, news organisations cannot be expected to necessarily and voluntarily demonstrate that responsibility - by, for instance, not spreading political falsehoods, hateful messaging, and other vitriol. To put it differently: Absent meaningful regulation, businesses operating in a free market economy, including media outlets, will do whatever they wish to maximise shareholder returns. Profit displaces social considerations.</p><p>So to ensure they would act responsibly, the government created a policy framework.</p><p>In India, the contours of media regulation have become sophisticatedly diverse, with laws such as the Press Council Act, 1978, the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954, the Newspaper (Price and Page) Act, 1956, and the Cinematograph Act, 1952.</p><p>To quote from an example, the last of these - a reform of the Indian film industry enacted 70 years ago - notes that a \"film shall not be certified for public exhibition if, in the opinion of the authority competent to grant the certificate, the film or any part of it is against the interests of 1 (the sovereignty and integrity of India) the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or involves defamation or contempt of court or is likely to incite the commission of any offence.\" Without the law, the government couldn't be sure that an intrepid director might just slip offending content into mass-market films every now and then.</p><p>Some might argue that Facebook and Google should be treated like publishers, too; they now dominate the media sector in India and often facilitate the dissemination of offending content. They have, until now, been regarded as open platforms, which allow any and all speech (different kinds of views/all shades of opinion)but can remove whatever they wish - a conceptualisation originally stemming from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 US law that simultaneously affirms that Internet companies won't \"be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information\" and won't \"be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material\". The idea was simple: Let the Internet grow and develop its own commercial standards as necessary.</p><p>Here is the problem. This benevolent regulatory framework has enabled Facebook to claim it acts as a publisher and reap the censorship rights thereof, but turn around and also claim it is an undiscerning platform to reap the benefits of free speech leniency. A more just regime might, instead of giving the firm a free pass on both ends, hold its feet to the fire on both counts. There can be no doubt the company acts as some novel form of entity in between; even the company's lawyers have suggested that the company possesses a \"quintessential publisher function\" over the \"protected\" practice of determining \"what to publish and the decision of what not to publish\" - while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also contended the company \"should err on the side of greater expression.\"</p><p>So, if it is true that Internet firms have editorial power - and it is, so long as they decide what specific news stories, search results, and social media posts to show us among the billions of possibilities - then let us treat them as such. The responsibility must now lie with the national government to do right by its citizens- many of whom have been targeted, misled, and pilloried, which has been enabled by Internet platforms. The time has come for the imposition of decency in exchange for continued participation in the Indian consumer market.</p><p>Dipayan Ghosh is co-director of the Digital Platforms &amp; Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School</p><p>The views expressed are personal</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

But this seemingly narrow intellectual question is increasingly becoming a central matter of great concern in the context of Indian democracy - and, indeed, democracy and the free flow of information around the world. Foreign governments are moving to impose new responsibilities on dominant tech firms. Australia, for instance, is forcing Facebook and Google to pay news companies for their content; French antitrust officials have ordered Google to negotiate with local media firms to pay for displaying their content; and in the United States, a fierce political war rages on between liberals and conservatives on this issue.</p><p>Let's go back to that philosophical question for a moment, though. Publishers have always held a vaunted position in society. Traditional media formats - daily newspapers, broadcast television networks and radio stations - once consumed the public's attention. My grandfather would comb through newspapers and news magazines every day, while my grandmother listened to the radio all day, every day - not uncommon for those of their generation. The result was that we came to know not only the voices and faces that graced these outlets, but the publishing houses and media personalities behind the businesses. This intense aura about the media ecosystem - a world that could make someone famous - gave news organisations great power. They had the power to convey the news, and with that power, came great responsibility.</p><p>As with any line of business, news organisations cannot be expected to necessarily and voluntarily exhibit that responsibility - by, for instance, not spreading political falsehoods, hateful messaging, and other vitriol. To put it differently: Absent meaningful regulation, businesses operating in a free market economy, including media outlets, will do whatever they wish to maximise shareholder returns. Profit comes before any other consideration.</p><p>But to ensure they were responsible, a policy framework was created.</p><p>In India, the contours of media regulation have become sophisticatedly diverse, with laws such as the Press Council Act, 1978, the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954, the Newspaper (Price and Page) Act, 1956, and the Cinematograph Act, 1952.</p><p>To quote from an example, the last of these - a reform of the Indian film industry enacted in 1952 - notes that a \"film shall not be certified for public exhibition if, in the opinion of the authority competent to grant the certificate, the film or any part of it is against the interests of 1 (the sovereignty and integrity of India) the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or involves defamation or contempt of court or is likely to incite the commission of any offence.\" Without the law, the government couldn't be sure that an intrepid director might just slip offending content into mass-market films every now and then.</p><p>Some might argue that Facebook and Google should be treated like publishers, too; they now dominate the media sector in India and often facilitate the dissemination of offending content. They have, until now, been regarded as open platforms, which allow any and all speech (different kinds of views/all shades of opinion) but can remove whatever they wish - a conceptualisation originally stemming from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 US law that simultaneously affirms that Internet companies won't \"be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information\" and won't \"be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material\". The idea was simple: Let the Internet grow and develop its own commercial standards as necessary.</p><p>Here is the problem. This benevolent regulatory framework has enabled Facebook to claim it acts as a publisher and reap the censorship rights thereof, but turn around and also claim it is an undiscerning platform to reap the benefits of free speech leniency. A more just regime might, instead of giving the firm a free pass on both ends, hold its feet to the fire on both counts. There can be no doubt that it is somewhere in between; even the company's lawyers have suggested that the company possesses a \"quintessential publisher function\" over the \"protected\" practice of determining \"what to publish and the decision of what not to publish\".</p><p>So, if it is true that Internet firms have editorial power - and it is, so long as they decide what specific news stories, search results, and social media posts to show us among the billions of possibilities - then let us treat them as such. The responsibility must now lie with the national government to do right by its citizens - many of whom have been targeted, misled, and pilloried, enabled by Internet platforms. The time has come for the imposition of decency in exchange for continued participation in the Indian consumer market.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Lucknow.

The report\u2019s main purpose is to ensure wide sharing and availability of data in society. To ensure that companies share the required data, it was found necessary to develop strong conceptual and legal basis for data-sharing requirements and obligations.   To understand why data sharing is needed, and its importance to a strong and fair digital economy, we must first recognise the infrastructural nature of data. Industrial age infrastructure \u2014 roads, electricity, etc. \u2014 were often publicly owned. Even if there was some private role, these were run as closely regulated public utilities. The idea was to ensure widespread availability of such infrastructural elements to all, and avoid wasteful duplications. Society\u2019s data have a similar nature for a digital economy.  Digital vertical integration  The digital age came with useful digital services that everyone lapped up. Many of these services were free or highly subsidised. The infrastructure versus over-the-top services distinction may initially have not been too significant. But that difference becomes important as digital corporations begin to dominate all sectors, including important ones such as education and health.  That very few corporations have vertically integrated all the digital components involved in delivery of any digital service is the reason for their becoming such huge global monopolies. Seven out of the top 10 companies globally today have a data-centric model. Such unsustainable concentration of digital power has a significant geopolitical dimension, with complete domination globally of U.S. and Chinese companies. At the national level its deleterious effect is of exploitation of consumers and small economic actors, and of strangulating competition and innovation. There are calls worldwide to break up Big Tech; to moderate their monopoly power. Their monopoly is best addressed by separating the infrastructural elements of digital service provision from the business of digital service delivery. There are two key infrastructural components of a digital economy: data and cloud computing. The Gopalakrishnan report and this article focus on the infrastructural element of data.  Infrastructures are to be equitably provided for all businesses. Data have similar characteristics. But today, dominant digital corporations are building exclusive control over any sector\u2019s data as their key business advantage. Start-ups try to ape the same mode. What is needed, however, is to treat data as infrastructure, or \u2018commons\u2019, so that data are widely available for all businesses. The digital businesses then shift their key business advantage from exclusive access to data to employing available data for devising digital services for consumers\u2019 benefit.  Reducing digital dependence  The Gopalakrishnan committee takes such an infrastructural view of data. Data collected from various communities are considered to be \u2018owned\u2019 by the relevant community. Such \u2018community ownership\u2019 means that the data should be shared back with all those who need it in society, whether to develop domestic digital businesses or for producing important digital public goods. With a robust domestic data/AI industry, dependence on U.S. and Chinese companies will reduce.   It is for these purposes that the Gopalakrishnan committee proposes the concept of \u2018community data\u2019. Only the data collected from non-privately owned sources, from society or community sources, have to be shared when requested for. Data from privately owned sources remain private. Since a community requires a legally recognisable body to articulate its data ownership claim, the committee introduces the concept of community trustees that could be various bodies representative of the community.  Data collectors are considered as data custodians that will use and secure data as per the best interests of the community concerned. Data trusts are data infrastructures that will enable data sharing, sector-wise, or across sectors, and which can be run by various kinds of third-party bodies. The committee recommends a new legislation, because ensuring and enforcing data sharing will require sufficient legal backing. A Non-Personal Data Authority is also envisaged to enable and regulate all the envisaged data-sharing activities.  India is the first country to come up with a comprehensive framework in this area. Starting early in this important digital policy and governance area may just provide a formidable first mover advantage for India to acquire its rightful place in the digital world.

It was found to have shared the private data of 50m users with Cambridge Analytica, which used this information to target potential voters in the US election and in the Brexit referendum.</p><p>The implication is clear: if it weren't for the manipulation enabled by Facebook, Donald Trump might not be US president and the UK might still be a grumpy member of the EU.</p><p>Facebook stock was cut down to size as traders factored in tighter regulation and the strangulation of Facebook's lucrative advertising model.</p><p>This came amid Trump's announcement that he was starting a trade war with China - something likely to affect the technology sector.</p><p>Then there was more politics, as Trump took to Twitter to vent his anger at Amazon.</p><p>Amazon is owned by Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, the poster child of liberal critique of Trump.</p><p>Trump tweeted: &amp; Unlike others, they [Amazon] pay little or no taxes to state &amp; local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the US), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!&amp; When it was pointed out that Amazon was, in fact, responsible for the postal service's best revenue stream, parcel post, Trump tweeted: &amp; Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon.

I'm Matt Weinberger, deputy tech editor out of our San Francisco bureau, filling in for Alexei Oreskovic while he's on vacation. If you want to get Trending in your inbox every Wednesday, just click here.[1] The clock goes tick-tock for TikTok Hello, and welcome to Trending, the Business Insider tech newsletter. As you may have already noticed, I'm not Alexei Oreskovic, your usual host \u2014 I'm Matt Weinberger, deputy tech editor out of our San Francisco bureau, filling in for Alexei while he takes some well-deserved time off.In my day job, I oversee our enterprise tech coverage, which encompasses cloud computing, artificial intelligence, open source software, and productivity (shameless plug: you can read all about it on Hyperscale[2], my enterprise tech newsletter, which publishes via LinkedIn on Fridays).So imagine my surprise when Microsoft \u2014 the single largest company in the enterprise sector \u2014 suddenly and unexpectedly found itself inserted into the saga of Chinese-owned TikTok[3], the hottest consumer app in who knows how many years. </p><p>As you've probably heard by now, Microsoft is in talks to buy up TikTok[4], or at least its American operations, in a deal likely to be worth many billions of dollars.Microsoft has said that it expects those talks to be completed, one way or the other, by September 15th. President Donald Trump has upped the pressure by saying that he intends to ban TikTok in the United States entirely if the app isn't owned by an American company by that date (and that the US should get a cut of the sale, which is generally not how that works).[5] A brief Q&amp;#38;A on Microsoft/TikTok I won't pretend to be an expert in international trade or China relations, but I am pretty familiar with Microsoft and how it operates. While nothing is set in stone and another buyer could swoop in, Microsoft seems like the most likely buyer, not least because it has the cash to spareand because it's so far avoided the worst of the antitrust scrutiny that rivals like Google and Facebook now find themselves under.Therefore, I've taken the liberty of throwing together a quick FAQ on what Microsoft might be thinking:Q:This is a weird deal, right?A:On the face of it, it's super weird. But, if you dig a little bit deeper \u2014 well, it's still super weird, but starts to make a little bit more sense.Q:Isn't Microsoft all about cloud computing and Microsoft Teams and all that kind of thing these days?A:Sure is. Under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has seen a tremendous bull run, thanks almost entirely to its focus on products like the Azure cloud platform and Office 365 productivity suite. In fact, Microsoft recently shuttered most of the Microsoft retail stores and the Mixer live-streaming service, a rival to Amazon's Twitch, in a move to make sure the company stayed on target[6]. The Xbox game console is Microsoft's last major consumer brand.Q:So where does TikTok fit into that master plan?A: Honestly, it probably doesn't.Q:Wait, but...A: The best and most educated guesses hold that Microsoft sees TikTok as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to win over an entire generation of fans[7]. With an estimated 100 million mostly-younger daily active users, TikTok has a built-in audience, and the pressure from the White House to sell is expected to give Microsoft an edge in negotiations. Plus, it could be Microsoft's chance to wind the clock back and get another chance to take on Facebook and Google in online advertising[8]. Otherwise, we'll have to wait and see.Q: So will it work?A:Great question. Nadella has largely earned the benefit of the doubt \u2014 his signature acquisitions of LinkedIn, GitHub, and \"Minecraft\" maker Mojang have all been very successful, and established a trend towards allowing big-money acquisitions to retain a level of independence previously thought unthinkable in the industry. But on the other hand...I already mentioned that Microsoft just shut down Mixer[9], right?Q: Last question: Doesn't it set a bizarre precedent for Silicon Valley in particular and American capitalism as a whole for a sitting president to get so involved in the affairs of a private company like Microsoft?A: Great question! You're very good at asking smart questions. Keep it up. But it looks like we've run a bit long, so let's put a pin in this for now. But feel free to keep asking those sharp, sharp questions! So how did the Big Tech hearing go? The sudden news of a potential Microsoft and TikTok tie-up was only the capstone on a week that was already incredibly busy.On Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai all testified before Congress[10] on allegations of anticompetitive behavior. As expected, there was plenty of grandstanding, but there was also some substance there. As Business Insider's Linette Lopez writes[11], the execs were forced to testify under oath about allegations about Amazon's use of third-party seller data, or Facebook's history of spying on the competition.More interesting than the hearing, however, were the internal emails released by the House Judiciary Committee as part of its investigation. With the release of documents, we got a rare insight into how these tech giants do business: Everything from an email from Jeff Bezos on the $1 billion purchase of smart doorbell company Ring[12], to a missive from late Apple cofounder Steve Jobs recommending the company \"cut off\" a developer[13].As Business Insider's Becky Peterson reports[14], the big takeaway is that in several cases, these mega-companies bought up startups not because they wanted their technology \u2014 which they often seemed to find lacking \u2014 but because they wanted to buy their way into a market.Either way, the real capstone on the hearing came a day letter, when all four of those companies simultaneously announced their quarterly earnings on Thursday. The big earnings bonanza Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook all blew away their earnings reports late last week[15], with the stocks surging in after-hours trading.It wasn't entirely a clean victory for all of them, however: Amazon reported a slight miss on Amazon Web Services cloud revenue, booking $10.81 billion in sales for the quarter, versus the $11.01 billion Wall Street was looking for, demonstrating slower growth than expected. Google parent company Alphabet, meanwhile, showed its first quarterly decline in revenues for the first time ever since it went public.None of this is especially surprising, given the increased reliance on services from all four companies in a stay-at-home, work-remotely kind of world[16]. But it's a funny sort of synchronicity that all four were able to take such a victory lap just a day after being raked over the coals by lawmakers over their size and influence. Congress may be able to shame you, but it's Wall Street that pays you. Lightning round Well, that's enough out of me. Before I give up this virtual podium and turn it back over to Alexei, here are a few various other recent highlights from the Business Insider tech team: Apple will start making its own chips to enable iPhone apps to run on future Mac computers. But developers say pulling that off may not be so easy.[17]The president of cybersecurity giant RSA explains how its $2.1 billion breakup deal with Dell will return it to its 'scrappy' startup days: 'How often do you get to do that as a 38-year-old company?'[18]Radish wants you to binge-read romance novels, and now it has a fresh $63.2 million to pay its soap opera writers to get you hooked[19]Sheila Bair oversaw nearly 400 bank closures during the last financial crisis.

The need for scale, specialisation and choice could push wealth management providers to converge around four distinctive models, according to a recent Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report.    The Global Wealth Report 2020, published last month, says these models are large-scale consolidation, niche plays, retail bank and asset manager expansion and the entrance of big tech.     With large-scale consolidation, the largest wealth management providers \u201cmay see their market share double over the next 20 years. Their scale advantage and balance sheet strength will allow them to service the whole value chain, cementing their role as a single gateway to meet even the most complex client needs\u201d, says the report.    The head of private banking at a global institution cites the following example in the report. \u201cWe will see a separation between larger organisations that can deliver multi-jurisdictional, multi-capability and multi-time-zone service and niche players that can charge a premium for specialised expertise. The middle will get squeezed out.\u201d    The industry will also see more niche plays. \u201cAlthough there will be fewer boutique wealth management firms overall, a cadre of focused specialists will remain,\u201d says the report.    \u201cThese firms will serve clients whose needs are highly complex, such as the high-net-worth (HNW) and ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) sub-segments that require unique types of support, ranging from providing aircraft and yacht management to setting up legacy trusts and educating family members on how to minimise intergenerational conflicts.\u201d    The report points out that the other surviving boutique wealth management providers will offer sophisticated investment angles such as exclusive access to unique deal flows, closed private market opportunities and impact investing. Although these providers will embrace digitisation when providing services, their models will lean more heavily on intensive human interactions, superior relationship management skills and specialised advice.    With the large and growing affluent and HNW segments in mind, retail banks and asset managers will use technology and hybrid models to \u201caggressively undercut traditional wealth management providers and offer simple but appealing investment solutions across their existing client base\u201d, says the report.    \u201cThese offerings will be especially attractive to clients in markets with few established wealth management providers. Asset managers will leverage their superior investment capabilities to win new clients through direct channels.\u201d    Large technology companies are expected to expand their services to the wealthy. Companies such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft have the existing infrastructure backbone and cloud environment needed to support many new wealth-tech players.    Some technology companies, like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Amazon.com Inc, are currently offering a range of financial products and services themselves. In time, the scale of these companies will allow them to move up the stack and provide wealth management services to affluent individuals and those in the lower HNW segment.    These shifts have already been seen in China with several large incumbent wealth management players, says the report. Similar changes are expected in the US due to the size of the market, an active investment clientele and multiple digital channels. \u201cIn these markets, big tech players could make significant inroads over the next two decades and pose a serious threat to unsuccessful wealth management providers,\u201d it adds.    \u201cIn Europe, fragmented markets and the variety of languages, cultures and regulations could slow big tech\u2019s move into wealth management, but they are unlikely to stop it. As big tech players overcome learning-curve issues, they could become not just regional powerhouses but global ones.\u201d    Changing demographics    According to the report, the major shifts among wealth management providers are mainly driven by a changing clientele demographic. In the years ahead, women are expected to grow their wealth faster than men, growth markets will outstrip mature markets in their rate of wealth accumulation and rising economic attainment will put more wealth in more hands globally.    \u201cMacroeconomic data suggests that Asia ex-Japan will continue to see rapid rates of wealth growth. BCG modelling suggests that wealth in the region will grow at between 5.1% and 7.4% annually over the next five years. Should that forecast hold, Asia will overtake Western Europe as the second wealthiest region in the world by 2022,\u201d says the report.    The authors of the report predict that the affluent segment globally will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.7% to 4.6% from 2019 to 2024. The HNW segment will grow at a CAGR of 0.2% to 4.7% while the UHNW segment will grow at a CAGR of 1.4% to 5.8% over the same period.    The HNW and UHNW segments will remain the fastest-growing in North America while the affluent will be the fastest-growing segment in Asia, Western Europe and the Middle East. Collectively, these trends point to a larger pool of potential clients for wealth management providers to serve over the next five years, says the report.    \u201cGenerations X, Y and Z will also be more educated and economically empowered than previous generations. Members of these younger cohorts will live in a dynamic and fast-paced global environment with increased economic and geopolitical volatility. Theirs will be an always-on world characterised by increasing grey areas between information sharing and information privacy.     \u201cFor these younger generations, wealth won\u2019t just be about money. It will also be about meaning, purpose, connection and making a positive difference in the world. This orientation will create a very different future for wealth management providers.\u201d    Growing number of wealthy elites    Greater economic attainment has increased the number of the world\u2019s wealthy. The number of global millionaires (in US dollars) has nearly tripled in the past 20 years, from 8.9 million in 1999 to more than 24 million by end-2019, says the report.    Collectively, millionaires now hold more than 50% of the total financial wealth globally (not taking into account inflation effects). North America continues to have the largest number of millionaires at 16.4 million \u2014 more than half of whom became millionaires in the 21st century.     \u201cNorth America is also home to the greatest concentration of HNW individuals. This segment now accounts for 59% of the wealth in North America at US$59 trillion,\u201d says the report.     Asset allocations have contributed to different rates of wealth growth across segments over the past 10 years, it says. The HNW and UHNW segments have prospered the most because their portfolios comprised a much higher share of equities than other wealth bands. On average, more than 50% of their portfolios were invested in equities and investment fund shares. Thus, they were well positioned to reap the gains from the recent long bull market. Both segments include individuals with a total financial wealth of more than US$100 million.    \u201cBy contrast, the retail segment (individuals with investments of less than US$250,000) on average only have about 9% of their assets in equities and investment funds, with more than 80% going into cash and deposits, life insurance and pensions. That low rate of investment has translated into lower rates of wealth growth for this segment,\u201d says the report.                    3   AHealth, AncomLB, AsiaPly, Asia Media, Bursa, CNI, Compugt,

Here are some trends worth following.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Turning entrepreneurs into job-builders: Even as other economic indicators rebound, the unemployment rate seems stuck around 8.5 percent nationally and 7 percent in Wisconsin. Then again, the definition of \"back to work\" is changing. More people are employing themselves as they pursue startup ventures launched when their 9-to-5 careers faded.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some reports show Wisconsin is slowly escaping the bottom tier of states when it comes to creating new businesses, thanks in part to organized mentors, angel investors, small-business incubators and entrepreneurial networks.</p><p>Connecting Wisconsin with venture capital: A bill creating a state-leveraged venture capital fund likely will surface in the state Capitol in January as key members of the Senate and Assembly appear near agreement on major provisions.</p><p>Such a bill would make the state a limited partner in a \"fund-of-funds\" that would help turn promising young companies into larger firms. About 30 states have adopted similar strategies over time. Success for startups won't happen overnight, however, so let's hope the state is a patient investor.</p><p>Building a next generation natural resource economy: Striking a balance between creating jobs and protecting the environment will pose challenges for policymakers. State lawmakers will consider expediting a proposed iron mine in Iron and Ashland counties, where a need for jobs is countered by concerns for water quality. Another emerging industry is mining to produce sand needed to extract natural gas and oil through hydraulic fracturing of deep shale formations. Again, the main issue is protecting groundwater - not only in the sand mines, but in gas drilling sites around the country.</p><p>Wisconsin can attract and retain businesses with its clean and abundant supplies of water - something not every state or region can claim. The Public Service Commission will continue to pursue innovative water pricing strategies, including rates that promote efficient water use and economic growth. The PSC also hopes to work with utilities on water-metering technologies that can help evaluate demand patterns and trends. Wisconsin is a hub for water technology solutions through emerging companies, academic research and smart regulations. Let's use that combination to our advantage.</p><p>Encouraging trade and foreign direct investment: Wisconsin has benefited from a booming export economy, especially when it comes to high-quality manufactured products, medical technologies and food products. When the 2011 figures come in, don't be surprised if Wisconsin shatters the 2010 record of $19.8 billion in total exports. Also vital is foreign direct investment, which is globalizing Wisconsin's economy in ways that create jobs, expand supply chains, open the doors to new markets and provide needed investment dollars.</p><p>Wisconsin cannot possibly consume or sell everything it produces at home or even nationally. That's why exports and foreign investment are two sides of the same coin. They represent Wisconsin's ability to build, produce and grow what the world needs - and to attract investment from markets that understand the state's strengths.</p><p>Educating tomorrow's workers now: Most colleges and universities in Wisconsin continue to see enrollment surges as people realize education often is the pathway to \"knowledge economy\" jobs. The trick is starting the education process earlier, which explains public and private efforts to encourage more middle and high school students to take science, technology, engineering and math courses. Some states have committed to STEM education in significant ways; Wisconsin should do the same if it wants to counter a coming demographic crunch as the baby-boom generation retires and there are shortages of skilled workers.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, expect higher education to examine how efficiently it moves technology from the laboratory to the marketplace. Some states are taking the speed bumps out of their technology transfer processes. Wisconsin can do the same.</p><p>Making technology work for people: If 2011 was the year Wall Street and Big Banking heard from the man and woman on the street, perhaps 2012 will be the year Big Tech gets an earful.</p><p>Privacy concerns continue to dog Facebook. Proposed \"piracy\" legislation may threaten the Internet. Attempts to ban all cellphone use by drivers are possible, given the National Transportation Safety Board's recent recommendation. The Obama administration must decide if it really wants to extend broadband coverage - or simply block mergers.</p><p>And Amazon.com appears intent on turning brick-and-mortar retailers into showrooms via consumers armed with price-check apps and Amazon discounts for doing the company's research.</p><p>The good news: There's a fresh new year in which to sort it all out.</p><p>Tom Still is president of the Wisconsin Technology Council and former associate editor of the Wisconsin State Journal.

Rousseau, Hobbes, Spinoza, Kant, Mill et Marx ont \u00e9labor\u00e9 des points de vue sur la politique et l'\u00e9thique qui ont travers\u00e9 les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations. Ces philosophes avaient des opinions extr\u00eamement diff\u00e9rentes, mais aucun n'\u00e9tait motiv\u00e9 par le profit et les recettes trimestrielles. Ils se pr\u00e9occupaient uniquement de proposer des id\u00e9es sur l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, la libert\u00e9, la -solidarit\u00e9 et la possibilit\u00e9 d'une vie meilleure pour tous.</p><p>D\u00e9sormais, ce sont les manifestes des Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, Jobs et Brin qui orientent le d\u00e9veloppement des institutions et de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Plus encore, c'est leur technologie elle-m\u00eame qui fa\u00e7onne notre monde. Nous avons \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 identifier les externalit\u00e9s n\u00e9gatives \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle globale, ainsi que les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes sociaux et moraux d'un monde dans lequel des milliards d'individus utilisent leurs appareils connect\u00e9s plusieurs heures par jour. La situation n'est pas tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente de la lente destruction de nos \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes mondiaux. C'est rien de moins qu'une trag\u00e9die des communs num\u00e9riques et une d\u00e9composition du tissu de nos mondes sociaux. Les penseurs Lessig, Zuboff, Rushkoff, Morozov, Harari et beaucoup d'autres ont point\u00e9 les inqui\u00e9tudes que font na\u00eetre les mod\u00e8les commerciaux extractifs, le capitalisme de surveillance et l'exploitation fond\u00e9e sur les donn\u00e9es.</p><p>Hormis ce contexte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9vident, la technologie a un impact insidieux sur l'univers de notre vie connect\u00e9e : la prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 du mal. Comme il se pr\u00e9sente aujourd'hui, le monde en ligne sape la morale telle qu'elle s'est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e au cours du temps. C'est le point le plus probl\u00e9matique, car toute une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration mondiale est en train de grandir en -ligne. Or, ce monde encourage la propagation de la radicalisation, du terrorisme, des \" fake news \", de la misogynie, des discours de haine, du racisme, du harc\u00e8lement, de l'usurpation d'identit\u00e9, de l'intimidation en ligne, de la pornographie infantile et des abus sexuels sur enfants, etc.</p><p>Les cons\u00e9quences r\u00e9elles de nos actes</p><p>Le monde en ligne contribue \u00e0 faire oublier les principes moraux qui dictent notre comportement, \u00e0 masquer les cons\u00e9quences r\u00e9elles de nos actes sur des personnes r\u00e9elles du monde r\u00e9el, \u00e0 encourager chacun \u00e0 se construire une r\u00e9putation en repoussant toujours plus loin les limites de la m\u00e9chancet\u00e9 et de la cruaut\u00e9, \u00e0 r\u00e9ifier les individus, \u00e0 les inciter \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 une comparaison effr\u00e9n\u00e9e entre eux et les autres. Les plates-formes de m\u00e9dias sociaux tels que YouTube, Twitter et Facebook sont des outils spectaculaires, mais ce sont aussi de v\u00e9ritables machines \u00e0 fum\u00e9e -morale qui g\u00e9n\u00e8rent un brouillard dans lequel beaucoup perdent leurs rep\u00e8res et sombrent dans les eaux boueuses des chambres d'\u00e9cho et de la propagande.</p><p>Un m\u00e9lange toxique de m\u00e9canismes et de propensions contribue \u00e0 g\u00e9n\u00e9rer ce brouillard moral : algorithmes, mod\u00e8les commerciaux des plates-formes en ligne, rassemblement de personnes d'opinions identiques, bulles de -filtrage, effondrement des fronti\u00e8res priv\u00e9-public, r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle, comportement addictif, anonymat apparent et personnalisation. La nouvelle technologie num\u00e9rique s'accompagne en outre d'une large \" souplesse interpr\u00e9tative \". Comme ces environnements sont nouveaux, les normes et les attitudes qu'ils impliquent ne sont pas encore solidement \u00e9tablies, et les utilisateurs ignorent la nature et les objectifs de la technologie. Ce qui veut dire que nous sommes de plus en plus amen\u00e9s \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer notre conduite comme relativement inoffensive et autoris\u00e9e. Les mondes sociaux en ligne ont r\u00e9pandu partout la souplesse interpr\u00e9tative.</p><p>Les militaires utilisent l'expression \" brouillard de la guerre \" pour qualifier les circonstances dans lesquelles il devient extr\u00eamement difficile d'appliquer nos r\u00e8gles -morales \u2013 comme, par exemple, d\u00e9terminer qui est innocent et qui peut \u00eatre cibl\u00e9 quand il est impossible de distinguer l'ami de l'ennemi. De nombreuses situations sont -capables d'\" embrouiller \" notre boussole morale, et les -actuels mondes sociaux en ligne en offrent d'innombrables et spectaculaires exemples.</p><p>La t\u00e2che qui nous incombe n'est donc pas seulement -d'accro\u00eetre les efforts de r\u00e9gulation chaque fois que nous d\u00e9couvrons de nouvelles violations de nos valeurs sur les r\u00e9seaux en ligne. Elle consiste aussi \u00e0 mieux comprendre comment les conditions de ces univers \" embrouillent \" la compr\u00e9hension morale, \u00e0 \u00e9radiquer (l\u00e0 o\u00f9 c'est possible) les sources m\u00eames de ce brouillard moral et \u00e0 concevoir de meilleures fa\u00e7ons d'en \u00e9viter les \u00e9cueils. Au XXIe \u00a0si\u00e8cle, il -serait parfaitement gratuit de parler de d\u00e9mocratie, d'autonomie, de vie priv\u00e9e et de redevabilit\u00e9 sans r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont nous pouvons int\u00e9grer ces valeurs et ces id\u00e9aux moraux dans notre monde num\u00e9rique. L'\u00e9thique doit intervenir dans la conception m\u00eame du codage informatique, des algorithmes et des infrastructures, sous peine de perdre sa pertinence et de devenir obsol\u00e8te.</p><p>(Traduit de l'anglais par Gilles Berton.)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONDE-1334292</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MONDE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRN-0991-DY7V-P0PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299258</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Le Monde Interactif Tous Droits R\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Le Monde</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19300\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>17 novembre 2018 samedi</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CFSV</classCode><className>HARC\u00c8LEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TSZ</classCode><className>PHILOSOPHIE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DLCU</classCode><className>FAUSSE INFORMATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>ENFANT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000882</classCode><className>VOL D'IDENTIT\u00c9</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0QzNDc4RTM3RjNENDA3RUJFMjFEODQ5OTUzODI4Q0Y7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTdGN0NBMjhBN0VBNDYzOEFCRkQyNDc2RDJDMzc3Mjg</classCode><className>Identity Theft</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000284</classCode><className>ABUS SUR MINEUR</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDgzMDZDQ0YyRTM1NDcxRDhFQkU4NTQyMjFGNkFBOEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjE5MEI0RUExOTZENDdFM0EwQTlFMjYyMkQzNkM0OEQ</classCode><className>Child Abuse</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DM4K</classCode><className>MISOGYNIE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001353</classCode><className>PORNOGRAPHIE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DA0C</classCode><className>RACISME &amp; X\u00c9NOPHOBIE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001555</classCode><className>CRIME SEXUEL</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY</classCode><className>Sex Crimes</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""
