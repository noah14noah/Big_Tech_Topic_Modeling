The report only \"assumes\" that \"data has this intrinsic value\" that can be of use to Indians, to the government, to the private sector, and to the individuals. However, that intrinsic value is never explained in the report, a number of speakers remarked.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The discussion was held with support from Centre for Communication Governance (NLU Delhi), Facebook and FTI Consulting. The discussion on data trusts was held under the Chatham House Rule. All quotes have been edited for clarity, brevity and anonymity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Report does not justify the need for a separate non-personal data regulation</p><p>A speaker explained that the leap from \"data as an economic good\" to the proposed NPD framework misses a few steps since alternate methods exist for most of the \"problems\" the report attempts to solve. For instance, to incentivise innovation and to create economic value from data, frameworks exist within the competition law and the intellectual property rights regime, they said.</p><p>To deal with harms that can potentially arise form use of community data, the Personal Data Protection Bill, is already looking at some of them. \"Concerns around collective community harms could be included within the PDP Bill itself,\" they proposed.</p><p>The technical architecture proposed in the report may also \"collapse on itself\" as most data sets today are mixed data sets, that is an inextricable mix of personal and non-personal data, the speaker continued. \"Even if the non-personal data in question is connected to traffic rights - an example that is often brought up -, it will still have personal data underlying it. So, even if a person did not create or was not the data source, he would have personally identifiable information or related information. So, even if it doesn't identify you as a person, it could relate to you and have consequences for you,\" they said.</p><p>This over-regulation, they concluded, could lead to regulatory arbitrage wherein companies could try and be governed as, say, a data fiduciary under the PDP Bill or a data custodian under the NPD framework depending on which is cheaper.</p><p>Problems with the report's methodology</p><p>A participant pointed out that to conflate regulation of non-personal data and community data with an attempt to curtail the dominance of Big Tech is \"misleading\" and \"diverts attention\" away from the issues. It also makes people who critique this idea seem like \"bad people\" who want Big Tech dominance to continue, they said.</p><p>Another speaker said that the report has not taken into account existing policies and frameworks that were formulated to deal with non-personal data and data sharing, such as the National Data Sharing and Access Policy, and the data.gov.in portal. The report, in fact, appears to be indicative of a larger trend at play in terms of policy, another speaker said. \"Several policy documents in the last three years have talked about sharing data with the Indian government, with Indian start-ups, such as in the earlier versions of the e-commerce policy draft, Economic Survey, etc.,\" they said.</p><p>1. Assumptions have not been tested: A number of speakers voiced their concerns that the assumptions in the report have not been tested at all. Instead of \"unpacking the underlying assumptions\", the report has made arguments on the basis of a few use cases, a speaker argued. The report does not propose a framework to identity the actual use cases where non-personal data and its regulation would be useful, another speaker pointed out. \"The report does not go into the specifics of how that's going to happen without going into specifics of implementation or reasons for collection of data,\" the latter speaker said.</p><p>2. Lack of checks and balances: A discussant pointed out that the report does not talk about any checks and balances in the system and just assumes that the new authority would come up with the necessary regulation.</p><p>3. No explanation of how data is a good: The report does not delve deeper into how data is an economic good. \"A good could be a purely private good, something which is non-rival and non-excludable,\" a speaker said. The report admits that data, by nature, is non-rivalrous but it is an excludable right. The problem occurs because rival and non-rival goods are not a binary, but a spectrum, as per the speaker. \"If everybody uses what I am producing and freely uses it with no benefit to me, then that changes my incentives to supply that good. So, the supply of that will get depleted eventually,\" they said.</p><p>Understanding how data is used in digital economy</p><p>To resolve one of the fundamental problems of the report, at least two participants explained how data is actually used in a digital economy. \"You can't simply look at non-personal data as a category for regulation and ignore all the other parts of the digital economy which have gone into creating that data. You need to look at platforms, the infrastructure and the business models that go into the very creation of this category of non-personal data,\" a speaker said. If this is not done, there is the danger of co-opting the model of surveillance/informational capitalism \"which we have recognised as the source of inequities and as the source of kind of problems in the digital economy,\" they said.</p><p>Data is not neutral: They cited this paper by Angela Xiao Wu and Harsh Taneja that talks about how \"data is ultimately just an abstraction that is shaped by the context in which it is created and for what it's created right\". They explained that Uber, for instance, does not give you an accurate normative perspective of what city streets look like; it gives you a perspective of what city streets look like under the influence of Uber surge pricing algorithm so that they can get the most value out of the commuters in those streets. \"Now, if you want to take all of that information and then input into city planning for traffic management or for whatever you want you know, over here it mentions like, how do we make sure that senior citizens are safe on the streets, it's not going to reflect the values of democratic governments or what people actually want, it's going to reflect why Uber has collected this data and what it's been using it for. That's one way, that's one problem of simply assuming that data is this neutral resource that can be mined and extracted for public use or even shifted out of context and reused elsewhere,\" they said.</p><p>They also cited this paper by Linnet Taylor and Christine Richter to show how when IBM tried to deploy a big data system to regulate water supply and management in Bangalore, similar problems cropped up even through IBM's Smart City system was purposefully built for smart cities. \"But problems around what kind of technology is recognised, what kinds of water pipes and what kinds of houses actually have access to say technologies of water measurement, etc. cropped up,\" they said. It is thus necessary to consider how the category of non-personal data is constituted and if it is even useful to share it.</p><p>Raw data is an oxymoron: One of the speakers explained that \"data is not something that naturally exists out in the world and is available for us to take\". \"At every moment it's an abstraction that's created by someone for a specific purpose,\" they said. At no point is there a category such as raw data, they stressed. It is shaped by standard-making processes of either public or private players, they said. Another speaker pointed out that the committee's assumption that raw, factual data just exists, and is ripe for anyone's plucking is an oversight. The report proposes that companies should not be compensated for collecting factual data.</p><p>Inferred data is based on probabilities: The speaker explained that inferred data is based on probability of what may be true, not on the basis of what is measured or captured by standardised technologies. This, then allows companies to categorise people on the basis of what else may be true about them, what other communities they may be part of, what other interests and attributes and habits they may have, and this is what is of value to companies, the speaker explained.</p><p>Defining ownership without considering power relations is a red flag: The report has proposed different ownership patterns for the three kinds of NPD that it identifies. However, one speaker said that this approach, where an ex nihilo existence of data is assumed for purposes of data ownership is a problem. \"We need to critically assess where this data is coming from, who is making it and for what purpose, else it will further entrench the power of these platforms, and the kind of inequitable system that we have already in place,\" they said.</p><p>Report's definition of community is too superficial</p><p>The report defines community as \"any group of people that are bound by common interests and purposes, and involved in social and/or economic interactions. It could be a geographic community, a community by life, livelihood, economic interactions or other social interests and objectives, and/or an entirely virtual community\". This according to a number of people is not a good characterisation of a community - both in the analog world, and within the digital economy.</p><p>Communities in the analog world require modicum of self-awareness: Outside of this report, a speaker pointed out, a community is thought of as \"a group of people who are self-aware that they have membership of the group or they articulate such membership\". There is an intersectionality associated with a being a community, as in, people can inhabit multiple communities at once, something the report does not consider. Another speaker cited Elinor Ostrom's work on the commons to argue what while defining a community, certain attributes are relevant including history of prior interaction, some sort of homogeneity, shared key attributes, shared knowledge, shared social capital, etc. Adivasi communities identified under the Forest Rights Act are such a community, they said.</p><p>Overlaps between public, private and community personal data: Although the report delineates three categories of NPD - public, private and community -, it does not consider overlaps between them. \"It's likely that everything will end up being a community data by this current definition,\" a speaker said.</p><p>Digital economy creates 'ad hoc' communities: One of the speakers explained that unlike analog communities, data systems create \"ad hoc\" communities where any semblance of self-awareness is not possible. These ad hoc communities \"are often based on inferences and happening inside databases that the person itself is not aware of\", they said. These grouping are not dependant on extant or existing identities. Such grouping are not determined by nationality, domicile, etc. but would like: \"you are somebody between the ages of probably twenty-five and thirty-five and you have liked one hundred such consumer products and therefore you are a part of the community that likes one hundred similar products and is aged such and such.\"</p><p>Lack of protections for particular communities: Given this lack of awareness of belonging to such a community, it becomes very difficult to enforce community rights on such members. A speaker pointed out that the report report doesn't delve into the question of what kind of communities require specific kinds of protections. \"And the definition is broad enough to capture both of these ad hoc communities which are created at every moment of data analysis, as well as existing communities which may require special, specialised protections as we have under Article 15 and 16 of the constitution,\" they said.</p><p>Privacy acknowledges group privacy but doesn't address harms associated with it: Surveillance capitalism, one speaker said, derive value from targeting an individual with certain habits, not the individual. An Eve is not as important as a woman who likes to buy red socks, history books, and camping gear. \"It doesn't really matter anymore that they can't identify me as long as they have specific relevant categories of data for me which can otherwise be anonymous according to which they can categorise me. So, that's precisely where the harm rises,\" they said.</p><p>Consent has not been unpacked</p><p>Multiple speakers pointed out that the report does not unpack the question of consent adequately. \"At the moment most users believe that they are consenting for data to be used to actually deliver a service or a product while the value of data does not come from that. The value of data comes from making predictions about our behaviour or actually influencing our behaviour in real time,\" one of the speakers said</p><p>Problem with definition of data trustees</p><p>The concept of data trustees is a deeply problematic one within the report. \"The data principal group/community will exercise its data rights through an appropriate community data trustee. In the case of community data, unlike personal data where an individual can directly exercise control over her data, the concept of trustee for community data comes in, who would exercise such rights on the behalf of the community.</p><p>The first problem is that the member may not know that they are a part of a community, a speaker pointed out. In that scenario, how is the member supposed to participate in process of sharing their non-personal data?</p><p>The question of who should represent a community is a particularly vexed one. The report assumes that a ministry or government department would be the default data trustee. This has its own set of harms.</p><p>For instance, if an individual belongs to a group of women who buy vibrators online, is the state really the best and most sympathetic entity to represent their concerns?</p><p>The report also doesn't acknowledge the intersectional nature of people's identities and how sub communities can exist within larger communities, leading to intra-community conflicts. For instance, who is the best entity to represent the concerns of a women within a particular religious group whose interests may not be as dominant as the larger interests of that specific community?</p><p>Overlapping communities is another issue. For instance, if you have education data of school students, who is the data trustee - the Ministry of Human Resource Development or the Ministry of Women and Child Development?</p><p>Problems with the stakeholder ecosystem</p><p>The stakeholder ecosystem that the report identifies, with several new entities such as data trusts, data trustees, data exchanges, etc., needs more elucidation. \"There is a lot of overlap in the way</p><p>stakeholders have been identified and we also are depending heavily on this idea of trust, on the idea of duty of care, on the idea of fiduciaries,\" a speaker said.</p><p>This regime of duty of care or a fiduciary duties means that that there should be no conflict of interest between the person who is a fiduciary and the person who is the principal agent, the speaker said. Thus, \"the fiduciary should not be making any money of the specific service that the principal is asking them to undertake for them other than whatever service fee there is possible,\" they said. That is where \"the entire model just breaks down\" since there are no checks and balances, they said.</p><p>Relationship between community and data trustee not fleshed out</p><p>The report proposes the concept of beneficial ownership for community wherein the community would have economic rights over the NPD but the decisions would be taken by the data trustee. How the data trustee would consult with the community or how it would be held accountable for decisions takes on behalf of the community have also not been specified in the report.</p><p>Identification of community data does not mean that the community is \"suddenly massively empowered\", a discussant said. Furthermore, this data trustee does not own the data trust and does not have any actual rights against the data trust except to ask for the enforcement of safeguards, another speaker pointed out. \"In effect, I am not able to see, in this entire structure, what power even that data trustee who may not be representing the community has,\" the latter speaker said.</p><p>Potential ways to give communities control over their data Case: Indigenous peoples in Canada</p><p>In Canada, indigenous peoples have special status within the Canadian state owing to the painful legacy of colonialism. They often have different governance structures over which the Canadian government has no control. \"They are making it very clear that community data for them means data that can be collected because they feel it's important for them,\" the speaker said. The communities have control over how the data is collected and used Case: Representation by consumer groups before TRAI</p><p>Another speaker gave the example of consumers as a community. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has a mechanism where \"they allow these NGOs which are supposed to represent the interests of consumer groups to be enrolled with the authority, and when issues related to consumers come up, these agencies are supposed to represent their interest\". There are, of course, concerns about the state's own incentive for engaging in such work, and of its agents, but it could still work as a template, the speaker said.</p><p>Data exchanges run the risk of excluding the marginalised</p><p>A participant pointed out that by engaging in data trade, wherein market forces determine the price of data, chances are that most valuable data is what most people would be interested in. \"What happens to the rest of it right, what happens to the data that belongs to people or groups of people or whatever you want to call it, NPD or PD or whatever else, that people don't want. What happens to the effort, especially in India, where everything is being run by the state? Will those communities, will that data then not be collected at all?\" they asked.</p><p>A speaker pointed out that data's value cannot always be priced. \"Non-price aspects of data are often the most determinative factor in terms of benefits or harms,\" they said. Another speaker pointed out that the report doesn't consider the fact that \"you are not selling the data, you are selling underlying what the data represents\". \"Data itself, like in a big data economy, serves as a signal like price used to be signals for commodities,\" they explained.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0054389770</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T2-RRN1-JB5M-W528-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3086\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 9, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002K8A</classCode><className>FTI CONSULTING INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ROYAL INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS541618 OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSULTING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS541611 ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT &amp;

The new strand of coronavirus continues to wreak havoc on industries - including tech - across the globe, and has resulted in a dip in sales, cancellation of major annual conferences and mandatory/advisory work from home. Here's a round-up of how the virus has affected the tech sector:</p><p>In India<br/><br/>* The Delhi government has suspended biometric attendance at all its offices until further orders. The central government has issued a similar advisory, which will remain in effect until October 31.<br/><br/>* The Kerala government has suspend biometric authentication for the public distribution system, The News Minute reported.<br/><br/>* A Google employee in Bengaluru tested positive for COVID-19, following which the company asked all its employees in that office to work from home on March 13, TechCrunch reported.<br/><br/>* Number of rides on Uber and Ola have dropped by a third over the last week, since several companies have advised employees to work from home, The Economic Times reported. At the same time, around 5% of drivers on these platforms have reportedly left Bengaluru over fears of contracting the virus.<br/><br/>Effect on the Big Tech<br/><br/>* After shutting its stores for a month in China, Apple said that it is reopening all 42 of its branded stores, Reuters reported. The company had earlier said that it will miss its quarterly revenue guidance because of the effects of the coronavirus.<br/><br/>- Apple's iPhone 11 series also reportedly took a major hit due to supply issues.<br/><br/>* Major technology companies have asked all their employees to work from home in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. This includes Twitter, which has made working from home mandatory, Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple among others.<br/><br/>- Twitter will also pay its contractors, vendors and hourly workers, and will reimburse employees for their home office set up.<br/><br/>- Facebook's contract workers have reportedly not been allowed to work from home.<br/><br/>* Microsoft said that revenue in the business segment that includes its Windows operating system and Surface devices would likely miss earlier forecasts. \"The supply chain is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated at the time of our Q2 earnings call,\" the company said.<br/><br/>* Amazon removed over 1 million listings for items that claimed to cure or defend against the coronavirus, Reuters reported. Amazon is also being investigated by Italy's anti-trust watchdog for an allegedly excessive rise in the price of products such as hand sanitiser during the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reported. eBay is also being probed by the regulator along with Amazon.<br/><br/>Event cancellations<br/><br/>* After Facebook and Google cancelled the physical portion of their respective major annual conferences, Microsoft followed suit and cancelled the in-person part of its Build conference that was scheduled to take place between May 19 and May 21.<br/><br/>* Tech and music conference SXSW, scheduled to take place from March 13 to March 22, has also been cancelled. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was set to deliver a keynote address at the event.<br/><br/>* Major gaming event E3, scheduled to be held from June 9, was also called off.<br/><br/>* Snapchat's parent company, Snap, has made its annual Snap Partner Summit an online-only event with a keynote scheduled for April 2.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0052211477</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDN-XDX1-JB5M-W3KP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 13, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The discussion was held on October 10, in Bengaluru.<br/><br/>Read all the reports in the series of discussions held at Delhi and Bangalore here.<br/><br/>What follows is a paraphrased and edited transcript of the session.<br/><br/>Preferential Voting Rights<br/><br/></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Control and equity funding</emphasis>: Startup founders often want a higher degree of control because they want to protect their company. They want to safeguard against future funding rounds which might just be strategic investments, or guard against the interest of the funders. Second, Preferential Voting Rights (PVR) lets you retain control while having equity funding, which is favorable over debt funding. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(Nehaa Chaudhari, Ikigai Law)</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Larger problem of the tech environment</emphasis>: I think having preferential voting rights is a larger problem linked to the exit of financial institutions in India. Big tech companies have not arisen in India because we don't have a good IPO process for tech companies; the rules are archaic and need refining and relook. Preferential rights should be dictated by the founders at their own negotiation level. The state should just stay off it, and instead ensure a better environment for startups to grow bigger. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(Nikhil Narendran, Trilegal)</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The moment an investor comes in and takes equity in your company, as management, you become a service provider to your shareholder.

Valuation determines the right price for the company. My investors have not asked for a board seat.

State policy is only a device for stopping malpractices or market making. Many founders I know have burned equity funding, but there needs to be another forum to address this question of liquidity. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(Thiyagarajan Maruthavanan, Upekkha)</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Founders often feel like they're crushed down to a 4-5% holding, with $500 million worth holding, when the total money in the company is $20 billion.

For instance, Amazon's legal bills in India in the last year are approximately Rs 700 crore. If a startup were to challenge them, it would have to create 4 entities owned by somebody who's separated by fifteen degrees of separation, and each of them would have 24% each, and a 5th entity to rent. By the time I do all the setup, the legal fees would have eaten up my whole first round. Young companies can't challenge the incumbents because of the legal scaffolding. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(Ravi Gururaj, Qikpod)</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>I think we're going to see some funky omni-channel. So I order online, I get the product from the local store, who owns the inventory. But I have the money from everyone in the world to run a portal that's just a search engine.

Maybe there could be thresholds, once a company is transacting more than $500 million, these rules apply, another threshold that's pretty high, so the big boys can duke it out.

If there are two conflicting provisions in a particular piece of legislation, then you try and give meaning to both. So if you try to give a meaning to the contradiction in the definition of e-commerce policy and thereby ban foreign investment in inventory-based e-commerce, and then read it along with the statement which says that FDI in services is not regulated, one can argue that online services and FDI there is allowed. The market is also relatively comfortable with the fact that in services, FDI is allowed in services. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(Nikhil Narendran, Trilegal)</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>People are very comfortable that pureplay service providers, even those with inventory, get FDI. Something like UrbanClap, or online healthcare providers, block time. They block inventory in terms of someone's time, which is actually a service, it is consumable. This is the reason why this controversy became all the more grave in terms of 'is that really blocking of inventory and does that become an inventory of services and trading in services?' There's no concept of trading in services, there should be no concept of an inventory-based model of a service provider. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(Winnie Shekhar, IndusLaw)</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>The inventory clause under the policy</h><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Press Note 3 was brought in to regulate foreign investment and wasn't supposed to be for the domestic guys. The domestic guys can import and sell whatever they want. But the policy says that an inventory-based e-commerce entity - which is basically a retailer, a B2C entity - can't sell online till they're ensuring that 100% of the goods being sold online are India-made. But the policy is vague about what that means, manufactured in India, or local support, or what? <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Winnie Shekhar, IndusLaw)</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>If retail trading is where all this started, anybody who is selling goods manufactured in India in the offline (brick-and-mortar) stores should be allowed to sell them. As far as the inventory's concerned, what are they really looking at? Are they looking at a marketplace which also owns inventory, or are they looking at a pure retailer who owns inventory? Then that is no different from a regular retailer. More importantly, if you're looking at a new entity with foreign funding, that company/startup won't be Indian owned and controlled for a very long time. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Winnie Shekhar, IndusLaw)</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Once investors have the largest shareholding or control of the board, the FDI policy defines control in terms of how are the voting rights or equity held, or how you have the right to exercise over the majority of the board.

For instance, FDI is self-regulating, the Companies Act is self-sufficient, the competition law needs a relook. The policy needs to focus on how well you regulate digital goods and services, from all perspectives including taxation and even cross-border sale of digital products. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(Harshitha Thammaiah, Xiaomi)</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>First, setting up a Consumer Protection Authority will be a big, big step forward, because consumers at this point in time have very few places that they can go to.

They represent the losing side, but they are determined not to lose their grip on power. They know that if what they stand for \u2014 globalism, socialism, mass Muslim migration \u2014 were put to an honest and fair vote, they would lose massively. They fear Trump and the European populists. </p><p>They know they can't defeat the forces of freedom in open debate. So they're determined to shut down all opposing voices. That's why the social media giants are steadily choking off all conservatives.'Nancy Pelosi Declares a 'New Era' of Internet Regulation; E.U. Threatens Same,' by Nick Gillespie, Reason[1], April 16, 2019:We've all been watching this developfor years now[2]: The internet is being slow-choked, not by rapacious ISPs forcing users to pay for 'fast lanes,' but by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic who want to have a bigger role in what we're allowed to do and say online. To be sure, lawmakers are being greatly aided in their efforts by major tech players such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Apple's Tim Cook[3], who are explicitly calling for regulation to maintain current market positions in a sector defined by creative destruction (all hail MySpace[4] and Blackberry[5]!). In an interview[6] with Recode's Kara Swisher, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) pronounced that in the tech sector, the 'era of self-regulation' is over when it comes to privacy and speech rules. Sounding a lot like conservative Republicans such as Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, she zeroes in especially on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as the thing that needs to be torched. As the title of a new book puts it, Section 230 comprises 'the twenty-six words that created the internet[7].' Author Jeff Kosseff explains that by immunizing websites, platforms, and service providers from 'lawsuits over materials that their users upload,' Section 230 'fundamentally changed American life.' Indeed, the internet as we know it is based on both 'content created not only by large companies, but by users,' writes Kosseff, who observes that of the top 10 most-trafficked websites in the United States in 2018, only Netflix 'mostly provides its own content.' All the rest\u2014Facebook, Wikipedia, YouTube, Twitter, et al.\u2014either rely heavily on user-generated content (including potentially actionable reviews and comments about everything under the sun) or exist to guide users to such content (Google, Yahoo). Pelosi is done with all that, telling Swisher that the freedom of expression empowered by Section 230 is 'a gift' and a 'privilege' that can be rescinded if major tech companies don't move in the direction she and other politicians want. She frets over companies such as Facebook and Twitter buying up app makers and other services without explaining themselves to regulators. 'Is this just commerce and they see a market opportunity and decide to take it on?' says Pelosi. 'Or are they in competition with each other, buying something before somebody else doesn't buy it and then all of a sudden, three or four firms dominate the marketplace and engines of search and the rest of that?' 'Forthe privilege of 230,' Pelosi warns, 'there has to be a bigger sense of responsibility on it.And it is not out of the question that that could be removed.' Like many Democrats, Pelosi remains convinced that Facebook helped to throw the election to Donald Trump by not regulating political advertising tightly enough and providing a space for the Russians to practice dark arts (the idea that Russian social media changed the outcome of the election is simply wrong[8]). On top of that, liberals and progressives are calling for more policing of whatever they define as 'hate speech.' The motivations might be slightly different than those on the right\u2014who accuse Facebook, et al. of limiting the reach and popularity of conservative figures and opinion due to ideological bias\u2014but the endpoint is the same: a repeal of Section 230. 'Google and Facebook should not be a law unto themselves,' Sen. Hawley told a crowd[9] at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). 'They should not be able to discriminate against conservatives. They should not be able to tell conservatives to sit down and shut up.' What Pelosi calls a gift, Hawley calls 'a sweetheart deal' that should be ended by enforcing some sort of viewpoint equality on social-media platforms. Cruz has effectively called for the repeal of Section 230 and the implementation of something like a Fairness Doctrine for the internet. During a debate last year with former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) during the 2018 elections, Cruz said'Right now, big tech enjoys an immunity from liability on the assumption they would be neutral and fair If they're not going to be neutral and fair, if they're going to be biased, we should repeal the immunity from liability so they should be liable like the rest of us.'It's not at all clear what it means to say 'they should be liable like the rest of us,' since publishers have the absolute right not to publish things and, under existing precedent, sites have the right to moderate some comments without becoming liable for the ones they allow to remain. But it's never a good sign when conservatives and liberals, Republicans and Democrats start sounding like one another. Throw in President Trump's recent statement that we need to 'do something' about social media sites, and the only safe conclusion is that Section 230 is in real danger. And with it, the internet as we've known it. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the European Union (E.U.) has approved 'The Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market'[10] whose Article 13 mandates thatanyone sharing copyrighted content must get permission from rights owners\u2014or at least have made the best possible effort to get permission\u2014before doing so. In order to do this, it's thought that internet services and social networks will have no choice but to build and enforce upload filters and generally apply a more heavy-handed approach to moderating what users post online.

Just a moment from now, we'll talk to the Vice President of the United  States, and we'll ask him whether America is getting a Border wall in the  end, and what the White House is willing to give in exchange for that.  That's just ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But first, Democrats have returned to power on one half of Capitol Hill,  one Chamber. After eight years out, Nancy Pelosi is once again the Speaker  of the House. What can we expect from this brand new Congress?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We don't have to speculate too much because they're already telling us.  Pelosi has signaled her total opposition to securing America's border with  Mexico, for example. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SAVANNAH CLARK GUTHRIE, BROADCAST JOURNALIST, ATTORNEY, CO-ANCHOR OF TODAY,  NBC NEWS: Are you willing to come up and give him some of this money for  the wall?</p><p> NANCY PELOSI, SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: No.</p><p> GUTHRIE: Because apparently that's the sticking point.</p><p> PELOSI: No. No, nothing for the wall. We're talking about border security.  There is no amount of persuasion he can do to say to us, \"We want you to do  something that is not effective, that costs billions of dollars.\" That  sends the wrong message about who we are.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CARLSON: OK. So there's that. What else can we expect? </p><p> Well Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, now a Member of Congress from New York,  finally, and she's pushing something called a Green New Deal. You may have  heard the term. What does it mean?

Now, what would you do? Sincerely, think about  it for a second. If you really thought Hitler was in the White House, well  you'd stage a coup, obviously. You have no choice morally.</p><p> Democrats aren't saying that out loud, but they now are talking about  impeachment out loud. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This deplorable,  despicable human being that occupies the White House should not be there.  We--</p><p> They say, \"Maxine, please don't say impeachment anymore.\" And when they say  that, I say, \"Impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.\"</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> WATERS: When someone asked, \"But what about Pence? If you were able to  impeach, Pence -- Pence will be worse.\" And I said, \"Look, one at a time.  You knock one down, and then we'll be ready for Pence. We'll get him, too.\"</p><p> (CROWD SHOUTING YES)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: But keep in mind that Maxine Waters is suddenly more than just a  very popular MSNBC guest. As of today, she's chairing the House Financial  Services Committee. She has real power. </p><p> And she plans to use that power to push what she's calling \"Diversity  quotas\" on the private sector. Hire the people Democratic Members of  Congress want you to hire or else. So, that's a large part of the agenda.  Should Americans be excited for that?</p><p> Richard Goodstein is a good barometer of that question. He's a lawyer. He  advised both Clintons over the years and, of course, one of our favorite  guests. Mr. Goodstein, thank you very much for coming. </p><p> Now, I'm not -- let me just say at the outset, I'm not going to ask you to  account for Congressman Hank Johnson, who once suggested that Guam would  capsize if too many American troops landed there because it's Hank Johnson. </p><p> But I do think it's fair to ask you about Nancy Pelosi, the new Speaker of  the House, who said that, \"No. We cannot secure the border between the  United States and Mexico. We cannot have a wall,\" and I'm quoting now,  \"Because it sends the wrong message about who we are.\" </p><p> What message would having a wall send that is not who we are?</p><p> RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER  CLINTON ADVISER: First, Hank Johnson is Hank Aaron's brother-in-law, so  he's deserving some credit--</p><p> CARLSON: Is he literally Hank Aaron's brother-in-law?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --yes, yes.</p><p> CARLSON: But I'm not against Hank Johnson.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I think he's hilarious. But there's obviously something wrong with  him (ph).</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, what Nancy Pelosi is saying is what Democrats have been  saying back when they, you know, passed that legislature in '06 about  fencing and in 2013, $46 billion for border security, including $8 billion  specifically for a structure along the border, and tens of thousands of  personnel to monitor it, and all sorts of virtual walls.</p><p> CARLSON: Right, right.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: What they're saying is we don't support open borders. That's why  Barack Obama was called by the largest Hispanic organization the, you know,  the -- the Deporter-in-Chief. So--</p><p> CARLSON: Well, I'm -- now I'm even more confused. Listen to this. \"Would  you allocate any money for a wall?\"</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: The new Speaker was asked. \"No. No, it sends the wrong message  about who we are.\" So, you're saying it's OK to have a virtual wall but not  a real wall?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: I'm saying that Donald Trump defined the wall in the campaign --  first he said, why are we having this conversation? He said, \"Mexico is  going to pay for it.\" And now we know that taxpayer is going to. So, can we  at least get him off that?</p><p> CARLSON: I don't know -- wait but hold on, he didn't -- I mean look--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: But--</p><p> CARLSON: --I don't think Mexico is going to pay for it. But just in point  of fact, he didn't say Mexico was going to prepay for it. Mexico can pay  for it later through remittances. But whatever, but that's really not the  point.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: In a 100 years, they may pay for it? But I mean this is--</p><p> CARLSON: Look -- look, my job is not to defend all of his campaign  promises.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: My job is to ask about the country and why can't we have a wall.  I'm serious.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, again, and Trump said, and here's why (ph) I think  there's actually going to be a deal because Trump said, 25-foot concrete  wall. That's what he kind of envisioned, that's what he sold his voters on.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: And I think even John Kelly said, to be honest, not something  that we hear every day from the White House, it's not a wall, OK? So, what  we're saying is that -- we're quibbling now between fencing and virtual  this and that--</p><p> CARLSON: But I -- I get it. But what's the difference? So, Trump promises  something that I hope he can deliver, which is a tall concrete barrier that  actually--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --would slow down dramatically the inflow of illegals into our  country. Nancy Pelosi says, \"No, no, that's not the message we want to  send,\" and I -- what does that mean? </p><p> What -- what message does it send that we care too much about our people,  that we're serious about territorial integrity like what is the bad message  that that would send?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: So, again, when Democrats held the White House, fewer people  were coming into the country than now. There were more deportations than  there are now. So, the suggestion that somehow Democrats are wanting--</p><p> CARLSON: But I'm -- I'm still confused.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --open borders is a myth.</p><p> CARLSON: You're not going to address my question.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: No, I -- I will but--</p><p> CARLSON: Look, I don't want to be mean.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: No, no it's not mean.</p><p> CARLSON: You know--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Look, the fact of the matter is what she's saying is what border  experts say by and large--</p><p> CARLSON: That a virtual wall's good but a real wall is bad.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --which is a 25-foot concrete wall is unnecessary. It's -- it's  not necessary to spend that money--</p><p> CARLSON: So that's (ph) necessary.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --and it's not going to work.</p><p> CARLSON: But wait a second. You just said that we have more people coming  in than we did during the (ph) Democrats. But now you're telling me it's  not necessary to secure the border with a big bad wall.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: That -- that is totally--</p><p> CARLSON: A virtual wall would be OK.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: No. It's -- it--</p><p> CARLSON: Because Democrats just want to save money. That's kind of their  motto, right?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Democrats--</p><p> CARLSON: How can we save taxpayers money?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Democrats said in -- in 2013, a bill that passed the Senate with  14 Republicans and that John Boehner refused to bring up, but would have  passed the House too--</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --and Barack Obama would have signed it, basically that would  have said we're going to put all these resources in to judges, to Border  Patrol, to, you know--</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --electronic monitoring.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. But the -- the -- look, I want to (ph) just say like thanks  for history lesson. A lot of dynamics, there are a lot of Republicans  oppose border security, I would never deny that. I'm just saying we have a  chance to get a wall, and they don't want one because it works, and we all  know that. </p><p> Let me ask you about the future. So, we're now hearing from the new  Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters of L.A. that  diversity quotas are coming to the private sector. Here's a quote from a  Democrat to Politico. </p><p> \"Now companies are focused like a laser on identifying top African-American  talent with Congressional Black Caucus relationships to help them  understand and mitigate the striking lack of diversity within their  corporations.\" </p><p> So, what Democrats are saying is you need to hire our friends or else we're  going to punish you. Why is that not corruption?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: In the same way that when Republicans came in, the word went --  I remember there was the K Street Project--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. I hated it. I hated it.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --been long enough to (ph) -- well but that's exactly what  happened, which is--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, it was disgusting.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --you hire our friends, our former staffers, K Streeters, big  corporations--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --corporation and trade association to know us. So, I mean--</p><p> CARLSON: I don't think the Republicans pretended that it was racial justice  when they did that. Did they?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well, they're--</p><p> CARLSON: Are you OK with Congress telling companies who they could hire--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well Congress is not telling--</p><p> CARLSON: --what talent (ph) -- yes, they are. They're--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --well, well, legislatively, the only thing that I saw proposed  was something that basically would require disclosure of the make-up of  your board on gender grounds. I don't know that that's such a bad thing.  It's frankly it's public. I mean presumably you list the names and you can  probably intuit who's a male and who's a female--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --so that's only (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: Well -- well first of all, I -- I just want to officially  disapprove of your rigid understanding of gender. OK? Just -- as -- as  (ph)--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: I'm saying for the most part. I didn't say for the most part.</p><p> CARLSON: --for the most part, thank you. I was giving you an out, Richard,  so you--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: --wouldn't be hung by your own people.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you so much.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: My pleasure, of course.</p><p> CARLSON: Good to see you. I'm very excited for this Congress.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Earlier tonight we had an interview with the Vice President. We  asked about the Border wall, the shutdown, and what was going to happen,  and here's what he said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Will the deal that resolves the shutdown include any form of  amnesty for people here illegally now?</p><p> MICHAEL RICHARD PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, our focus  is on border security.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, of course, but the Democrats' focus is on--</p><p> PENCE: Our focus--</p><p> CARLSON: --getting amnesty for people here illegally--</p><p> PENCE: Well--</p><p> CARLSON: --will you agree to that?</p><p> PENCE: What -- what we've completely focused on is keeping the President's  promise, to build a wall, to pass legislation that provides other support  for border security, that gives the people that are enforcing our laws at  the border, and across the country enforcing our immigration laws, the  resources and the tools-- </p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: --that they need. There's a lot of people talking about a lot of  different ideas. You know, frankly, the better part of a year ago, the  President expressed a willingness to deal with the issue of DREAMers in a  compassionate way for people who were brought here as children, and--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: --through no fault of their own. He's discussed that, it's being  talked about.</p><p> CARLSON: But what about--</p><p> PENCE: But look, here's the part where the (ph) President and I are--</p><p> CARLSON: --people who -- who came here as adults?</p><p> PENCE: --ever since -- ever since the Christmas holiday, the President sent  us to Capitol Hill. I met with Senator Schumer not once but twice. We  engaged in good faith negotiations. The President and I canceled all of our  Christmas vacation plans. We were here in Washington D.C.</p><p> Democrats broke off negotiations about a week ago, but the President's made  it clear. We're here to make a deal, but it's a deal that's going to result  in achieving real gains on border security. And you have no border security  without a wall.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: We will have no deal without a wall. </p><p> CARLSON: If the deal in the end includes allowing people who came here as  adults, intentionally to break our laws, to become citizens, then wouldn't  the message to the rest of us be, why should we obey the law, if people who  intentionally broke it are being rewarded for it? Can you see why that  would be a perverse incentive for the rest of us?</p><p> PENCE: I absolutely can, and I've heard no discussion of that. I've heard  no discussion of--</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> PENCE: --amnesty related to this. I -- I heard some Members of the Senate  are talking about maybe including DREAMers in some sort of a negotiated  settlement.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: And the President's posture on all this is, look, we're at 5.6  billion. We have engaged in good faith negotiations. We've made offers.  There's been no counter-offers made. But, again, we -- we heard the  Democrat leadership, the new Speaker of the House this morning again said,  \"No money for the wall.\" </p><p> Well the American people know walls work. And we heard from Border Agents  today in the Oval Office that -- that in areas and sectors where they were  assigned to deal with illegal immigration, the flow of narcotics, human  trafficking, all the -- all the threats to our communities--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: --that we face at our border that once they build a wall, you saw  illegal immigration, the flow of narcotics, drop precipitously. And--</p><p> CARLSON: So the bottom line is you will not accept a deal that does not  include a wall, if I'm hearing this right?</p><p> PENCE: I think the President's made -- made it very clear.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> PENCE: No wall, no deal. And -- but, look, we really are prepared to  negotiate. We're prepared to talk. We're prepared to listen and--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: --and ultimately it all begins with the facts. I mean that's the  reason why the President called the meeting in the Situation Room. We'll be  meeting again tomorrow with Republican and Democrat leadership.</p><p> And I want the American people to know that that, you know, this is a real  crisis at our border. We made progress last year. And it probably was a  result of the fact that the American people elected a new president who  delivered a very strong message about confronting illegal immigration.</p><p> We actually saw a decline in illegal immigration and incursions on our  Southern border. But in the last 12 months, we've literally seen a dramatic  increase in the number of people -- 2,000 people a day--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I've noticed.</p><p> PENCE: --apprehended at our border or found to be inadmissible, trying to  enter our country.</p><p> I mean that represents -- as -- as much as we're all troubled in recent  weeks about the caravans moving north, and there's talks about more  caravans, literally, 2,000 people a day attempt to come into this country  illegally by one means or another. </p><p> We -- we can agree on those facts, come together around solutions, but part  of that solution means a wall. It means a barrier and -- and along our  Southern border.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: And it also means technology, drones, the kind of support that our  Border Agents know will assist them in doing their job. But -- but bottom  line, if there's no wall, there's no deal.</p><p> CARLSON: The President, the other day, announced the withdrawal of the  2,000 American troops in Syria--</p><p> PENCE: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --back to the United States. Nobody in Washington liked that,  including some Republicans. Lindsey Graham said probably not going to  happen. There was a pause on that withdrawal.</p><p> What is the state of that? Are those troops coming home? And if so, when?</p><p> PENCE: You know, President Trump as Commander-in-Chief and as a candidate  made it clear that our -- our number one priority would be destroying ISIS. </p><p> The reality is we have defeated ISIS. We have defeated the Caliphate. And  what the President announced just before Christmas is not that we're giving  up on the fight on ISIS. We're going to continue to lean into the fight of  ISIS. We're going to continue to take the actions that are necessary to  protect the American people and our interests in the region. </p><p> But the President is determined, in consultation with military commanders,  including in al-Asad Air Force Base when he was there just after Christmas  that it's no longer necessary for us to have American forces in harm's way  in Northeastern Syria to accomplish that.</p><p> CARLSON: Do you think we can expect in the next few months those troops to  come back?</p><p> PENCE: Well I think the President's made it clear. We're -- we're going to  do this and are doing this in an orderly way. </p><p> I heard him in dozens and dozens of speeches talk about bringing our troops  home wherever we could around the world. This is not a -- a president  that's interested--</p><p> CARLSON: So -- no, no he definitely said that, of course.</p><p> PENCE: --in seeing American forces all over the world. They accomplished --  they accomplished the task that we gave--</p><p> CARLSON: But what about Afghanistan? I'm just--</p><p> PENCE: --them to accomplish, defeating the Caliphate.</p><p> CARLSON: --right.</p><p> PENCE: And now we can bring them out of Syria.</p><p> CARLSON: Do you think that we're winning the conflict in Afghanistan? Do  you think the United States benefits from the continued presence of such a  large number of U.S. troops there?</p><p> PENCE: Well, the President is in the process of evaluating that, as we  speak. I was in Afghanistan last year.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> PENCE: In his speech in August, President Trump, basically through new  rules of engagement, new resources, additional military personnel, gave our  folks on the ground the ability to take the fight, be at the tip of the  spear, supporting the Afghan National Army in the battle against the  Taliban, ISIS Khorasan, Al-Qaeda, re-emerging in Afghanistan.</p><p> CARLSON: Is it working?</p><p> PENCE: And it's been a tough fight. I mean the President's been very clear  about that. And now, I think the President's in the process of evaluating  options about what has been, as you know, Tucker, we both lived through it  in the last two decades, what has been a -- an 18-year conflict in  Afghanistan--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> PENCE: --and determining what our best options are, in terms of putting  America first, protecting America's interests in the region, making sure  that we can confront terrorism--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: --if it -- if it rears its head once again. But the President's  looking at ways in Syria, and perhaps even in Afghanistan, where we can  have less of a military commitment and see those resources and those troops  coming home.</p><p> CARLSON: Mr. Vice President, thank you.</p><p> PENCE: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: I appreciate it.</p><p> PENCE: Good to be with you.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Well on our first show of the year, which was last night, we  highlighted and tried to explain the decline of men in Middle America, and  how it's devastating this country. And it is. </p><p> That segment got a huge response from viewers. But some people hated it,  the science parts, especially. That's no longer allowed. We'll explain  after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well last night was our first show of the year. So, we decided to  take a minute to talk about the biggest issue facing this country going  forward. </p><p> No, it's not higher GDP growth despite what some think-tank people will  tell you. It's not, definitely not, some obscure Middle-Eastern hellhole  our leaders claim we should be policing forever. It's not even illegal  immigration as big a problem as that is, and as much time as we have spent  talking about it.</p><p> The real problem is families. America used to be the best country in the  world for families. Americans could get married and afford to raise their  own children. If your kids worked hard, you could expect they'd be a little  more successful maybe than you were. That was called the American Dream. </p><p> And for a small group of affluent people, it still exists. They're still  living like it's 1965, and good for them. But for everyone else, that Dream  is dying. America's middle-class is in decline because middle-class  American families are declining.</p><p> So, the question is why is that happening? Well there are a lot of reasons  it's happening. But a major driver of family collapse, the one that nobody  ever talks about for some reason is simple economics, and we explained it  last night.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Study after study has shown that when men make less than women,  women generally don't want to marry them. Now maybe they should want to  marry them but they don't.</p><p> Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of- wedlock births and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow. More  drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed  to the next generation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Now, let's be clear about that statement. First of all, it is  factually true, and that's the essential test of anything. That's the test  that we go by.</p><p> In 2015, a study by the decidedly non-Conservative Brookings Institution  found that falling male wages caused about a quarter of the decline in  marriage rates over the past 35 years. </p><p> Two years later, MIT researchers found that when factories close, marriage  rates go down, and single parenthood becomes more common. And that, as you  could guess, causes a higher proportion of children to wind up on drugs or  in prison. So, it's not a small thing.</p><p> And, by the way, many other studies have reached the same conclusions over  long periods of time. This is real. So, what we said is a statement of  fact. We wish it weren't. </p><p> In an ideal world, none of this would matter. The marriage rate never would  have declined when manufacturing died and everything in Middle America  would be fine. But it's not. And we're not in charge of that. All we can do  is tell the truth about what happened, which we did because it actually  matters. </p><p> And that turned out to be too much for the people who believe it's their  job to prevent you from knowing why your country is going down the tubes.  Those people got very angry. Here's a selection.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW: And strike it off (ph).</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> BEHAR: You know, it reminds me -- it reminds me of when they blamed women - - women for pregnancy as if he had nothing to do with it.</p><p> SUNNY HOSTIN, ABC NEWS SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; ANALYST, THE VIEW CO- HOST, COLUMNIST, MULTI-PLATFORM JOURNALIST, SOCIAL COMMENTATOR: There's a  woman in the audience. She's like, \"What? What?\" She's over there (ph).</p><p> MEGHAN MARGUERITE MCCAIN, THE VIEW CO-HOST, COLUMNIST, AUTHOR, FORMER FOX  NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Where?</p><p> BEHAR: This -- this idea that, you know, to keep women down that's going on  in the country--</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p> ABIGAIL HAIGHT HUNTSMAN, TELEVISION PERSONALITY, THE VIEW CO-HOST, ABC: But  Sunny, you said you had friends--</p><p> BEHAR: --and this is just another aspect of it.</p><p> HOSTIN: I don't know. It looked like Loony Town--</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Loony Town.</p><p> HOSTIN: --Town to me.</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, Loony Town. Notice that no one though contested the facts of  what we said. In fact, later in the show, one of those same hosts admitted  that, in fact, women do strongly prefer marrying men who make more than  they do. </p><p> So, it's true but it's not on the list of approved talking points, so it  can't ever be said out loud. Those are the rules. And anyone who violates  those rules must be punished. </p><p> This is very common. And if you're wondering how we wound up in the Dark  Age we're currently living through, this is how we did. This is why  important science is no longer being conducted. This is why art isn't being  made. This is why comedy is dying. </p><p> It's why people aren't thinking for themselves anymore, which means the end  of creativity. It's why the rest of us stand by like cowards as the  innocent are punished for crimes they didn't commit because we're all  terrified. </p><p> We're terrified of being denounced by some mindless ideologue on TV, or  shamed and ostracized on social media for stepping out of line, or silenced  completely by some big tech firm. A mob of angry children is suddenly in  charge of the country.</p><p> These aren't people seeking a revolution. They're fighting for the status  quo to protect their own status. They are drunk on power. And they're  looking for new people to hurt. Someday, we're going to look back on this  moment with shame and horror. </p><p> But, in the meantime, we should remember that terror only works if we play  along with it. So, what if we decided not to? What if all of us decided to  tell the truth about something every day in public? What would happen then?  What could they do about it? </p><p> They can't punish everybody. We're the majority. Let's try that.</p><p> We're starting tonight with Heather Mac Donald. She's a fearless person, a  Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the Author of the book, The Diversity  Delusion: How Race and Gender Pandering Corrupt the University and  Undermine Our Culture, and she joins us tonight. </p><p> Heather, thanks very much for coming on.</p><p> HEATHER LYNN MAC DONALD, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, CITY JOURNAL, THE DIVERSITY  DELUSION AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: So, my theory is that when you say the true things, people get  outraged. So, you know, hurt dog barks. But just to be clear, as a social  scientist yourself, I hope you'll confirm for audience that this is not a  controversial statement that male employment and wages directly affect the  marriage rate. Do they not?</p><p> MAC DONALD: Well, first of all, Tucker, I want to commend you for making  the breakdown of marriage a central focus of your show. There's no bigger  social catastrophe of our age than the fact that more and more children are  being raised without their fathers. And the elites understand that.  Marriage has not disappeared from the elites.</p><p> CARLSON: That's for sure.</p><p> MAC DONALD: And yet, they are absolutely unwilling to send the message that  fathers are as important to their children as mothers. Their tongues are  tied. They refuse to say it. It's one of those truths that again is being  completely denied by elite culture. </p><p> Why? Because it violates the feminist nostrum that strong women could do it  all. Now, you're right that there's an economic component to this. And --  and, most famously, William Julius Wilson explained the drop in marriage  among the Black community--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> MAC DONALD: --as a result of jobs leaving the Midwest. And he said that the  male unemployment decreases females' willingness to marry. </p><p> But I think you also have to look at a culture explanation -- explanation  because I remember being taken around in a ride-along by a Chicago cop, a  very handsome man, solid job, good pension to look forward to, he had  fathered several children out of wedlock. </p><p> Why? Because the marriage norm had simply disappeared--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> MAC DONALD: --from the Black community. So, I think this is a cultural  matter as well. It's a product to a certain extent of the feminist attack  on males. </p><p> We are living through a period where males are being constantly disparaged  as simply the source of evil in our world. And they are responding  tragically by withdrawing from competition, taking their marbles and going  home. And that is leaving us all at greater risk.</p><p> CARLSON: And in some cases taking their own lives, I would say. I mean the  suicide rate for American men--</p><p> MAC DONALD: Sure.</p><p> CARLSON: --is higher that it's been in a long time. I would just note that  the problems that William Julius Wilson chronicled, I thought, so well 30  or 40 years ago, are now the problems of rural America which, obviously,  has a completely different racial demographic and political beliefs than  inner-city America. </p><p> And it seems to me that when it happens to two different groups, the very  same thing that would be the wake-up call for our policymakers to say, wait  a second. Maybe we should get involved in thinking about how to fix this  considering in our neighborhoods, where rich people live in -- my  neighborhood, for example, there are no single mothers. Everyone's married  because it works.</p><p> So, why aren't they doing their best to pass on the thing that is working  for them? It just seems grotesque to me.</p><p> MAC DONALD: No, I -- I think we do have to look at Industrial Policy and  make sure that there are good well-paying jobs there. I just wouldn't  assume that that is going to be enough at this point--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> MAC DONALD: --to turn around the culture. </p><p> Again, we need to valorize males. And -- and the culture needs to say males  are not toxic. Masculinity is not toxic. There are male virtues of valor,  courage, chivalry, heroism in war that are really uniquely male. They  should not be disparaged. Females have complementary virtues and values  that are also essential to children.</p><p> CARLSON: So, so wait. Can I ask where does the idea come from that when men  fail, women win? I mean that really is the underlying assumption of like--</p><p> MAC DONALD: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --the dumb people we always play from other shows. \"You know, men  are declining. This is great for us.\" But men and women are totally  interconnected. So, how can the failure of one help the other? Doesn't it  hurt all of us?</p><p> MAC DONALD: Yes. It's a preposterous zero-sum mentality. But there's a lot  of females who are angry, angry for no reason at all. They have an axe on  their -- to grind, a chip on their shoulder, and they're constantly looking  for ways to feel offended, mostly by dredging up sexism from the past,  because it's almost impossible to find today.</p><p> I mean you have females that are excelling in education. There's not a  single mainstream institution that is not twisting itself into knots to  hire and promote as many females as possible. And yet, females are still  ringing their hands over the alleged sexism of the 50s, simply so they can  feel like they're victims.</p><p> Preposterous! I am not a victim. I -- I don't know any female victims,  frankly. But -- but there is a sense that in order for females to succeed,  it has to be at the expense of males and--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> MAC DONALD: --through a constant de-valorization--</p><p> CARLSON: That doesn't work.</p><p> MAC DONALD: --of masculinity.</p><p> CARLSON: It doesn't work. We -- we -- we don't win when some of us lose. I  -- I don't believe that. It's not true. Heather, thank you very much.</p><p> MAC DONALD: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well they're coming after your drinking straws. Now they want to  tax your meat. It's getting bad out here. Mark Steyn joins us after the  break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well huge parts of this country, as you already know, are  breathtakingly beautiful. Yellowstone, Big Sur, Yosemite, the vast forests  of Maine, places like that are what make this a great country.</p><p> If being an environmentalist means anything, it means protecting those  places and countless others across this continental nation, keeping them  clean and protected. So, how are professional environmentalists doing with  that? </p><p> Well, we know, this week, the federal government is shut down and that  means the National Park Service is not cleaning up in our national parks.  That means that trash is piling up. That is an environmental crisis. </p><p> So, we wanted to know how our environmental watchdogs were responding to  it, so we contacted this country's four biggest environmental groups to see  what they were doing about it, The Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, the  Environmental Defense Fund, and the National -- Natural Resources Defense  Council.</p><p> Go to their websites. They'll tell you how they're protecting the soil and  water. By the way, they raise a lot of money on those claims. Combined,  these four groups have an annual revenue of well over $1 billion. </p><p> Over The Nature Conservancy, their endowment is over $6 billion. So, they  could easily help. Picking up trash is not expensive. They're certainly  rich enough to do that. Are they doing it? We called it in (ph) to find  out. None of them even responded. </p><p> And that, of course, means no. They're not doing it. They're not helping.  Now, that may be sad to those of you who grow up -- grew up sending money  to The Sierra Club, which used to concern itself with our physical  environment and did virtuous work.</p><p> But if you've been paying attention for the past 10 years, you shouldn't be  surprised. Actual garbage that's ruining nature? Well that seems small in  importance compared to, I don't know, promoting carbon taxes or unlimited  immigration or gender theory or the various other priorities of the  Democratic Party, which is what these groups spend their time and money  doing.</p><p> And, by the way, that's fine. Lots of groups in Washington do those exact  things. They're political consultants. That's their job. But, at least,  they're honorable enough to pretend they're not protecting the environment.</p><p> So, these groups may not care anymore about picking up garbage but they do  like the idea of controlling your behavior. Across America, scolds (ph) are  stamping out plastic straws, already banned here in Washington, but it  won't stop with straws. Think it will? Huh.</p><p> Some groups are promoting taxes on meat. They're doing this in the name of  promoting health and fighting climate change. Of course, these taxes would  have the added benefit of punishing you.</p><p> Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. He joins us tonight. So, it does, am  I sensing a theme here, Mark, where a certain sort of--</p><p> MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --upper-income person doesn't feel content until he's really taken  away all the small comforts of those below him?</p><p> STEYN: Absolutely. The Councilman in Santa Barbara, where they introduced  one of these bans on plastic straws, said, we have to regulate, we can't  trust the common sense anymore, we have to regulate every aspect of  people's lives. And after he got a bit of pushback on Twitter or whatever,  he kind of walked that back. </p><p> But it's true. And it's actually the inverse of what you were talking about  with Heather just now that the less anybody notices the vast amount of  human rubble piling up around us, and the more we're prevented from talking  about anything that matters, the moral, the clever people in our society  obsess on peripheral things like plastic straws.</p><p> CARLSON: It's just so interesting though that all of it is aimed downward  at people they believe is--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --are their social inferiors. I can't remember the last time The  Sierra Club went after the Government of China. Some of these groups are  taking money from the Government of China or went after--</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --Al Gore for flying privately or went after--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --private airports, the FBOs across the country. Why is it always  aimed at people who make less than they do?</p><p> STEYN: Well I think -- I think it's because it is the pleasure it affords  the elites at actually regulating the masses. You -- you mentioned China.  Supposedly, we ban straws because straws are polluting the oceans--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STEYN: --as you mentioned, eight countries in Asia are responsible for two- thirds of the plastic waste that goes into the oceans, which means that a  192 countries or thereabouts are responsible for the other third.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: And America contributes less to plastic waste in the oceans. The  Morocco or Burma or even North Korea, and I don't even know what they got  to throw in the oceans in North Korea because that's not a--</p><p> CARLSON: Not much.</p><p> STEYN: --that's not a consumer society. But it -- it's on -- this is  unglamorous work. Just as the most important aspect of human healthcare is  hygiene, the most important aspect of environmental healthcare is -- is  garbage disposal. </p><p> If -- if instead of the Paris Climate Accord, the -- the nations of the  world got together and decided to raise these Asian countries' level of  trash disposal to Euro-American--</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> STEYN: --standards, you would have a much better and -- but -- but if you  say to The Sierra Club, do you want to be running on better garbage  disposal, it's not glamorous enough for them.</p><p> CARLSON: It's just, on the meat tax, very quickly, it just seems like this  is not -- this will only affect people who like burgers. And why not for--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --all the problems that people in that income range have, why  hassle them? Is global warming really their fault?</p><p> STEYN: Well they -- if we didn't eat burgers, we wouldn't have cows. And  they take bovine flatulence more seriously than illegal immigration or  anything. I mean the European Union--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --was proposing offsets on that because the Irish Holstein emits  more than the -- emits less than the BullGuard Jersey (ph). So, they were  actually going to be having offsets in that particular sphere in the  European Union. </p><p> I mean as I said, the -- the less we talk about anything that matters--</p><p> CARLSON: Right, exactly.</p><p> STEYN: --the more we obsess on these boutique niche issues.</p><p> CARLSON: That's -- that's such a deep point, as most of your points are.  Mark Steyn, thank you very much.</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, ho, ho, ho, it is finally here after a week. Final Exam, can  you beat the experts at remembering the final stories of 2018? How's your  short-term memory? The test ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Thank Heaven in a world gone crazy, there is still Final Exam.  We've come to that time of the week where the news professionals compete  with one another to be crowned the ultimate master of the news. </p><p> The defending champion this week is Fox -- Fox National Correspondent,  Lauren Blanchard, who crushed it last week. Her challenger is a very  accomplished man, former U.S. Congressman, Jason Chaffetz, who is guest- hosting for Laura this evening, so don't miss that, and also works here at  Fox Site (ph).</p><p> Great to see you both.</p><p> LAUREN BLANCHARD, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Good to see you.</p><p> CARLSON: Congressman, are you familiar with what this requires?</p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm -- I'm a rookie. But I got  the coat off.</p><p> CARLSON: I like that.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: You know -- you know, at--</p><p> BLANCHARD: Right now.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: --home, when we play games, it's usually shirts -- shirts versus  skins. But I'm going to go ahead and keep the tie on.</p><p> CARLSON: You know what? You can be who you are on this show.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Hey.</p><p> CARLSON: If you want to go shirtless, it's up to you but--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I'm a rookie.</p><p> CARLSON: --I'll let you decide.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I'm a rookie.</p><p> CARLSON: OK, good. Well then let me read you the rules, the stringent  rules. You know them, of course.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Oh, yes.</p><p> CARLSON: Hands on buzzers. I ask the questions. The first one to buzz in  gets to answer the question. You must wait until I finish asking it before  you answer. </p><p> You can answer once I acknowledge you by saying your name. Each correct  answer is worth one point. Here's the trick. If you get it wrong, you lose  a point, the cruel math of Final Exam. Best of five wins. Are you ready?</p><p> BLANCHARD: Let's do it. You're ready?</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: All right. All right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: That's a trick. I know you seriously (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: She's good (ph). I know she's -- she's devastating. </p><p> OK. First question. After announcing that she does, in fact, plan to run  for President, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts held a live stream  Q&amp;A session with supporters. And at one point, she stopped taking  questions, so she could grab a beverage from the fridge. Some are saying it  was an embarrassing gap. What kind of drink did she get?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> CARLSON: Lauren Blanchard.</p><p> BLANCHARD: It was a beer.</p><p> CARLSON: A beer?</p><p> BLANCHARD: She popped open a beer.</p><p> CARLSON: Unbelievable. Was it a beer?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Hold on  a sec. I'm going to get me a beer.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But, for some, the moment falling flat, online critics  calling her awkward attempt at drinking beer inauthentic pandering to young  voters.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: For some--</p><p> BLANCHARD: Could have been worse (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --the moment falling flat. They -- they leave out verbs in network  news for some reason. I mean it was a beer. It's exactly right.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: She also got her husband that she kept -- dragged into the shot  as she--</p><p> CARLSON: She did?</p><p> CHAFFETZ: --that was very natural. Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I even -- wasn't even aware of him. What kind of beer? Do you  know?</p><p> BLANCHARD: I think it was something light but--</p><p> CARLSON: It was some sort of non-beer like your carb-free--</p><p> BLANCHARD: I don't--</p><p> CARLSON: --beer or something. I'm not a beer guy. </p><p> All right, question two. The Billboard R&amp;B chart this week features a debut  from an unexpected artist. He's a former U.S. President. He's featured on  the number 22 song. What is his name?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> CARLSON: Lauren.</p><p> BLANCHARD: It's President Obama.</p><p> CARLSON: Is that true? President Obama?</p><p> BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I didn't even know this. Is it President Obama? To the tape we go.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With a rising star in the R&amp;B world, you guys are  going to want to keep an eye on this one. His name, Barack Obama.</p><p> All right, let's listen in.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: With pleasing  expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize the sweet  enjoyment of partaking. In the midst of my fellow citizens--</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It could be (ph).</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, he left Office to make the world better. And that's what he's  doing.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes, I--</p><p> CARLSON: You were right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: --I -- I missed that.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I do. I--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I would have -- you could have given me 20 minutes, I would have  never gotten it.</p><p> CARLSON: I wouldn't have either.</p><p> BLANCHARD: YEs.</p><p> CARLSON: Let's see if he gets (ph) this one. </p><p> Question three. It's a crowded Democratic field coming together for 2020,  even Hollywood considering jumping in, or one member of it. Which award- winning actress, famous for wearing a vial of her husband's blood around  her neck, is thinking about becoming a Democratic candidate?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Oh.</p><p> BLANCHARD: OK. I don't know the story, but the only one who did that was  Angelina Jolie. She was famous for wearing the blood. But I didn't hear  that she was--</p><p> CARLSON: I can't. I can't imagine there's more than one--</p><p> BLANCHARD: --is Angelina getting in?</p><p> CARLSON: --actress in Hollywood--</p><p> BLANCHARD: I would hope not.</p><p> CARLSON: --even in Hollywood, who wears a vial--</p><p> BLANCHARD: I would hope not.</p><p> CARLSON: --of her husband's blood. </p><p> BLANCHARD: Oh.</p><p> CARLSON: Was it Angelina Jolie?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Another 2020 contender, Actress Angelina Jolie is hinting that even  she might run for president in 2020. In an interview with the BBC--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BLANCHARD: Really?</p><p> CARLSON: I think.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: --Ms. Jolie said that she can work with both governments and  militaries, so she may be worthy of high office.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Mark Steyn, ladies and gentlemen. So, I -- I think what our judges  are saying -- congratulations, by the way--</p><p> BLANCHARD: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: --Congressman, is that speed is of the essence.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes, yes.</p><p> CARLSON: And pressing perhaps rather than slapping might be more effective.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: OK.</p><p> BLANCHARD: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: This is a two-point question.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: OK.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Ooh.</p><p> CARLSON: OK?</p><p> CHAFFETZ: All right.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Oh.</p><p> CARLSON: Question four. People in the City of New York believe their city  was being invaded by aliens recently. Why did they think this? Because the  night sky lit up in an electric blue. What was the cause of that?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> CARLSON: Lauren.</p><p> BLANCHARD: It was a Con Ed transformer explosion. It was very weird.</p><p> CARLSON: Man, you are so on it, you're freaking me out. Is that true? Is  Lauren right?</p><p> BLANCHARD: It's all over Twitter.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The cause of the panic? A transformer explosion at a Con  Edison utility substation. Then there was that low frequency hum. Worried  residents fearing the worst called 9-1-1. Some thought it might be the  beginning of an alien invasion.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was freaky. It was like Independence Day in the  movie--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BLANCHARD: He did like compare to (ph)--</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --where you just look up and a -- a weird blue color  that, you know, you haven't seen, lighting up the clouds in the sky.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: As we've noted many times in this show that is just a matter of  time. Right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: She -- she is no doubt good. But can I get a lesson on buzzer  like--</p><p> CARLSON: You know, the judges were just saying--</p><p> BLANCHARD: You got to really like this (ph) you got to--</p><p> CARLSON: --would you -- would you like to take a practice buzz right now?</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Just practice buzz.</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> BLANCHARD: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: It's working.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: All right.</p><p> CARLSON: I -- I think -- I think, actually -- I mean, obviously, she's  deeply informed on the news.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: She would have kicked my butt no matter what.</p><p> CARLSON: But she's also lightning fast.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes. No kidding.</p><p> CARLSON: You have a bunch of brothers, right?</p><p> BLANCHARD: I do.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Two brothers.</p><p> CARLSON: Right, so--</p><p> BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: All right, I-- </p><p> BLANCHARD: Maybe quick (ph).</p><p> CHAFFETZ: --I've never been known for my cat quick reflexes.</p><p> CARLSON: No.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I would say that (ph)--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I get that. I get that. Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Final question, and per the mandate of the National Game Show  Commission, this must be an animal question, and therefore it is. </p><p> Tension was high at Tuesday's Sugar Bowl between the Texas Longhorns and  the Georgia Bulldogs. The mascot for the Texas team, a live 1,800 pounds  steer charged the mascot for the Georgia team. What kind of animal is the  Georgia mascot?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> CARLSON: Holy smokes! Lauren.</p><p> BLANCHARD: It's a bull dog. The Georgia Bulldogs?</p><p> CARLSON: Was the answer in the question? To the tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Before the Sugar Bowl, the Texas Longhorns' 1,800  pound mascot, Bevo, charging Georgia's Bulldog, Uga, after breaking out of  its pen.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Holy smokes!</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nobody was hurt though but that's a bit of a scary  situation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BLANCHARD: Great.</p><p> CARLSON: Lauren Blanchard--</p><p> BLANCHARD: I don't believe it (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --highest score ever achieved on this show.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Ooh.</p><p> CARLSON: Congressman, I don't judge you for a second. I would have had the  exact same score because she is absolutely unbeatable. She--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Next time, I'm going to put the coat on.</p><p> CARLSON: I -- I don't know. I don't think that -- I don't--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I can study enough.</p><p> CARLSON: --I'm not sure that any accessory could help because she's that  good. OK. You get another Erik Wemple mug--</p><p> BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --which commemorates the now famous appearance of Mr. Wemple from  the Washington Post website on our show.</p><p> BLANCHARD: I gave one to my parents for Christmas so--</p><p> CARLSON: Good.</p><p> BLANCHARD: --now they'll have two.</p><p> CARLSON: And you'll be hosting Laura Ingraham tonight.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: 10 o'clock.</p><p> CARLSON: It's going to be good?</p><p> CHAFFETZ: It'd be good. </p><p> CARLSON: I'll--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: There's so much out there.</p><p> CARLSON: --I'll be sitting with my Erik Wemple mug watching you. Thank you  both very much.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: That's it for Final Exam tonight. Pay attention, close attention,  to the news, especially weird news, every week. Tune in next Thursday to  see if you can beat our experts. We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Well this show is committed to taking a much closer look at big  tech. Contrary to many people's expectations, technology companies have  turned out to be the single biggest threat to your freedom of speech, to  many of your rights and, in fact, your well-being, certainly to your  privacy, as an American. So, we're always looking to know more.</p><p> Trace Gallagher joins us tonight with what he's found. Trace?</p><p> TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, Zhou Fengsuo was a  Chinese Human Rights Activist, based in New York. But the professional  networking site, LinkedIn, blocked his profile page in China, because of  \"Specific content,\" though the company did not say what specific content  ran afoul of Chinese policy.</p><p> Instead, they wrote this, quoting, \"While we strongly support freedom of  expression, we recognized that when we launched that we would need to  adhere to the requirements of the Chinese government in order to operate in  China.\"</p><p> But Human Rights groups say this has nothing to do with violating Chinese  laws and everything to do with trying to silence Chinese dissidents. Turns  out, Zhou was a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen  Square. </p><p> But breaking tonight, LinkedIn has now restored Mr. Zhou's page saying it  made a mistake. </p><p> And separately, we thought you should know that documents filed by the  Dutch Chamber of Commerce show that in 2017, Google shifted $23 billion to  a tax shelter in Bermuda. The move is legal, but it does allow the company  to avoid triggering U.S. income taxes and European withholding taxes.  Google says it pays all its taxes and complies with all laws. </p><p> Tucker?</p><p> CARLSON: It is (ph) really shocking. Trace, thank you for that.</p><p> Well, back in this country, as major tech platforms continue to suppress  free speech, people who seek to think for themselves will have to look for  alternatives. And if those alternatives don't exist, they may need to be  created.</p><p> Dave Rubin has reached that conclusion after years of thinking about it.  He, of course, hosts The Rubin Report on YouTube. And, until recently, he  raised money for his show on the crowd-funding site, Patreon. But now,  after Patreon purged several dissenting voices from its service, Rubin and  Professor Jordan Peterson have announced they will be leaving.</p><p> Dave Rubin joins us tonight to explain what he's doing. Dave, thanks a lot  for coming on tonight. One of the reasons this was such an ex--</p><p> DAVID JOSHUA RUBIN, CREATOR AND HOST, THE RUBIN REPORT: Always good to be  with you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --exciting story to hear is that finally someone is opting out and  creating an alternative. What -- what are you going to do now that you've  left this service?</p><p> RUBIN: Yes. Well, I would say the headline here really is that I think the  tech story of 2019 is that the people, the average person, watching your  show, that watches my show, has to decide what kind of internet they want.  And do we want--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIN: --a free internet that respects dissenting opinion that allows for  free expression and free speech and things of that nature? Or do we want a  controlled internet that is basically controlled by the social justice mob  that you did a segment on this show earlier? </p><p> I think, yes, you're right. The reason that Dr. Peterson and I are leaving  Patreon on January 15th, despite it being something like 70 percent of my  company's revenue, which I'm voluntarily giving up--</p><p> CARLSON: Wow.</p><p> RUBIN: --is that it is time for someone to take a stand. It--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIN: --we're just watching our freedoms erode away. We're just giving  them up. We're letting these companies take people out. </p><p> We're letting these companies say, \"No, you can't say this. You can't earn  money. You can't make a living, etcetera, etcetera,\" and it's like, you  know what, at some point, if -- if a couple of us that have some influence  don't stand up, then nobody will. And then this whole -- this whole game,  this whole -- this whole beautiful game about freedom on the internet,  it'll all be over before we know it. </p><p> And that's why Jordan and I are doing this. And -- and there's a huge --  it's a Herculean effort to design a system that will truly respect freedom  and not be destroyed when the mob comes to turn on it.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIN: We've got a lot of technical issues to deal with, technological  issues. We've got -- we've got free speech issues to deal with, legal  issues to deal with, so we've got -- we've got work to do, but let's go  ahead and do it.</p><p> CARLSON: The fact that you're putting 70 percent of your income on the line  to do this, I think, is inspiring. And I hope it is literally an  inspiration to other people. When will this service be up, do you think?</p><p> RUBIN: It -- it -- it's going to take a couple months, you know. We don't  want to over-promise right now. Anyone that's watching your show that  understands tech knows that this is not going to be easy--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIN: --to be built out. But we just felt, look, let's get some of the  middlemen out of the way. Patreon had just become a middleman. And, right  now, people can go to daverubin.com/donate, if they want to support what  I'm doing.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIN: They can go to Dr. Peterson's website if they want to support what  he's doing. And I just believe that actually people have had enough. So,  I'm taking a risk here. </p><p> But I -- I truly believe with no risk comes no reward. And we'll build  something better. And, you know, we've got -- we've got allies, people like  you that are on mainstream media that are helping--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIN: --promote -- promote these stories and ideas. And it's, I think 2019  actually is the year that the people start fighting back.</p><p> CARLSON: Man, I hope that's true.</p><p> RUBIN: Enough of giving into the mobs -- yes.</p><p> CARLSON: God bless you--</p><p> RUBIN: I -- I do too.</p><p> CARLSON: --for taking the first step. Dave Rubin, we're rooting for you,  obviously.</p><p> RUBIN: Thanks, brother.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p> Well we're out of time, sadly. Could go on forever, but we'll be back  tomorrow night. The time is 8:00 P.M. The show is the sworn enemy of lying,  pomposity, smugness, and groupthink, cheerfully, we hope.</p><p> Good night from Washington D.C. Last night, we turned the show over 14  seconds early to Sean Hannity in New York. Now we're giving him three  seconds. Sean Hannity, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p> SEAN HANNITY- HOST: Well, no, it's actually perfect timing. But who's --  who's going to -- oh, oh, my button goes -- go there -- I got to get my  American flag straight, although it's in distress, in some ways.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p> HANNITY: Sorry, Liberals have no sense of humor. Great show, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Thanks, Sean. See you.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Just a moment from now, we'll talk to the Vice President of the United  States, and we'll ask him whether America is getting a Border wall in the  end, and what the White House is willing to give in exchange for that.  That's just ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, Democrats have returned to power on one half of Capitol Hill,  one Chamber. After eight years out, Nancy Pelosi is once again the Speaker  of the House. What can we expect from this brand new Congress?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We don't have to speculate too much because they're already telling us.  Pelosi has signaled her total opposition to securing America's border with  Mexico, for example. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SAVANNAH CLARK GUTHRIE, BROADCAST JOURNALIST, ATTORNEY, CO-ANCHOR OF  TODAY,  NBC NEWS: Are you willing to come up and give him some of this money for  the wall?</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: No.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Because apparently that's the sticking point.</p><p>PELOSI: No. No, nothing for the wall. We're talking about border security.  There is no amount of persuasion he can do to say to us, \"We want you to do  something that is not effective, that costs billions of dollars.\" That  sends the wrong message about who we are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: OK. So there's that. What else can we expect? </p><p>Well Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, now a Member of Congress from New York,  finally, and she's pushing something called a Green New Deal. You may have  heard the term. What does it mean? Well, among other things, it would close  every fossil fuel plant apparently in the United States.</p><p>You'll remember, last summer, in the spirit of closing things, she vowed to  abolish ICE.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR NEW YORK'S 14TH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA MEMBER: I happen  to believe that an agency that has repeatedly, systematically and violent - - and violently committed human rights abuses cannot be reformed.</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Keep in mind, the backdrop against which all of this is  playing out is the slow but certain decline of America's middle-class. So,  what's being done to address that, the single most pressing problem in this  country? </p><p>Well, have no fear, Congressman Richard Neal says the Democratic Party will  fight to dig up President Trump's tax returns, and why wouldn't they, and  more, because according to his colleague, Hank Johnson of Atlanta, the  President is literally like Hitler. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANK JOHNSON, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR GEORGIA'S 4TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT,  DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: Americans elected an authoritarian, anti- immigrant, racist strongman to the nation's highest office. </p><p>(CROWD CHANTING)</p><p>JOHNSON: Donald Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" followers who want  to return America back to a time when White men and White privilege were  unchallenged.</p><p>Much like Hitler took over the Nazi party, Trump has taken over the  Republican Party.</p><p>(CROWD CHANTING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Much like Hitler. Now, what would you do? Sincerely, think about  it for a second. If you really thought Hitler was in the White House, well  you'd stage a coup, obviously. You have no choice morally.</p><p>Democrats aren't saying that out loud, but they now are talking about  impeachment out loud. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This deplorable,  despicable human being that occupies the White House should not be there.  We--</p><p>They say, \"Maxine, please don't say impeachment anymore.\" And when they say  that, I say, \"Impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.\"</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>WATERS: When someone asked, \"But what about Pence? If you were able to  impeach, Pence -- Pence will be worse.\" And I said, \"Look, one at a time.  You knock one down, and then we'll be ready for Pence. We'll get him, too.\"</p><p>(CROWD SHOUTING YES)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: But keep in mind that Maxine Waters is suddenly more than just a  very popular MSNBC guest. As of today, she's chairing the House Financial  Services Committee. She has real power. </p><p>And she plans to use that power to push what she's calling \"Diversity  quotas\" on the private sector. Hire the people Democratic Members of  Congress want you to hire or else. So, that's a large part of the agenda.  Should Americans be excited for that?</p><p>Richard Goodstein is a good barometer of that question. He's a lawyer. He  advised both Clintons over the years and, of course, one of our favorite  guests. Mr. Goodstein, thank you very much for coming. </p><p>Now, I'm not -- let me just say at the outset, I'm not going to ask you to  account for Congressman Hank Johnson, who once suggested that Guam would  capsize if too many American troops landed there because it's Hank Johnson. </p><p>But I do think it's fair to ask you about Nancy Pelosi, the new Speaker of  the House, who said that, \"No. We cannot secure the border between the  United States and Mexico. We cannot have a wall,\" and I'm quoting now,  \"Because it sends the wrong message about who we are.\" </p><p>What message would having a wall send that is not who we are?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER  CLINTON ADVISER: First, Hank Johnson is Hank Aaron's brother-in-law, so  he's deserving some credit--</p><p>CARLSON: Is he literally Hank Aaron's brother-in-law?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm not against Hank Johnson.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I think he's hilarious. But there's obviously something wrong with  him (ph).</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, what Nancy Pelosi is saying is what Democrats have been  saying back when they, you know, passed that legislature in '06 about  fencing and in 2013, $46 billion for border security, including $8 billion  specifically for a structure along the border, and tens of thousands of  personnel to monitor it, and all sorts of virtual walls.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: What they're saying is we don't support open borders. That's why  Barack Obama was called by the largest Hispanic organization the, you know,  the -- the Deporter-in-Chief. So--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I'm -- now I'm even more confused. Listen to this. \"Would  you allocate any money for a wall?\"</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The new Speaker was asked. \"No. No, it sends the wrong message  about who we are.\" So, you're saying it's OK to have a virtual wall but not  a real wall?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I'm saying that Donald Trump defined the wall in the campaign --  first he said, why are we having this conversation? He said, \"Mexico is  going to pay for it.\" And now we know that taxpayer is going to. So, can we  at least get him off that?</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know -- wait but hold on, he didn't -- I mean look--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: But--</p><p>CARLSON: --I don't think Mexico is going to pay for it. But just in point  of fact, he didn't say Mexico was going to prepay for it. Mexico can pay  for it later through remittances. But whatever, but that's really not the  point.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: In a 100 years, they may pay for it? But I mean this is--</p><p>CARLSON: Look -- look, my job is not to defend all of his campaign  promises.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: My job is to ask about the country and why can't we have a wall.  I'm serious.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, again, and Trump said, and here's why (ph) I think  there's actually going to be a deal because Trump said, 25-foot concrete  wall. That's what he kind of envisioned, that's what he sold his voters on.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: And I think even John Kelly said, to be honest, not something  that we hear every day from the White House, it's not a wall, OK? So, what  we're saying is that -- we're quibbling now between fencing and virtual  this and that--</p><p>CARLSON: But I -- I get it. But what's the difference? So, Trump promises  something that I hope he can deliver, which is a tall concrete barrier that  actually--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --would slow down dramatically the inflow of illegals into our  country. Nancy Pelosi says, \"No, no, that's not the message we want to  send,\" and I -- what does that mean? </p><p>What -- what message does it send that we care too much about our people,  that we're serious about territorial integrity like what is the bad message  that that would send?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: So, again, when Democrats held the White House, fewer people  were coming into the country than now. There were more deportations than  there are now. So, the suggestion that somehow Democrats are wanting--</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm -- I'm still confused.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --open borders is a myth.</p><p>CARLSON: You're not going to address my question.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No, I -- I will but--</p><p>CARLSON: Look, I don't want to be mean.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No, no it's not mean.</p><p>CARLSON: You know--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Look, the fact of the matter is what she's saying is what border  experts say by and large--</p><p>CARLSON: That a virtual wall's good but a real wall is bad.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --which is a 25-foot concrete wall is unnecessary. It's -- it's  not necessary to spend that money--</p><p>CARLSON: So that's (ph) necessary.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --and it's not going to work.</p><p>CARLSON: But wait a second. You just said that we have more people coming  in than we did during the (ph) Democrats. But now you're telling me it's  not necessary to secure the border with a big bad wall.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: That -- that is totally--</p><p>CARLSON: A virtual wall would be OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No. It's -- it--</p><p>CARLSON: Because Democrats just want to save money. That's kind of their  motto, right?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Democrats--</p><p>CARLSON: How can we save taxpayers money?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Democrats said in -- in 2013, a bill that passed the Senate with  14 Republicans and that John Boehner refused to bring up, but would have  passed the House too--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --and Barack Obama would have signed it, basically that would  have said we're going to put all these resources in to judges, to Border  Patrol, to, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --electronic monitoring.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But the -- the -- look, I want to (ph) just say like thanks  for history lesson. A lot of dynamics, there are a lot of Republicans  oppose border security, I would never deny that. I'm just saying we have a  chance to get a wall, and they don't want one because it works, and we all  know that. </p><p>Let me ask you about the future. So, we're now hearing from the new  Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters of L.A. that  diversity quotas are coming to the private sector. Here's a quote from a  Democrat to Politico. </p><p>\"Now companies are focused like a laser on identifying top African-American  talent with Congressional Black Caucus relationships to help them  understand and mitigate the striking lack of diversity within their  corporations.\" </p><p>So, what Democrats are saying is you need to hire our friends or else we're  going to punish you. Why is that not corruption?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: In the same way that when Republicans came in, the word went --  I remember there was the K Street Project--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I hated it. I hated it.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --been long enough to (ph) -- well but that's exactly what  happened, which is--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it was disgusting.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --you hire our friends, our former staffers, K Streeters, big  corporations--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --corporation and trade association to know us. So, I mean--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think the Republicans pretended that it was racial justice  when they did that. Did they?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, they're--</p><p>CARLSON: Are you OK with Congress telling companies who they could hire--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well Congress is not telling--</p><p>CARLSON: --what talent (ph) -- yes, they are. They're--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --well, well, legislatively, the only thing that I saw proposed  was something that basically would require disclosure of the make-up of  your board on gender grounds. I don't know that that's such a bad thing.  It's frankly it's public. I mean presumably you list the names and you can  probably intuit who's a male and who's a female--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --so that's only (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Well -- well first of all, I -- I just want to officially  disapprove of your rigid understanding of gender. OK? Just -- as -- as  (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I'm saying for the most part. I didn't say for the most part.</p><p>CARLSON: --for the most part, thank you. I was giving you an out, Richard,  so you--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --wouldn't be hung by your own people.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you so much.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: My pleasure, of course.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you. I'm very excited for this Congress.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Earlier tonight we had an interview with the Vice President. We  asked about the Border wall, the shutdown, and what was going to happen,  and here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Will the deal that resolves the shutdown include any form of  amnesty for people here illegally now?</p><p>MICHAEL RICHARD PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, our focus  is on border security.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course, but the Democrats' focus is on--</p><p>PENCE: Our focus--</p><p>CARLSON: --getting amnesty for people here illegally--</p><p>PENCE: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --will you agree to that?</p><p>PENCE: What -- what we've completely focused on is keeping the President's  promise, to build a wall, to pass legislation that provides other support  for border security, that gives the people that are enforcing our laws at  the border, and across the country enforcing our immigration laws, the  resources and the tools-- </p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --that they need. There's a lot of people talking about a lot of  different ideas. You know, frankly, the better part of a year ago, the  President expressed a willingness to deal with the issue of DREAMers in a  compassionate way for people who were brought here as children, and--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --through no fault of their own. He's discussed that, it's being  talked about.</p><p>CARLSON: But what about--</p><p>PENCE: But look, here's the part where the (ph) President and I are--</p><p>CARLSON: --people who -- who came here as adults?</p><p>PENCE: --ever since -- ever since the Christmas holiday, the President sent  us to Capitol Hill. I met with Senator Schumer not once but twice. We  engaged in good faith negotiations. The President and I canceled all of our  Christmas vacation plans. We were here in Washington D.C.</p><p>Democrats broke off negotiations about a week ago, but the President's made  it clear. We're here to make a deal, but it's a deal that's going to result  in achieving real gains on border security. And you have no border security  without a wall.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: We will have no deal without a wall. </p><p>CARLSON: If the deal in the end includes allowing people who came here as  adults, intentionally to break our laws, to become citizens, then wouldn't  the message to the rest of us be, why should we obey the law, if people who  intentionally broke it are being rewarded for it? Can you see why that  would be a perverse incentive for the rest of us?</p><p>PENCE: I absolutely can, and I've heard no discussion of that. I've heard  no discussion of--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>PENCE: --amnesty related to this. I -- I heard some Members of the Senate  are talking about maybe including DREAMers in some sort of a negotiated  settlement.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: And the President's posture on all this is, look, we're at 5.6  billion. We have engaged in good faith negotiations. We've made offers.  There's been no counter-offers made. But, again, we -- we heard the  Democrat leadership, the new Speaker of the House this morning again said,  \"No money for the wall.\" </p><p>Well the American people know walls work. And we heard from Border Agents  today in the Oval Office that -- that in areas and sectors where they were  assigned to deal with illegal immigration, the flow of narcotics, human  trafficking, all the -- all the threats to our communities--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --that we face at our border that once they build a wall, you saw  illegal immigration, the flow of narcotics, drop precipitously. And--</p><p>CARLSON: So the bottom line is you will not accept a deal that does not  include a wall, if I'm hearing this right?</p><p>PENCE: I think the President's made -- made it very clear.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PENCE: No wall, no deal. And -- but, look, we really are prepared to  negotiate. We're prepared to talk. We're prepared to listen and--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --and ultimately it all begins with the facts. I mean that's the  reason why the President called the meeting in the Situation Room. We'll be  meeting again tomorrow with Republican and Democrat leadership.</p><p>And I want the American people to know that that, you know, this is a real  crisis at our border. We made progress last year. And it probably was a  result of the fact that the American people elected a new president who  delivered a very strong message about confronting illegal immigration.</p><p>We actually saw a decline in illegal immigration and incursions on our  Southern border. But in the last 12 months, we've literally seen a dramatic  increase in the number of people -- 2,000 people a day--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I've noticed.</p><p>PENCE: --apprehended at our border or found to be inadmissible, trying to  enter our country.</p><p>I mean that represents -- as -- as much as we're all troubled in recent  weeks about the caravans moving north, and there's talks about more  caravans, literally, 2,000 people a day attempt to come into this country  illegally by one means or another. </p><p>We -- we can agree on those facts, come together around solutions, but part  of that solution means a wall. It means a barrier and -- and along our  Southern border.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: And it also means technology, drones, the kind of support that our  Border Agents know will assist them in doing their job. But -- but bottom  line, if there's no wall, there's no deal.</p><p>CARLSON: The President, the other day, announced the withdrawal of the  2,000 American troops in Syria--</p><p>PENCE: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --back to the United States. Nobody in Washington liked that,  including some Republicans. Lindsey Graham said probably not going to  happen. There was a pause on that withdrawal.</p><p>What is the state of that? Are those troops coming home? And if so, when?</p><p>PENCE: You know, President Trump as Commander-in-Chief and as a candidate  made it clear that our -- our number one priority would be destroying ISIS. </p><p>The reality is we have defeated ISIS. We have defeated the Caliphate. And  what the President announced just before Christmas is not that we're giving  up on the fight on ISIS. We're going to continue to lean into the fight of  ISIS. We're going to continue to take the actions that are necessary to  protect the American people and our interests in the region. </p><p>But the President is determined, in consultation with military commanders,  including in al-Asad Air Force Base when he was there just after Christmas  that it's no longer necessary for us to have American forces in harm's way  in Northeastern Syria to accomplish that.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think we can expect in the next few months those troops to  come back?</p><p>PENCE: Well I think the President's made it clear. We're -- we're going to  do this and are doing this in an orderly way. </p><p>I heard him in dozens and dozens of speeches talk about bringing our troops  home wherever we could around the world. This is not a -- a president  that's interested--</p><p>CARLSON: So -- no, no he definitely said that, of course.</p><p>PENCE: --in seeing American forces all over the world. They accomplished --  they accomplished the task that we gave--</p><p>CARLSON: But what about Afghanistan? I'm just--</p><p>PENCE: --them to accomplish, defeating the Caliphate.</p><p>CARLSON: --right.</p><p>PENCE: And now we can bring them out of Syria.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that we're winning the conflict in Afghanistan? Do  you think the United States benefits from the continued presence of such a  large number of U.S. troops there?</p><p>PENCE: Well, the President is in the process of evaluating that, as we  speak. I was in Afghanistan last year.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PENCE: In his speech in August, President Trump, basically through new  rules of engagement, new resources, additional military personnel, gave our  folks on the ground the ability to take the fight, be at the tip of the  spear, supporting the Afghan National Army in the battle against the  Taliban, ISIS Khorasan, Al-Qaeda, re-emerging in Afghanistan.</p><p>CARLSON: Is it working?</p><p>PENCE: And it's been a tough fight. I mean the President's been very clear  about that. And now, I think the President's in the process of evaluating  options about what has been, as you know, Tucker, we both lived through it  in the last two decades, what has been a -- an 18-year conflict in  Afghanistan--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PENCE: --and determining what our best options are, in terms of putting  America first, protecting America's interests in the region, making sure  that we can confront terrorism--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --if it -- if it rears its head once again. But the President's  looking at ways in Syria, and perhaps even in Afghanistan, where we can  have less of a military commitment and see those resources and those troops  coming home.</p><p>CARLSON: Mr. Vice President, thank you.</p><p>PENCE: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I appreciate it.</p><p>PENCE: Good to be with you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well on our first show of the year, which was last night, we  highlighted and tried to explain the decline of men in Middle America, and  how it's devastating this country. And it is. </p><p>That segment got a huge response from viewers. But some people hated it,  the science parts, especially. That's no longer allowed. We'll explain  after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well last night was our first show of the year. So, we decided to  take a minute to talk about the biggest issue facing this country going  forward. </p><p>No, it's not higher GDP growth despite what some think-tank people will  tell you. It's not, definitely not, some obscure Middle-Eastern hellhole  our leaders claim we should be policing forever. It's not even illegal  immigration as big a problem as that is, and as much time as we have spent  talking about it.</p><p>The real problem is families. America used to be the best country in the  world for families. Americans could get married and afford to raise their  own children. If your kids worked hard, you could expect they'd be a little  more successful maybe than you were. That was called the American Dream. </p><p>And for a small group of affluent people, it still exists. They're still  living like it's 1965, and good for them. But for everyone else, that Dream  is dying. America's middle-class is in decline because middle-class  American families are declining.</p><p>So, the question is why is that happening? Well there are a lot of reasons  it's happening. But a major driver of family collapse, the one that nobody  ever talks about for some reason is simple economics, and we explained it  last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Study after study has shown that when men make less than women,  women generally don't want to marry them. Now maybe they should want to  marry them but they don't.</p><p>Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of- wedlock births and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow. More  drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed  to the next generation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Now, let's be clear about that statement. First of all, it is  factually true, and that's the essential test of anything. That's the test  that we go by.</p><p>In 2015, a study by the decidedly non-Conservative Brookings Institution  found that falling male wages caused about a quarter of the decline in  marriage rates over the past 35 years. </p><p>Two years later, MIT researchers found that when factories close, marriage  rates go down, and single parenthood becomes more common. And that, as you  could guess, causes a higher proportion of children to wind up on drugs or  in prison. So, it's not a small thing.</p><p>And, by the way, many other studies have reached the same conclusions over  long periods of time. This is real. So, what we said is a statement of  fact. We wish it weren't. </p><p>In an ideal world, none of this would matter. The marriage rate never would  have declined when manufacturing died and everything in Middle America  would be fine. But it's not. And we're not in charge of that. All we can do  is tell the truth about what happened, which we did because it actually  matters. </p><p>And that turned out to be too much for the people who believe it's their  job to prevent you from knowing why your country is going down the tubes.  Those people got very angry. Here's a selection.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW: And strike it off (ph).</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>BEHAR: You know, it reminds me -- it reminds me of when they blamed women - - women for pregnancy as if he had nothing to do with it.</p><p>SUNNY HOSTIN, ABC NEWS SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; ANALYST, THE VIEW CO- HOST, COLUMNIST, MULTI-PLATFORM JOURNALIST, SOCIAL COMMENTATOR: There's a  woman in the audience. She's like, \"What? What?\" She's over there (ph).</p><p>MEGHAN MARGUERITE MCCAIN, THE VIEW CO-HOST, COLUMNIST, AUTHOR, FORMER FOX  NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Where?</p><p>BEHAR: This -- this idea that, you know, to keep women down that's going on  in the country--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>ABIGAIL HAIGHT HUNTSMAN, TELEVISION PERSONALITY, THE VIEW CO-HOST, ABC: But  Sunny, you said you had friends--</p><p>BEHAR: --and this is just another aspect of it.</p><p>HOSTIN: I don't know. It looked like Loony Town--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Loony Town.</p><p>HOSTIN: --Town to me.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, Loony Town. Notice that no one though contested the facts of  what we said. In fact, later in the show, one of those same hosts admitted  that, in fact, women do strongly prefer marrying men who make more than  they do. </p><p>So, it's true but it's not on the list of approved talking points, so it  can't ever be said out loud. Those are the rules. And anyone who violates  those rules must be punished. </p><p>This is very common. And if you're wondering how we wound up in the Dark  Age we're currently living through, this is how we did. This is why  important science is no longer being conducted. This is why art isn't being  made. This is why comedy is dying. </p><p>It's why people aren't thinking for themselves anymore, which means the end  of creativity. It's why the rest of us stand by like cowards as the  innocent are punished for crimes they didn't commit because we're all  terrified. </p><p>We're terrified of being denounced by some mindless ideologue on TV, or  shamed and ostracized on social media for stepping out of line, or silenced  completely by some big tech firm. A mob of angry children is suddenly in  charge of the country.</p><p>These aren't people seeking a revolution. They're fighting for the status  quo to protect their own status. They are drunk on power. And they're  looking for new people to hurt. Someday, we're going to look back on this  moment with shame and horror. </p><p>But, in the meantime, we should remember that terror only works if we play  along with it. So, what if we decided not to? What if all of us decided to  tell the truth about something every day in public? What would happen then?  What could they do about it? </p><p>They can't punish everybody. We're the majority. Let's try that.</p><p>We're starting tonight with Heather Mac Donald. She's a fearless person, a  Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the Author of the book, The Diversity  Delusion: How Race and Gender Pandering Corrupt the University and  Undermine Our Culture, and she joins us tonight. </p><p>Heather, thanks very much for coming on.</p><p>HEATHER LYNN MAC DONALD, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, CITY JOURNAL, THE DIVERSITY  DELUSION AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, my theory is that when you say the true things, people get  outraged. So, you know, hurt dog barks. But just to be clear, as a social  scientist yourself, I hope you'll confirm for audience that this is not a  controversial statement that male employment and wages directly affect the  marriage rate. Do they not?</p><p>MAC DONALD: Well, first of all, Tucker, I want to commend you for making  the breakdown of marriage a central focus of your show. There's no bigger  social catastrophe of our age than the fact that more and more children are  being raised without their fathers. And the elites understand that.  Marriage has not disappeared from the elites.</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure.</p><p>MAC DONALD: And yet, they are absolutely unwilling to send the message that  fathers are as important to their children as mothers. Their tongues are  tied. They refuse to say it. It's one of those truths that again is being  completely denied by elite culture. </p><p>Why? Because it violates the feminist nostrum that strong women could do it  all. Now, you're right that there's an economic component to this. And --  and, most famously, William Julius Wilson explained the drop in marriage  among the Black community--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --as a result of jobs leaving the Midwest. And he said that the  male unemployment decreases females' willingness to marry. </p><p>But I think you also have to look at a culture explanation -- explanation  because I remember being taken around in a ride-along by a Chicago cop, a  very handsome man, solid job, good pension to look forward to, he had  fathered several children out of wedlock. </p><p>Why? Because the marriage norm had simply disappeared--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --from the Black community. So, I think this is a cultural  matter as well. It's a product to a certain extent of the feminist attack  on males. </p><p>We are living through a period where males are being constantly disparaged  as simply the source of evil in our world. And they are responding  tragically by withdrawing from competition, taking their marbles and going  home. And that is leaving us all at greater risk.</p><p>CARLSON: And in some cases taking their own lives, I would say. I mean the  suicide rate for American men--</p><p>MAC DONALD: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --is higher that it's been in a long time. I would just note that  the problems that William Julius Wilson chronicled, I thought, so well 30  or 40 years ago, are now the problems of rural America which, obviously,  has a completely different racial demographic and political beliefs than  inner-city America. </p><p>And it seems to me that when it happens to two different groups, the very  same thing that would be the wake-up call for our policymakers to say, wait  a second. Maybe we should get involved in thinking about how to fix this  considering in our neighborhoods, where rich people live in -- my  neighborhood, for example, there are no single mothers. Everyone's married  because it works.</p><p>So, why aren't they doing their best to pass on the thing that is working  for them? It just seems grotesque to me.</p><p>MAC DONALD: No, I -- I think we do have to look at Industrial Policy and  make sure that there are good well-paying jobs there. I just wouldn't  assume that that is going to be enough at this point--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --to turn around the culture. </p><p>Again, we need to valorize males. And -- and the culture needs to say males  are not toxic. Masculinity is not toxic. There are male virtues of valor,  courage, chivalry, heroism in war that are really uniquely male. They  should not be disparaged. Females have complementary virtues and values  that are also essential to children.</p><p>CARLSON: So, so wait. Can I ask where does the idea come from that when men  fail, women win? I mean that really is the underlying assumption of like--</p><p>MAC DONALD: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --the dumb people we always play from other shows. \"You know, men  are declining. This is great for us.\" But men and women are totally  interconnected. So, how can the failure of one help the other? Doesn't it  hurt all of us?</p><p>MAC DONALD: Yes. It's a preposterous zero-sum mentality. But there's a lot  of females who are angry, angry for no reason at all. They have an axe on  their -- to grind, a chip on their shoulder, and they're constantly looking  for ways to feel offended, mostly by dredging up sexism from the past,  because it's almost impossible to find today.</p><p>I mean you have females that are excelling in education. There's not a  single mainstream institution that is not twisting itself into knots to  hire and promote as many females as possible. And yet, females are still  ringing their hands over the alleged sexism of the 50s, simply so they can  feel like they're victims.</p><p>Preposterous! I am not a victim. I -- I don't know any female victims,  frankly. But -- but there is a sense that in order for females to succeed,  it has to be at the expense of males and--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --through a constant de-valorization--</p><p>CARLSON: That doesn't work.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --of masculinity.</p><p>CARLSON: It doesn't work. We -- we -- we don't win when some of us lose. I  -- I don't believe that. It's not true. Heather, thank you very much.</p><p>MAC DONALD: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well they're coming after your drinking straws. Now they want to  tax your meat. It's getting bad out here. Mark Steyn joins us after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well huge parts of this country, as you already know, are  breathtakingly beautiful. Yellowstone, Big Sur, Yosemite, the vast forests  of Maine, places like that are what make this a great country.</p><p>If being an environmentalist means anything, it means protecting those  places and countless others across this continental nation, keeping them  clean and protected. So, how are professional environmentalists doing with  that? </p><p>Well, we know, this week, the federal government is shut down and that  means the National Park Service is not cleaning up in our national parks.  That means that trash is piling up. That is an environmental crisis. </p><p>So, we wanted to know how our environmental watchdogs were responding to  it, so we contacted this country's four biggest environmental groups to see  what they were doing about it, The Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, the  Environmental Defense Fund, and the National -- Natural Resources Defense  Council.</p><p>Go to their websites. They'll tell you how they're protecting the soil and  water. By the way, they raise a lot of money on those claims. Combined,  these four groups have an annual revenue of well over $1 billion. </p><p>Over The Nature Conservancy, their endowment is over $6 billion. So, they  could easily help. Picking up trash is not expensive. They're certainly  rich enough to do that. Are they doing it? We called it in (ph) to find  out. None of them even responded. </p><p>And that, of course, means no. They're not doing it. They're not helping.  Now, that may be sad to those of you who grow up -- grew up sending money  to The Sierra Club, which used to concern itself with our physical  environment and did virtuous work.</p><p>But if you've been paying attention for the past 10 years, you shouldn't be  surprised. Actual garbage that's ruining nature? Well that seems small in  importance compared to, I don't know, promoting carbon taxes or unlimited  immigration or gender theory or the various other priorities of the  Democratic Party, which is what these groups spend their time and money  doing.</p><p>And, by the way, that's fine. Lots of groups in Washington do those exact  things. They're political consultants. That's their job. But, at least,  they're honorable enough to pretend they're not protecting the environment.</p><p>So, these groups may not care anymore about picking up garbage but they do  like the idea of controlling your behavior. Across America, scolds (ph) are  stamping out plastic straws, already banned here in Washington, but it  won't stop with straws. Think it will? Huh.</p><p>Some groups are promoting taxes on meat. They're doing this in the name of  promoting health and fighting climate change. Of course, these taxes would  have the added benefit of punishing you.</p><p>Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. He joins us tonight. So, it does, am  I sensing a theme here, Mark, where a certain sort of--</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --upper-income person doesn't feel content until he's really taken  away all the small comforts of those below him?</p><p>STEYN: Absolutely. The Councilman in Santa Barbara, where they introduced  one of these bans on plastic straws, said, we have to regulate, we can't  trust the common sense anymore, we have to regulate every aspect of  people's lives. And after he got a bit of pushback on Twitter or whatever,  he kind of walked that back. </p><p>But it's true. And it's actually the inverse of what you were talking about  with Heather just now that the less anybody notices the vast amount of  human rubble piling up around us, and the more we're prevented from talking  about anything that matters, the moral, the clever people in our society  obsess on peripheral things like plastic straws.</p><p>CARLSON: It's just so interesting though that all of it is aimed downward  at people they believe is--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --are their social inferiors. I can't remember the last time The  Sierra Club went after the Government of China. Some of these groups are  taking money from the Government of China or went after--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --Al Gore for flying privately or went after--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --private airports, the FBOs across the country. Why is it always  aimed at people who make less than they do?</p><p>STEYN: Well I think -- I think it's because it is the pleasure it affords  the elites at actually regulating the masses. You -- you mentioned China.  Supposedly, we ban straws because straws are polluting the oceans--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STEYN: --as you mentioned, eight countries in Asia are responsible for two- thirds of the plastic waste that goes into the oceans, which means that a  192 countries or thereabouts are responsible for the other third.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And America contributes less to plastic waste in the oceans. The  Morocco or Burma or even North Korea, and I don't even know what they got  to throw in the oceans in North Korea because that's not a--</p><p>CARLSON: Not much.</p><p>STEYN: --that's not a consumer society. But it -- it's on -- this is  unglamorous work. Just as the most important aspect of human healthcare is  hygiene, the most important aspect of environmental healthcare is -- is  garbage disposal. </p><p>If -- if instead of the Paris Climate Accord, the -- the nations of the  world got together and decided to raise these Asian countries' level of  trash disposal to Euro-American--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STEYN: --standards, you would have a much better and -- but -- but if you  say to The Sierra Club, do you want to be running on better garbage  disposal, it's not glamorous enough for them.</p><p>CARLSON: It's just, on the meat tax, very quickly, it just seems like this  is not -- this will only affect people who like burgers. And why not for--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --all the problems that people in that income range have, why  hassle them? Is global warming really their fault?</p><p>STEYN: Well they -- if we didn't eat burgers, we wouldn't have cows. And  they take bovine flatulence more seriously than illegal immigration or  anything. I mean the European Union--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --was proposing offsets on that because the Irish Holstein emits  more than the -- emits less than the BullGuard Jersey (ph). So, they were  actually going to be having offsets in that particular sphere in the  European Union. </p><p>I mean as I said, the -- the less we talk about anything that matters--</p><p>CARLSON: Right, exactly.</p><p>STEYN: --the more we obsess on these boutique niche issues.</p><p>CARLSON: That's -- that's such a deep point, as most of your points are.  Mark Steyn, thank you very much.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, ho, ho, ho, it is finally here after a week. Final Exam, can  you beat the experts at remembering the final stories of 2018? How's your  short-term memory? The test ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Thank Heaven in a world gone crazy, there is still Final Exam.  We've come to that time of the week where the news professionals compete  with one another to be crowned the ultimate master of the news. </p><p>The defending champion this week is Fox -- Fox National Correspondent,  Lauren Blanchard, who crushed it last week. Her challenger is a very  accomplished man, former U.S. Congressman, Jason Chaffetz, who is guest- hosting for Laura this evening, so don't miss that, and also works here at  Fox Site (ph).</p><p>Great to see you both.</p><p>LAUREN BLANCHARD, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Good to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: Congressman, are you familiar with what this requires?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON  OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm -- I'm a rookie. But I got  the coat off.</p><p>CARLSON: I like that.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You know -- you know, at--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Right now.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --home, when we play games, it's usually shirts -- shirts versus  skins. But I'm going to go ahead and keep the tie on.</p><p>CARLSON: You know what? You can be who you are on this show.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Hey.</p><p>CARLSON: If you want to go shirtless, it's up to you but--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm a rookie.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'll let you decide.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm a rookie.</p><p>CARLSON: OK, good. Well then let me read you the rules, the stringent  rules. You know them, of course.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Oh, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Hands on buzzers. I ask the questions. The first one to buzz in  gets to answer the question. You must wait until I finish asking it before  you answer. </p><p>You can answer once I acknowledge you by saying your name. Each correct  answer is worth one point. Here's the trick. If you get it wrong, you lose  a point, the cruel math of Final Exam. Best of five wins. Are you ready?</p><p>BLANCHARD: Let's do it. You're ready?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: All right. All right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: That's a trick. I know you seriously (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: She's good (ph). I know she's -- she's devastating. </p><p>OK. First question. After announcing that she does, in fact, plan to run  for President, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts held a live stream  Q&amp;A session with supporters. And at one point, she stopped taking  questions, so she could grab a beverage from the fridge. Some are saying it  was an embarrassing gap. What kind of drink did she get?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CARLSON: Lauren Blanchard.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It was a beer.</p><p>CARLSON: A beer?</p><p>BLANCHARD: She popped open a beer.</p><p>CARLSON: Unbelievable. Was it a beer?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Hold on  a sec. I'm going to get me a beer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But, for some, the moment falling flat, online critics  calling her awkward attempt at drinking beer inauthentic pandering to young  voters.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: For some--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Could have been worse (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --the moment falling flat. They -- they leave out verbs in network  news for some reason. I mean it was a beer. It's exactly right.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: She also got her husband that she kept -- dragged into the shot  as she--</p><p>CARLSON: She did?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --that was very natural. Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I even -- wasn't even aware of him. What kind of beer? Do you  know?</p><p>BLANCHARD: I think it was something light but--</p><p>CARLSON: It was some sort of non-beer like your carb-free--</p><p>BLANCHARD: I don't--</p><p>CARLSON: --beer or something. I'm not a beer guy. </p><p>All right, question two. The Billboard R&amp;B chart this week features a debut  from an unexpected artist. He's a former U.S. President. He's featured on  the number 22 song. What is his name?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CARLSON: Lauren.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It's President Obama.</p><p>CARLSON: Is that true? President Obama?</p><p>BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I didn't even know this. Is it President Obama? To the tape we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With a rising star in the R&amp;B world, you guys are  going to want to keep an eye on this one. His name, Barack Obama.</p><p>All right, let's listen in.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: With pleasing  expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize the sweet  enjoyment of partaking. In the midst of my fellow citizens--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It could be (ph).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, he left Office to make the world better. And that's what he's  doing.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes, I--</p><p>CARLSON: You were right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --I -- I missed that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I do. I--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I would have -- you could have given me 20 minutes, I would have  never gotten it.</p><p>CARLSON: I wouldn't have either.</p><p>BLANCHARD: YEs.</p><p>CARLSON: Let's see if he gets (ph) this one. </p><p>Question three. It's a crowded Democratic field coming together for 2020,  even Hollywood considering jumping in, or one member of it. Which award- winning actress, famous for wearing a vial of her husband's blood around  her neck, is thinking about becoming a Democratic candidate?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Oh.</p><p>BLANCHARD: OK. I don't know the story, but the only one who did that was  Angelina Jolie. She was famous for wearing the blood. But I didn't hear  that she was--</p><p>CARLSON: I can't. I can't imagine there's more than one--</p><p>BLANCHARD: --is Angelina getting in?</p><p>CARLSON: --actress in Hollywood--</p><p>BLANCHARD: I would hope not.</p><p>CARLSON: --even in Hollywood, who wears a vial--</p><p>BLANCHARD: I would hope not.</p><p>CARLSON: --of her husband's blood. </p><p>BLANCHARD: Oh.</p><p>CARLSON: Was it Angelina Jolie?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Another 2020 contender, Actress Angelina Jolie is hinting that even  she might run for president in 2020. In an interview with the BBC--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD: Really?</p><p>CARLSON: I think.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: --Ms. Jolie said that she can work with both governments and  militaries, so she may be worthy of high office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Steyn, ladies and gentlemen. So, I -- I think what our judges  are saying -- congratulations, by the way--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --Congressman, is that speed is of the essence.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And pressing perhaps rather than slapping might be more effective.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: OK.</p><p>BLANCHARD: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: This is a two-point question.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: OK.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Ooh.</p><p>CARLSON: OK?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: All right.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Oh.</p><p>CARLSON: Question four. People in the City of New York believe their city  was being invaded by aliens recently. Why did they think this? Because the  night sky lit up in an electric blue. What was the cause of that?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CARLSON: Lauren.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It was a Con Ed transformer explosion. It was very weird.</p><p>CARLSON: Man, you are so on it, you're freaking me out. Is that true? Is  Lauren right?</p><p>BLANCHARD: It's all over Twitter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The cause of the panic? A transformer explosion at a Con  Edison utility substation. Then there was that low frequency hum. Worried  residents fearing the worst called 9-1-1. Some thought it might be the  beginning of an alien invasion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was freaky. It was like Independence Day in the  movie--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD: He did like compare to (ph)--</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --where you just look up and a -- a weird blue color  that, you know, you haven't seen, lighting up the clouds in the sky.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: As we've noted many times in this show that is just a matter of  time. Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: She -- she is no doubt good. But can I get a lesson on buzzer  like--</p><p>CARLSON: You know, the judges were just saying--</p><p>BLANCHARD: You got to really like this (ph) you got to--</p><p>CARLSON: --would you -- would you like to take a practice buzz right now?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Just practice buzz.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>BLANCHARD: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: It's working.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I think -- I think, actually -- I mean, obviously, she's  deeply informed on the news.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: She would have kicked my butt no matter what.</p><p>CARLSON: But she's also lightning fast.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes. No kidding.</p><p>CARLSON: You have a bunch of brothers, right?</p><p>BLANCHARD: I do.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Two brothers.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, so--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: All right, I-- </p><p>BLANCHARD: Maybe quick (ph).</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --I've never been known for my cat quick reflexes.</p><p>CARLSON: No.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I would say that (ph)--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I get that. I get that. Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Final question, and per the mandate of the National Game Show  Commission, this must be an animal question, and therefore it is. </p><p>Tension was high at Tuesday's Sugar Bowl between the Texas Longhorns and  the Georgia Bulldogs. The mascot for the Texas team, a live 1,800 pounds  steer charged the mascot for the Georgia team. What kind of animal is the  Georgia mascot?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CARLSON: Holy smokes! Lauren.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It's a bull dog. The Georgia Bulldogs?</p><p>CARLSON: Was the answer in the question? To the tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Before the Sugar Bowl, the Texas Longhorns' 1,800  pound mascot, Bevo, charging Georgia's Bulldog, Uga, after breaking out of  its pen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Holy smokes!</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nobody was hurt though but that's a bit of a scary  situation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD: Great.</p><p>CARLSON: Lauren Blanchard--</p><p>BLANCHARD: I don't believe it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --highest score ever achieved on this show.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Ooh.</p><p>CARLSON: Congressman, I don't judge you for a second. I would have had the  exact same score because she is absolutely unbeatable. She--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Next time, I'm going to put the coat on.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I don't know. I don't think that -- I don't--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I can study enough.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not sure that any accessory could help because she's that  good. OK. You get another Erik Wemple mug--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --which commemorates the now famous appearance of Mr. Wemple from  the Washington Post website on our show.</p><p>BLANCHARD: I gave one to my parents for Christmas so--</p><p>CARLSON: Good.</p><p>BLANCHARD: --now they'll have two.</p><p>CARLSON: And you'll be hosting Laura Ingraham tonight.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: 10 o'clock.</p><p>CARLSON: It's going to be good?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It'd be good. </p><p>CARLSON: I'll--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: There's so much out there.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'll be sitting with my Erik Wemple mug watching you. Thank you  both very much.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: That's it for Final Exam tonight. Pay attention, close attention,  to the news, especially weird news, every week. Tune in next Thursday to  see if you can beat our experts. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well this show is committed to taking a much closer look at big  tech. Contrary to many people's expectations, technology companies have  turned out to be the single biggest threat to your freedom of speech, to  many of your rights and, in fact, your well-being, certainly to your  privacy, as an American. So, we're always looking to know more.</p><p>Trace Gallagher joins us tonight with what he's found. Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, Zhou Fengsuo was a  Chinese Human Rights Activist, based in New York. But the professional  networking site, LinkedIn, blocked his profile page in China, because of  \"Specific content,\" though the company did not say what specific content  ran afoul of Chinese policy.</p><p>Instead, they wrote this, quoting, \"While we strongly support freedom of  expression, we recognized that when we launched that we would need to  adhere to the requirements of the Chinese government in order to operate in  China.\"</p><p>But Human Rights groups say this has nothing to do with violating Chinese  laws and everything to do with trying to silence Chinese dissidents. Turns  out, Zhou was a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen  Square. </p><p>But breaking tonight, LinkedIn has now restored Mr. Zhou's page saying it  made a mistake. </p><p>And separately, we thought you should know that documents filed by the  Dutch Chamber of Commerce show that in 2017, Google shifted $23 billion to  a tax shelter in Bermuda. The move is legal, but it does allow the company  to avoid triggering U.S. income taxes and European withholding taxes.  Google says it pays all its taxes and complies with all laws. </p><p>Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: It is (ph) really shocking. Trace, thank you for that.</p><p>Well, back in this country, as major tech platforms continue to suppress  free speech, people who seek to think for themselves will have to look for  alternatives. And if those alternatives don't exist, they may need to be  created.</p><p>Dave Rubin has reached that conclusion after years of thinking about it.  He, of course, hosts The Rubin Report on YouTube. And, until recently, he  raised money for his show on the crowd-funding site, Patreon. But now,  after Patreon purged several dissenting voices from its service, Rubin and  Professor Jordan Peterson have announced they will be leaving.</p><p>Dave Rubin joins us tonight to explain what he's doing. Dave, thanks a lot  for coming on tonight. One of the reasons this was such an ex--</p><p>DAVID JOSHUA RUBIN, CREATOR AND HOST, THE RUBIN REPORT: Always good to be  with you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --exciting story to hear is that finally someone is opting out and  creating an alternative. What -- what are you going to do now that you've  left this service?</p><p>RUBIN: Yes. Well, I would say the headline here really is that I think the  tech story of 2019 is that the people, the average person, watching your  show, that watches my show, has to decide what kind of internet they want.  And do we want--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: --a free internet that respects dissenting opinion that allows for  free expression and free speech and things of that nature? Or do we want a  controlled internet that is basically controlled by the social justice mob  that you did a segment on this show earlier? </p><p>I think, yes, you're right. The reason that Dr. Peterson and I are leaving  Patreon on January 15th, despite it being something like 70 percent of my  company's revenue, which I'm voluntarily giving up--</p><p>CARLSON: Wow.</p><p>RUBIN: --is that it is time for someone to take a stand. It--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: --we're just watching our freedoms erode away. We're just giving  them up. We're letting these companies take people out. </p><p>We're letting these companies say, \"No, you can't say this. You can't earn  money. You can't make a living, etcetera, etcetera,\" and it's like, you  know what, at some point, if -- if a couple of us that have some influence  don't stand up, then nobody will. And then this whole -- this whole game,  this whole -- this whole beautiful game about freedom on the internet,  it'll all be over before we know it. </p><p>And that's why Jordan and I are doing this. And -- and there's a huge --  it's a Herculean effort to design a system that will truly respect freedom  and not be destroyed when the mob comes to turn on it.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: We've got a lot of technical issues to deal with, technological  issues. We've got -- we've got free speech issues to deal with, legal  issues to deal with, so we've got -- we've got work to do, but let's go  ahead and do it.</p><p>CARLSON: The fact that you're putting 70 percent of your income on the line  to do this, I think, is inspiring. And I hope it is literally an  inspiration to other people. When will this service be up, do you think?</p><p>RUBIN: It -- it -- it's going to take a couple months, you know. We don't  want to over-promise right now. Anyone that's watching your show that  understands tech knows that this is not going to be easy--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: --to be built out. But we just felt, look, let's get some of the  middlemen out of the way. Patreon had just become a middleman. And, right  now, people can go to daverubin.com/donate, if they want to support what  I'm doing.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: They can go to Dr. Peterson's website if they want to support what  he's doing. And I just believe that actually people have had enough. So,  I'm taking a risk here. </p><p>But I -- I truly believe with no risk comes no reward. And we'll build  something better. And, you know, we've got -- we've got allies, people like  you that are on mainstream media that are helping--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: --promote -- promote these stories and ideas. And it's, I think 2019  actually is the year that the people start fighting back.</p><p>CARLSON: Man, I hope that's true.</p><p>RUBIN: Enough of giving into the mobs -- yes.</p><p>CARLSON: God bless you--</p><p>RUBIN: I -- I do too.</p><p>CARLSON: --for taking the first step. Dave Rubin, we're rooting for you,  obviously.</p><p>RUBIN: Thanks, brother.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well we're out of time, sadly. Could go on forever, but we'll be back  tomorrow night. The time is 8:00 P.M. The show is the sworn enemy of lying,  pomposity, smugness, and groupthink, cheerfully, we hope.</p><p>Good night from Washington D.C. Last night, we turned the show over 14  seconds early to Sean Hannity in New York. Now we're giving him three  seconds. Sean Hannity, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: Well, no, it's actually perfect timing. But who's --  who's going to -- oh, oh, my button goes -- go there -- I got to get my  American flag straight, although it's in distress, in some ways.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p>HANNITY: Sorry, Liberals have no sense of humor. Great show, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks, Sean. See you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Just a moment from now, we'll talk to the Vice President of the United  States, and we'll ask him whether America is getting a Border wall in the  end, and what the White House is willing to give in exchange for that.  That's just ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But first, Democrats have returned to power on one half of Capitol Hill,  one Chamber. After eight years out, Nancy Pelosi is once again the Speaker  of the House. What can we expect from this brand new Congress?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We don't have to speculate too much because they're already telling us.  Pelosi has signaled her total opposition to securing America's border with  Mexico, for example. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SAVANNAH CLARK GUTHRIE, BROADCAST JOURNALIST, ATTORNEY, CO-ANCHOR OF  TODAY,  NBC NEWS: Are you willing to come up and give him some of this money for  the wall?</p><p> NANCY PELOSI, SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: No.</p><p> GUTHRIE: Because apparently that's the sticking point.</p><p> PELOSI: No. No, nothing for the wall. We're talking about border security.  There is no amount of persuasion he can do to say to us, \"We want you to do  something that is not effective, that costs billions of dollars.\" That  sends the wrong message about who we are.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CARLSON: OK. So there's that. What else can we expect? </p><p> Well Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, now a Member of Congress from New York,  finally, and she's pushing something called a Green New Deal. You may have  heard the term. What does it mean? Well, among other things, it would close  every fossil fuel plant apparently in the United States.</p><p> You'll remember, last summer, in the spirit of closing things, she vowed to  abolish ICE.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR NEW YORK'S 14TH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA MEMBER: I happen  to believe that an agency that has repeatedly, systematically and violent - - and violently committed human rights abuses cannot be reformed.</p><p> (CROWD CHEERING)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Keep in mind, the backdrop against which all of this is  playing out is the slow but certain decline of America's middle-class. So,  what's being done to address that, the single most pressing problem in this  country? </p><p> Well, have no fear, Congressman Richard Neal says the Democratic Party will  fight to dig up President Trump's tax returns, and why wouldn't they, and  more, because according to his colleague, Hank Johnson of Atlanta, the  President is literally like Hitler. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HANK JOHNSON, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR GEORGIA'S 4TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT,  DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: Americans elected an authoritarian, anti- immigrant, racist strongman to the nation's highest office. </p><p> (CROWD CHANTING)</p><p> JOHNSON: Donald Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" followers who want  to return America back to a time when White men and White privilege were  unchallenged.</p><p> Much like Hitler took over the Nazi party, Trump has taken over the  Republican Party.</p><p> (CROWD CHANTING)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Much like Hitler. Now, what would you do? Sincerely, think about  it for a second. If you really thought Hitler was in the White House, well  you'd stage a coup, obviously. You have no choice morally.</p><p> Democrats aren't saying that out loud, but they now are talking about  impeachment out loud. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This deplorable,  despicable human being that occupies the White House should not be there.  We--</p><p> They say, \"Maxine, please don't say impeachment anymore.\" And when they say  that, I say, \"Impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.\"</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> WATERS: When someone asked, \"But what about Pence? If you were able to  impeach, Pence -- Pence will be worse.\" And I said, \"Look, one at a time.  You knock one down, and then we'll be ready for Pence. We'll get him, too.\"</p><p> (CROWD SHOUTING YES)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: But keep in mind that Maxine Waters is suddenly more than just a  very popular MSNBC guest. As of today, she's chairing the House Financial  Services Committee. She has real power. </p><p> And she plans to use that power to push what she's calling \"Diversity  quotas\" on the private sector. Hire the people Democratic Members of  Congress want you to hire or else. So, that's a large part of the agenda.  Should Americans be excited for that?</p><p> Richard Goodstein is a good barometer of that question. He's a lawyer. He  advised both Clintons over the years and, of course, one of our favorite  guests. Mr. Goodstein, thank you very much for coming. </p><p> Now, I'm not -- let me just say at the outset, I'm not going to ask you to  account for Congressman Hank Johnson, who once suggested that Guam would  capsize if too many American troops landed there because it's Hank Johnson. </p><p> But I do think it's fair to ask you about Nancy Pelosi, the new Speaker of  the House, who said that, \"No. We cannot secure the border between the  United States and Mexico. We cannot have a wall,\" and I'm quoting now,  \"Because it sends the wrong message about who we are.\" </p><p> What message would having a wall send that is not who we are?</p><p> RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER  CLINTON ADVISER: First, Hank Johnson is Hank Aaron's brother-in-law, so  he's deserving some credit--</p><p> CARLSON: Is he literally Hank Aaron's brother-in-law?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --yes, yes.</p><p> CARLSON: But I'm not against Hank Johnson.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I think he's hilarious. But there's obviously something wrong with  him (ph).</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, what Nancy Pelosi is saying is what Democrats have been  saying back when they, you know, passed that legislature in '06 about  fencing and in 2013, $46 billion for border security, including $8 billion  specifically for a structure along the border, and tens of thousands of  personnel to monitor it, and all sorts of virtual walls.</p><p> CARLSON: Right, right.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: What they're saying is we don't support open borders. That's why  Barack Obama was called by the largest Hispanic organization the, you know,  the -- the Deporter-in-Chief. So--</p><p> CARLSON: Well, I'm -- now I'm even more confused. Listen to this. \"Would  you allocate any money for a wall?\"</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: The new Speaker was asked. \"No. No, it sends the wrong message  about who we are.\" So, you're saying it's OK to have a virtual wall but not  a real wall?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: I'm saying that Donald Trump defined the wall in the campaign --  first he said, why are we having this conversation? He said, \"Mexico is  going to pay for it.\" And now we know that taxpayer is going to. So, can we  at least get him off that?</p><p> CARLSON: I don't know -- wait but hold on, he didn't -- I mean look--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: But--</p><p> CARLSON: --I don't think Mexico is going to pay for it. But just in point  of fact, he didn't say Mexico was going to prepay for it. Mexico can pay  for it later through remittances. But whatever, but that's really not the  point.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: In a 100 years, they may pay for it? But I mean this is--</p><p> CARLSON: Look -- look, my job is not to defend all of his campaign  promises.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: My job is to ask about the country and why can't we have a wall.  I'm serious.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, again, and Trump said, and here's why (ph) I think  there's actually going to be a deal because Trump said, 25-foot concrete  wall. That's what he kind of envisioned, that's what he sold his voters on.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: And I think even John Kelly said, to be honest, not something  that we hear every day from the White House, it's not a wall, OK? So, what  we're saying is that -- we're quibbling now between fencing and virtual  this and that--</p><p> CARLSON: But I -- I get it. But what's the difference? So, Trump promises  something that I hope he can deliver, which is a tall concrete barrier that  actually--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --would slow down dramatically the inflow of illegals into our  country. Nancy Pelosi says, \"No, no, that's not the message we want to  send,\" and I -- what does that mean? </p><p> What -- what message does it send that we care too much about our people,  that we're serious about territorial integrity like what is the bad message  that that would send?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: So, again, when Democrats held the White House, fewer people  were coming into the country than now. There were more deportations than  there are now. So, the suggestion that somehow Democrats are wanting--</p><p> CARLSON: But I'm -- I'm still confused.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --open borders is a myth.</p><p> CARLSON: You're not going to address my question.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: No, I -- I will but--</p><p> CARLSON: Look, I don't want to be mean.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: No, no it's not mean.</p><p> CARLSON: You know--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Look, the fact of the matter is what she's saying is what border  experts say by and large--</p><p> CARLSON: That a virtual wall's good but a real wall is bad.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --which is a 25-foot concrete wall is unnecessary. It's -- it's  not necessary to spend that money--</p><p> CARLSON: So that's (ph) necessary.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --and it's not going to work.</p><p> CARLSON: But wait a second. You just said that we have more people coming  in than we did during the (ph) Democrats. But now you're telling me it's  not necessary to secure the border with a big bad wall.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: That -- that is totally--</p><p> CARLSON: A virtual wall would be OK.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: No. It's -- it--</p><p> CARLSON: Because Democrats just want to save money. That's kind of their  motto, right?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Democrats--</p><p> CARLSON: How can we save taxpayers money?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Democrats said in -- in 2013, a bill that passed the Senate with  14 Republicans and that John Boehner refused to bring up, but would have  passed the House too--</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --and Barack Obama would have signed it, basically that would  have said we're going to put all these resources in to judges, to Border  Patrol, to, you know--</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --electronic monitoring.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. But the -- the -- look, I want to (ph) just say like thanks  for history lesson. A lot of dynamics, there are a lot of Republicans  oppose border security, I would never deny that. I'm just saying we have a  chance to get a wall, and they don't want one because it works, and we all  know that. </p><p> Let me ask you about the future. So, we're now hearing from the new  Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters of L.A. that  diversity quotas are coming to the private sector. Here's a quote from a  Democrat to Politico. </p><p> \"Now companies are focused like a laser on identifying top African-American  talent with Congressional Black Caucus relationships to help them  understand and mitigate the striking lack of diversity within their  corporations.\" </p><p> So, what Democrats are saying is you need to hire our friends or else we're  going to punish you. Why is that not corruption?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: In the same way that when Republicans came in, the word went --  I remember there was the K Street Project--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. I hated it. I hated it.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --been long enough to (ph) -- well but that's exactly what  happened, which is--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, it was disgusting.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --you hire our friends, our former staffers, K Streeters, big  corporations--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --corporation and trade association to know us. So, I mean--</p><p> CARLSON: I don't think the Republicans pretended that it was racial justice  when they did that. Did they?</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well, they're--</p><p> CARLSON: Are you OK with Congress telling companies who they could hire--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Well Congress is not telling--</p><p> CARLSON: --what talent (ph) -- yes, they are. They're--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --well, well, legislatively, the only thing that I saw proposed  was something that basically would require disclosure of the make-up of  your board on gender grounds. I don't know that that's such a bad thing.  It's frankly it's public. I mean presumably you list the names and you can  probably intuit who's a male and who's a female--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: --so that's only (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: Well -- well first of all, I -- I just want to officially  disapprove of your rigid understanding of gender. OK? Just -- as -- as  (ph)--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: I'm saying for the most part. I didn't say for the most part.</p><p> CARLSON: --for the most part, thank you. I was giving you an out, Richard,  so you--</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: --wouldn't be hung by your own people.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you so much.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: My pleasure, of course.</p><p> CARLSON: Good to see you. I'm very excited for this Congress.</p><p> GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Earlier tonight we had an interview with the Vice President. We  asked about the Border wall, the shutdown, and what was going to happen,  and here's what he said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Will the deal that resolves the shutdown include any form of  amnesty for people here illegally now?</p><p> MICHAEL RICHARD PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, our focus  is on border security.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, of course, but the Democrats' focus is on--</p><p> PENCE: Our focus--</p><p> CARLSON: --getting amnesty for people here illegally--</p><p> PENCE: Well--</p><p> CARLSON: --will you agree to that?</p><p> PENCE: What -- what we've completely focused on is keeping the President's  promise, to build a wall, to pass legislation that provides other support  for border security, that gives the people that are enforcing our laws at  the border, and across the country enforcing our immigration laws, the  resources and the tools-- </p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: --that they need. There's a lot of people talking about a lot of  different ideas. You know, frankly, the better part of a year ago, the  President expressed a willingness to deal with the issue of DREAMers in a  compassionate way for people who were brought here as children, and--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: --through no fault of their own. He's discussed that, it's being  talked about.</p><p> CARLSON: But what about--</p><p> PENCE: But look, here's the part where the (ph) President and I are--</p><p> CARLSON: --people who -- who came here as adults?</p><p> PENCE: --ever since -- ever since the Christmas holiday, the President sent  us to Capitol Hill. I met with Senator Schumer not once but twice. We  engaged in good faith negotiations. The President and I canceled all of our  Christmas vacation plans. We were here in Washington D.C.</p><p> Democrats broke off negotiations about a week ago, but the President's made  it clear. We're here to make a deal, but it's a deal that's going to result  in achieving real gains on border security. And you have no border security  without a wall.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: We will have no deal without a wall. </p><p> CARLSON: If the deal in the end includes allowing people who came here as  adults, intentionally to break our laws, to become citizens, then wouldn't  the message to the rest of us be, why should we obey the law, if people who  intentionally broke it are being rewarded for it? Can you see why that  would be a perverse incentive for the rest of us?</p><p> PENCE: I absolutely can, and I've heard no discussion of that. I've heard  no discussion of--</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> PENCE: --amnesty related to this. I -- I heard some Members of the Senate  are talking about maybe including DREAMers in some sort of a negotiated  settlement.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: And the President's posture on all this is, look, we're at 5.6  billion. We have engaged in good faith negotiations. We've made offers.  There's been no counter-offers made. But, again, we -- we heard the  Democrat leadership, the new Speaker of the House this morning again said,  \"No money for the wall.\" </p><p> Well the American people know walls work. And we heard from Border Agents  today in the Oval Office that -- that in areas and sectors where they were  assigned to deal with illegal immigration, the flow of narcotics, human  trafficking, all the -- all the threats to our communities--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: --that we face at our border that once they build a wall, you saw  illegal immigration, the flow of narcotics, drop precipitously. And--</p><p> CARLSON: So the bottom line is you will not accept a deal that does not  include a wall, if I'm hearing this right?</p><p> PENCE: I think the President's made -- made it very clear.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> PENCE: No wall, no deal. And -- but, look, we really are prepared to  negotiate. We're prepared to talk. We're prepared to listen and--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: --and ultimately it all begins with the facts. I mean that's the  reason why the President called the meeting in the Situation Room. We'll be  meeting again tomorrow with Republican and Democrat leadership.</p><p> And I want the American people to know that that, you know, this is a real  crisis at our border. We made progress last year. And it probably was a  result of the fact that the American people elected a new president who  delivered a very strong message about confronting illegal immigration.</p><p> We actually saw a decline in illegal immigration and incursions on our  Southern border. But in the last 12 months, we've literally seen a dramatic  increase in the number of people -- 2,000 people a day--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I've noticed.</p><p> PENCE: --apprehended at our border or found to be inadmissible, trying to  enter our country.</p><p> I mean that represents -- as -- as much as we're all troubled in recent  weeks about the caravans moving north, and there's talks about more  caravans, literally, 2,000 people a day attempt to come into this country  illegally by one means or another. </p><p> We -- we can agree on those facts, come together around solutions, but part  of that solution means a wall. It means a barrier and -- and along our  Southern border.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: And it also means technology, drones, the kind of support that our  Border Agents know will assist them in doing their job. But -- but bottom  line, if there's no wall, there's no deal.</p><p> CARLSON: The President, the other day, announced the withdrawal of the  2,000 American troops in Syria--</p><p> PENCE: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --back to the United States. Nobody in Washington liked that,  including some Republicans. Lindsey Graham said probably not going to  happen. There was a pause on that withdrawal.</p><p> What is the state of that? Are those troops coming home? And if so, when?</p><p> PENCE: You know, President Trump as Commander-in-Chief and as a candidate  made it clear that our -- our number one priority would be destroying ISIS. </p><p> The reality is we have defeated ISIS. We have defeated the Caliphate. And  what the President announced just before Christmas is not that we're giving  up on the fight on ISIS. We're going to continue to lean into the fight of  ISIS. We're going to continue to take the actions that are necessary to  protect the American people and our interests in the region. </p><p> But the President is determined, in consultation with military commanders,  including in al-Asad Air Force Base when he was there just after Christmas  that it's no longer necessary for us to have American forces in harm's way  in Northeastern Syria to accomplish that.</p><p> CARLSON: Do you think we can expect in the next few months those troops to  come back?</p><p> PENCE: Well I think the President's made it clear. We're -- we're going to  do this and are doing this in an orderly way. </p><p> I heard him in dozens and dozens of speeches talk about bringing our troops  home wherever we could around the world. This is not a -- a president  that's interested--</p><p> CARLSON: So -- no, no he definitely said that, of course.</p><p> PENCE: --in seeing American forces all over the world. They accomplished --  they accomplished the task that we gave--</p><p> CARLSON: But what about Afghanistan? I'm just--</p><p> PENCE: --them to accomplish, defeating the Caliphate.</p><p> CARLSON: --right.</p><p> PENCE: And now we can bring them out of Syria.</p><p> CARLSON: Do you think that we're winning the conflict in Afghanistan? Do  you think the United States benefits from the continued presence of such a  large number of U.S. troops there?</p><p> PENCE: Well, the President is in the process of evaluating that, as we  speak. I was in Afghanistan last year.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> PENCE: In his speech in August, President Trump, basically through new  rules of engagement, new resources, additional military personnel, gave our  folks on the ground the ability to take the fight, be at the tip of the  spear, supporting the Afghan National Army in the battle against the  Taliban, ISIS Khorasan, Al-Qaeda, re-emerging in Afghanistan.</p><p> CARLSON: Is it working?</p><p> PENCE: And it's been a tough fight. I mean the President's been very clear  about that. And now, I think the President's in the process of evaluating  options about what has been, as you know, Tucker, we both lived through it  in the last two decades, what has been a -- an 18-year conflict in  Afghanistan--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> PENCE: --and determining what our best options are, in terms of putting  America first, protecting America's interests in the region, making sure  that we can confront terrorism--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PENCE: --if it -- if it rears its head once again. But the President's  looking at ways in Syria, and perhaps even in Afghanistan, where we can  have less of a military commitment and see those resources and those troops  coming home.</p><p> CARLSON: Mr. Vice President, thank you.</p><p> PENCE: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: I appreciate it.</p><p> PENCE: Good to be with you.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Well on our first show of the year, which was last night, we  highlighted and tried to explain the decline of men in Middle America, and  how it's devastating this country. And it is. </p><p> That segment got a huge response from viewers. But some people hated it,  the science parts, especially. That's no longer allowed. We'll explain  after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well last night was our first show of the year. So, we decided to  take a minute to talk about the biggest issue facing this country going  forward. </p><p> No, it's not higher GDP growth despite what some think-tank people will  tell you. It's not, definitely not, some obscure Middle-Eastern hellhole  our leaders claim we should be policing forever. It's not even illegal  immigration as big a problem as that is, and as much time as we have spent  talking about it.</p><p> The real problem is families. America used to be the best country in the  world for families. Americans could get married and afford to raise their  own children. If your kids worked hard, you could expect they'd be a little  more successful maybe than you were. That was called the American Dream. </p><p> And for a small group of affluent people, it still exists. They're still  living like it's 1965, and good for them. But for everyone else, that Dream  is dying. America's middle-class is in decline because middle-class  American families are declining.</p><p> So, the question is why is that happening? Well there are a lot of reasons  it's happening. But a major driver of family collapse, the one that nobody  ever talks about for some reason is simple economics, and we explained it  last night.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Study after study has shown that when men make less than women,  women generally don't want to marry them. Now maybe they should want to  marry them but they don't.</p><p> Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of- wedlock births and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow. More  drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed  to the next generation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Now, let's be clear about that statement. First of all, it is  factually true, and that's the essential test of anything. That's the test  that we go by.</p><p> In 2015, a study by the decidedly non-Conservative Brookings Institution  found that falling male wages caused about a quarter of the decline in  marriage rates over the past 35 years. </p><p> Two years later, MIT researchers found that when factories close, marriage  rates go down, and single parenthood becomes more common. And that, as you  could guess, causes a higher proportion of children to wind up on drugs or  in prison. So, it's not a small thing.</p><p> And, by the way, many other studies have reached the same conclusions over  long periods of time. This is real. So, what we said is a statement of  fact. We wish it weren't. </p><p> In an ideal world, none of this would matter. The marriage rate never would  have declined when manufacturing died and everything in Middle America  would be fine. But it's not. And we're not in charge of that. All we can do  is tell the truth about what happened, which we did because it actually  matters. </p><p> And that turned out to be too much for the people who believe it's their  job to prevent you from knowing why your country is going down the tubes.  Those people got very angry. Here's a selection.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW: And strike it off (ph).</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> BEHAR: You know, it reminds me -- it reminds me of when they blamed women - - women for pregnancy as if he had nothing to do with it.</p><p> SUNNY HOSTIN, ABC NEWS SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; ANALYST, THE VIEW CO- HOST, COLUMNIST, MULTI-PLATFORM JOURNALIST, SOCIAL COMMENTATOR: There's a  woman in the audience. She's like, \"What? What?\" She's over there (ph).</p><p> MEGHAN MARGUERITE MCCAIN, THE VIEW CO-HOST, COLUMNIST, AUTHOR, FORMER FOX  NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Where?</p><p> BEHAR: This -- this idea that, you know, to keep women down that's going on  in the country--</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p> ABIGAIL HAIGHT HUNTSMAN, TELEVISION PERSONALITY, THE VIEW CO-HOST, ABC: But  Sunny, you said you had friends--</p><p> BEHAR: --and this is just another aspect of it.</p><p> HOSTIN: I don't know. It looked like Loony Town--</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Loony Town.</p><p> HOSTIN: --Town to me.</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, Loony Town. Notice that no one though contested the facts of  what we said. In fact, later in the show, one of those same hosts admitted  that, in fact, women do strongly prefer marrying men who make more than  they do. </p><p> So, it's true but it's not on the list of approved talking points, so it  can't ever be said out loud. Those are the rules. And anyone who violates  those rules must be punished. </p><p> This is very common. And if you're wondering how we wound up in the Dark  Age we're currently living through, this is how we did. This is why  important science is no longer being conducted. This is why art isn't being  made. This is why comedy is dying. </p><p> It's why people aren't thinking for themselves anymore, which means the end  of creativity. It's why the rest of us stand by like cowards as the  innocent are punished for crimes they didn't commit because we're all  terrified. </p><p> We're terrified of being denounced by some mindless ideologue on TV, or  shamed and ostracized on social media for stepping out of line, or silenced  completely by some big tech firm. A mob of angry children is suddenly in  charge of the country.</p><p> These aren't people seeking a revolution. They're fighting for the status  quo to protect their own status. They are drunk on power. And they're  looking for new people to hurt. Someday, we're going to look back on this  moment with shame and horror. </p><p> But, in the meantime, we should remember that terror only works if we play  along with it. So, what if we decided not to? What if all of us decided to  tell the truth about something every day in public? What would happen then?  What could they do about it? </p><p> They can't punish everybody. We're the majority. Let's try that.</p><p> We're starting tonight with Heather Mac Donald. She's a fearless person, a  Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the Author of the book, The Diversity  Delusion: How Race and Gender Pandering Corrupt the University and  Undermine Our Culture, and she joins us tonight. </p><p> Heather, thanks very much for coming on.</p><p> HEATHER LYNN MAC DONALD, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, CITY JOURNAL, THE DIVERSITY  DELUSION AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: So, my theory is that when you say the true things, people get  outraged. So, you know, hurt dog barks. But just to be clear, as a social  scientist yourself, I hope you'll confirm for audience that this is not a  controversial statement that male employment and wages directly affect the  marriage rate. Do they not?</p><p> MAC DONALD: Well, first of all, Tucker, I want to commend you for making  the breakdown of marriage a central focus of your show. There's no bigger  social catastrophe of our age than the fact that more and more children are  being raised without their fathers. And the elites understand that.  Marriage has not disappeared from the elites.</p><p> CARLSON: That's for sure.</p><p> MAC DONALD: And yet, they are absolutely unwilling to send the message that  fathers are as important to their children as mothers. Their tongues are  tied. They refuse to say it. It's one of those truths that again is being  completely denied by elite culture. </p><p> Why? Because it violates the feminist nostrum that strong women could do it  all. Now, you're right that there's an economic component to this. And --  and, most famously, William Julius Wilson explained the drop in marriage  among the Black community--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> MAC DONALD: --as a result of jobs leaving the Midwest. And he said that the  male unemployment decreases females' willingness to marry. </p><p> But I think you also have to look at a culture explanation -- explanation  because I remember being taken around in a ride-along by a Chicago cop, a  very handsome man, solid job, good pension to look forward to, he had  fathered several children out of wedlock. </p><p> Why? Because the marriage norm had simply disappeared--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> MAC DONALD: --from the Black community. So, I think this is a cultural  matter as well. It's a product to a certain extent of the feminist attack  on males. </p><p> We are living through a period where males are being constantly disparaged  as simply the source of evil in our world. And they are responding  tragically by withdrawing from competition, taking their marbles and going  home. And that is leaving us all at greater risk.</p><p> CARLSON: And in some cases taking their own lives, I would say. I mean the  suicide rate for American men--</p><p> MAC DONALD: Sure.</p><p> CARLSON: --is higher that it's been in a long time. I would just note that  the problems that William Julius Wilson chronicled, I thought, so well 30  or 40 years ago, are now the problems of rural America which, obviously,  has a completely different racial demographic and political beliefs than  inner-city America. </p><p> And it seems to me that when it happens to two different groups, the very  same thing that would be the wake-up call for our policymakers to say, wait  a second. Maybe we should get involved in thinking about how to fix this  considering in our neighborhoods, where rich people live in -- my  neighborhood, for example, there are no single mothers. Everyone's married  because it works.</p><p> So, why aren't they doing their best to pass on the thing that is working  for them? It just seems grotesque to me.</p><p> MAC DONALD: No, I -- I think we do have to look at Industrial Policy and  make sure that there are good well-paying jobs there. I just wouldn't  assume that that is going to be enough at this point--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> MAC DONALD: --to turn around the culture. </p><p> Again, we need to valorize males. And -- and the culture needs to say males  are not toxic. Masculinity is not toxic. There are male virtues of valor,  courage, chivalry, heroism in war that are really uniquely male. They  should not be disparaged. Females have complementary virtues and values  that are also essential to children.</p><p> CARLSON: So, so wait. Can I ask where does the idea come from that when men  fail, women win? I mean that really is the underlying assumption of like--</p><p> MAC DONALD: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --the dumb people we always play from other shows. \"You know, men  are declining. This is great for us.\" But men and women are totally  interconnected. So, how can the failure of one help the other? Doesn't it  hurt all of us?</p><p> MAC DONALD: Yes. It's a preposterous zero-sum mentality. But there's a lot  of females who are angry, angry for no reason at all. They have an axe on  their -- to grind, a chip on their shoulder, and they're constantly looking  for ways to feel offended, mostly by dredging up sexism from the past,  because it's almost impossible to find today.</p><p> I mean you have females that are excelling in education. There's not a  single mainstream institution that is not twisting itself into knots to  hire and promote as many females as possible. And yet, females are still  ringing their hands over the alleged sexism of the 50s, simply so they can  feel like they're victims.</p><p> Preposterous! I am not a victim. I -- I don't know any female victims,  frankly. But -- but there is a sense that in order for females to succeed,  it has to be at the expense of males and--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> MAC DONALD: --through a constant de-valorization--</p><p> CARLSON: That doesn't work.</p><p> MAC DONALD: --of masculinity.</p><p> CARLSON: It doesn't work. We -- we -- we don't win when some of us lose. I  -- I don't believe that. It's not true. Heather, thank you very much.</p><p> MAC DONALD: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well they're coming after your drinking straws. Now they want to  tax your meat. It's getting bad out here. Mark Steyn joins us after the  break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well huge parts of this country, as you already know, are  breathtakingly beautiful. Yellowstone, Big Sur, Yosemite, the vast forests  of Maine, places like that are what make this a great country.</p><p> If being an environmentalist means anything, it means protecting those  places and countless others across this continental nation, keeping them  clean and protected. So, how are professional environmentalists doing with  that? </p><p> Well, we know, this week, the federal government is shut down and that  means the National Park Service is not cleaning up in our national parks.  That means that trash is piling up. That is an environmental crisis. </p><p> So, we wanted to know how our environmental watchdogs were responding to  it, so we contacted this country's four biggest environmental groups to see  what they were doing about it, The Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, the  Environmental Defense Fund, and the National -- Natural Resources Defense  Council.</p><p> Go to their websites. They'll tell you how they're protecting the soil and  water. By the way, they raise a lot of money on those claims. Combined,  these four groups have an annual revenue of well over $1 billion. </p><p> Over The Nature Conservancy, their endowment is over $6 billion. So, they  could easily help. Picking up trash is not expensive. They're certainly  rich enough to do that. Are they doing it? We called it in (ph) to find  out. None of them even responded. </p><p> And that, of course, means no. They're not doing it. They're not helping.  Now, that may be sad to those of you who grow up -- grew up sending money  to The Sierra Club, which used to concern itself with our physical  environment and did virtuous work.</p><p> But if you've been paying attention for the past 10 years, you shouldn't be  surprised. Actual garbage that's ruining nature? Well that seems small in  importance compared to, I don't know, promoting carbon taxes or unlimited  immigration or gender theory or the various other priorities of the  Democratic Party, which is what these groups spend their time and money  doing.</p><p> And, by the way, that's fine. Lots of groups in Washington do those exact  things. They're political consultants. That's their job. But, at least,  they're honorable enough to pretend they're not protecting the environment.</p><p> So, these groups may not care anymore about picking up garbage but they do  like the idea of controlling your behavior. Across America, scolds (ph) are  stamping out plastic straws, already banned here in Washington, but it  won't stop with straws. Think it will? Huh.</p><p> Some groups are promoting taxes on meat. They're doing this in the name of  promoting health and fighting climate change. Of course, these taxes would  have the added benefit of punishing you.</p><p> Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. He joins us tonight. So, it does, am  I sensing a theme here, Mark, where a certain sort of--</p><p> MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --upper-income person doesn't feel content until he's really taken  away all the small comforts of those below him?</p><p> STEYN: Absolutely. The Councilman in Santa Barbara, where they introduced  one of these bans on plastic straws, said, we have to regulate, we can't  trust the common sense anymore, we have to regulate every aspect of  people's lives. And after he got a bit of pushback on Twitter or whatever,  he kind of walked that back. </p><p> But it's true. And it's actually the inverse of what you were talking about  with Heather just now that the less anybody notices the vast amount of  human rubble piling up around us, and the more we're prevented from talking  about anything that matters, the moral, the clever people in our society  obsess on peripheral things like plastic straws.</p><p> CARLSON: It's just so interesting though that all of it is aimed downward  at people they believe is--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --are their social inferiors. I can't remember the last time The  Sierra Club went after the Government of China. Some of these groups are  taking money from the Government of China or went after--</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --Al Gore for flying privately or went after--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --private airports, the FBOs across the country. Why is it always  aimed at people who make less than they do?</p><p> STEYN: Well I think -- I think it's because it is the pleasure it affords  the elites at actually regulating the masses. You -- you mentioned China.  Supposedly, we ban straws because straws are polluting the oceans--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STEYN: --as you mentioned, eight countries in Asia are responsible for two- thirds of the plastic waste that goes into the oceans, which means that a  192 countries or thereabouts are responsible for the other third.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: And America contributes less to plastic waste in the oceans. The  Morocco or Burma or even North Korea, and I don't even know what they got  to throw in the oceans in North Korea because that's not a--</p><p> CARLSON: Not much.</p><p> STEYN: --that's not a consumer society. But it -- it's on -- this is  unglamorous work. Just as the most important aspect of human healthcare is  hygiene, the most important aspect of environmental healthcare is -- is  garbage disposal. </p><p> If -- if instead of the Paris Climate Accord, the -- the nations of the  world got together and decided to raise these Asian countries' level of  trash disposal to Euro-American--</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> STEYN: --standards, you would have a much better and -- but -- but if you  say to The Sierra Club, do you want to be running on better garbage  disposal, it's not glamorous enough for them.</p><p> CARLSON: It's just, on the meat tax, very quickly, it just seems like this  is not -- this will only affect people who like burgers. And why not for--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --all the problems that people in that income range have, why  hassle them? Is global warming really their fault?</p><p> STEYN: Well they -- if we didn't eat burgers, we wouldn't have cows. And  they take bovine flatulence more seriously than illegal immigration or  anything. I mean the European Union--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --was proposing offsets on that because the Irish Holstein emits  more than the -- emits less than the BullGuard Jersey (ph). So, they were  actually going to be having offsets in that particular sphere in the  European Union. </p><p> I mean as I said, the -- the less we talk about anything that matters--</p><p> CARLSON: Right, exactly.</p><p> STEYN: --the more we obsess on these boutique niche issues.</p><p> CARLSON: That's -- that's such a deep point, as most of your points are.  Mark Steyn, thank you very much.</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, ho, ho, ho, it is finally here after a week. Final Exam, can  you beat the experts at remembering the final stories of 2018? How's your  short-term memory? The test ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Thank Heaven in a world gone crazy, there is still Final Exam.  We've come to that time of the week where the news professionals compete  with one another to be crowned the ultimate master of the news. </p><p> The defending champion this week is Fox -- Fox National Correspondent,  Lauren Blanchard, who crushed it last week. Her challenger is a very  accomplished man, former U.S. Congressman, Jason Chaffetz, who is guest- hosting for Laura this evening, so don't miss that, and also works here at  Fox Site (ph).</p><p> Great to see you both.</p><p> LAUREN BLANCHARD, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Good to see you.</p><p> CARLSON: Congressman, are you familiar with what this requires?</p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON  OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm -- I'm a rookie. But I got  the coat off.</p><p> CARLSON: I like that.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: You know -- you know, at--</p><p> BLANCHARD: Right now.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: --home, when we play games, it's usually shirts -- shirts versus  skins. But I'm going to go ahead and keep the tie on.</p><p> CARLSON: You know what? You can be who you are on this show.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Hey.</p><p> CARLSON: If you want to go shirtless, it's up to you but--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I'm a rookie.</p><p> CARLSON: --I'll let you decide.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I'm a rookie.</p><p> CARLSON: OK, good. Well then let me read you the rules, the stringent  rules. You know them, of course.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Oh, yes.</p><p> CARLSON: Hands on buzzers. I ask the questions. The first one to buzz in  gets to answer the question. You must wait until I finish asking it before  you answer. </p><p> You can answer once I acknowledge you by saying your name. Each correct  answer is worth one point. Here's the trick. If you get it wrong, you lose  a point, the cruel math of Final Exam. Best of five wins. Are you ready?</p><p> BLANCHARD: Let's do it. You're ready?</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: All right. All right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: That's a trick. I know you seriously (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: She's good (ph). I know she's -- she's devastating. </p><p> OK. First question. After announcing that she does, in fact, plan to run  for President, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts held a live stream  Q&amp;A session with supporters. And at one point, she stopped taking  questions, so she could grab a beverage from the fridge. Some are saying it  was an embarrassing gap. What kind of drink did she get?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> CARLSON: Lauren Blanchard.</p><p> BLANCHARD: It was a beer.</p><p> CARLSON: A beer?</p><p> BLANCHARD: She popped open a beer.</p><p> CARLSON: Unbelievable. Was it a beer?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Hold on  a sec. I'm going to get me a beer.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But, for some, the moment falling flat, online critics  calling her awkward attempt at drinking beer inauthentic pandering to young  voters.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: For some--</p><p> BLANCHARD: Could have been worse (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --the moment falling flat. They -- they leave out verbs in network  news for some reason. I mean it was a beer. It's exactly right.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: She also got her husband that she kept -- dragged into the shot  as she--</p><p> CARLSON: She did?</p><p> CHAFFETZ: --that was very natural. Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I even -- wasn't even aware of him. What kind of beer? Do you  know?</p><p> BLANCHARD: I think it was something light but--</p><p> CARLSON: It was some sort of non-beer like your carb-free--</p><p> BLANCHARD: I don't--</p><p> CARLSON: --beer or something. I'm not a beer guy. </p><p> All right, question two. The Billboard R&amp;B chart this week features a debut  from an unexpected artist. He's a former U.S. President. He's featured on  the number 22 song. What is his name?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> CARLSON: Lauren.</p><p> BLANCHARD: It's President Obama.</p><p> CARLSON: Is that true? President Obama?</p><p> BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I didn't even know this. Is it President Obama? To the tape we go.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With a rising star in the R&amp;B world, you guys are  going to want to keep an eye on this one. His name, Barack Obama.</p><p> All right, let's listen in.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: With pleasing  expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize the sweet  enjoyment of partaking. In the midst of my fellow citizens--</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It could be (ph).</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, he left Office to make the world better. And that's what he's  doing.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes, I--</p><p> CARLSON: You were right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: --I -- I missed that.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I do. I--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I would have -- you could have given me 20 minutes, I would have  never gotten it.</p><p> CARLSON: I wouldn't have either.</p><p> BLANCHARD: YEs.</p><p> CARLSON: Let's see if he gets (ph) this one. </p><p> Question three. It's a crowded Democratic field coming together for 2020,  even Hollywood considering jumping in, or one member of it. Which award- winning actress, famous for wearing a vial of her husband's blood around  her neck, is thinking about becoming a Democratic candidate?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Oh.</p><p> BLANCHARD: OK. I don't know the story, but the only one who did that was  Angelina Jolie. She was famous for wearing the blood. But I didn't hear  that she was--</p><p> CARLSON: I can't. I can't imagine there's more than one--</p><p> BLANCHARD: --is Angelina getting in?</p><p> CARLSON: --actress in Hollywood--</p><p> BLANCHARD: I would hope not.</p><p> CARLSON: --even in Hollywood, who wears a vial--</p><p> BLANCHARD: I would hope not.</p><p> CARLSON: --of her husband's blood. </p><p> BLANCHARD: Oh.</p><p> CARLSON: Was it Angelina Jolie?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Another 2020 contender, Actress Angelina Jolie is hinting that even  she might run for president in 2020. In an interview with the BBC--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BLANCHARD: Really?</p><p> CARLSON: I think.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: --Ms. Jolie said that she can work with both governments and  militaries, so she may be worthy of high office.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Mark Steyn, ladies and gentlemen. So, I -- I think what our judges  are saying -- congratulations, by the way--</p><p> BLANCHARD: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: --Congressman, is that speed is of the essence.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes, yes.</p><p> CARLSON: And pressing perhaps rather than slapping might be more effective.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: OK.</p><p> BLANCHARD: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: This is a two-point question.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: OK.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Ooh.</p><p> CARLSON: OK?</p><p> CHAFFETZ: All right.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Oh.</p><p> CARLSON: Question four. People in the City of New York believe their city  was being invaded by aliens recently. Why did they think this? Because the  night sky lit up in an electric blue. What was the cause of that?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> CARLSON: Lauren.</p><p> BLANCHARD: It was a Con Ed transformer explosion. It was very weird.</p><p> CARLSON: Man, you are so on it, you're freaking me out. Is that true? Is  Lauren right?</p><p> BLANCHARD: It's all over Twitter.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The cause of the panic? A transformer explosion at a Con  Edison utility substation. Then there was that low frequency hum. Worried  residents fearing the worst called 9-1-1. Some thought it might be the  beginning of an alien invasion.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was freaky. It was like Independence Day in the  movie--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BLANCHARD: He did like compare to (ph)--</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --where you just look up and a -- a weird blue color  that, you know, you haven't seen, lighting up the clouds in the sky.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: As we've noted many times in this show that is just a matter of  time. Right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: She -- she is no doubt good. But can I get a lesson on buzzer  like--</p><p> CARLSON: You know, the judges were just saying--</p><p> BLANCHARD: You got to really like this (ph) you got to--</p><p> CARLSON: --would you -- would you like to take a practice buzz right now?</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Just practice buzz.</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> BLANCHARD: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: It's working.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: All right.</p><p> CARLSON: I -- I think -- I think, actually -- I mean, obviously, she's  deeply informed on the news.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: She would have kicked my butt no matter what.</p><p> CARLSON: But she's also lightning fast.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes. No kidding.</p><p> CARLSON: You have a bunch of brothers, right?</p><p> BLANCHARD: I do.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Two brothers.</p><p> CARLSON: Right, so--</p><p> BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: All right, I-- </p><p> BLANCHARD: Maybe quick (ph).</p><p> CHAFFETZ: --I've never been known for my cat quick reflexes.</p><p> CARLSON: No.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: I would say that (ph)--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I get that. I get that. Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Final question, and per the mandate of the National Game Show  Commission, this must be an animal question, and therefore it is. </p><p> Tension was high at Tuesday's Sugar Bowl between the Texas Longhorns and  the Georgia Bulldogs. The mascot for the Texas team, a live 1,800 pounds  steer charged the mascot for the Georgia team. What kind of animal is the  Georgia mascot?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> CARLSON: Holy smokes! Lauren.</p><p> BLANCHARD: It's a bull dog. The Georgia Bulldogs?</p><p> CARLSON: Was the answer in the question? To the tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Before the Sugar Bowl, the Texas Longhorns' 1,800  pound mascot, Bevo, charging Georgia's Bulldog, Uga, after breaking out of  its pen.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Holy smokes!</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nobody was hurt though but that's a bit of a scary  situation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BLANCHARD: Great.</p><p> CARLSON: Lauren Blanchard--</p><p> BLANCHARD: I don't believe it (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --highest score ever achieved on this show.</p><p> BLANCHARD: Ooh.</p><p> CARLSON: Congressman, I don't judge you for a second. I would have had the  exact same score because she is absolutely unbeatable. She--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Next time, I'm going to put the coat on.</p><p> CARLSON: I -- I don't know. I don't think that -- I don't--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I can study enough.</p><p> CARLSON: --I'm not sure that any accessory could help because she's that  good. OK. You get another Erik Wemple mug--</p><p> BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --which commemorates the now famous appearance of Mr. Wemple from  the Washington Post website on our show.</p><p> BLANCHARD: I gave one to my parents for Christmas so--</p><p> CARLSON: Good.</p><p> BLANCHARD: --now they'll have two.</p><p> CARLSON: And you'll be hosting Laura Ingraham tonight.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: 10 o'clock.</p><p> CARLSON: It's going to be good?</p><p> CHAFFETZ: It'd be good. </p><p> CARLSON: I'll--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: There's so much out there.</p><p> CARLSON: --I'll be sitting with my Erik Wemple mug watching you. Thank you  both very much.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: That's it for Final Exam tonight. Pay attention, close attention,  to the news, especially weird news, every week. Tune in next Thursday to  see if you can beat our experts. We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Well this show is committed to taking a much closer look at big  tech. Contrary to many people's expectations, technology companies have  turned out to be the single biggest threat to your freedom of speech, to  many of your rights and, in fact, your well-being, certainly to your  privacy, as an American. So, we're always looking to know more.</p><p> Trace Gallagher joins us tonight with what he's found. Trace?</p><p> TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, Zhou Fengsuo was a  Chinese Human Rights Activist, based in New York. But the professional  networking site, LinkedIn, blocked his profile page in China, because of  \"Specific content,\" though the company did not say what specific content  ran afoul of Chinese policy.</p><p> Instead, they wrote this, quoting, \"While we strongly support freedom of  expression, we recognized that when we launched that we would need to  adhere to the requirements of the Chinese government in order to operate in  China.\"</p><p> But Human Rights groups say this has nothing to do with violating Chinese  laws and everything to do with trying to silence Chinese dissidents. Turns  out, Zhou was a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen  Square. </p><p> But breaking tonight, LinkedIn has now restored Mr. Zhou's page saying it  made a mistake. </p><p> And separately, we thought you should know that documents filed by the  Dutch Chamber of Commerce show that in 2017, Google shifted $23 billion to  a tax shelter in Bermuda. The move is legal, but it does allow the company  to avoid triggering U.S. income taxes and European withholding taxes.  Google says it pays all its taxes and complies with all laws. </p><p> Tucker?</p><p> CARLSON: It is (ph) really shocking. Trace, thank you for that.</p><p> Well, back in this country, as major tech platforms continue to suppress  free speech, people who seek to think for themselves will have to look for  alternatives. And if those alternatives don't exist, they may need to be  created.</p><p> Dave Rubin has reached that conclusion after years of thinking about it.  He, of course, hosts The Rubin Report on YouTube. And, until recently, he  raised money for his show on the crowd-funding site, Patreon. But now,  after Patreon purged several dissenting voices from its service, Rubin and  Professor Jordan Peterson have announced they will be leaving.</p><p> Dave Rubin joins us tonight to explain what he's doing. Dave, thanks a lot  for coming on tonight. One of the reasons this was such an ex--</p><p> DAVID JOSHUA RUBIN, CREATOR AND HOST, THE RUBIN REPORT: Always good to be  with you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --exciting story to hear is that finally someone is opting out and  creating an alternative. What -- what are you going to do now that you've  left this service?</p><p> RUBIN: Yes. Well, I would say the headline here really is that I think the  tech story of 2019 is that the people, the average person, watching your  show, that watches my show, has to decide what kind of internet they want.  And do we want--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIN: --a free internet that respects dissenting opinion that allows for  free expression and free speech and things of that nature? Or do we want a  controlled internet that is basically controlled by the social justice mob  that you did a segment on this show earlier? </p><p> I think, yes, you're right. The reason that Dr. Peterson and I are leaving  Patreon on January 15th, despite it being something like 70 percent of my  company's revenue, which I'm voluntarily giving up--</p><p> CARLSON: Wow.</p><p> RUBIN: --is that it is time for someone to take a stand. It--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIN: --we're just watching our freedoms erode away. We're just giving  them up. We're letting these companies take people out. </p><p> We're letting these companies say, \"No, you can't say this. You can't earn  money. You can't make a living, etcetera, etcetera,\" and it's like, you  know what, at some point, if -- if a couple of us that have some influence  don't stand up, then nobody will. And then this whole -- this whole game,  this whole -- this whole beautiful game about freedom on the internet,  it'll all be over before we know it. </p><p> And that's why Jordan and I are doing this. And -- and there's a huge --  it's a Herculean effort to design a system that will truly respect freedom  and not be destroyed when the mob comes to turn on it.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIN: We've got a lot of technical issues to deal with, technological  issues. We've got -- we've got free speech issues to deal with, legal  issues to deal with, so we've got -- we've got work to do, but let's go  ahead and do it.</p><p> CARLSON: The fact that you're putting 70 percent of your income on the line  to do this, I think, is inspiring. And I hope it is literally an  inspiration to other people. When will this service be up, do you think?</p><p> RUBIN: It -- it -- it's going to take a couple months, you know. We don't  want to over-promise right now. Anyone that's watching your show that  understands tech knows that this is not going to be easy--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIN: --to be built out. But we just felt, look, let's get some of the  middlemen out of the way. Patreon had just become a middleman. And, right  now, people can go to daverubin.com/donate, if they want to support what  I'm doing.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIN: They can go to Dr. Peterson's website if they want to support what  he's doing. And I just believe that actually people have had enough. So,  I'm taking a risk here. </p><p> But I -- I truly believe with no risk comes no reward. And we'll build  something better. And, you know, we've got -- we've got allies, people like  you that are on mainstream media that are helping--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIN: --promote -- promote these stories and ideas. And it's, I think 2019  actually is the year that the people start fighting back.</p><p> CARLSON: Man, I hope that's true.</p><p> RUBIN: Enough of giving into the mobs -- yes.</p><p> CARLSON: God bless you--</p><p> RUBIN: I -- I do too.</p><p> CARLSON: --for taking the first step. Dave Rubin, we're rooting for you,  obviously.</p><p> RUBIN: Thanks, brother.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p> Well we're out of time, sadly. Could go on forever, but we'll be back  tomorrow night. The time is 8:00 P.M. The show is the sworn enemy of lying,  pomposity, smugness, and groupthink, cheerfully, we hope.</p><p> Good night from Washington D.C. Last night, we turned the show over 14  seconds early to Sean Hannity in New York. Now we're giving him three  seconds. Sean Hannity, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p> SEAN HANNITY- HOST: Well, no, it's actually perfect timing. But who's --  who's going to -- oh, oh, my button goes -- go there -- I got to get my  American flag straight, although it's in distress, in some ways.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p> HANNITY: Sorry, Liberals have no sense of humor. Great show, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Thanks, Sean. See you.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Just a moment from now, we'll talk to the Vice President of the United  States, and we'll ask him whether America is getting a Border wall in the  end, and what the White House is willing to give in exchange for that.  That's just ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, Democrats have returned to power on one half of Capitol Hill,  one Chamber. After eight years out, Nancy Pelosi is once again the Speaker  of the House. What can we expect from this brand new Congress?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We don't have to speculate too much because they're already telling us.  Pelosi has signaled her total opposition to securing America's border with  Mexico, for example. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SAVANNAH CLARK GUTHRIE, BROADCAST JOURNALIST, ATTORNEY, CO-ANCHOR OF TODAY,  NBC NEWS: Are you willing to come up and give him some of this money for  the wall?</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: No.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Because apparently that's the sticking point.</p><p>PELOSI: No. No, nothing for the wall. We're talking about border security.  There is no amount of persuasion he can do to say to us, \"We want you to do  something that is not effective, that costs billions of dollars.\" That  sends the wrong message about who we are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: OK. So there's that. What else can we expect? </p><p>Well Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, now a Member of Congress from New York,  finally, and she's pushing something called a Green New Deal. You may have  heard the term. What does it mean? Well, among other things, it would close  every fossil fuel plant apparently in the United States.</p><p>You'll remember, last summer, in the spirit of closing things, she vowed to  abolish ICE.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR NEW YORK'S 14TH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA MEMBER: I happen  to believe that an agency that has repeatedly, systematically and violent - - and violently committed human rights abuses cannot be reformed.</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Keep in mind, the backdrop against which all of this is  playing out is the slow but certain decline of America's middle-class. So,  what's being done to address that, the single most pressing problem in this  country? </p><p>Well, have no fear, Congressman Richard Neal says the Democratic Party will  fight to dig up President Trump's tax returns, and why wouldn't they, and  more, because according to his colleague, Hank Johnson of Atlanta, the  President is literally like Hitler. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANK JOHNSON, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR GEORGIA'S 4TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT,  DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: Americans elected an authoritarian, anti- immigrant, racist strongman to the nation's highest office. </p><p>(CROWD CHANTING)</p><p>JOHNSON: Donald Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" followers who want  to return America back to a time when White men and White privilege were  unchallenged.</p><p>Much like Hitler took over the Nazi party, Trump has taken over the  Republican Party.</p><p>(CROWD CHANTING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Much like Hitler. Now, what would you do? Sincerely, think about  it for a second. If you really thought Hitler was in the White House, well  you'd stage a coup, obviously. You have no choice morally.</p><p>Democrats aren't saying that out loud, but they now are talking about  impeachment out loud. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This deplorable,  despicable human being that occupies the White House should not be there.  We--</p><p>They say, \"Maxine, please don't say impeachment anymore.\" And when they say  that, I say, \"Impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.\"</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>WATERS: When someone asked, \"But what about Pence? If you were able to  impeach, Pence -- Pence will be worse.\" And I said, \"Look, one at a time.  You knock one down, and then we'll be ready for Pence. We'll get him, too.\"</p><p>(CROWD SHOUTING YES)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: But keep in mind that Maxine Waters is suddenly more than just a  very popular MSNBC guest. As of today, she's chairing the House Financial  Services Committee. She has real power. </p><p>And she plans to use that power to push what she's calling \"Diversity  quotas\" on the private sector. Hire the people Democratic Members of  Congress want you to hire or else. So, that's a large part of the agenda.  Should Americans be excited for that?</p><p>Richard Goodstein is a good barometer of that question. He's a lawyer. He  advised both Clintons over the years and, of course, one of our favorite  guests. Mr. Goodstein, thank you very much for coming. </p><p>Now, I'm not -- let me just say at the outset, I'm not going to ask you to  account for Congressman Hank Johnson, who once suggested that Guam would  capsize if too many American troops landed there because it's Hank Johnson. </p><p>But I do think it's fair to ask you about Nancy Pelosi, the new Speaker of  the House, who said that, \"No. We cannot secure the border between the  United States and Mexico. We cannot have a wall,\" and I'm quoting now,  \"Because it sends the wrong message about who we are.\" </p><p>What message would having a wall send that is not who we are?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER  CLINTON ADVISER: First, Hank Johnson is Hank Aaron's brother-in-law, so  he's deserving some credit--</p><p>CARLSON: Is he literally Hank Aaron's brother-in-law?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm not against Hank Johnson.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I think he's hilarious. But there's obviously something wrong with  him (ph).</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, what Nancy Pelosi is saying is what Democrats have been  saying back when they, you know, passed that legislature in '06 about  fencing and in 2013, $46 billion for border security, including $8 billion  specifically for a structure along the border, and tens of thousands of  personnel to monitor it, and all sorts of virtual walls.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: What they're saying is we don't support open borders. That's why  Barack Obama was called by the largest Hispanic organization the, you know,  the -- the Deporter-in-Chief. So--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I'm -- now I'm even more confused. Listen to this. \"Would  you allocate any money for a wall?\"</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The new Speaker was asked. \"No. No, it sends the wrong message  about who we are.\" So, you're saying it's OK to have a virtual wall but not  a real wall?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I'm saying that Donald Trump defined the wall in the campaign --  first he said, why are we having this conversation? He said, \"Mexico is  going to pay for it.\" And now we know that taxpayer is going to. So, can we  at least get him off that?</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know -- wait but hold on, he didn't -- I mean look--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: But--</p><p>CARLSON: --I don't think Mexico is going to pay for it. But just in point  of fact, he didn't say Mexico was going to prepay for it. Mexico can pay  for it later through remittances. But whatever, but that's really not the  point.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: In a 100 years, they may pay for it? But I mean this is--</p><p>CARLSON: Look -- look, my job is not to defend all of his campaign  promises.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: My job is to ask about the country and why can't we have a wall.  I'm serious.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, again, and Trump said, and here's why (ph) I think  there's actually going to be a deal because Trump said, 25-foot concrete  wall. That's what he kind of envisioned, that's what he sold his voters on.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: And I think even John Kelly said, to be honest, not something  that we hear every day from the White House, it's not a wall, OK? So, what  we're saying is that -- we're quibbling now between fencing and virtual  this and that--</p><p>CARLSON: But I -- I get it. But what's the difference? So, Trump promises  something that I hope he can deliver, which is a tall concrete barrier that  actually--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --would slow down dramatically the inflow of illegals into our  country. Nancy Pelosi says, \"No, no, that's not the message we want to  send,\" and I -- what does that mean? </p><p>What -- what message does it send that we care too much about our people,  that we're serious about territorial integrity like what is the bad message  that that would send?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: So, again, when Democrats held the White House, fewer people  were coming into the country than now. There were more deportations than  there are now. So, the suggestion that somehow Democrats are wanting--</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm -- I'm still confused.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --open borders is a myth.</p><p>CARLSON: You're not going to address my question.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No, I -- I will but--</p><p>CARLSON: Look, I don't want to be mean.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No, no it's not mean.</p><p>CARLSON: You know--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Look, the fact of the matter is what she's saying is what border  experts say by and large--</p><p>CARLSON: That a virtual wall's good but a real wall is bad.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --which is a 25-foot concrete wall is unnecessary. It's -- it's  not necessary to spend that money--</p><p>CARLSON: So that's (ph) necessary.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --and it's not going to work.</p><p>CARLSON: But wait a second. You just said that we have more people coming  in than we did during the (ph) Democrats. But now you're telling me it's  not necessary to secure the border with a big bad wall.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: That -- that is totally--</p><p>CARLSON: A virtual wall would be OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No. It's -- it--</p><p>CARLSON: Because Democrats just want to save money. That's kind of their  motto, right?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Democrats--</p><p>CARLSON: How can we save taxpayers money?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Democrats said in -- in 2013, a bill that passed the Senate with  14 Republicans and that John Boehner refused to bring up, but would have  passed the House too--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --and Barack Obama would have signed it, basically that would  have said we're going to put all these resources in to judges, to Border  Patrol, to, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --electronic monitoring.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But the -- the -- look, I want to (ph) just say like thanks  for history lesson. A lot of dynamics, there are a lot of Republicans  oppose border security, I would never deny that. I'm just saying we have a  chance to get a wall, and they don't want one because it works, and we all  know that. </p><p>Let me ask you about the future. So, we're now hearing from the new  Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters of L.A. that  diversity quotas are coming to the private sector. Here's a quote from a  Democrat to Politico. </p><p>\"Now companies are focused like a laser on identifying top African-American  talent with Congressional Black Caucus relationships to help them  understand and mitigate the striking lack of diversity within their  corporations.\" </p><p>So, what Democrats are saying is you need to hire our friends or else we're  going to punish you. Why is that not corruption?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: In the same way that when Republicans came in, the word went --  I remember there was the K Street Project--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I hated it. I hated it.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --been long enough to (ph) -- well but that's exactly what  happened, which is--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it was disgusting.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --you hire our friends, our former staffers, K Streeters, big  corporations--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --corporation and trade association to know us. So, I mean--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think the Republicans pretended that it was racial justice  when they did that. Did they?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, they're--</p><p>CARLSON: Are you OK with Congress telling companies who they could hire--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well Congress is not telling--</p><p>CARLSON: --what talent (ph) -- yes, they are. They're--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --well, well, legislatively, the only thing that I saw proposed  was something that basically would require disclosure of the make-up of  your board on gender grounds. I don't know that that's such a bad thing.  It's frankly it's public. I mean presumably you list the names and you can  probably intuit who's a male and who's a female--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --so that's only (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Well -- well first of all, I -- I just want to officially  disapprove of your rigid understanding of gender. OK? Just -- as -- as  (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I'm saying for the most part. I didn't say for the most part.</p><p>CARLSON: --for the most part, thank you. I was giving you an out, Richard,  so you--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --wouldn't be hung by your own people.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you so much.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: My pleasure, of course.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you. I'm very excited for this Congress.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Earlier tonight we had an interview with the Vice President. We  asked about the Border wall, the shutdown, and what was going to happen,  and here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Will the deal that resolves the shutdown include any form of  amnesty for people here illegally now?</p><p>MICHAEL RICHARD PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, our focus  is on border security.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course, but the Democrats' focus is on--</p><p>PENCE: Our focus--</p><p>CARLSON: --getting amnesty for people here illegally--</p><p>PENCE: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --will you agree to that?</p><p>PENCE: What -- what we've completely focused on is keeping the President's  promise, to build a wall, to pass legislation that provides other support  for border security, that gives the people that are enforcing our laws at  the border, and across the country enforcing our immigration laws, the  resources and the tools-- </p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --that they need. There's a lot of people talking about a lot of  different ideas. You know, frankly, the better part of a year ago, the  President expressed a willingness to deal with the issue of DREAMers in a  compassionate way for people who were brought here as children, and--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --through no fault of their own. He's discussed that, it's being  talked about.</p><p>CARLSON: But what about--</p><p>PENCE: But look, here's the part where the (ph) President and I are--</p><p>CARLSON: --people who -- who came here as adults?</p><p>PENCE: --ever since -- ever since the Christmas holiday, the President sent  us to Capitol Hill. I met with Senator Schumer not once but twice. We  engaged in good faith negotiations. The President and I canceled all of our  Christmas vacation plans. We were here in Washington D.C.</p><p>Democrats broke off negotiations about a week ago, but the President's made  it clear. We're here to make a deal, but it's a deal that's going to result  in achieving real gains on border security. And you have no border security  without a wall.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: We will have no deal without a wall. </p><p>CARLSON: If the deal in the end includes allowing people who came here as  adults, intentionally to break our laws, to become citizens, then wouldn't  the message to the rest of us be, why should we obey the law, if people who  intentionally broke it are being rewarded for it? Can you see why that  would be a perverse incentive for the rest of us?</p><p>PENCE: I absolutely can, and I've heard no discussion of that. I've heard  no discussion of--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>PENCE: --amnesty related to this. I -- I heard some Members of the Senate  are talking about maybe including DREAMers in some sort of a negotiated  settlement.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: And the President's posture on all this is, look, we're at 5.6  billion. We have engaged in good faith negotiations. We've made offers.  There's been no counter-offers made. But, again, we -- we heard the  Democrat leadership, the new Speaker of the House this morning again said,  \"No money for the wall.\" </p><p>Well the American people know walls work. And we heard from Border Agents  today in the Oval Office that -- that in areas and sectors where they were  assigned to deal with illegal immigration, the flow of narcotics, human  trafficking, all the -- all the threats to our communities--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --that we face at our border that once they build a wall, you saw  illegal immigration, the flow of narcotics, drop precipitously. And--</p><p>CARLSON: So the bottom line is you will not accept a deal that does not  include a wall, if I'm hearing this right?</p><p>PENCE: I think the President's made -- made it very clear.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PENCE: No wall, no deal. And -- but, look, we really are prepared to  negotiate. We're prepared to talk. We're prepared to listen and--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --and ultimately it all begins with the facts. I mean that's the  reason why the President called the meeting in the Situation Room. We'll be  meeting again tomorrow with Republican and Democrat leadership.</p><p>And I want the American people to know that that, you know, this is a real  crisis at our border. We made progress last year. And it probably was a  result of the fact that the American people elected a new president who  delivered a very strong message about confronting illegal immigration.</p><p>We actually saw a decline in illegal immigration and incursions on our  Southern border. But in the last 12 months, we've literally seen a dramatic  increase in the number of people -- 2,000 people a day--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I've noticed.</p><p>PENCE: --apprehended at our border or found to be inadmissible, trying to  enter our country.</p><p>I mean that represents -- as -- as much as we're all troubled in recent  weeks about the caravans moving north, and there's talks about more  caravans, literally, 2,000 people a day attempt to come into this country  illegally by one means or another. </p><p>We -- we can agree on those facts, come together around solutions, but part  of that solution means a wall. It means a barrier and -- and along our  Southern border.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: And it also means technology, drones, the kind of support that our  Border Agents know will assist them in doing their job. But -- but bottom  line, if there's no wall, there's no deal.</p><p>CARLSON: The President, the other day, announced the withdrawal of the  2,000 American troops in Syria--</p><p>PENCE: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --back to the United States. Nobody in Washington liked that,  including some Republicans. Lindsey Graham said probably not going to  happen. There was a pause on that withdrawal.</p><p>What is the state of that? Are those troops coming home? And if so, when?</p><p>PENCE: You know, President Trump as Commander-in-Chief and as a candidate  made it clear that our -- our number one priority would be destroying ISIS. </p><p>The reality is we have defeated ISIS. We have defeated the Caliphate. And  what the President announced just before Christmas is not that we're giving  up on the fight on ISIS. We're going to continue to lean into the fight of  ISIS. We're going to continue to take the actions that are necessary to  protect the American people and our interests in the region. </p><p>But the President is determined, in consultation with military commanders,  including in al-Asad Air Force Base when he was there just after Christmas  that it's no longer necessary for us to have American forces in harm's way  in Northeastern Syria to accomplish that.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think we can expect in the next few months those troops to  come back?</p><p>PENCE: Well I think the President's made it clear. We're -- we're going to  do this and are doing this in an orderly way. </p><p>I heard him in dozens and dozens of speeches talk about bringing our troops  home wherever we could around the world. This is not a -- a president  that's interested--</p><p>CARLSON: So -- no, no he definitely said that, of course.</p><p>PENCE: --in seeing American forces all over the world. They accomplished --  they accomplished the task that we gave--</p><p>CARLSON: But what about Afghanistan? I'm just--</p><p>PENCE: --them to accomplish, defeating the Caliphate.</p><p>CARLSON: --right.</p><p>PENCE: And now we can bring them out of Syria.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that we're winning the conflict in Afghanistan? Do  you think the United States benefits from the continued presence of such a  large number of U.S. troops there?</p><p>PENCE: Well, the President is in the process of evaluating that, as we  speak. I was in Afghanistan last year.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PENCE: In his speech in August, President Trump, basically through new  rules of engagement, new resources, additional military personnel, gave our  folks on the ground the ability to take the fight, be at the tip of the  spear, supporting the Afghan National Army in the battle against the  Taliban, ISIS Khorasan, Al-Qaeda, re-emerging in Afghanistan.</p><p>CARLSON: Is it working?</p><p>PENCE: And it's been a tough fight. I mean the President's been very clear  about that. And now, I think the President's in the process of evaluating  options about what has been, as you know, Tucker, we both lived through it  in the last two decades, what has been a -- an 18-year conflict in  Afghanistan--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PENCE: --and determining what our best options are, in terms of putting  America first, protecting America's interests in the region, making sure  that we can confront terrorism--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --if it -- if it rears its head once again. But the President's  looking at ways in Syria, and perhaps even in Afghanistan, where we can  have less of a military commitment and see those resources and those troops  coming home.</p><p>CARLSON: Mr. Vice President, thank you.</p><p>PENCE: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I appreciate it.</p><p>PENCE: Good to be with you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well on our first show of the year, which was last night, we  highlighted and tried to explain the decline of men in Middle America, and  how it's devastating this country. And it is. </p><p>That segment got a huge response from viewers. But some people hated it,  the science parts, especially. That's no longer allowed. We'll explain  after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well last night was our first show of the year. So, we decided to  take a minute to talk about the biggest issue facing this country going  forward. </p><p>No, it's not higher GDP growth despite what some think-tank people will  tell you. It's not, definitely not, some obscure Middle-Eastern hellhole  our leaders claim we should be policing forever. It's not even illegal  immigration as big a problem as that is, and as much time as we have spent  talking about it.</p><p>The real problem is families. America used to be the best country in the  world for families. Americans could get married and afford to raise their  own children. If your kids worked hard, you could expect they'd be a little  more successful maybe than you were. That was called the American Dream. </p><p>And for a small group of affluent people, it still exists. They're still  living like it's 1965, and good for them. But for everyone else, that Dream  is dying. America's middle-class is in decline because middle-class  American families are declining.</p><p>So, the question is why is that happening? Well there are a lot of reasons  it's happening. But a major driver of family collapse, the one that nobody  ever talks about for some reason is simple economics, and we explained it  last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Study after study has shown that when men make less than women,  women generally don't want to marry them. Now maybe they should want to  marry them but they don't.</p><p>Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of- wedlock births and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow. More  drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed  to the next generation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Now, let's be clear about that statement. First of all, it is  factually true, and that's the essential test of anything. That's the test  that we go by.</p><p>In 2015, a study by the decidedly non-Conservative Brookings Institution  found that falling male wages caused about a quarter of the decline in  marriage rates over the past 35 years. </p><p>Two years later, MIT researchers found that when factories close, marriage  rates go down, and single parenthood becomes more common. And that, as you  could guess, causes a higher proportion of children to wind up on drugs or  in prison. So, it's not a small thing.</p><p>And, by the way, many other studies have reached the same conclusions over  long periods of time. This is real. So, what we said is a statement of  fact. We wish it weren't. </p><p>In an ideal world, none of this would matter. The marriage rate never would  have declined when manufacturing died and everything in Middle America  would be fine. But it's not. And we're not in charge of that. All we can do  is tell the truth about what happened, which we did because it actually  matters. </p><p>And that turned out to be too much for the people who believe it's their  job to prevent you from knowing why your country is going down the tubes.  Those people got very angry. Here's a selection.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW: And strike it off (ph).</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>BEHAR: You know, it reminds me -- it reminds me of when they blamed women - - women for pregnancy as if he had nothing to do with it.</p><p>SUNNY HOSTIN, ABC NEWS SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; ANALYST, THE VIEW CO- HOST, COLUMNIST, MULTI-PLATFORM JOURNALIST, SOCIAL COMMENTATOR: There's a  woman in the audience. She's like, \"What? What?\" She's over there (ph).</p><p>MEGHAN MARGUERITE MCCAIN, THE VIEW CO-HOST, COLUMNIST, AUTHOR, FORMER FOX  NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Where?</p><p>BEHAR: This -- this idea that, you know, to keep women down that's going on  in the country--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>ABIGAIL HAIGHT HUNTSMAN, TELEVISION PERSONALITY, THE VIEW CO-HOST, ABC: But  Sunny, you said you had friends--</p><p>BEHAR: --and this is just another aspect of it.</p><p>HOSTIN: I don't know. It looked like Loony Town--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Loony Town.</p><p>HOSTIN: --Town to me.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, Loony Town. Notice that no one though contested the facts of  what we said. In fact, later in the show, one of those same hosts admitted  that, in fact, women do strongly prefer marrying men who make more than  they do. </p><p>So, it's true but it's not on the list of approved talking points, so it  can't ever be said out loud. Those are the rules. And anyone who violates  those rules must be punished. </p><p>This is very common. And if you're wondering how we wound up in the Dark  Age we're currently living through, this is how we did. This is why  important science is no longer being conducted. This is why art isn't being  made. This is why comedy is dying. </p><p>It's why people aren't thinking for themselves anymore, which means the end  of creativity. It's why the rest of us stand by like cowards as the  innocent are punished for crimes they didn't commit because we're all  terrified. </p><p>We're terrified of being denounced by some mindless ideologue on TV, or  shamed and ostracized on social media for stepping out of line, or silenced  completely by some big tech firm. A mob of angry children is suddenly in  charge of the country.</p><p>These aren't people seeking a revolution. They're fighting for the status  quo to protect their own status. They are drunk on power. And they're  looking for new people to hurt. Someday, we're going to look back on this  moment with shame and horror. </p><p>But, in the meantime, we should remember that terror only works if we play  along with it. So, what if we decided not to? What if all of us decided to  tell the truth about something every day in public? What would happen then?  What could they do about it? </p><p>They can't punish everybody. We're the majority. Let's try that.</p><p>We're starting tonight with Heather Mac Donald. She's a fearless person, a  Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the Author of the book, The Diversity  Delusion: How Race and Gender Pandering Corrupt the University and  Undermine Our Culture, and she joins us tonight. </p><p>Heather, thanks very much for coming on.</p><p>HEATHER LYNN MAC DONALD, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, CITY JOURNAL, THE DIVERSITY  DELUSION AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, my theory is that when you say the true things, people get  outraged. So, you know, hurt dog barks. But just to be clear, as a social  scientist yourself, I hope you'll confirm for audience that this is not a  controversial statement that male employment and wages directly affect the  marriage rate. Do they not?</p><p>MAC DONALD: Well, first of all, Tucker, I want to commend you for making  the breakdown of marriage a central focus of your show. There's no bigger  social catastrophe of our age than the fact that more and more children are  being raised without their fathers. And the elites understand that.  Marriage has not disappeared from the elites.</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure.</p><p>MAC DONALD: And yet, they are absolutely unwilling to send the message that  fathers are as important to their children as mothers. Their tongues are  tied. They refuse to say it. It's one of those truths that again is being  completely denied by elite culture. </p><p>Why? Because it violates the feminist nostrum that strong women could do it  all. Now, you're right that there's an economic component to this. And --  and, most famously, William Julius Wilson explained the drop in marriage  among the Black community--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --as a result of jobs leaving the Midwest. And he said that the  male unemployment decreases females' willingness to marry. </p><p>But I think you also have to look at a culture explanation -- explanation  because I remember being taken around in a ride-along by a Chicago cop, a  very handsome man, solid job, good pension to look forward to, he had  fathered several children out of wedlock. </p><p>Why? Because the marriage norm had simply disappeared--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --from the Black community. So, I think this is a cultural  matter as well. It's a product to a certain extent of the feminist attack  on males. </p><p>We are living through a period where males are being constantly disparaged  as simply the source of evil in our world. And they are responding  tragically by withdrawing from competition, taking their marbles and going  home. And that is leaving us all at greater risk.</p><p>CARLSON: And in some cases taking their own lives, I would say. I mean the  suicide rate for American men--</p><p>MAC DONALD: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --is higher that it's been in a long time. I would just note that  the problems that William Julius Wilson chronicled, I thought, so well 30  or 40 years ago, are now the problems of rural America which, obviously,  has a completely different racial demographic and political beliefs than  inner-city America. </p><p>And it seems to me that when it happens to two different groups, the very  same thing that would be the wake-up call for our policymakers to say, wait  a second. Maybe we should get involved in thinking about how to fix this  considering in our neighborhoods, where rich people live in -- my  neighborhood, for example, there are no single mothers. Everyone's married  because it works.</p><p>So, why aren't they doing their best to pass on the thing that is working  for them? It just seems grotesque to me.</p><p>MAC DONALD: No, I -- I think we do have to look at Industrial Policy and  make sure that there are good well-paying jobs there. I just wouldn't  assume that that is going to be enough at this point--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --to turn around the culture. </p><p>Again, we need to valorize males. And -- and the culture needs to say males  are not toxic. Masculinity is not toxic. There are male virtues of valor,  courage, chivalry, heroism in war that are really uniquely male. They  should not be disparaged. Females have complementary virtues and values  that are also essential to children.</p><p>CARLSON: So, so wait. Can I ask where does the idea come from that when men  fail, women win? I mean that really is the underlying assumption of like--</p><p>MAC DONALD: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --the dumb people we always play from other shows. \"You know, men  are declining. This is great for us.\" But men and women are totally  interconnected. So, how can the failure of one help the other? Doesn't it  hurt all of us?</p><p>MAC DONALD: Yes. It's a preposterous zero-sum mentality. But there's a lot  of females who are angry, angry for no reason at all. They have an axe on  their -- to grind, a chip on their shoulder, and they're constantly looking  for ways to feel offended, mostly by dredging up sexism from the past,  because it's almost impossible to find today.</p><p>I mean you have females that are excelling in education. There's not a  single mainstream institution that is not twisting itself into knots to  hire and promote as many females as possible. And yet, females are still  ringing their hands over the alleged sexism of the 50s, simply so they can  feel like they're victims.</p><p>Preposterous! I am not a victim. I -- I don't know any female victims,  frankly. But -- but there is a sense that in order for females to succeed,  it has to be at the expense of males and--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --through a constant de-valorization--</p><p>CARLSON: That doesn't work.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --of masculinity.</p><p>CARLSON: It doesn't work. We -- we -- we don't win when some of us lose. I  -- I don't believe that. It's not true. Heather, thank you very much.</p><p>MAC DONALD: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well they're coming after your drinking straws. Now they want to  tax your meat. It's getting bad out here. Mark Steyn joins us after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well huge parts of this country, as you already know, are  breathtakingly beautiful. Yellowstone, Big Sur, Yosemite, the vast forests  of Maine, places like that are what make this a great country.</p><p>If being an environmentalist means anything, it means protecting those  places and countless others across this continental nation, keeping them  clean and protected. So, how are professional environmentalists doing with  that? </p><p>Well, we know, this week, the federal government is shut down and that  means the National Park Service is not cleaning up in our national parks.  That means that trash is piling up. That is an environmental crisis. </p><p>So, we wanted to know how our environmental watchdogs were responding to  it, so we contacted this country's four biggest environmental groups to see  what they were doing about it, The Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, the  Environmental Defense Fund, and the National -- Natural Resources Defense  Council.</p><p>Go to their websites. They'll tell you how they're protecting the soil and  water. By the way, they raise a lot of money on those claims. Combined,  these four groups have an annual revenue of well over $1 billion. </p><p>Over The Nature Conservancy, their endowment is over $6 billion. So, they  could easily help. Picking up trash is not expensive. They're certainly  rich enough to do that. Are they doing it? We called it in (ph) to find  out. None of them even responded. </p><p>And that, of course, means no. They're not doing it. They're not helping.  Now, that may be sad to those of you who grow up -- grew up sending money  to The Sierra Club, which used to concern itself with our physical  environment and did virtuous work.</p><p>But if you've been paying attention for the past 10 years, you shouldn't be  surprised. Actual garbage that's ruining nature? Well that seems small in  importance compared to, I don't know, promoting carbon taxes or unlimited  immigration or gender theory or the various other priorities of the  Democratic Party, which is what these groups spend their time and money  doing.</p><p>And, by the way, that's fine. Lots of groups in Washington do those exact  things. They're political consultants. That's their job. But, at least,  they're honorable enough to pretend they're not protecting the environment.</p><p>So, these groups may not care anymore about picking up garbage but they do  like the idea of controlling your behavior. Across America, scolds (ph) are  stamping out plastic straws, already banned here in Washington, but it  won't stop with straws. Think it will? Huh.</p><p>Some groups are promoting taxes on meat. They're doing this in the name of  promoting health and fighting climate change. Of course, these taxes would  have the added benefit of punishing you.</p><p>Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. He joins us tonight. So, it does, am  I sensing a theme here, Mark, where a certain sort of--</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --upper-income person doesn't feel content until he's really taken  away all the small comforts of those below him?</p><p>STEYN: Absolutely. The Councilman in Santa Barbara, where they introduced  one of these bans on plastic straws, said, we have to regulate, we can't  trust the common sense anymore, we have to regulate every aspect of  people's lives. And after he got a bit of pushback on Twitter or whatever,  he kind of walked that back. </p><p>But it's true. And it's actually the inverse of what you were talking about  with Heather just now that the less anybody notices the vast amount of  human rubble piling up around us, and the more we're prevented from talking  about anything that matters, the moral, the clever people in our society  obsess on peripheral things like plastic straws.</p><p>CARLSON: It's just so interesting though that all of it is aimed downward  at people they believe is--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --are their social inferiors. I can't remember the last time The  Sierra Club went after the Government of China. Some of these groups are  taking money from the Government of China or went after--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --Al Gore for flying privately or went after--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --private airports, the FBOs across the country. Why is it always  aimed at people who make less than they do?</p><p>STEYN: Well I think -- I think it's because it is the pleasure it affords  the elites at actually regulating the masses. You -- you mentioned China.  Supposedly, we ban straws because straws are polluting the oceans--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STEYN: --as you mentioned, eight countries in Asia are responsible for two- thirds of the plastic waste that goes into the oceans, which means that a  192 countries or thereabouts are responsible for the other third.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And America contributes less to plastic waste in the oceans. The  Morocco or Burma or even North Korea, and I don't even know what they got  to throw in the oceans in North Korea because that's not a--</p><p>CARLSON: Not much.</p><p>STEYN: --that's not a consumer society. But it -- it's on -- this is  unglamorous work. Just as the most important aspect of human healthcare is  hygiene, the most important aspect of environmental healthcare is -- is  garbage disposal. </p><p>If -- if instead of the Paris Climate Accord, the -- the nations of the  world got together and decided to raise these Asian countries' level of  trash disposal to Euro-American--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STEYN: --standards, you would have a much better and -- but -- but if you  say to The Sierra Club, do you want to be running on better garbage  disposal, it's not glamorous enough for them.</p><p>CARLSON: It's just, on the meat tax, very quickly, it just seems like this  is not -- this will only affect people who like burgers. And why not for--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --all the problems that people in that income range have, why  hassle them? Is global warming really their fault?</p><p>STEYN: Well they -- if we didn't eat burgers, we wouldn't have cows. And  they take bovine flatulence more seriously than illegal immigration or  anything. I mean the European Union--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --was proposing offsets on that because the Irish Holstein emits  more than the -- emits less than the BullGuard Jersey (ph). So, they were  actually going to be having offsets in that particular sphere in the  European Union. </p><p>I mean as I said, the -- the less we talk about anything that matters--</p><p>CARLSON: Right, exactly.</p><p>STEYN: --the more we obsess on these boutique niche issues.</p><p>CARLSON: That's -- that's such a deep point, as most of your points are.  Mark Steyn, thank you very much.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, ho, ho, ho, it is finally here after a week. Final Exam, can  you beat the experts at remembering the final stories of 2018? How's your  short-term memory? The test ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Thank Heaven in a world gone crazy, there is still Final Exam.  We've come to that time of the week where the news professionals compete  with one another to be crowned the ultimate master of the news. </p><p>The defending champion this week is Fox -- Fox National Correspondent,  Lauren Blanchard, who crushed it last week. Her challenger is a very  accomplished man, former U.S. Congressman, Jason Chaffetz, who is guest- hosting for Laura this evening, so don't miss that, and also works here at  Fox Site (ph).</p><p>Great to see you both.</p><p>LAUREN BLANCHARD, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Good to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: Congressman, are you familiar with what this requires?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm -- I'm a rookie. But I got  the coat off.</p><p>CARLSON: I like that.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You know -- you know, at--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Right now.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --home, when we play games, it's usually shirts -- shirts versus  skins. But I'm going to go ahead and keep the tie on.</p><p>CARLSON: You know what? You can be who you are on this show.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Hey.</p><p>CARLSON: If you want to go shirtless, it's up to you but--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm a rookie.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'll let you decide.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm a rookie.</p><p>CARLSON: OK, good. Well then let me read you the rules, the stringent  rules. You know them, of course.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Oh, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Hands on buzzers. I ask the questions. The first one to buzz in  gets to answer the question. You must wait until I finish asking it before  you answer. </p><p>You can answer once I acknowledge you by saying your name. Each correct  answer is worth one point. Here's the trick. If you get it wrong, you lose  a point, the cruel math of Final Exam. Best of five wins. Are you ready?</p><p>BLANCHARD: Let's do it. You're ready?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: All right. All right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: That's a trick. I know you seriously (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: She's good (ph). I know she's -- she's devastating. </p><p>OK. First question. After announcing that she does, in fact, plan to run  for President, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts held a live stream  Q&amp;A session with supporters. And at one point, she stopped taking  questions, so she could grab a beverage from the fridge. Some are saying it  was an embarrassing gap. What kind of drink did she get?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CARLSON: Lauren Blanchard.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It was a beer.</p><p>CARLSON: A beer?</p><p>BLANCHARD: She popped open a beer.</p><p>CARLSON: Unbelievable. Was it a beer?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Hold on  a sec. I'm going to get me a beer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But, for some, the moment falling flat, online critics  calling her awkward attempt at drinking beer inauthentic pandering to young  voters.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: For some--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Could have been worse (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --the moment falling flat. They -- they leave out verbs in network  news for some reason. I mean it was a beer. It's exactly right.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: She also got her husband that she kept -- dragged into the shot  as she--</p><p>CARLSON: She did?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --that was very natural. Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I even -- wasn't even aware of him. What kind of beer? Do you  know?</p><p>BLANCHARD: I think it was something light but--</p><p>CARLSON: It was some sort of non-beer like your carb-free--</p><p>BLANCHARD: I don't--</p><p>CARLSON: --beer or something. I'm not a beer guy. </p><p>All right, question two. The Billboard R&amp;B chart this week features a debut  from an unexpected artist. He's a former U.S. President. He's featured on  the number 22 song. What is his name?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CARLSON: Lauren.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It's President Obama.</p><p>CARLSON: Is that true? President Obama?</p><p>BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I didn't even know this. Is it President Obama? To the tape we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With a rising star in the R&amp;B world, you guys are  going to want to keep an eye on this one. His name, Barack Obama.</p><p>All right, let's listen in.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: With pleasing  expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize the sweet  enjoyment of partaking. In the midst of my fellow citizens--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It could be (ph).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, he left Office to make the world better. And that's what he's  doing.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes, I--</p><p>CARLSON: You were right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --I -- I missed that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I do. I--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I would have -- you could have given me 20 minutes, I would have  never gotten it.</p><p>CARLSON: I wouldn't have either.</p><p>BLANCHARD: YEs.</p><p>CARLSON: Let's see if he gets (ph) this one. </p><p>Question three. It's a crowded Democratic field coming together for 2020,  even Hollywood considering jumping in, or one member of it. Which award- winning actress, famous for wearing a vial of her husband's blood around  her neck, is thinking about becoming a Democratic candidate?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Oh.</p><p>BLANCHARD: OK. I don't know the story, but the only one who did that was  Angelina Jolie. She was famous for wearing the blood. But I didn't hear  that she was--</p><p>CARLSON: I can't. I can't imagine there's more than one--</p><p>BLANCHARD: --is Angelina getting in?</p><p>CARLSON: --actress in Hollywood--</p><p>BLANCHARD: I would hope not.</p><p>CARLSON: --even in Hollywood, who wears a vial--</p><p>BLANCHARD: I would hope not.</p><p>CARLSON: --of her husband's blood. </p><p>BLANCHARD: Oh.</p><p>CARLSON: Was it Angelina Jolie?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Another 2020 contender, Actress Angelina Jolie is hinting that even  she might run for president in 2020. In an interview with the BBC--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD: Really?</p><p>CARLSON: I think.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: --Ms. Jolie said that she can work with both governments and  militaries, so she may be worthy of high office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Steyn, ladies and gentlemen. So, I -- I think what our judges  are saying -- congratulations, by the way--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --Congressman, is that speed is of the essence.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And pressing perhaps rather than slapping might be more effective.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: OK.</p><p>BLANCHARD: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: This is a two-point question.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: OK.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Ooh.</p><p>CARLSON: OK?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: All right.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Oh.</p><p>CARLSON: Question four. People in the City of New York believe their city  was being invaded by aliens recently. Why did they think this? Because the  night sky lit up in an electric blue. What was the cause of that?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CARLSON: Lauren.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It was a Con Ed transformer explosion. It was very weird.</p><p>CARLSON: Man, you are so on it, you're freaking me out. Is that true? Is  Lauren right?</p><p>BLANCHARD: It's all over Twitter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The cause of the panic? A transformer explosion at a Con  Edison utility substation. Then there was that low frequency hum. Worried  residents fearing the worst called 9-1-1. Some thought it might be the  beginning of an alien invasion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was freaky. It was like Independence Day in the  movie--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD: He did like compare to (ph)--</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --where you just look up and a -- a weird blue color  that, you know, you haven't seen, lighting up the clouds in the sky.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: As we've noted many times in this show that is just a matter of  time. Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: She -- she is no doubt good. But can I get a lesson on buzzer  like--</p><p>CARLSON: You know, the judges were just saying--</p><p>BLANCHARD: You got to really like this (ph) you got to--</p><p>CARLSON: --would you -- would you like to take a practice buzz right now?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Just practice buzz.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>BLANCHARD: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: It's working.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I think -- I think, actually -- I mean, obviously, she's  deeply informed on the news.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: She would have kicked my butt no matter what.</p><p>CARLSON: But she's also lightning fast.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes. No kidding.</p><p>CARLSON: You have a bunch of brothers, right?</p><p>BLANCHARD: I do.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Two brothers.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, so--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: All right, I-- </p><p>BLANCHARD: Maybe quick (ph).</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --I've never been known for my cat quick reflexes.</p><p>CARLSON: No.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I would say that (ph)--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I get that. I get that. Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Final question, and per the mandate of the National Game Show  Commission, this must be an animal question, and therefore it is. </p><p>Tension was high at Tuesday's Sugar Bowl between the Texas Longhorns and  the Georgia Bulldogs. The mascot for the Texas team, a live 1,800 pounds  steer charged the mascot for the Georgia team. What kind of animal is the  Georgia mascot?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CARLSON: Holy smokes! Lauren.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It's a bull dog. The Georgia Bulldogs?</p><p>CARLSON: Was the answer in the question? To the tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Before the Sugar Bowl, the Texas Longhorns' 1,800  pound mascot, Bevo, charging Georgia's Bulldog, Uga, after breaking out of  its pen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Holy smokes!</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nobody was hurt though but that's a bit of a scary  situation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD: Great.</p><p>CARLSON: Lauren Blanchard--</p><p>BLANCHARD: I don't believe it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --highest score ever achieved on this show.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Ooh.</p><p>CARLSON: Congressman, I don't judge you for a second. I would have had the  exact same score because she is absolutely unbeatable. She--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Next time, I'm going to put the coat on.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I don't know. I don't think that -- I don't--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I can study enough.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not sure that any accessory could help because she's that  good. OK. You get another Erik Wemple mug--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --which commemorates the now famous appearance of Mr. Wemple from  the Washington Post website on our show.</p><p>BLANCHARD: I gave one to my parents for Christmas so--</p><p>CARLSON: Good.</p><p>BLANCHARD: --now they'll have two.</p><p>CARLSON: And you'll be hosting Laura Ingraham tonight.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: 10 o'clock.</p><p>CARLSON: It's going to be good?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It'd be good. </p><p>CARLSON: I'll--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: There's so much out there.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'll be sitting with my Erik Wemple mug watching you. Thank you  both very much.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: That's it for Final Exam tonight. Pay attention, close attention,  to the news, especially weird news, every week. Tune in next Thursday to  see if you can beat our experts. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well this show is committed to taking a much closer look at big  tech. Contrary to many people's expectations, technology companies have  turned out to be the single biggest threat to your freedom of speech, to  many of your rights and, in fact, your well-being, certainly to your  privacy, as an American. So, we're always looking to know more.</p><p>Trace Gallagher joins us tonight with what he's found. Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, Zhou Fengsuo was a  Chinese Human Rights Activist, based in New York. But the professional  networking site, LinkedIn, blocked his profile page in China, because of  \"Specific content,\" though the company did not say what specific content  ran afoul of Chinese policy.</p><p>Instead, they wrote this, quoting, \"While we strongly support freedom of  expression, we recognized that when we launched that we would need to  adhere to the requirements of the Chinese government in order to operate in  China.\"</p><p>But Human Rights groups say this has nothing to do with violating Chinese  laws and everything to do with trying to silence Chinese dissidents. Turns  out, Zhou was a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen  Square. </p><p>But breaking tonight, LinkedIn has now restored Mr. Zhou's page saying it  made a mistake. </p><p>And separately, we thought you should know that documents filed by the  Dutch Chamber of Commerce show that in 2017, Google shifted $23 billion to  a tax shelter in Bermuda. The move is legal, but it does allow the company  to avoid triggering U.S. income taxes and European withholding taxes.  Google says it pays all its taxes and complies with all laws. </p><p>Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: It is (ph) really shocking. Trace, thank you for that.</p><p>Well, back in this country, as major tech platforms continue to suppress  free speech, people who seek to think for themselves will have to look for  alternatives. And if those alternatives don't exist, they may need to be  created.</p><p>Dave Rubin has reached that conclusion after years of thinking about it.  He, of course, hosts The Rubin Report on YouTube. And, until recently, he  raised money for his show on the crowd-funding site, Patreon. But now,  after Patreon purged several dissenting voices from its service, Rubin and  Professor Jordan Peterson have announced they will be leaving.</p><p>Dave Rubin joins us tonight to explain what he's doing. Dave, thanks a lot  for coming on tonight. One of the reasons this was such an ex--</p><p>DAVID JOSHUA RUBIN, CREATOR AND HOST, THE RUBIN REPORT: Always good to be  with you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --exciting story to hear is that finally someone is opting out and  creating an alternative. What -- what are you going to do now that you've  left this service?</p><p>RUBIN: Yes. Well, I would say the headline here really is that I think the  tech story of 2019 is that the people, the average person, watching your  show, that watches my show, has to decide what kind of internet they want.  And do we want--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: --a free internet that respects dissenting opinion that allows for  free expression and free speech and things of that nature? Or do we want a  controlled internet that is basically controlled by the social justice mob  that you did a segment on this show earlier? </p><p>I think, yes, you're right. The reason that Dr. Peterson and I are leaving  Patreon on January 15th, despite it being something like 70 percent of my  company's revenue, which I'm voluntarily giving up--</p><p>CARLSON: Wow.</p><p>RUBIN: --is that it is time for someone to take a stand. It--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: --we're just watching our freedoms erode away. We're just giving  them up. We're letting these companies take people out. </p><p>We're letting these companies say, \"No, you can't say this. You can't earn  money. You can't make a living, etcetera, etcetera,\" and it's like, you  know what, at some point, if -- if a couple of us that have some influence  don't stand up, then nobody will. And then this whole -- this whole game,  this whole -- this whole beautiful game about freedom on the internet,  it'll all be over before we know it. </p><p>And that's why Jordan and I are doing this. And -- and there's a huge --  it's a Herculean effort to design a system that will truly respect freedom  and not be destroyed when the mob comes to turn on it.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: We've got a lot of technical issues to deal with, technological  issues. We've got -- we've got free speech issues to deal with, legal  issues to deal with, so we've got -- we've got work to do, but let's go  ahead and do it.</p><p>CARLSON: The fact that you're putting 70 percent of your income on the line  to do this, I think, is inspiring. And I hope it is literally an  inspiration to other people. When will this service be up, do you think?</p><p>RUBIN: It -- it -- it's going to take a couple months, you know. We don't  want to over-promise right now. Anyone that's watching your show that  understands tech knows that this is not going to be easy--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: --to be built out. But we just felt, look, let's get some of the  middlemen out of the way. Patreon had just become a middleman. And, right  now, people can go to daverubin.com/donate, if they want to support what  I'm doing.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: They can go to Dr. Peterson's website if they want to support what  he's doing. And I just believe that actually people have had enough. So,  I'm taking a risk here. </p><p>But I -- I truly believe with no risk comes no reward. And we'll build  something better. And, you know, we've got -- we've got allies, people like  you that are on mainstream media that are helping--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: --promote -- promote these stories and ideas. And it's, I think 2019  actually is the year that the people start fighting back.</p><p>CARLSON: Man, I hope that's true.</p><p>RUBIN: Enough of giving into the mobs -- yes.</p><p>CARLSON: God bless you--</p><p>RUBIN: I -- I do too.</p><p>CARLSON: --for taking the first step. Dave Rubin, we're rooting for you,  obviously.</p><p>RUBIN: Thanks, brother.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well we're out of time, sadly. Could go on forever, but we'll be back  tomorrow night. The time is 8:00 P.M. The show is the sworn enemy of lying,  pomposity, smugness, and groupthink, cheerfully, we hope.</p><p>Good night from Washington D.C. Last night, we turned the show over 14  seconds early to Sean Hannity in New York. Now we're giving him three  seconds. Sean Hannity, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: Well, no, it's actually perfect timing. But who's --  who's going to -- oh, oh, my button goes -- go there -- I got to get my  American flag straight, although it's in distress, in some ways.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p>HANNITY: Sorry, Liberals have no sense of humor. Great show, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks, Sean. See you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Just a moment from now, we'll talk to the Vice President of the United States, and we'll ask him whether America is getting a Border wall in the end, and what the White House is willing to give in exchange for that. That's just ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, Democrats have returned to power on one half of Capitol Hill, one Chamber. After eight years out, Nancy Pelosi is once again the Speaker of the House. What can we expect from this brand new Congress?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We don't have to speculate too much because they're already telling us. Pelosi has signaled her total opposition to securing America's border with Mexico, for example. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVANNAH CLARK GUTHRIE, BROADCAST JOURNALIST, ATTORNEY, CO-ANCHOR OF TODAY, NBC NEWS: Are you willing to come up and give him some of this money for the wall?</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: No.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Because apparently that's the sticking point.</p><p>PELOSI: No. No, nothing for the wall. We're talking about border security. There is no amount of persuasion he can do to say to us, \"We want you to do something that is not effective, that costs billions of dollars.\" That sends the wrong message about who we are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So there's that. What else can we expect?</p><p>Well Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, now a Member of Congress from New York, finally, and she's pushing something called a Green New Deal. You may have heard the term. What does it mean? Well, among other things, it would close every fossil fuel plant apparently in the United States.</p><p>You'll remember, last summer, in the spirit of closing things, she vowed to abolish ICE.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR NEW YORK'S 14TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA MEMBER: I happen to believe that an agency that has repeatedly, systematically and violent - - and violently committed human rights abuses cannot be reformed.</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Keep in mind, the backdrop against which all of this is playing out is the slow but certain decline of America's middle-class. So, what's being done to address that, the single most pressing problem in this country?</p><p>Well, have no fear, Congressman Richard Neal says the Democratic Party will fight to dig up President Trump's tax returns, and why wouldn't they, and more, because according to his colleague, Hank Johnson of Atlanta, the President is literally like Hitler. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANK JOHNSON, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR GEORGIA'S 4TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: Americans elected an authoritarian, anti- immigrant, racist strongman to the nation's highest office.</p><p>(CROWD CHANTING)</p><p>JOHNSON: Donald Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" followers who want to return America back to a time when White men and White privilege were unchallenged.</p><p>Much like Hitler took over the Nazi party, Trump has taken over the Republican Party.</p><p>(CROWD CHANTING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Much like Hitler. Now, what would you do? Sincerely, think about it for a second. If you really thought Hitler was in the White House, well you'd stage a coup, obviously. You have no choice morally.</p><p>Democrats aren't saying that out loud, but they now are talking about impeachment out loud. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This deplorable, despicable human being that occupies the White House should not be there. We--</p><p>They say, \"Maxine, please don't say impeachment anymore.\" And when they say that, I say, \"Impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.\"</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>WATERS: When someone asked, \"But what about Pence? If you were able to impeach, Pence -- Pence will be worse.\" And I said, \"Look, one at a time. You knock one down, and then we'll be ready for Pence. We'll get him, too.\"</p><p>(CROWD SHOUTING YES)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: But keep in mind that Maxine Waters is suddenly more than just a very popular MSNBC guest. As of today, she's chairing the House Financial Services Committee. She has real power.</p><p>And she plans to use that power to push what she's calling \"Diversity quotas\" on the private sector. Hire the people Democratic Members of Congress want you to hire or else. So, that's a large part of the agenda. Should Americans be excited for that?</p><p>Richard Goodstein is a good barometer of that question. He's a lawyer. He advised both Clintons over the years and, of course, one of our favorite guests. Mr. Goodstein, thank you very much for coming.</p><p>Now, I'm not -- let me just say at the outset, I'm not going to ask you to account for Congressman Hank Johnson, who once suggested that Guam would capsize if too many American troops landed there because it's Hank Johnson.</p><p>But I do think it's fair to ask you about Nancy Pelosi, the new Speaker of the House, who said that, \"No. We cannot secure the border between the United States and Mexico. We cannot have a wall,\" and I'm quoting now, \"Because it sends the wrong message about who we are.\"</p><p>What message would having a wall send that is not who we are?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER CLINTON ADVISER: First, Hank Johnson is Hank Aaron's brother-in-law, so he's deserving some credit--</p><p>CARLSON: Is he literally Hank Aaron's brother-in-law?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm not against Hank Johnson.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I think he's hilarious. But there's obviously something wrong with him (ph).</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, what Nancy Pelosi is saying is what Democrats have been saying back when they, you know, passed that legislature in '06 about fencing and in 2013, $46 billion for border security, including $8 billion specifically for a structure along the border, and tens of thousands of personnel to monitor it, and all sorts of virtual walls.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: What they're saying is we don't support open borders. That's why Barack Obama was called by the largest Hispanic organization the, you know, the -- the Deporter-in-Chief. So--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I'm -- now I'm even more confused. Listen to this. \"Would you allocate any money for a wall?\"</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The new Speaker was asked. \"No. No, it sends the wrong message about who we are.\" So, you're saying it's OK to have a virtual wall but not a real wall?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I'm saying that Donald Trump defined the wall in the campaign -- first he said, why are we having this conversation? He said, \"Mexico is going to pay for it.\" And now we know that taxpayer is going to. So, can we at least get him off that?</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know -- wait but hold on, he didn't -- I mean look--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: But--</p><p>CARLSON: --I don't think Mexico is going to pay for it. But just in point of fact, he didn't say Mexico was going to prepay for it. Mexico can pay for it later through remittances. But whatever, but that's really not the point.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: In a 100 years, they may pay for it? But I mean this is--</p><p>CARLSON: Look -- look, my job is not to defend all of his campaign promises.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: My job is to ask about the country and why can't we have a wall. I'm serious.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, again, and Trump said, and here's why (ph) I think there's actually going to be a deal because Trump said, 25-foot concrete wall. That's what he kind of envisioned, that's what he sold his voters on.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: And I think even John Kelly said, to be honest, not something that we hear every day from the White House, it's not a wall, OK? So, what we're saying is that -- we're quibbling now between fencing and virtual this and that--</p><p>CARLSON: But I -- I get it. But what's the difference? So, Trump promises something that I hope he can deliver, which is a tall concrete barrier that actually--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --would slow down dramatically the inflow of illegals into our country. Nancy Pelosi says, \"No, no, that's not the message we want to send,\" and I -- what does that mean?</p><p>What -- what message does it send that we care too much about our people, that we're serious about territorial integrity like what is the bad message that that would send?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: So, again, when Democrats held the White House, fewer people were coming into the country than now. There were more deportations than there are now. So, the suggestion that somehow Democrats are wanting--</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm -- I'm still confused.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --open borders is a myth.</p><p>CARLSON: You're not going to address my question.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No, I -- I will but--</p><p>CARLSON: Look, I don't want to be mean.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No, no it's not mean.</p><p>CARLSON: You know--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Look, the fact of the matter is what she's saying is what border experts say by and large--</p><p>CARLSON: That a virtual wall's good but a real wall is bad.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --which is a 25-foot concrete wall is unnecessary. It's -- it's not necessary to spend that money--</p><p>CARLSON: So that's (ph) necessary.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --and it's not going to work.</p><p>CARLSON: But wait a second. You just said that we have more people coming in than we did during the (ph) Democrats. But now you're telling me it's not necessary to secure the border with a big bad wall.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: That -- that is totally--</p><p>CARLSON: A virtual wall would be OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No. It's -- it--</p><p>CARLSON: Because Democrats just want to save money. That's kind of their motto, right?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Democrats--</p><p>CARLSON: How can we save taxpayers money?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Democrats said in -- in 2013, a bill that passed the Senate with 14 Republicans and that John Boehner refused to bring up, but would have passed the House too--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --and Barack Obama would have signed it, basically that would have said we're going to put all these resources in to judges, to Border Patrol, to, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --electronic monitoring.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But the -- the -- look, I want to (ph) just say like thanks for history lesson. A lot of dynamics, there are a lot of Republicans oppose border security, I would never deny that. I'm just saying we have a chance to get a wall, and they don't want one because it works, and we all know that.</p><p>Let me ask you about the future. So, we're now hearing from the new Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters of L.A. that diversity quotas are coming to the private sector. Here's a quote from a Democrat to Politico.</p><p>\"Now companies are focused like a laser on identifying top African-American talent with Congressional Black Caucus relationships to help them understand and mitigate the striking lack of diversity within their corporations.\"</p><p>So, what Democrats are saying is you need to hire our friends or else we're going to punish you. Why is that not corruption?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: In the same way that when Republicans came in, the word went -- I remember there was the K Street Project--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I hated it. I hated it.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --been long enough to (ph) -- well but that's exactly what happened, which is--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it was disgusting.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --you hire our friends, our former staffers, K Streeters, big corporations--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --corporation and trade association to know us. So, I mean--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think the Republicans pretended that it was racial justice when they did that. Did they?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, they're--</p><p>CARLSON: Are you OK with Congress telling companies who they could hire--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well Congress is not telling--</p><p>CARLSON: --what talent (ph) -- yes, they are. They're--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --well, well, legislatively, the only thing that I saw proposed was something that basically would require disclosure of the make-up of your board on gender grounds. I don't know that that's such a bad thing. It's frankly it's public. I mean presumably you list the names and you can probably intuit who's a male and who's a female--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --so that's only (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Well -- well first of all, I -- I just want to officially disapprove of your rigid understanding of gender. OK? Just -- as -- as (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I'm saying for the most part. I didn't say for the most part.</p><p>CARLSON: --for the most part, thank you. I was giving you an out, Richard, so you--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --wouldn't be hung by your own people.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you so much.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: My pleasure, of course.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you. I'm very excited for this Congress.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Earlier tonight we had an interview with the Vice President. We asked about the Border wall, the shutdown, and what was going to happen, and here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Will the deal that resolves the shutdown include any form of amnesty for people here illegally now?</p><p>MICHAEL RICHARD PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, our focus is on border security.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course, but the Democrats' focus is on--</p><p>PENCE: Our focus--</p><p>CARLSON: --getting amnesty for people here illegally--</p><p>PENCE: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --will you agree to that?</p><p>PENCE: What -- what we've completely focused on is keeping the President's promise, to build a wall, to pass legislation that provides other support for border security, that gives the people that are enforcing our laws at the border, and across the country enforcing our immigration laws, the resources and the tools--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --that they need. There's a lot of people talking about a lot of different ideas. You know, frankly, the better part of a year ago, the President expressed a willingness to deal with the issue of DREAMers in a compassionate way for people who were brought here as children, and--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --through no fault of their own. He's discussed that, it's being talked about.</p><p>CARLSON: But what about--</p><p>PENCE: But look, here's the part where the (ph) President and I are--</p><p>CARLSON: --people who -- who came here as adults?</p><p>PENCE: --ever since -- ever since the Christmas holiday, the President sent us to Capitol Hill. I met with Senator Schumer not once but twice. We engaged in good faith negotiations. The President and I canceled all of our Christmas vacation plans. We were here in Washington D.C.</p><p>Democrats broke off negotiations about a week ago, but the President's made it clear. We're here to make a deal, but it's a deal that's going to result in achieving real gains on border security. And you have no border security without a wall.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: We will have no deal without a wall.</p><p>CARLSON: If the deal in the end includes allowing people who came here as adults, intentionally to break our laws, to become citizens, then wouldn't the message to the rest of us be, why should we obey the law, if people who intentionally broke it are being rewarded for it? Can you see why that would be a perverse incentive for the rest of us?</p><p>PENCE: I absolutely can, and I've heard no discussion of that. I've heard no discussion of--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>PENCE: --amnesty related to this. I -- I heard some Members of the Senate are talking about maybe including DREAMers in some sort of a negotiated settlement.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: And the President's posture on all this is, look, we're at 5.6 billion. We have engaged in good faith negotiations. We've made offers. There's been no counter-offers made. But, again, we -- we heard the Democrat leadership, the new Speaker of the House this morning again said, \"No money for the wall.\"</p><p>Well the American people know walls work. And we heard from Border Agents today in the Oval Office that -- that in areas and sectors where they were assigned to deal with illegal immigration, the flow of narcotics, human trafficking, all the -- all the threats to our communities--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --that we face at our border that once they build a wall, you saw illegal immigration, the flow of narcotics, drop precipitously. And--</p><p>CARLSON: So the bottom line is you will not accept a deal that does not include a wall, if I'm hearing this right?</p><p>PENCE: I think the President's made -- made it very clear.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PENCE: No wall, no deal. And -- but, look, we really are prepared to negotiate. We're prepared to talk. We're prepared to listen and--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --and ultimately it all begins with the facts. I mean that's the reason why the President called the meeting in the Situation Room. We'll be meeting again tomorrow with Republican and Democrat leadership.</p><p>And I want the American people to know that that, you know, this is a real crisis at our border. We made progress last year. And it probably was a result of the fact that the American people elected a new president who delivered a very strong message about confronting illegal immigration.</p><p>We actually saw a decline in illegal immigration and incursions on our Southern border. But in the last 12 months, we've literally seen a dramatic increase in the number of people -- 2,000 people a day--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I've noticed.</p><p>PENCE: --apprehended at our border or found to be inadmissible, trying to enter our country.</p><p>I mean that represents -- as -- as much as we're all troubled in recent weeks about the caravans moving north, and there's talks about more caravans, literally, 2,000 people a day attempt to come into this country illegally by one means or another.</p><p>We -- we can agree on those facts, come together around solutions, but part of that solution means a wall. It means a barrier and -- and along our Southern border.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: And it also means technology, drones, the kind of support that our Border Agents know will assist them in doing their job. But -- but bottom line, if there's no wall, there's no deal.</p><p>CARLSON: The President, the other day, announced the withdrawal of the 2,000 American troops in Syria--</p><p>PENCE: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --back to the United States. Nobody in Washington liked that, including some Republicans. Lindsey Graham said probably not going to happen. There was a pause on that withdrawal.</p><p>What is the state of that? Are those troops coming home? And if so, when?</p><p>PENCE: You know, President Trump as Commander-in-Chief and as a candidate made it clear that our -- our number one priority would be destroying ISIS.</p><p>The reality is we have defeated ISIS. We have defeated the Caliphate. And what the President announced just before Christmas is not that we're giving up on the fight on ISIS. We're going to continue to lean into the fight of ISIS. We're going to continue to take the actions that are necessary to protect the American people and our interests in the region.</p><p>But the President is determined, in consultation with military commanders, including in al-Asad Air Force Base when he was there just after Christmas that it's no longer necessary for us to have American forces in harm's way in Northeastern Syria to accomplish that.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think we can expect in the next few months those troops to come back?</p><p>PENCE: Well I think the President's made it clear. We're -- we're going to do this and are doing this in an orderly way.</p><p>I heard him in dozens and dozens of speeches talk about bringing our troops home wherever we could around the world. This is not a -- a president that's interested--</p><p>CARLSON: So -- no, no he definitely said that, of course.</p><p>PENCE: --in seeing American forces all over the world. They accomplished -- they accomplished the task that we gave--</p><p>CARLSON: But what about Afghanistan? I'm just--</p><p>PENCE: --them to accomplish, defeating the Caliphate.</p><p>CARLSON: --right.</p><p>PENCE: And now we can bring them out of Syria.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that we're winning the conflict in Afghanistan? Do you think the United States benefits from the continued presence of such a large number of U.S. troops there?</p><p>PENCE: Well, the President is in the process of evaluating that, as we speak. I was in Afghanistan last year.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PENCE: In his speech in August, President Trump, basically through new rules of engagement, new resources, additional military personnel, gave our folks on the ground the ability to take the fight, be at the tip of the spear, supporting the Afghan National Army in the battle against the Taliban, ISIS Khorasan, Al-Qaeda, re-emerging in Afghanistan.</p><p>CARLSON: Is it working?</p><p>PENCE: And it's been a tough fight. I mean the President's been very clear about that. And now, I think the President's in the process of evaluating options about what has been, as you know, Tucker, we both lived through it in the last two decades, what has been a -- an 18-year conflict in Afghanistan--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PENCE: --and determining what our best options are, in terms of putting America first, protecting America's interests in the region, making sure that we can confront terrorism--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PENCE: --if it -- if it rears its head once again. But the President's looking at ways in Syria, and perhaps even in Afghanistan, where we can have less of a military commitment and see those resources and those troops coming home.</p><p>CARLSON: Mr. Vice President, thank you.</p><p>PENCE: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I appreciate it.</p><p>PENCE: Good to be with you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well on our first show of the year, which was last night, we highlighted and tried to explain the decline of men in Middle America, and how it's devastating this country. And it is.</p><p>That segment got a huge response from viewers. But some people hated it, the science parts, especially. That's no longer allowed. We'll explain after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well last night was our first show of the year. So, we decided to take a minute to talk about the biggest issue facing this country going forward.</p><p>No, it's not higher GDP growth despite what some think-tank people will tell you. It's not, definitely not, some obscure Middle-Eastern hellhole our leaders claim we should be policing forever. It's not even illegal immigration as big a problem as that is, and as much time as we have spent talking about it.</p><p>The real problem is families. America used to be the best country in the world for families. Americans could get married and afford to raise their own children. If your kids worked hard, you could expect they'd be a little more successful maybe than you were. That was called the American Dream.</p><p>And for a small group of affluent people, it still exists. They're still living like it's 1965, and good for them. But for everyone else, that Dream is dying. America's middle-class is in decline because middle-class American families are declining.</p><p>So, the question is why is that happening? Well there are a lot of reasons it's happening. But a major driver of family collapse, the one that nobody ever talks about for some reason is simple economics, and we explained it last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Now maybe they should want to marry them but they don't.</p><p>Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of- wedlock births and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow. More drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed to the next generation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Now, let's be clear about that statement. First of all, it is factually true, and that's the essential test of anything. That's the test that we go by.</p><p>In 2015, a study by the decidedly non-Conservative Brookings Institution found that falling male wages caused about a quarter of the decline in marriage rates over the past 35 years.</p><p>Two years later, MIT researchers found that when factories close, marriage rates go down, and single parenthood becomes more common. And that, as you could guess, causes a higher proportion of children to wind up on drugs or in prison. So, it's not a small thing.</p><p>And, by the way, many other studies have reached the same conclusions over long periods of time. This is real. So, what we said is a statement of fact. We wish it weren't.</p><p>In an ideal world, none of this would matter. The marriage rate never would have declined when manufacturing died and everything in Middle America would be fine. But it's not. And we're not in charge of that. All we can do is tell the truth about what happened, which we did because it actually matters.</p><p>And that turned out to be too much for the people who believe it's their job to prevent you from knowing why your country is going down the tubes. Those people got very angry. Here's a selection.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW: And strike it off (ph).</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>BEHAR: You know, it reminds me -- it reminds me of when they blamed women - - women for pregnancy as if he had nothing to do with it.</p><p>SUNNY HOSTIN, ABC NEWS SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; ANALYST, THE VIEW CO- HOST, COLUMNIST, MULTI-PLATFORM JOURNALIST, SOCIAL COMMENTATOR: There's a woman in the audience. She's like, \"What? What?\" She's over there (ph).</p><p>MEGHAN MARGUERITE MCCAIN, THE VIEW CO-HOST, COLUMNIST, AUTHOR, FORMER FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Where?</p><p>BEHAR: This -- this idea that, you know, to keep women down that's going on in the country--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>ABIGAIL HAIGHT HUNTSMAN, TELEVISION PERSONALITY, THE VIEW CO-HOST, ABC: But Sunny, you said you had friends--</p><p>BEHAR: --and this is just another aspect of it.</p><p>HOSTIN: I don't know. It looked like Loony Town--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Loony Town.</p><p>HOSTIN: --Town to me.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, Loony Town. Notice that no one though contested the facts of what we said. In fact, later in the show, one of those same hosts admitted that, in fact, women do strongly prefer marrying men who make more than they do.</p><p>So, it's true but it's not on the list of approved talking points, so it can't ever be said out loud. Those are the rules. And anyone who violates those rules must be punished.</p><p>This is very common. And if you're wondering how we wound up in the Dark Age we're currently living through, this is how we did. This is why important science is no longer being conducted. This is why art isn't being made. This is why comedy is dying.</p><p>It's why people aren't thinking for themselves anymore, which means the end of creativity. It's why the rest of us stand by like cowards as the innocent are punished for crimes they didn't commit because we're all terrified.</p><p>We're terrified of being denounced by some mindless ideologue on TV, or shamed and ostracized on social media for stepping out of line, or silenced completely by some big tech firm. A mob of angry children is suddenly in charge of the country.</p><p>These aren't people seeking a revolution. They're fighting for the status quo to protect their own status. They are drunk on power. And they're looking for new people to hurt. Someday, we're going to look back on this moment with shame and horror.</p><p>But, in the meantime, we should remember that terror only works if we play along with it. So, what if we decided not to? What if all of us decided to tell the truth about something every day in public? What would happen then? What could they do about it?</p><p>They can't punish everybody. We're the majority. Let's try that.</p><p>We're starting tonight with Heather Mac Donald. She's a fearless person, a Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the Author of the book, The Diversity Delusion: How Race and Gender Pandering Corrupt the University and Undermine Our Culture, and she joins us tonight.</p><p>Heather, thanks very much for coming on.</p><p>HEATHER LYNN MAC DONALD, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, CITY JOURNAL, THE DIVERSITY DELUSION AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, my theory is that when you say the true things, people get outraged. So, you know, hurt dog barks. But just to be clear, as a social scientist yourself, I hope you'll confirm for audience that this is not a controversial statement that male employment and wages directly affect the marriage rate. Do they not?</p><p>MAC DONALD: Well, first of all, Tucker, I want to commend you for making the breakdown of marriage a central focus of your show. There's no bigger social catastrophe of our age than the fact that more and more children are being raised without their fathers. And the elites understand that. Marriage has not disappeared from the elites.</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure.</p><p>MAC DONALD: And yet, they are absolutely unwilling to send the message that fathers are as important to their children as mothers. Their tongues are tied. They refuse to say it. It's one of those truths that again is being completely denied by elite culture.</p><p>Why? Because it violates the feminist nostrum that strong women could do it all. Now, you're right that there's an economic component to this. And -- and, most famously, William Julius Wilson explained the drop in marriage among the Black community--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --as a result of jobs leaving the Midwest. And he said that the male unemployment decreases females' willingness to marry.</p><p>But I think you also have to look at a culture explanation -- explanation because I remember being taken around in a ride-along by a Chicago cop, a very handsome man, solid job, good pension to look forward to, he had fathered several children out of wedlock.</p><p>Why? Because the marriage norm had simply disappeared--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --from the Black community. So, I think this is a cultural matter as well. It's a product to a certain extent of the feminist attack on males.</p><p>We are living through a period where males are being constantly disparaged as simply the source of evil in our world. And they are responding tragically by withdrawing from competition, taking their marbles and going home. And that is leaving us all at greater risk.</p><p>CARLSON: And in some cases taking their own lives, I would say. I mean the suicide rate for American men--</p><p>MAC DONALD: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --is higher that it's been in a long time. I would just note that the problems that William Julius Wilson chronicled, I thought, so well 30 or 40 years ago, are now the problems of rural America which, obviously, has a completely different racial demographic and political beliefs than inner-city America.</p><p>And it seems to me that when it happens to two different groups, the very same thing that would be the wake-up call for our policymakers to say, wait a second. Maybe we should get involved in thinking about how to fix this considering in our neighborhoods, where rich people live in -- my neighborhood, for example, there are no single mothers. Everyone's married because it works.</p><p>So, why aren't they doing their best to pass on the thing that is working for them? It just seems grotesque to me.</p><p>MAC DONALD: No, I -- I think we do have to look at Industrial Policy and make sure that there are good well-paying jobs there. I just wouldn't assume that that is going to be enough at this point--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --to turn around the culture.</p><p>Again, we need to valorize males. And -- and the culture needs to say males are not toxic. Masculinity is not toxic. There are male virtues of valor, courage, chivalry, heroism in war that are really uniquely male. They should not be disparaged. Females have complementary virtues and values that are also essential to children.</p><p>CARLSON: So, so wait. Can I ask where does the idea come from that when men fail, women win? I mean that really is the underlying assumption of like--</p><p>MAC DONALD: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --the dumb people we always play from other shows. \"You know, men are declining. This is great for us.\" But men and women are totally interconnected. So, how can the failure of one help the other? Doesn't it hurt all of us?</p><p>MAC DONALD: Yes. It's a preposterous zero-sum mentality. But there's a lot of females who are angry, angry for no reason at all. They have an axe on their -- to grind, a chip on their shoulder, and they're constantly looking for ways to feel offended, mostly by dredging up sexism from the past, because it's almost impossible to find today.</p><p>I mean you have females that are excelling in education. There's not a single mainstream institution that is not twisting itself into knots to hire and promote as many females as possible. And yet, females are still ringing their hands over the alleged sexism of the 50s, simply so they can feel like they're victims.</p><p>Preposterous! I am not a victim. I -- I don't know any female victims, frankly. But -- but there is a sense that in order for females to succeed, it has to be at the expense of males and--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --through a constant de-valorization--</p><p>CARLSON: That doesn't work.</p><p>MAC DONALD: --of masculinity.</p><p>CARLSON: It doesn't work. We -- we -- we don't win when some of us lose. I -- I don't believe that. It's not true. Heather, thank you very much.</p><p>MAC DONALD: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well they're coming after your drinking straws. Now they want to tax your meat. It's getting bad out here. Mark Steyn joins us after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well huge parts of this country, as you already know, are breathtakingly beautiful. Yellowstone, Big Sur, Yosemite, the vast forests of Maine, places like that are what make this a great country.</p><p>If being an environmentalist means anything, it means protecting those places and countless others across this continental nation, keeping them clean and protected. So, how are professional environmentalists doing with that?</p><p>Well, we know, this week, the federal government is shut down and that means the National Park Service is not cleaning up in our national parks. That means that trash is piling up. That is an environmental crisis.</p><p>So, we wanted to know how our environmental watchdogs were responding to it, so we contacted this country's four biggest environmental groups to see what they were doing about it, The Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the National -- Natural Resources Defense Council.</p><p>Go to their websites. They'll tell you how they're protecting the soil and water. By the way, they raise a lot of money on those claims. Combined, these four groups have an annual revenue of well over $1 billion.</p><p>Over The Nature Conservancy, their endowment is over $6 billion. So, they could easily help. Picking up trash is not expensive. They're certainly rich enough to do that. Are they doing it? We called it in (ph) to find out. None of them even responded.</p><p>And that, of course, means no. They're not doing it. They're not helping. Now, that may be sad to those of you who grow up -- grew up sending money to The Sierra Club, which used to concern itself with our physical environment and did virtuous work.</p><p>But if you've been paying attention for the past 10 years, you shouldn't be surprised. Actual garbage that's ruining nature? Well that seems small in importance compared to, I don't know, promoting carbon taxes or unlimited immigration or gender theory or the various other priorities of the Democratic Party, which is what these groups spend their time and money doing.</p><p>And, by the way, that's fine. Lots of groups in Washington do those exact things. They're political consultants. That's their job. But, at least, they're honorable enough to pretend they're not protecting the environment.</p><p>So, these groups may not care anymore about picking up garbage but they do like the idea of controlling your behavior. Across America, scolds (ph) are stamping out plastic straws, already banned here in Washington, but it won't stop with straws. Think it will? Huh.</p><p>Some groups are promoting taxes on meat. They're doing this in the name of promoting health and fighting climate change. Of course, these taxes would have the added benefit of punishing you.</p><p>Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. He joins us tonight. So, it does, am I sensing a theme here, Mark, where a certain sort of--</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --upper-income person doesn't feel content until he's really taken away all the small comforts of those below him?</p><p>STEYN: Absolutely. The Councilman in Santa Barbara, where they introduced one of these bans on plastic straws, said, we have to regulate, we can't trust the common sense anymore, we have to regulate every aspect of people's lives. And after he got a bit of pushback on Twitter or whatever, he kind of walked that back.</p><p>But it's true. And it's actually the inverse of what you were talking about with Heather just now that the less anybody notices the vast amount of human rubble piling up around us, and the more we're prevented from talking about anything that matters, the moral, the clever people in our society obsess on peripheral things like plastic straws.</p><p>CARLSON: It's just so interesting though that all of it is aimed downward at people they believe is--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --are their social inferiors. I can't remember the last time The Sierra Club went after the Government of China. Some of these groups are taking money from the Government of China or went after--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --Al Gore for flying privately or went after--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --private airports, the FBOs across the country. Why is it always aimed at people who make less than they do?</p><p>STEYN: Well I think -- I think it's because it is the pleasure it affords the elites at actually regulating the masses. You -- you mentioned China. Supposedly, we ban straws because straws are polluting the oceans--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STEYN: --as you mentioned, eight countries in Asia are responsible for two- thirds of the plastic waste that goes into the oceans, which means that a 192 countries or thereabouts are responsible for the other third.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And America contributes less to plastic waste in the oceans. The Morocco or Burma or even North Korea, and I don't even know what they got to throw in the oceans in North Korea because that's not a--</p><p>CARLSON: Not much.</p><p>STEYN: --that's not a consumer society. But it -- it's on -- this is unglamorous work. Just as the most important aspect of human healthcare is hygiene, the most important aspect of environmental healthcare is -- is garbage disposal.</p><p>If -- if instead of the Paris Climate Accord, the -- the nations of the world got together and decided to raise these Asian countries' level of trash disposal to Euro-American--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STEYN: --standards, you would have a much better and -- but -- but if you say to The Sierra Club, do you want to be running on better garbage disposal, it's not glamorous enough for them.</p><p>CARLSON: It's just, on the meat tax, very quickly, it just seems like this is not -- this will only affect people who like burgers. And why not for--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --all the problems that people in that income range have, why hassle them? Is global warming really their fault?</p><p>STEYN: Well they -- if we didn't eat burgers, we wouldn't have cows. And they take bovine flatulence more seriously than illegal immigration or anything. I mean the European Union--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --was proposing offsets on that because the Irish Holstein emits more than the -- emits less than the BullGuard Jersey (ph). So, they were actually going to be having offsets in that particular sphere in the European Union.</p><p>I mean as I said, the -- the less we talk about anything that matters--</p><p>CARLSON: Right, exactly.</p><p>STEYN: --the more we obsess on these boutique niche issues.</p><p>CARLSON: That's -- that's such a deep point, as most of your points are. Mark Steyn, thank you very much.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, ho, ho, ho, it is finally here after a week. Final Exam, can you beat the experts at remembering the final stories of 2018? How's your short-term memory? The test ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Thank Heaven in a world gone crazy, there is still Final Exam. We've come to that time of the week where the news professionals compete with one another to be crowned the ultimate master of the news.</p><p>The defending champion this week is Fox -- Fox National Correspondent, Lauren Blanchard, who crushed it last week. Her challenger is a very accomplished man, former U.S. Congressman, Jason Chaffetz, who is guest- hosting for Laura this evening, so don't miss that, and also works here at Fox Site (ph).</p><p>Great to see you both.</p><p>LAUREN BLANCHARD, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Good to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: Congressman, are you familiar with what this requires?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm -- I'm a rookie. But I got the coat off.</p><p>CARLSON: I like that.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You know -- you know, at--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Right now.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --home, when we play games, it's usually shirts -- shirts versus skins. But I'm going to go ahead and keep the tie on.</p><p>CARLSON: You know what? You can be who you are on this show.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Hey.</p><p>CARLSON: If you want to go shirtless, it's up to you but--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm a rookie.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'll let you decide.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm a rookie.</p><p>CARLSON: OK, good. Well then let me read you the rules, the stringent rules. You know them, of course.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Oh, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Hands on buzzers. I ask the questions. The first one to buzz in gets to answer the question. You must wait until I finish asking it before you answer.</p><p>You can answer once I acknowledge you by saying your name. Each correct answer is worth one point. Here's the trick. If you get it wrong, you lose a point, the cruel math of Final Exam. Best of five wins. Are you ready?</p><p>BLANCHARD: Let's do it. You're ready?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: All right. All right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: That's a trick. I know you seriously (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: She's good (ph). I know she's -- she's devastating.</p><p>OK. First question. After announcing that she does, in fact, plan to run for President, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts held a live stream Q&amp;A session with supporters. And at one point, she stopped taking questions, so she could grab a beverage from the fridge. Some are saying it was an embarrassing gap. What kind of drink did she get?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CARLSON: Lauren Blanchard.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It was a beer.</p><p>CARLSON: A beer?</p><p>BLANCHARD: She popped open a beer.</p><p>CARLSON: Unbelievable. Was it a beer?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Hold on a sec. I'm going to get me a beer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But, for some, the moment falling flat, online critics calling her awkward attempt at drinking beer inauthentic pandering to young voters.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: For some--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Could have been worse (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --the moment falling flat. They -- they leave out verbs in network news for some reason. I mean it was a beer. It's exactly right.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: She also got her husband that she kept -- dragged into the shot as she--</p><p>CARLSON: She did?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --that was very natural. Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I even -- wasn't even aware of him. What kind of beer? Do you know?</p><p>BLANCHARD: I think it was something light but--</p><p>CARLSON: It was some sort of non-beer like your carb-free--</p><p>BLANCHARD: I don't--</p><p>CARLSON: --beer or something. I'm not a beer guy.</p><p>All right, question two. The Billboard R&amp;B chart this week features a debut from an unexpected artist. He's a former U.S. President. He's featured on the number 22 song. What is his name?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CARLSON: Lauren.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It's President Obama.</p><p>CARLSON: Is that true? President Obama?</p><p>BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I didn't even know this. Is it President Obama? To the tape we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With a rising star in the R&amp;B world, you guys are going to want to keep an eye on this one. His name, Barack Obama.</p><p>All right, let's listen in.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: With pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking. In the midst of my fellow citizens--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It could be (ph).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, he left Office to make the world better. And that's what he's doing.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes, I--</p><p>CARLSON: You were right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --I -- I missed that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I do. I--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I would have -- you could have given me 20 minutes, I would have never gotten it.</p><p>CARLSON: I wouldn't have either.</p><p>BLANCHARD: YEs.</p><p>CARLSON: Let's see if he gets (ph) this one.</p><p>Question three. It's a crowded Democratic field coming together for 2020, even Hollywood considering jumping in, or one member of it. Which award- winning actress, famous for wearing a vial of her husband's blood around her neck, is thinking about becoming a Democratic candidate?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Oh.</p><p>BLANCHARD: OK. I don't know the story, but the only one who did that was Angelina Jolie. She was famous for wearing the blood. But I didn't hear that she was--</p><p>CARLSON: I can't. I can't imagine there's more than one--</p><p>BLANCHARD: --is Angelina getting in?</p><p>CARLSON: --actress in Hollywood--</p><p>BLANCHARD: I would hope not.</p><p>CARLSON: --even in Hollywood, who wears a vial--</p><p>BLANCHARD: I would hope not.</p><p>CARLSON: --of her husband's blood.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Oh.</p><p>CARLSON: Was it Angelina Jolie?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Another 2020 contender, Actress Angelina Jolie is hinting that even she might run for president in 2020. In an interview with the BBC--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD: Really?</p><p>CARLSON: I think.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: --Ms. Jolie said that she can work with both governments and militaries, so she may be worthy of high office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Steyn, ladies and gentlemen. So, I -- I think what our judges are saying -- congratulations, by the way--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --Congressman, is that speed is of the essence.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And pressing perhaps rather than slapping might be more effective.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: OK.</p><p>BLANCHARD: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: This is a two-point question.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: OK.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Ooh.</p><p>CARLSON: OK?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: All right.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Oh.</p><p>CARLSON: Question four. People in the City of New York believe their city was being invaded by aliens recently. Why did they think this? Because the night sky lit up in an electric blue. What was the cause of that?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CARLSON: Lauren.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It was a Con Ed transformer explosion. It was very weird.</p><p>CARLSON: Man, you are so on it, you're freaking me out. Is that true? Is Lauren right?</p><p>BLANCHARD: It's all over Twitter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The cause of the panic? A transformer explosion at a Con Edison utility substation. Then there was that low frequency hum. Worried residents fearing the worst called 9-1-1. Some thought it might be the beginning of an alien invasion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was freaky. It was like Independence Day in the movie--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD: He did like compare to (ph)--</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --where you just look up and a -- a weird blue color that, you know, you haven't seen, lighting up the clouds in the sky.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: As we've noted many times in this show that is just a matter of time. Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: She -- she is no doubt good. But can I get a lesson on buzzer like--</p><p>CARLSON: You know, the judges were just saying--</p><p>BLANCHARD: You got to really like this (ph) you got to--</p><p>CARLSON: --would you -- would you like to take a practice buzz right now?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Just practice buzz.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>BLANCHARD: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: It's working.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I think -- I think, actually -- I mean, obviously, she's deeply informed on the news.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: She would have kicked my butt no matter what.</p><p>CARLSON: But she's also lightning fast.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes. No kidding.</p><p>CARLSON: You have a bunch of brothers, right?</p><p>BLANCHARD: I do.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Two brothers.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, so--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: All right, I--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Maybe quick (ph).</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --I've never been known for my cat quick reflexes.</p><p>CARLSON: No.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: I would say that (ph)--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I get that. I get that. Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Final question, and per the mandate of the National Game Show Commission, this must be an animal question, and therefore it is.</p><p>Tension was high at Tuesday's Sugar Bowl between the Texas Longhorns and the Georgia Bulldogs. The mascot for the Texas team, a live 1,800 pounds steer charged the mascot for the Georgia team. What kind of animal is the Georgia mascot?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>CARLSON: Holy smokes! Lauren.</p><p>BLANCHARD: It's a bull dog. The Georgia Bulldogs?</p><p>CARLSON: Was the answer in the question? To the tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Before the Sugar Bowl, the Texas Longhorns' 1,800 pound mascot, Bevo, charging Georgia's Bulldog, Uga, after breaking out of its pen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Holy smokes!</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nobody was hurt though but that's a bit of a scary situation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLANCHARD: Great.</p><p>CARLSON: Lauren Blanchard--</p><p>BLANCHARD: I don't believe it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --highest score ever achieved on this show.</p><p>BLANCHARD: Ooh.</p><p>CARLSON: Congressman, I don't judge you for a second. I would have had the exact same score because she is absolutely unbeatable. She--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Next time, I'm going to put the coat on.</p><p>CARLSON: I -- I don't know. I don't think that -- I don't--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I can study enough.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not sure that any accessory could help because she's that good. OK. You get another Erik Wemple mug--</p><p>BLANCHARD: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --which commemorates the now famous appearance of Mr. Wemple from the Washington Post website on our show.</p><p>BLANCHARD: I gave one to my parents for Christmas so--</p><p>CARLSON: Good.</p><p>BLANCHARD: --now they'll have two.</p><p>CARLSON: And you'll be hosting Laura Ingraham tonight.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: 10 o'clock.</p><p>CARLSON: It's going to be good?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It'd be good.</p><p>CARLSON: I'll--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: There's so much out there.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'll be sitting with my Erik Wemple mug watching you. Thank you both very much.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: That's it for Final Exam tonight. Pay attention, close attention, to the news, especially weird news, every week. Tune in next Thursday to see if you can beat our experts. We'll be right back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well this show is committed to taking a much closer look at big tech. Contrary to many people's expectations, technology companies have turned out to be the single biggest threat to your freedom of speech, to many of your rights and, in fact, your well-being, certainly to your privacy, as an American. So, we're always looking to know more.</p><p>Trace Gallagher joins us tonight with what he's found. Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, Zhou Fengsuo was a Chinese Human Rights Activist, based in New York. But the professional networking site, LinkedIn, blocked his profile page in China, because of \"Specific content,\" though the company did not say what specific content ran afoul of Chinese policy.</p><p>Instead, they wrote this, quoting, \"While we strongly support freedom of expression, we recognized that when we launched that we would need to adhere to the requirements of the Chinese government in order to operate in China.\"</p><p>But Human Rights groups say this has nothing to do with violating Chinese laws and everything to do with trying to silence Chinese dissidents. Turns out, Zhou was a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.</p><p>But breaking tonight, LinkedIn has now restored Mr. Zhou's page saying it made a mistake.</p><p>And separately, we thought you should know that documents filed by the Dutch Chamber of Commerce show that in 2017, Google shifted $23 billion to a tax shelter in Bermuda. The move is legal, but it does allow the company to avoid triggering U.S. income taxes and European withholding taxes. Google says it pays all its taxes and complies with all laws.</p><p>Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: It is (ph) really shocking. Trace, thank you for that.</p><p>Well, back in this country, as major tech platforms continue to suppress free speech, people who seek to think for themselves will have to look for alternatives. And if those alternatives don't exist, they may need to be created.</p><p>Dave Rubin has reached that conclusion after years of thinking about it. He, of course, hosts The Rubin Report on YouTube. And, until recently, he raised money for his show on the crowd-funding site, Patreon. But now, after Patreon purged several dissenting voices from its service, Rubin and Professor Jordan Peterson have announced they will be leaving.</p><p>Dave Rubin joins us tonight to explain what he's doing. Dave, thanks a lot for coming on tonight. One of the reasons this was such an ex--</p><p>DAVID JOSHUA RUBIN, CREATOR AND HOST, THE RUBIN REPORT: Always good to be with you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --exciting story to hear is that finally someone is opting out and creating an alternative. What -- what are you going to do now that you've left this service?</p><p>RUBIN: Yes. Well, I would say the headline here really is that I think the tech story of 2019 is that the people, the average person, watching your show, that watches my show, has to decide what kind of internet they want. And do we want--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: --a free internet that respects dissenting opinion that allows for free expression and free speech and things of that nature? Or do we want a controlled internet that is basically controlled by the social justice mob that you did a segment on this show earlier?</p><p>I think, yes, you're right. The reason that Dr. Peterson and I are leaving Patreon on January 15th, despite it being something like 70 percent of my company's revenue, which I'm voluntarily giving up--</p><p>CARLSON: Wow.</p><p>RUBIN: --is that it is time for someone to take a stand. It--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: --we're just watching our freedoms erode away. We're just giving them up. We're letting these companies take people out.</p><p>We're letting these companies say, \"No, you can't say this. You can't earn money. You can't make a living, etcetera, etcetera,\" and it's like, you know what, at some point, if -- if a couple of us that have some influence don't stand up, then nobody will. And then this whole -- this whole game, this whole -- this whole beautiful game about freedom on the internet, it'll all be over before we know it.</p><p>And that's why Jordan and I are doing this. And -- and there's a huge -- it's a Herculean effort to design a system that will truly respect freedom and not be destroyed when the mob comes to turn on it.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: We've got a lot of technical issues to deal with, technological issues. We've got -- we've got free speech issues to deal with, legal issues to deal with, so we've got -- we've got work to do, but let's go ahead and do it.</p><p>CARLSON: The fact that you're putting 70 percent of your income on the line to do this, I think, is inspiring. And I hope it is literally an inspiration to other people. When will this service be up, do you think?</p><p>RUBIN: It -- it -- it's going to take a couple months, you know. We don't want to over-promise right now. Anyone that's watching your show that understands tech knows that this is not going to be easy--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: --to be built out. But we just felt, look, let's get some of the middlemen out of the way. Patreon had just become a middleman. And, right now, people can go to daverubin.com/donate, if they want to support what I'm doing.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: They can go to Dr. Peterson's website if they want to support what he's doing. And I just believe that actually people have had enough. So, I'm taking a risk here.</p><p>But I -- I truly believe with no risk comes no reward. And we'll build something better. And, you know, we've got -- we've got allies, people like you that are on mainstream media that are helping--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: --promote -- promote these stories and ideas. And it's, I think 2019 actually is the year that the people start fighting back.</p><p>CARLSON: Man, I hope that's true.</p><p>RUBIN: Enough of giving into the mobs -- yes.</p><p>CARLSON: God bless you--</p><p>RUBIN: I -- I do too.</p><p>CARLSON: --for taking the first step. Dave Rubin, we're rooting for you, obviously.</p><p>RUBIN: Thanks, brother.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well we're out of time, sadly. Could go on forever, but we'll be back tomorrow night. The time is 8:00 P.M. The show is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink, cheerfully, we hope.</p><p>Good night from Washington D.C. Last night, we turned the show over 14 seconds early to Sean Hannity in New York. Now we're giving him three seconds. Sean Hannity, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: Well, no, it's actually perfect timing. But who's -- who's going to -- oh, oh, my button goes -- go there -- I got to get my American flag straight, although it's in distress, in some ways.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is.</p><p>HANNITY: Sorry, Liberals have no sense of humor. Great show, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks, Sean. See you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019010301cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V43-RR71-JB20-G148-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 3, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>SIERRA CLUB</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Post reported that the house speaker's refusal to engage with Zuckerberg highlights her frustration with how Facebook declined to remove the video. Pelosi called for greater regulation of big tech following the video spreading like wildfire. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Nancy Pelosi is reportedly ghosting Mark Zuckerberg. According to a report in The Washington Post[2], the house speaker has ignored the Facebook CEO's efforts to make contact after a fake video of her slurring went viral on the social network. Facebook refused to remove the video, citing freedom of speech. The company did, however, downrank versions of the clip, which slows down Pelosi's speech at a Center for American Progress event in May to make it sound like she is slurring. The Post said Pelosi has not returned Zuckerberg's call or reached out to him personally, according to two people familiar with the matter. It reflects her frustration with how Facebook handled the matter, the sources added, and her lack of appetite to hear his explanation. Her staff and Zuckerberg's have been in contact, the Post added. Both Facebook and Pelosi's office declined to comment when contacted by the newspaper. Read more: Nancy Pelosi slams Facebook in response to misleading videos and calls the company 'willing enablers' of Russian interference[3] In the days after Facebook failed to remove the video, Pelosi suggested that the firm's decision had convinced her it knowingly enabled Russian election interference in 2016.\"I thought it was unwittingly, but clearly they wittingly were accomplices and enablers of false information to go across Facebook,\" she said last month.[4] Pelosi later doubled down by calling for regulation of the internet giants. \"Unwarranted, concentrated economic power in the hands of a few is dangerous to democracy - especially when digital platforms control content. The era of self-regulation is over,\" she tweeted.[5] The Post's report about Pelosi giving Zuckerberg the cold shoulder came as a fake video of the Facebook CEO surfaced on Instagram[6]. It was created as part of an exhibit called \"Spectre\" for the Sheffield Doc Fest, a documentary festival in the UK.NOW WATCH: Here's why it's so hard to switch from Apple to Android[7]See Also:

The update follows the announcement in June of a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/oct/15/democratic-debate-live-warren-biden-sanders-trump-steyer-latest-2020-news-tonight\">policy whereby the company would choose not to delete tweets</url> by major political figures that violated the company's rules if the company decided it was in the public interest. </p><p>Since the election of Donald Trump, Twitter has been in the unenviable position of having the ability to censor the president of the United States on the very platform where he is the most unguarded. It has largely resisted the intense pressure to do so, even when it seemed that Trump's tweets might have fallen afoul of Twitter's rules if they had been sent by anyone else. </p><p>In September 2017, after Trump appeared to threaten North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Twitter, the company announced that it had begun considering \"newsworthiness\" when considering whether to take down a tweet. </p><p>The June 2019 policy allowed for a scenario whereby a world leader's tweet was bad enough to come down, but merited remaining up for documentation or accountability.

Amazon has been criticized for tax benefits[4] some see as unfair and for having itslow-wage warehouse employees[5]work long hours for little pay, all while fighting their efforts to unionize[6]. Uber has faced several drivers' strikes[7], most recently in Los Angeles, for cutting drivers' pay per mile \u2015 all while drivers are categorized as contractors rather than employees, preventing them from unionizing or receiving benefits like health care or 401(k) retirement funds. </p><p>Facebook and Twitter have also notably come under fire for not doing enough to manage the spread of hate[8] and misinformation on their platforms, and Facebook has experienced a seemingly endless series of privacy snafus[9].Swisher asked Pelosi about Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break up big tech companies like Google and Facebook[10] because she says they have too much power and stifle competition. The House speaker said she hadn't studied the Massachusetts senator's proposal, but cautiously expressed that such moves should be looked into.'I know there could be some clear lines that we see right in our own community of companies that maybe could be easily broken up without having any impact, one on the other,' she said. 'I don't know how all of these should be painted with the same brush, but I think that's a look that should be taken,' she added.Pelosi also spoke of Section 230[11] of the Communications Decency Act \u2015 a provision that gives online intermediaries like Google, YouTube and Reddit immunity from liability for any third-party content posted to or hosted on their platforms.'[Section] 230 is a gift to them ... and I don't think they are treating it with the respect that they should,' Pelosi said of tech companies. 'And so I think that that could be a question mark and in jeopardy.''They just love 230,' she added. 'For the privilege of 230, there has to be a bigger sense of responsibility on it, and it is not out of the question that that could be removed.'Speaking of Democrats' relationship with tech giants, Pelosi noted the companies are often 'out there' in a positive sense on issues of immigration, gun safety, women's and LGBTQ rights, and that they 'take pride' in their involvement. 'You're maybe not gonna like what I have to say \u2015 they won't,' Pelosi added. 'I think all of that interest, and I believe it is sincere on their part, is trumped \u2015 pun intended \u2015 by their interest in a tax cut.'When President Donald Trump announced his tax overhaul in 2017, tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft reportedly lobbied in support[12] of the tax bill, which would allow them to bring overseas cash back to the U.S. at reduced tax rates[13]. Pelosi called the tax changes a 'scam' and 'disgrace' that gave '1% of the people 83% of the benefit of it.'

Applewhite/AP House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Facebook on Thursday, highlighting brewing concerns over the social media giant's size and influence as well as its impact on election interference. During a press conference, Pelosi called Facebook's behavior \"shameful\" and accused it of acting in an \"irresponsible\" way. Facebook is under scrutiny for its handling of privacy and its role spreading misinformation ahead of the 2016 elections. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Facebook during a press conference on Thursday[2], calling the company's behavior \"shameful\" and accusing the tech giant of acting in an \"irresponsible\" manner. The comments come as Facebook has been embroiled in several controversies over the past few years regarding digital privacy, election interference, and antitrust regulation among other issues. Pelosi, who represents San Francisco, where Facebook has offices, was responding to a question about whether she believes technology executives like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg hold too much power, reigniting ongoing concerns about the influence of large tech firms.  \"The Facebook business model is strictly to make money,\" she said. \"They don't care about the impact on children, they don't care about truth. They don't care about where this is all coming from.\" Facebook has been under increased scrutiny in recent years over privacy and security-related issues, potentially anticompetitive business practices, its role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 election, and its stance on free speech and content moderation. For example, Facebook's decision not to fact-check political ads [3]recently resulted in backlash from both Facebook's own employees and politicians such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In her response during the press conference on Thursday, Pelosi specifically called out the thousands of fake ads[4] paid for by Russian parties that ran on Facebook leading up to the 2016 presidential election. \"They didn't even check on the money from Russia in the last election,\" Pelosi said. \"They never even thought they should. So they have been very irresponsible.\" She also said Facebook has indicated that it intends \"to be accomplices for misleading the American people.\" Pelosi's comments underscore concerns that have been simmering amongst lawmakers and regulators over the past year over whether or not the size and scope of companies like Facebook have enabled them to become too powerful. Warren in particular has been a vocal advocate of regulating large tech firms, as she proposed a sweeping plan last March to break up big tech companies and roll back certain acquisitions, such as Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram. Zuckerberg has said in the past that he's in support of regulation, proposing in aWashington Post[5] op-ed from last March that the internet should be regulated when it comes to harmful content, election integrity, and data profitability.

Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican and an outspoken critic of Silicon Valley, has proposed legislation that could roll back the law's liability protections for companies that fail to meet a government-mandated standard for political neutrality. </p><p>Earlier this year, a draft White House executive order called for the Federal Communications Commission to develop new regulations to clarify when and how social media companies are legally protected for removing or suppressing content on their platforms. The effort prompted questions about the proposal's constitutionality and swift pushback internally from agency officials. </p><p>Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a tech trade group, argued in a statement Thursday that excluding the protections from USMCA would \"negatively impact\" entrepreneurs who use online platforms to promote their businesses.</p><p>Making content liability protections a part of US trade deals, he said, would \"ensure that people across the world can share their thoughts, ideas, and viewpoints without government intervention.\"</p><p>Pelosi's comments come as congressional Democrats say they are in the final stretch of negotiations with the administration for changes to Trump's revised North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Democrats have pushed for stronger labor and environmental standards to be enshrined in the pact, as well as firm enforcement provisions. Pelosi says she hopes to hold a vote on the trade deal by the end of the year, although calendar time will be tight in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Pelosi has been working closely on the tech protections issue with Rep. Frank Pallone, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who serves on the nine-member working group that has met with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for months to hammer out USMCA's language, according to a Democratic aide. </p><p>It could be an area of bipartisan agreement: Republicans and Democrats alike have raised concerns about modeling parts of trade agreements after Section 230. In August, Pallone and Rep. Greg Walden, the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, sent a letter to Lighthizer criticizing his handling of the issue. </p><p>\"We find it inappropriate for the United States to export language mirroring Section 230 while such serious policy discussions [about the law] are ongoing,\" the letter read. </p><p>Walden later slammed the Trump administration for allowing language similar to Section 230 to appear in a trade deal with Japan, which was announced in September and ratified by Japan's legislature on Wednesday. That deal is expected to take effect in January. </p><p>At a congressional hearing in October, Walden said he was \"very frustrated\" about not being consulted and that he hoped \"the administration's paying attention and listening, because they haven't up to this point on the matter.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican and an outspoken critic of Silicon Valley, has proposed legislation that could roll back the law's liability protections for companies that fail to meet a government-mandated standard for political neutrality.</p><p>Earlier this year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/tech/white-house-social-media-executive-order-fcc-ftc/index.html\">a draft White House executive order</url> called for the Federal Communications Commission to develop new regulations to clarify when and how social media companies are legally protected for removing or suppressing content on their platforms. The effort prompted questions about the proposal's constitutionality and .</p><p>Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a tech trade group, argued in a statement Thursday that excluding the protections from USMCA would \"negatively impact\" entrepreneurs who use online platforms to promote their businesses.</p><p>Making content liability protections a part of US trade deals, he said, would \"ensure that people across the world can share their thoughts, ideas, and viewpoints without government intervention.\"</p><p>Pelosi's comments come as congressional Democrats say they are in the final stretch of negotiations with the administration for changes to Trump's revised North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Democrats have pushed for stronger labor and environmental standards to be enshrined in the pact, as well as firm enforcement provisions. Pelosi says she hopes to hold a vote on the trade deal by the end of the year, although calendar time will be tight in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Pelosi has been working closely on the tech protections issue with Rep. Frank Pallone, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who serves on the nine-member working group that has met with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for months to hammer out USMCA's language, according to a Democratic aide.</p><p>It could be an area of bipartisan agreement: Republicans and Democrats alike have raised concerns about modeling parts of trade agreements after Section 230. In August, Pallone and Rep. Greg Walden, the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, sent a letter to Lighthizer criticizing his handling of the issue.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/12/06/tesla-tweaks-cybertruck-production-timeline/\">Tesla extends Cybertruck production timeline       </url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/tech/ftc-fcc-trump-social-media/index.html\">swift pushback internally from agency officials</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/12/06/despite-security-warnings-trump-still-uses-his-personal-cell-phone/\">           Despite security warnings, Trump still uses his personal cell phone       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/12/06/ftc-finds-that-cambridge-analytica-deceived-facebook-users/\">           FTC finds that Cambridge Analytica deceived Facebook users       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/12/06/sen-sander-rolls-out-broadband-for-all-proposal/\">           Sen.

Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican and an outspoken critic of Silicon Valley, has proposed legislation that could roll back the law's liability protections for companies that fail to meet a government-mandated standard for political neutrality.</p><p>Earlier this year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/tech/white-house-social-media-executive-order-fcc-ftc/index.html\">a draft White House executive order</url> called for the Federal Communications Commission to develop new regulations to clarify when and how social media companies are legally protected for removing or suppressing content on their platforms. The effort prompted questions about the proposal's constitutionality and .</p><p>Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a tech trade group, argued in a statement Thursday that excluding the protections from USMCA would \"negatively impact\" entrepreneurs who use online platforms to promote their businesses.</p><p>Making content liability protections a part of US trade deals, he said, would \"ensure that people across the world can share their thoughts, ideas, and viewpoints without government intervention.\"</p><p>Pelosi's comments come as congressional Democrats say they are in the final stretch of negotiations with the administration for changes to Trump's revised North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Democrats have pushed for stronger labor and environmental standards to be enshrined in the pact, as well as firm enforcement provisions. Pelosi says she hopes to hold a vote on the trade deal by the end of the year, although calendar time will be tight in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Pelosi has been working closely on the tech protections issue with Rep. Frank Pallone, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who serves on the nine-member working group that has met with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for months to hammer out USMCA's language, according to a Democratic aide.</p><p>It could be an area of bipartisan agreement: Republicans and Democrats alike have raised concerns about modeling parts of trade agreements after Section 230. In August, Pallone and Rep. Greg Walden, the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, sent a letter to Lighthizer criticizing his handling of the issue.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/06/h-1b-visa-new-registration-system-will-start-in-march/\">           H-1B visa: New registration system will start in March       </url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/tech/ftc-fcc-trump-social-media/index.html\">swift pushback internally from agency officials</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/06/despite-security-warnings-trump-still-uses-his-personal-cell-phone/\">           Despite security warnings, Trump still uses his personal cell phone       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/06/tesla-tweaks-cybertruck-production-timeline/\">Tesla extends Cybertruck production timeline       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/06/ftc-finds-that-cambridge-analytica-deceived-facebook-users/\">           FTC finds that Cambridge Analytica deceived Facebook users       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/06/sen-sander-rolls-out-broadband-for-all-proposal/\">           Sen.

We are New Yorkers, so were aggressive about it, were ambitious about it We realise that change is not only imminent, but it can actually be a friend if done the right way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The inspiration for these uncharacteristically good vibes was a video visit from the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt , who joined the governors briefing to announce that he will be heading up a panel to reimagine New York states post-Covid reality, with an emphasis on permanently integrating technology into every aspect of civic life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first priorities of what were trying to do, Schmidt said, are focused on telehealth, remote learning, and broadband We need to look for solutions that can be presented now, and accelerated, and use technology to make things better. Lest there be any doubt that the former Google chairs goals were purely benevolent, his video background featured a framed pair of golden angel wings.</p><p>Just one day earlier, Cuomo had announced a similar partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a smarter education system. Calling Gates a visionary, Cuomo said the pandemic has created a moment in history when we can actually incorporate and advance [Gatess] ideas all these buildings, all these physical classrooms why, with all the technology you have? he asked, apparently rhetorically.</p><p>It has taken some time to gel, but something resembling a coherent pandemic shock doctrine is beginning to emerge. Call it the Screen New Deal. Far more hi-tech than anything we have seen during previous disasters, the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives, but as a living laboratory for a permanent and highly profitable no-touch future.</p><p>Anuja Sonalker, the CEO of Steer Tech , a Maryland-based company selling self-parking technology, recently summed up the new virus-personalised pitch. There has been a distinct warming up to humanless, contactless technology, she said . Humans are biohazards, machines are not.</p><p>Its a future in which our homes are never again exclusively personal spaces, but are also, via high-speed digital connectivity, our schools, our doctors offices, our gyms, and, if determined by the state, our jails. Of course, for many of us, those same homes were already turning into our never-off workplaces and our primary entertainment venues before the pandemic, and surveillance incarceration in the community was already booming. But in the future that is hastily being constructed, all of these trends are poised for a warp-speed acceleration.</p><p>This is a future in which, for the privileged, almost everything is home delivered, either virtually via streaming and cloud technology, or physically via driverless vehicle or drone, then screen shared on a mediated platform. Its a future that employs far fewer teachers, doctors and drivers. It accepts no cash or credit cards (under guise of virus control), and has skeletal mass transit and far less live art. Its a future that claims to be run on artificial intelligence, but is actually held together by tens of millions of anonymous workers tucked away in warehouses, data centres, content-moderation mills, electronic sweatshops, lithium mines, industrial farms, meat-processing plants and prisons, where they are left unprotected from disease and hyper-exploitation. Its a future in which our every move, our every word, our every relationship is trackable, traceable and data-mineable by unprecedented collaborations between government and tech giants.</p><p>If all of this sounds familiar, its because, pre-Covid, this precise app-driven, gig-fuelled future was being sold to us in the name of friction-free convenience and personalisation. But many of us had concerns. About the security, quality and inequity of telehealth and online classrooms . About driverless cars mowing down pedestrians and drones smashing packages (and people ). About location tracking and cash-free commerce obliterating our privacy and entrenching racial and gender discrimination. About unscrupulous social media platforms poisoning our information ecology and our kids mental health . About smart cities filled with sensors supplanting local government. About the good jobs these technologies wiped out. About the bad jobs they mass produced.</p><p>And most of all, we had concerns about the democracy-threatening wealth and power accumulated by a handful of tech companies that are masters of abdication eschewing all responsibility for the wreckage left behind in the fields they now dominate, whether media, retail or transportation.</p><p>That was the ancient past, also known as February. Today, a great many of those well-founded concerns are being swept away by a tidal wave of panic, and this warmed-over dystopia is going through a rush-job rebranding. Now, against a harrowing backdrop of mass death, it is being sold to us on the dubious promise that these technologies are the only possible way to pandemic-proof our lives, the indispensable keys to keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe.</p><p>Thanks to Cuomo and his various billionaire partnerships (including one with Michael Bloomberg for testing and tracing), New York state is being positioned as the gleaming showroom for this grim future but the ambitions reach far beyond the borders of any one state or country.</p><p>And at the dead centre of it all is Eric Schmidt.</p><p>W ell before Americans understood the threat of Covid-19, Schmidt had been on an aggressive lobbying and public-relations campaign, pushing precisely the Black Mirror vision of society that Cuomo has just empowered him to build. At the heart of this vision is seamless integration of government with a handful of Silicon Valley giants with public schools, hospitals, doctors offices, police and military all outsourcing (at a high cost) many of their core functions to private tech companies.</p><p>Its a vision Schmidt has been advancing in his roles as chair of the Defense Innovation Board , which advises the US Department of Defense on increased use of artificial intelligence in the military, and as chair of the powerful National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence , or NSCAI, which advises Congress on advances in artificial intelligence, related machine learning developments and associated technologies, with the goal of addressing the national and economic security needs of the United States, including economic risk. Both boards are crowded with powerful Silicon Valley CEOs and top executives from companies including Oracle , Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and of course, Schmidts former colleagues at Google.</p><p>As chair, Schmidt who still holds more than $5.3bn in shares of Alphabet (Googles parent company), as well as large investments in other tech firms has essentially been running a Washington-based shakedown on behalf of Silicon Valley. The main purpose of the two boards is to call for exponential increases in government spending on research into artificial intelligence and on tech-enabling infrastructure such as 5G investments that would directly benefit the companies in which Schmidt and other members of these boards have extensive holdings.</p><p>First in closed-door presentations to lawmakers, and later in public-facing opinion articles and interviews, the thrust of Schmidts argument has been that since the Chinese government is willing to spend limitless public money building the infrastructure of high-tech surveillance, while allowing Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba, Baidu and Huawei to pocket the profits from commercial applications, the USs dominant position in the global economy is on the precipice of collapsing.</p><p>The Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic) recently got access, through a freedom of information (FOI) request, to a presentation made by Schmidts NSCAI in May 2019. Its slides make a series of alarmist claims about how Chinas relatively lax regulatory infrastructure and its bottomless appetite for surveillance are causing it to pull ahead of the US in a number of fields, including AI for medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, digital infrastructure, smart cities, ride-sharing and cashless commerce.</p><p>The reasons given for Chinas competitive edge are myriad, ranging from the sheer volume of consumers who shop online; the lack of legacy banking systems in China, which has allowed it to leapfrog over cash and credit cards and unleash a huge e-commerce and digital services market using digital payments; and a severe doctor shortage, which has led the government to work closely with tech companies such as Tencent to use AI for predictive medicine. The slides note that in China, tech companies have the authority to quickly clear regulatory barriers, while American initiatives are mired in HIPPA compliance and FDA approval.</p><p>A slide from the Chinese Tech Landscape Overview (NSCAI presentation) discussing surveillance. Photograph: NSCAI</p><p>More than any other factor, however, the NSCAI points to Chinas willingness to embrace public-private partnerships in mass surveillance and data collection as a reason for its competitive edge. The presentation touts Chinas Explicit government support and involvement eg facial recognition deployment. It argues that surveillance is one of the first-and-best customers for Al and further, that mass surveillance is a killer application for deep learning.</p><p>A slide titled State Datasets: Surveillance = Smart Cities notes that China, along with Googles main Chinese competitor, Alibaba, are racing ahead.</p><p>This is notable because Googles parent company, Alphabet, has been pushing this precise vision through its Sidewalk Labs division, choosing a large portion of Torontos waterfront as its smart city prototype . But the Toronto project was just shut down after two years of ceaseless controversy relating to the enormous amounts of personal data that Alphabet would collect, a lack of privacy protections, and questionable benefits for the city as a whole.</p><p>Five months after this presentation, in November, NSCAI issued an interim report to Congress further raising the alarm about the need for the US to match Chinas adaptation of these controversial technologies. We are in a strategic competition, states the report , obtained via FOI by Epic. AI will be at the centre. The future of our national security and economy are at stake.</p><p>By late February, Schmidt was taking his campaign to the public, perhaps understanding that the budget increases his board was calling for could not be approved without a great deal more buy-in. In a New York Times article headlined I used to Run Google. Silicon Valley Could Lose to China, Schmidt called for unprecedented partnerships between government and industry and, once again sounding the yellow peril alarm, wrote:</p><p>AI will open new frontiers in everything from biotechnology to banking, and it is also a defense department priority If current trends continue, Chinas overall investments in research and development are expected to surpass those of the United States within 10 years, around the same time its economy is projected to become larger than ours .</p><p>Unless these trends change, in the 2030s we will be competing with a country that has a bigger economy, more research and development investments, better research, wider deployment of new technologies and stronger computing infrastructure Ultimately, the Chinese are competing to become the worlds leading innovators, and the United States is not playing to win.</p><p>The only solution, for Schmidt, was a gush of public money. Praising the White House for requesting a doubling of research funding in AI and quantum information science, he wrote: We should plan to double funding in those fields again as we build institutional capacity in labs and research centres At the same time, Congress should meet the presidents request for the highest level of defen ce R &amp; D funding in over 70 years , and the defense department should capitalise on that resource surge to build breakthrough capabilities in AI, quantum, hypersonics and other priority technology areas.</p><p>That was exactly two weeks before the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic, and there was no mention that a goal of this vast, hi-tech expansion was to protect American health. Only that it was necessary to avoid being outcompeted by China. But, of course, that would soon change.</p><p>In the two months since, Schmidt has put these pre-existing demands for massive public expenditures on high-tech research and infrastructure, for a slew of public-private partnerships in AI, and for the loosening of myriad privacy and safety protections through an aggressive rebranding exercise. Now all of these measures (and more) are being sold to the public as our only possible hope of protecting ourselves from a novel virus that will be with us for years to come.</p><p>And the tech companies to which Schmidt has deep ties, and which populate the influential advisory boards he chairs, have all repositioned themselves as benevolent protectors of public health and munificent champions of everyday hero essential workers (many of whom, like delivery drivers, would lose their jobs if these companies get their way). Less than two weeks into New York states lockdown, Schmidt wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal that both set the new tone and made clear that Silicon Valley had every intention of leveraging the crisis for a permanent transformation.</p><p>Like other Americans, technologists are trying to do their part to support the front-line pandemic response</p><p>But every American should be asking where we want the nation to be when the Covid-19 pandemic is over. How could the emerging technologies being deployed in the current crisis propel us into a better future? Companies like Amazon know how to supply and distribute efficiently. They will need to provide services and advice to government officials who lack the computing systems and expertise.</p><p>We should also accelerate the trend toward remote learning, which is being tested today as never before. Online, there is no requirement of proximity, which allows students to get instruction from the best teachers, no matter what school district they reside in</p><p>The need for fast, large-scale experimentation will also accelerate the biotech revolution Finally, the country is long overdue for a real digital infrastructure If we are to build a future economy and education system based on tele-everything, we need a fully connected population and ultrafast infrastructure. The government must make a massive investment perhaps as part of a stimulus package to convert the nations digital infrastructure to cloud-based platforms and link them with a 5G network.</p><p>Indeed, Schmidt has been relentless in pursuing this vision. Two weeks after that article appeared, he described the ad-hoc home schooling programming that teachers and families across the country had been forced to cobble together during this public health emergency as a massive experiment in remote learning.</p><p>The goal of this experiment, he said, was trying to find out: how do kids learn remotely? And with that data we should be able to build better remote and distance learning tools which, when combined with the teacher will help kids learn better. During this same video call, hosted by the Economic Club of New York, Schmidt also called for more telehealth, more 5G, more digital commerce and the rest of the preexisting wish list. All in the name of fighting the virus.</p><p>His most telling comment, however, was this: The benefit of these corporations, which we love to malign, in terms of the ability to communicate, the ability to deal with health, the ability to get information, is profound. Think about what your life would be like in America without Amazon. He added that people should be a little bit grateful that these companies got the capital, did the investment, built the tools that were using now, and have really helped us out.</p><p>S chmidts words are a reminder that until very recently, public pushback against these companies was surging. Presidential candidates were openly discussing breaking up big tech. Amazon was forced to pull its plans for a New York headquarters because of fierce local opposition. Googles Sidewalk Labs project was in perennial crisis , and Google workers were refusing to build surveillance tech with military applications.</p><p>In short, democracy inconvenient public engagement in the designing of critical institutions and public spaces was turning out to be the single greatest obstacle to the vision Schmidt was advancing, first from his perch at the top of Google and Alphabet, and then as chair of two powerful boards advising US Congress and the Department of Defense. As the NSCAI documents reveal, this inconvenient exercise of power by members of the public and by tech workers inside these mega-firms has, from the perspective of men such as Schmidt and the Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, maddeningly slowed down the AI arms race, keeping fleets of potentially deadly driverless cars and trucks off the roads, protecting private health records from becoming a weapon used by employers against workers, preventing urban spaces from being blanketing with facial recognition software, and much more.</p><p>Now, in the midst of the carnage of this ongoing pandemic, and the fear and uncertainty about the future it has brought, these companies clearly see their moment to sweep out all that democratic engagement. To have the same kind of power as their Chinese competitors, who have the luxury of functioning without being hampered by intrusions of either labour or civil rights.</p><p>All of this is moving very fast. The Australian government has contracted with Amazon to store the data for its controversial coronavirus tracking app. The Canadian government has contracted with Amazon to deliver medical equipment, raising questions about why it bypassed the public postal service. And in just a few short days in early May, Alphabet has spun up a new Sidewalk Labs initiative to remake urban infrastructure with $400m in seed capital. Josh Marcuse, the executive director of the Defense Innovation Board chaired by Schmidt, announced that he was leaving that job to work full-time at Google as head of strategy and innovation for global public sector, meaning that he will be helping Google to cash in on some of the many opportunities he and Schmidt have been busily creating with their lobbying.</p><p>T o be clear, technology is most certainly a key part of how we must protect public health in the coming months and years. The question is: will that technology be subject to the disciplines of democracy and public oversight, or will it be rolled out in state-of-exception frenzy, without asking critical questions that will shape our lives for decades to come? Questions such as these, for instance: if we are indeed seeing how critical digital connectivity is in times of crisis, should these networks, and our data, really be in the hands of private players such as Google, Amazon and Apple? If public funds are paying for so much of it, should the public also own and control it? If the internet is essential for so much in our lives, as it clearly is, should it be treated as a nonprofit public utility?</p><p>And while there is no doubt that the ability to teleconference has been a lifeline in this period of lockdown, there are serious debates to be had about whether our more lasting protections are distinctly more human. Take education. Schmidt is right that overcrowded classrooms present a health risk, at least until we have a vaccine. So how about hiring double the number of teachers and cutting class size in half? How about making sure that every school has a nurse?</p><p>That would create much-needed jobs in a depression-level unemployment crisis, and give everyone in the learning environment more elbow room. If buildings are too crowded, how about dividing the day into shifts, and having more outdoor education, drawing on the plentiful research that shows that time in nature enhances childrens capacity to learn?</p><p>Introducing those kinds of changes would be hard, to be sure. But they are not nearly as risky as giving up on the tried-and-true technology of trained humans teaching younger humans face-to-face, in groups where they learn to socialise with one another to boot.</p><p>'If one of us gets sick, we all get sick': the food workers on the coronavirus front line</p><p>Upon learning of New York states new partnership with the Gates Foundation, Andy Pallotta, the president of the New York State United Teachers union, was quick to react : If we want to reimagine education, lets start with addressing the need for social workers, mental health counsellors, school nurses, enriching arts courses, advanced courses and smaller class sizes in school districts across the state, he said. A coalition of parents groups also pointed out that if they had indeed been living an experiment in remote learning (as Schmidt put it), then the results were deeply worrying: Since the schools were shut down in mid-March, our understanding of the profound deficiencies of screen-based instruction has only grown.</p><p>I n addition to the obvious class and race biases against children who lack internet access and home computers (problems that tech companies are eager to be paid to solve with massive tech buys), there are big questions about whether remote teaching can serve many kids with disabilities, as required by law . And there is no technological solution to the problem of learning in a home environment that is overcrowded and/or abusive.</p><p>The issue is not whether schools must change in the face of a highly contagious virus for which we have neither cure nor inoculation. Like every institution where humans gather in groups, they will change. The trouble, as always in these moments of collective shock, is the absence of public debate about what those changes should look like, and who they should benefit private tech companies or students?</p><p>The same questions need to be asked about health. Avoiding doctors offices and hospitals during a pandemic makes good sense. But telehealth misses a huge amount. So we need to have an evidence-based debate about the pros and cons of spending scarce public resources on telehealth rather than on more trained nurses, equipped with all the necessary protective equipment, who are able to make house calls to diagnose and treat patients in their homes. And, perhaps most urgently, we need to get the balance right between virus tracking apps, which, with the proper privacy protections, have a role to play, and the calls for a community health corps that would put millions of Americans to work, not only doing contact-tracing, but making sure that everyone has the material resources and support they need to quarantine safely.</p><p>In each case, we face real and hard choices between investing in humans and investing in technology. Because the brutal truth is that, as it stands, we are very unlikely to do both. The refusal to transfer anything like the needed resources to states and cities in successive federal bailouts means that the coronavirus health crisis is now slamming headlong into a manufactured austerity crisis. Public schools, universities, hospitals and transit are facing existential questions about their futures. If tech companies win their ferocious lobbying campaign for remote learning, telehealth, 5G and driverless vehicles their Screen New Deal there simply wont be any money left over for urgent public priorities, never mind the Green New Deal that our planet urgently needs. On the contrary: the price tag for all the shiny gadgets will be mass teacher layoffs and hospital closures.</p><p>Tech provides us with powerful tools, but not every solution is technological. And the trouble with outsourcing key decisions about how to reimagine our states and cities to men such as Bill Gates and Schmidt is that they have spent their lives demonstrating the belief that there is no problem that technology cannot fix.</p><p>For them, and many others in Silicon Valley, the pandemic is a golden opportunity to receive not just the gratitude, but the deference and power that they feel has been unjustly denied. And Andrew Cuomo, by putting the former Google chair in charge of the body that will shape the states reopening, appears to have just given him something close to free rein.</p><p>Republished with permission from The Intercept .

We are New Yorkers, so were aggressive about it, were ambitious about it We realise that change is not only imminent, but it can actually be a friend if done the right way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The inspiration for these uncharacteristically good vibes was a video visit from the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt , who joined the governors briefing to announce that he will be heading up a panel to reimagine New York states post-Covid reality, with an emphasis on permanently integrating technology into every aspect of civic life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first priorities of what were trying to do, Schmidt said, are focused on telehealth, remote learning, and broadband We need to look for solutions that can be presented now, and accelerated, and use technology to make things better. Lest there be any doubt that the former Google chairs goals were purely benevolent, his video background featured a framed pair of golden angel wings.</p><p>Just one day earlier, Cuomo had announced a similar partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a smarter education system. Calling Gates a visionary, Cuomo said the pandemic has created a moment in history when we can actually incorporate and advance [Gatess] ideas all these buildings, all these physical classrooms why, with all the technology you have? he asked, apparently rhetorically.</p><p>It has taken some time to gel, but something resembling a coherent pandemic shock doctrine is beginning to emerge. Call it the Screen New Deal. Far more hi-tech than anything we have seen during previous disasters, the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives, but as a living laboratory for a permanent and highly profitable no-touch future.</p><p>Anuja Sonalker, the CEO of Steer Tech , a Maryland-based company selling self-parking technology, recently summed up the new virus-personalised pitch. There has been a distinct warming up to humanless, contactless technology, she said . Humans are biohazards, machines are not.</p><p>Its a future in which our homes are never again exclusively personal spaces, but are also, via high-speed digital connectivity, our schools, our doctors offices, our gyms, and, if determined by the state, our jails. Of course, for many of us, those same homes were already turning into our never-off workplaces and our primary entertainment venues before the pandemic, and surveillance incarceration in the community was already booming. But in the future that is hastily being constructed, all of these trends are poised for a warp-speed acceleration.</p><p>This is a future in which, for the privileged, almost everything is home delivered, either virtually via streaming and cloud technology, or physically via driverless vehicle or drone, then screen shared on a mediated platform. Its a future that employs far fewer teachers, doctors and drivers. It accepts no cash or credit cards (under guise of virus control), and has skeletal mass transit and far less live art. Its a future that claims to be run on artificial intelligence, but is actually held together by tens of millions of anonymous workers tucked away in warehouses, data centres, content-moderation mills, electronic sweatshops, lithium mines, industrial farms, meat-processing plants and prisons, where they are left unprotected from disease and hyper-exploitation. Its a future in which our every move, our every word, our every relationship is trackable, traceable and data-mineable by unprecedented collaborations between government and tech giants.</p><p>If all of this sounds familiar, its because, pre-Covid, this precise app-driven, gig-fuelled future was being sold to us in the name of friction-free convenience and personalisation. But many of us had concerns. About the security, quality and inequity of telehealth and online classrooms . About driverless cars mowing down pedestrians and drones smashing packages (and people ). About location tracking and cash-free commerce obliterating our privacy and entrenching racial and gender discrimination. About unscrupulous social media platforms poisoning our information ecology and our kids mental health . About smart cities filled with sensors supplanting local government. About the good jobs these technologies wiped out. About the bad jobs they mass produced.</p><p>And most of all, we had concerns about the democracy-threatening wealth and power accumulated by a handful of tech companies that are masters of abdication eschewing all responsibility for the wreckage left behind in the fields they now dominate, whether media, retail or transportation.</p><p>That was the ancient past, also known as February. Today, a great many of those well-founded concerns are being swept away by a tidal wave of panic, and this warmed-over dystopia is going through a rush-job rebranding. Now, against a harrowing backdrop of mass death, it is being sold to us on the dubious promise that these technologies are the only possible way to pandemic-proof our lives, the indispensable keys to keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe.</p><p>Thanks to Cuomo and his various billionaire partnerships (including one with Michael Bloomberg for testing and tracing), New York state is being positioned as the gleaming showroom for this grim future but the ambitions reach far beyond the borders of any one state or country.</p><p>And at the dead centre of it all is Eric Schmidt.</p><p>W ell before Americans understood the threat of Covid-19, Schmidt had been on an aggressive lobbying and public-relations campaign, pushing precisely the Black Mirror vision of society that Cuomo has just empowered him to build. At the heart of this vision is seamless integration of government with a handful of Silicon Valley giants with public schools, hospitals, doctors offices, police and military all outsourcing (at a high cost) many of their core functions to private tech companies.</p><p>Its a vision Schmidt has been advancing in his roles as chair of the Defense Innovation Board , which advises the US Department of Defense on increased use of artificial intelligence in the military, and as chair of the powerful National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence , or NSCAI, which advises Congress on advances in artificial intelligence, related machine learning developments and associated technologies, with the goal of addressing the national and economic security needs of the United States, including economic risk. Both boards are crowded with powerful Silicon Valley CEOs and top executives from companies including Oracle , Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and of course, Schmidts former colleagues at Google.</p><p>As chair, Schmidt who still holds more than $5.3bn in shares of Alphabet (Googles parent company), as well as large investments in other tech firms has essentially been running a Washington-based shakedown on behalf of Silicon Valley. The main purpose of the two boards is to call for exponential increases in government spending on research into artificial intelligence and on tech-enabling infrastructure such as 5G investments that would directly benefit the companies in which Schmidt and other members of these boards have extensive holdings.</p><p>First in closed-door presentations to lawmakers, and later in public-facing opinion articles and interviews, the thrust of Schmidts argument has been that since the Chinese government is willing to spend limitless public money building the infrastructure of high-tech surveillance, while allowing Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba, Baidu and Huawei to pocket the profits from commercial applications, the USs dominant position in the global economy is on the precipice of collapsing.</p><p>The Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic) recently got access, through a freedom of information (FOI) request, to a presentation made by Schmidts NSCAI in May 2019. Its slides make a series of alarmist claims about how Chinas relatively lax regulatory infrastructure and its bottomless appetite for surveillance are causing it to pull ahead of the US in a number of fields, including AI for medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, digital infrastructure, smart cities, ride-sharing and cashless commerce.</p><p>The reasons given for Chinas competitive edge are myriad, ranging from the sheer volume of consumers who shop online; the lack of legacy banking systems in China, which has allowed it to leapfrog over cash and credit cards and unleash a huge e-commerce and digital services market using digital payments; and a severe doctor shortage, which has led the government to work closely with tech companies such as Tencent to use AI for predictive medicine. The slides note that in China, tech companies have the authority to quickly clear regulatory barriers, while American initiatives are mired in HIPPA compliance and FDA approval.</p><p>More than any other factor, however, the NSCAI points to Chinas willingness to embrace public-private partnerships in mass surveillance and data collection as a reason for its competitive edge. The presentation touts Chinas Explicit government support and involvement eg facial recognition deployment. It argues that surveillance is one of the first-and-best customers for Al and further, that mass surveillance is a killer application for deep learning.</p><p>A slide titled State Datasets: Surveillance = Smart Cities notes that China, along with Googles main Chinese competitor, Alibaba, are racing ahead.</p><p>This is notable because Googles parent company, Alphabet, has been pushing this precise vision through its Sidewalk Labs division, choosing a large portion of Torontos waterfront as its smart city prototype . But the Toronto project was just shut down after two years of ceaseless controversy relating to the enormous amounts of personal data that Alphabet would collect, a lack of privacy protections, and questionable benefits for the city as a whole.</p><p>Five months after this presentation, in November, NSCAI issued an interim report to Congress further raising the alarm about the need for the US to match Chinas adaptation of these controversial technologies. We are in a strategic competition, states the report , obtained via FOI by Epic. AI will be at the centre. The future of our national security and economy are at stake.</p><p>By late February, Schmidt was taking his campaign to the public, perhaps understanding that the budget increases his board was calling for could not be approved without a great deal more buy-in. In a New York Times article headlined I used to Run Google. Silicon Valley Could Lose to China, Schmidt called for unprecedented partnerships between government and industry and, once again sounding the yellow peril alarm, wrote:</p><p>AI will open new frontiers in everything from biotechnology to banking, and it is also a defense department priority If current trends continue, Chinas overall investments in research and development are expected to surpass those of the United States within 10 years, around the same time its economy is projected to become larger than ours .</p><p>Unless these trends change, in the 2030s we will be competing with a country that has a bigger economy, more research and development investments, better research, wider deployment of new technologies and stronger computing infrastructure Ultimately, the Chinese are competing to become the worlds leading innovators, and the United States is not playing to win.</p><p>The only solution, for Schmidt, was a gush of public money. Praising the White House for requesting a doubling of research funding in AI and quantum information science, he wrote: We should plan to double funding in those fields again as we build institutional capacity in labs and research centres At the same time, Congress should meet the presidents request for the highest level of defen ce R &amp; D funding in over 70 years , and the defense department should capitalise on that resource surge to build breakthrough capabilities in AI, quantum, hypersonics and other priority technology areas.</p><p>That was exactly two weeks before the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic, and there was no mention that a goal of this vast, hi-tech expansion was to protect American health. Only that it was necessary to avoid being outcompeted by China. But, of course, that would soon change.</p><p>In the two months since, Schmidt has put these pre-existing demands for massive public expenditures on high-tech research and infrastructure, for a slew of public-private partnerships in AI, and for the loosening of myriad privacy and safety protections through an aggressive rebranding exercise. Now all of these measures (and more) are being sold to the public as our only possible hope of protecting ourselves from a novel virus that will be with us for years to come.</p><p>And the tech companies to which Schmidt has deep ties, and which populate the influential advisory boards he chairs, have all repositioned themselves as benevolent protectors of public health and munificent champions of everyday hero essential workers (many of whom, like delivery drivers, would lose their jobs if these companies get their way). Less than two weeks into New York states lockdown, Schmidt wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal that both set the new tone and made clear that Silicon Valley had every intention of leveraging the crisis for a permanent transformation.</p><p>Like other Americans, technologists are trying to do their part to support the front-line pandemic response</p><p>But every American should be asking where we want the nation to be when the Covid-19 pandemic is over. How could the emerging technologies being deployed in the current crisis propel us into a better future? Companies like Amazon know how to supply and distribute efficiently. They will need to provide services and advice to government officials who lack the computing systems and expertise.</p><p>We should also accelerate the trend toward remote learning, which is being tested today as never before. Online, there is no requirement of proximity, which allows students to get instruction from the best teachers, no matter what school district they reside in</p><p>The need for fast, large-scale experimentation will also accelerate the biotech revolution Finally, the country is long overdue for a real digital infrastructure If we are to build a future economy and education system based on tele-everything, we need a fully connected population and ultrafast infrastructure. The government must make a massive investment perhaps as part of a stimulus package to convert the nations digital infrastructure to cloud-based platforms and link them with a 5G network.</p><p>Indeed, Schmidt has been relentless in pursuing this vision. Two weeks after that article appeared, he described the ad-hoc home schooling programming that teachers and families across the country had been forced to cobble together during this public health emergency as a massive experiment in remote learning.</p><p>The goal of this experiment, he said, was trying to find out: how do kids learn remotely? And with that data we should be able to build better remote and distance learning tools which, when combined with the teacher will help kids learn better. During this same video call, hosted by the Economic Club of New York, Schmidt also called for more telehealth, more 5G, more digital commerce and the rest of the preexisting wish list. All in the name of fighting the virus.</p><p>His most telling comment, however, was this: The benefit of these corporations, which we love to malign, in terms of the ability to communicate, the ability to deal with health, the ability to get information, is profound. Think about what your life would be like in America without Amazon. He added that people should be a little bit grateful that these companies got the capital, did the investment, built the tools that were using now, and have really helped us out.</p><p>S chmidts words are a reminder that until very recently, public pushback against these companies was surging. Presidential candidates were openly discussing breaking up big tech. Amazon was forced to pull its plans for a New York headquarters because of fierce local opposition. Googles Sidewalk Labs project was in perennial crisis , and Google workers were refusing to build surveillance tech with military applications.</p><p>In short, democracy inconvenient public engagement in the designing of critical institutions and public spaces was turning out to be the single greatest obstacle to the vision Schmidt was advancing, first from his perch at the top of Google and Alphabet, and then as chair of two powerful boards advising US Congress and the Department of Defense. As the NSCAI documents reveal, this inconvenient exercise of power by members of the public and by tech workers inside these mega-firms has, from the perspective of men such as Schmidt and the Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, maddeningly slowed down the AI arms race, keeping fleets of potentially deadly driverless cars and trucks off the roads, protecting private health records from becoming a weapon used by employers against workers, preventing urban spaces from being blanketing with facial recognition software, and much more.</p><p>Now, in the midst of the carnage of this ongoing pandemic, and the fear and uncertainty about the future it has brought, these companies clearly see their moment to sweep out all that democratic engagement. To have the same kind of power as their Chinese competitors, who have the luxury of functioning without being hampered by intrusions of either labour or civil rights.</p><p>All of this is moving very fast. The Australian government has contracted with Amazon to store the data for its controversial coronavirus tracking app. The Canadian government has contracted with Amazon to deliver medical equipment, raising questions about why it bypassed the public postal service. And in just a few short days in early May, Alphabet has spun up a new Sidewalk Labs initiative to remake urban infrastructure with $400m in seed capital. Josh Marcuse, the executive director of the Defense Innovation Board chaired by Schmidt, announced that he was leaving that job to work full-time at Google as head of strategy and innovation for global public sector, meaning that he will be helping Google to cash in on some of the many opportunities he and Schmidt have been busily creating with their lobbying.</p><p>T o be clear, technology is most certainly a key part of how we must protect public health in the coming months and years. The question is: will that technology be subject to the disciplines of democracy and public oversight, or will it be rolled out in state-of-exception frenzy, without asking critical questions that will shape our lives for decades to come? Questions such as these, for instance: if we are indeed seeing how critical digital connectivity is in times of crisis, should these networks, and our data, really be in the hands of private players such as Google, Amazon and Apple? If public funds are paying for so much of it, should the public also own and control it? If the internet is essential for so much in our lives, as it clearly is, should it be treated as a nonprofit public utility?</p><p>And while there is no doubt that the ability to teleconference has been a lifeline in this period of lockdown, there are serious debates to be had about whether our more lasting protections are distinctly more human. Take education. Schmidt is right that overcrowded classrooms present a health risk, at least until we have a vaccine. So how about hiring double the number of teachers and cutting class size in half? How about making sure that every school has a nurse?</p><p>That would create much-needed jobs in a depression-level unemployment crisis, and give everyone in the learning environment more elbow room. If buildings are too crowded, how about dividing the day into shifts, and having more outdoor education, drawing on the plentiful research that shows that time in nature enhances childrens capacity to learn?</p><p>Introducing those kinds of changes would be hard, to be sure. But they are not nearly as risky as giving up on the tried-and-true technology of trained humans teaching younger humans face-to-face, in groups where they learn to socialise with one another to boot.</p><p>'If one of us gets sick, we all get sick': the food workers on the coronavirus front line</p><p>Upon learning of New York states new partnership with the Gates Foundation, Andy Pallotta, the president of the New York State United Teachers union, was quick to react : If we want to reimagine education, lets start with addressing the need for social workers, mental health counsellors, school nurses, enriching arts courses, advanced courses and smaller class sizes in school districts across the state, he said. A coalition of parents groups also pointed out that if they had indeed been living an experiment in remote learning (as Schmidt put it), then the results were deeply worrying: Since the schools were shut down in mid-March, our understanding of the profound deficiencies of screen-based instruction has only grown.</p><p>I n addition to the obvious class and race biases against children who lack internet access and home computers (problems that tech companies are eager to be paid to solve with massive tech buys), there are big questions about whether remote teaching can serve many kids with disabilities, as required by law . And there is no technological solution to the problem of learning in a home environment that is overcrowded and/or abusive.</p><p>The issue is not whether schools must change in the face of a highly contagious virus for which we have neither cure nor inoculation. Like every institution where humans gather in groups, they will change. The trouble, as always in these moments of collective shock, is the absence of public debate about what those changes should look like, and who they should benefit private tech companies or students?</p><p>The same questions need to be asked about health. Avoiding doctors offices and hospitals during a pandemic makes good sense. But telehealth misses a huge amount. So we need to have an evidence-based debate about the pros and cons of spending scarce public resources on telehealth rather than on more trained nurses, equipped with all the necessary protective equipment, who are able to make house calls to diagnose and treat patients in their homes. And, perhaps most urgently, we need to get the balance right between virus tracking apps, which, with the proper privacy protections, have a role to play, and the calls for a community health corps that would put millions of Americans to work, not only doing contact-tracing, but making sure that everyone has the material resources and support they need to quarantine safely.</p><p>In each case, we face real and hard choices between investing in humans and investing in technology. Because the brutal truth is that, as it stands, we are very unlikely to do both. The refusal to transfer anything like the needed resources to states and cities in successive federal bailouts means that the coronavirus health crisis is now slamming headlong into a manufactured austerity crisis. Public schools, universities, hospitals and transit are facing existential questions about their futures. If tech companies win their ferocious lobbying campaign for remote learning, telehealth, 5G and driverless vehicles their Screen New Deal there simply wont be any money left over for urgent public priorities, never mind the Green New Deal that our planet urgently needs. On the contrary: the price tag for all the shiny gadgets will be mass teacher layoffs and hospital closures.</p><p>Tech provides us with powerful tools, but not every solution is technological. And the trouble with outsourcing key decisions about how to reimagine our states and cities to men such as Bill Gates and Schmidt is that they have spent their lives demonstrating the belief that there is no problem that technology cannot fix.</p><p>For them, and many others in Silicon Valley, the pandemic is a golden opportunity to receive not just the gratitude, but the deference and power that they feel has been unjustly denied. And Andrew Cuomo, by putting the former Google chair in charge of the body that will shape the states reopening, appears to have just given him something close to free rein.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECONNW-en130520</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECONNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YWX-3M31-F0R9-T1F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4081\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 RIA OREANDA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economic News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 13, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>BILL &amp;

The New Deal fundamentally shifted power from the states, businesses and private citizens to an arrogant federal bureaucracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The mainstream media  embracing an Adam Schiffian approach to facts  reported the Democratic primaries are a seminal contest between moderates Michael Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden, who would reform free markets and socialists like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who would rip out capitalism and burn its roots by nationalizing whole industries and breaking up big tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That is an even more insidious lie than the notion that Donald Trump is an illegitimate president, who should be removed even it means throwing out the U.S. Constitution. It is terribly disturbing that the preponderance of a profession that depends on free speech for its survival champions the idea that elections should be rigged to ensure \u201cprogressives\u201d win.</p><p> In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Obama White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel argues the problem with Sen. Sanders is not his goals but how quickly he wants to accomplish them.</p><p> Apparently, reformists can succeed in destroying free markets and our constitutional rights if they don\u2019t nominate someone so transparently radical that he frightens moderate voters. Instead, gradually hypnotize the electorate with false promises and manufactured crises and incrementally compel it to embrace socialism rechristened as progressivism.</p><p> The Affordable Care Act was supposed to make health care less expensive when in fact it hasn\u2019t. The monopolization of markets for hospital services, prescription drugs and physicians and heavy government subsidies are rapidly making the system too unaffordable to sustain. Now House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants absolute price controls, but Mr. Sanders wants to nationalize in Castro-like fashion health insurers and give us doctors\u2019 offices as moribund and swift as the U.S. Postal Service.</p><p> With the Green New Deal, Democrats would shut down oil companies and nationalize electric utilities and in Chinese fashion, state-manage the entire automobile and transportation sectors. And likely require the vetting of corporate and education officials by an informal consensus for politically correct thinking.</p><p> To get any traction in the Democratic Party these days, politicians must adhere to four tenets. Capitalism and free markets, not failed government regulation and spending, are responsible for all slow growth and inequality. America was founded and remains controlled by a cynical monopoly of exploitive white males. The climate change crisis is a convenient vehicle to accomplish the revolution.</p><p> Pundits, professors, politicians and corporate executives who do not adhere to every dot of this theocracy are populists  code for racist, sexist, anti-Semitic and generally invidious  and should be blacklisted, banished and if suitably dangerous, incarcerated.</p><p> The cancel culture at media outlets like NPR and universities are invidious examples of this new, soft fascism.</p><p> Unfortunately, centrists of neither party  in Europe  have not governed well. Despite breathtaking technological change, economic growth has been halting and families feel stressed as the cost of health care, university education and resulting student debt service and housing have risen much more rapidly than incomes.</p><p> That\u2019s what makes Sens. Sanders and Warren possible. Despite the lousy job public education and universities do these days, Americans apparently remember that socialism was a flop in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. But now they could be persuaded by Democrats that a little bit more government  like another shot of heroin  will solve kitchen table budget problems when President Obama proved that doesn\u2019t.</p><p> They all have plans to dramatically raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for free health care, universal basic incomes and college and to forgive student loans  but as conditions in Europe prove, it\u2019s the middle class that will pay.</p><p> It\u2019s narcissistic for billionaire Bloomberg to believe he can ride the Donkey Party Express to the Oval Office  or maybe just cynical because with enough money he can so monopolize the airways and pay enough Twitter trolls to win.\u00a0</p><p> The controversies Mr. Trump\u2019s ruminations create to keep his blue-collar base energized distracts the middle class from an essential reality  things may not be great, but they are getting better than during the Obama years.</p><p> Real household income now surpasses pre-recession levels, women and minorities have more opportunities and he is not trying to pack the U.S. Supreme Court and villainize the founding minority, white males, like demagogues and fascists are prone. Or throw out the results of legitimate elections as Mr. Schiff and his fellow Democrats would be happy to do.</p><p> \u2022 Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-1797876ECD669A60</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBH-28W1-DXVP-V1VC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>3 March 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

The culmination of factors has helped propel the tech-heavy Index near its all-time highs, but it has slightly lagged the S &amp; P 500. The relative underperformance of the Nasdaq expands upon the theme I highlighted earlier this weekwith momentum stocks lagging their value counterparts. </p><p>Source: BloombergTo be sure, the Nasdaq-tracking QQQ ETF registered net inflows for the week alongside SPY. Compared to their relative assets under management (AUM) however, QQQ lagged its larger peer. With assets under management of roughly $75 billion, the additional $574 million that QQQ has seen flow into its coffers in September stands at just 0.79% of total AUM. SPY on the other hand, saw an additional $6.6 billion in fresh capital during the same span - roughly 2.42% of the fund's total $273 billion AUM. Source: BloombergTherefore, the relatively modest underperformance in price has also been reflected in the corresponding exchange traded funds. Interestingly, the mega-cap tech companies of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google make up significant portions of both indices, but account for nearly 45% of the QQQ ETF. Thus, it can be argued the leaders that have been responsible for much of the bull market's run are starting to slow. This can be further evidenced by comparing the five stocks to the entire Nasdaq. S &amp; P 500 Price Chart: Daily Time Frame (January - September) S &amp; P 500 overlaid with Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook relative to Nasdaq. Given the relative performance, it begs the question what factors are to blame. Multiple arguments could be made, but a gradual rotation out of the high-flying momentum stocks seems to be the most popular among financial news media at present. Another potential catalyst is theantitrust probe facing Googleand talks of supplementary probes into Amazon, Facebook and Apple. At a minimum, the regulatory scrutiny adds uncertainty to the collection of tech stocks - an undoubtedly bearish theme in the investing world. Whatever the underlying factors may be, the commentary offered atnext week's FOMC meetingwill likely dominate price action in the short and intermediate terms. Consequently, traders should keep a watchful eye on the degree of dovishness out of the Fed and how it aligns with the market's lofty expectations.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, CNN ANCHOR: Good evening.  While the world awaits word of possible military action, the United States presses on building anti terrorism coalitions and rebuilding its economy. Tonight, we'll report to you on the complex ties some of that our allies have with countries that either sponsor or support terrorism. Tonight we'll also look at our dependence on oil from the Middle East, how likely it is that oil supply may be disrupted, and our government's strategy should this occur.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We'll also be joined by Senator Max Baucus, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee.  We'll be talking about economic stimulus plans. And we'll hear from anti terrorism expert Nikos Passas on underground terrorist funding and how to choke it off.</p><p>But first, let's take a look at the latest developments in the war on terrorism.  President Bush today unveiling a $3 billion emergency package today to help people who have lost their jobs as a result of the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. Earlier today, the president pledged $320 million in humanitarian aid for the Afghan people.  Mr. Bush also stressed that America's anger is directed towards the Taliban and not the Afghan people.  We'll have a live report for you from the White House in just a moment.</p><p>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld arrived in Cairo to shore up support for any U.S. military action.  He later travels to Uzbekistan. This morning, he met with officials in Oman.</p><p>Pakistan says evidence gathered by the United States is enough for an indictment against Osama Bin Laden.  Washington's Reagan National Airport today reopened for business, but at a much reduced capacity.  Reagan National was the last commercial airport to reopen since the attacks of September 11.</p><p>A Russian airliner may have been accidentally shot down over the Black Sea today.  The Siberian Airlines jet was carrying 77 people when it disappeared early this morning.  U.S. sources say they have evidence that the jetliner was shot down by a missile during a Ukrainian military exercise.  The Ukraine denies it.  Russian and Israeli officials say they've not ruled out terrorism.  The plane was en route from Tel Aviv to Siberia.</p><p>A 63-year-old Florida man has been diagnosed with anthrax.  But Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson today said it appears to be an isolated case.  The secretary also said the illness is not linked to any threats of biological terrorism.  The FBI along with Florida health officials are working to locate the source of the man's illness.</p><p>President Bush meeting with Mexican President Vicente Fox and the Emir of Qatar today.  The meetings are part of the continuing effort to build international support for the fight against terrorism.  Major Garrett joins us now from the White House with the story -- Major.</p><p>MAJOR GARRETT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Lou.  The White House believes and has said over and over again, you simply cannot have too much diplomacy at a time like this. President looking far and wide to build that international coalition you referred to against terrorism.  This morning inviting Vicente Fox, the Mexican president to the White House for his third visit.</p><p>A bit of a subtext to that visit, Lou.  There has been some criticism in Mexico that Vicente Fox was not amplified enough in expressing his condolences or offering us any military assistance or whatever Mexico could in fact provide the United States in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks.  Vicente Fox has become very concerned about those criticisms.  Bush White House invited him to show that there is absolutely no distance between the two close allies.  The two are very good friends.  That is to say, President Bush and President Fox.  And the trip here to the White House today meant to underscore that close friendship and support from Mexico for the United States.</p><p>Also this afternoon, a meeting has concluded between the president and the Emir of Qatar.  Again, that is also a part of building that coalition in the Middle East, that part of the world so vital to U.S. concerns.  The president, as you mentioned at the top, Lou, announcing $320 million of humanitarian assistance.  That's food, medicine and other supplies to the thousands, potentially millions of Afghan refugees who may be fleeing to neighboring countries.</p><p>And our Jaime McIntyre, our defense correspondent, who is traveling with Donald Rumsfeld, has just reported that a senior Defense Department official has acknowledged that the United States is considering -- considering -- taking preemptive military action against any surface-to-air missile site that may try to stop the airdropping of those humanitarian supplies into Afghanistan.  That's a new, late development there, Lou.</p><p>But clearly the United States wants to use this humanitarian means as a way of sending a signal to the Afghan people that the U.S. quarrel is entirely with the Taliban, not with them.  The president reiterated that point at a stop at the State Department today, where he announced the program.</p><p>DOBBS: So in effect, there, Major, hostilities could begin in support of an aid effort before actually a retaliation against Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban for the September 11th attacks.</p><p>GARRETT: It's important to note, Lou, that a lot of different signals are sent by this administration to a lot of different audiences.  That is the latest signal that in fact the U.S. considering the prospect of taking preemptive military action against any site that may inhibit or try to block efforts to provide this humanitarian assistance.</p><p>DOBBS: OK.  Major Garrett from the White House.  Thank you.</p><p>Before launching any attack on Osama Bin Laden, the United States has been working diligently to line up the support of other nations. But some of those new allies may have ties to countries that either sponsor or support terrorism.  And some of the allies may still want to do business with those nations. Kitty Pilgrim has the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KITTY PILGRIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Terrorists have been trained, nurtured and harbored in many countries around the world.  Each year the U.S. State Department issues a list of states which sponsor terrorism, currently listing Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria: states which the U.S. has refused to deal with on any level, diplomatic or commercial.  Yet these standards are not upheld by other countries, including U.S. allies.</p><p>ELIE KRAKOWSKI, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COUNCIL: In general terms, the United States has taken a more principled stand with regard to the sponsors of terrorism than have many of the European states that have persisted in dealing with them in a business-as-usual sense.</p><p>PILGRIM: Iran, by most accounts, has exported more terrorists and terrorist acts than any other nation.  Iraq still under U.N. sanctions for its role in the Gulf War.  Yet other nations are clamoring to trade with Iraq and Libya.  Yet all are viewed as potential sources of oil.</p><p>JIM PHILLIPS, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: The lure of Iraqi oil is very strong for Russia, which wants to get a foothold in the lucrative oil market.  Also for France, which wants to get its foot in.</p><p>PILGRIM: Cuba is an open trading partner with many countries in Europe, even though the U.S. embargo is still in place, a major point of friction in U.S. trade relations with Europe.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PILGRIM: The countries where terrorists operate can be just about any industrialized nation.  Simply targeting terrorist's states makes sense.  It's clear as the coalition-building continues, vigilance must be tightened.  Its not that simple when it comes to international politics --Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Kitty, thank you.  Thank you very much.  The distinct possibility of war in the Middle East raises some important questions. Questions such as, how much does the United States rely on oil from the Middle East?  And how prepared is the United States should that supply be disrupted?  In event of a supply disruption, Washington would in point of fact have to appeal to U.S. allies such as Mexico and Canada for some help.  Peter Viles has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The Big Hill oil storage facility in eastern Texas: 160 million barrels of oil stored below ground, part of the nation's strategic petroleum reserve .  But with U.S. military strikes expected soon, Congressman Joe Barton wants the government to stockpile even more oil.</p><p>CONGRESSMAN JOE BARTON: As we sit here today, if there were a complete disruption, we would only have about 53 days worth of oil in the strategic petroleum reserve.</p><p>VILES: Complete disruption is unlikely.  The United States imports 54 percent of the crude it uses, and gets much of that from friendly western nations.  Canada, Venezuela and Mexico supply a combined 24 percent of U.S. needs.  But Persian Gulf nations are key suppliers.  Saudi Arabia 8.9 percent of U.S. consumption.  Iraq, 3.2 percent, and Kuwait, 1.4 percent.</p><p>Any disruption in those supplies would likely send oil prices skyrocketing.  The government's main buffer against supply disruption is the strategic reserve, stored underground in four huge man-made salt mines near the Gulf coast.</p><p>The Clinton administration, in a controversial to drive down retail prices last year, authorized swapping out up 30 million barrels.  That leaves the reserve with 544 million barrels in storage. Barton wants to fill it to its capacity, 700 million barrels, and expand that capacity to one billion barrels.</p><p>FADEL GHEIT, OIL ANALYST, FAHNESTOCK: Raising the level of the strategic petroleum reserve is a very wise thing to do. Unfortunately, in the last eight years the government has neglected doing so, even though crude oil prices in 1998 hit very low levels, and that would have been a golden opportunity for the government.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES: In the event of a supply disruption, Washington can and likely would appeal to oil-producing allies such as Mexico and Canada. We understand there are informal diplomatic arrangements to do that already. But the global oil market is a free market and a very volatile one, and there is no clear protection against skyrocketing prices -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: And what effectively you're saying is no certain protection of those oil supply routes.</p><p>VILES: Correct.  But 544 million barrels is a long time.  If you take Saudi Arabia, for example, at a million or two million barrels a day out of picture, the United States could clearly cover that for some time.  The problem is prices would rise dramatically.</p><p>DOBBS: As you point out, prices would rise.  That's what we saw after some decline for some time in oil prices today.  Oil stocks, oil prices themselves rising.  And the cost, frankly, of stimulus packages also rising today.  Peter, thank you.</p><p>The president wants a package that could cost as much as $75 billion. Tim O'Brien now takes a look at some of the proposals on how to spend that money.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TIM O'BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: While lawmakers still have a long way to go to complete their stimulus package, leaders of the House and Senate budget committees today announced bipartisanship agreement on both size, around $60 billion, and timing.</p><p>SENATOR KENT CONRAD, BUDGET CHAIRMAN: Congress should assemble an economic stimulus package aiming for passage within three to four weeks.  Rapid impact.  A substantial portion of the fiscal impact on the economy should be felt within six months.</p><p>O'BRIEN: And they agreed should be broad-based rather than industry specific.  So far, there seems to be little progress over what percentage of the package should involve new spending or new tax cuts, or what specifically should be in the package.</p><p>SENATOR TRENT LOTT, MINORITY LEADER: People are lining up all the way down the Mall, saying, \"Do this and do that.  Help me do that or the other.\"</p><p>O'BRIEN: Democrats want immediate help, unemployment compensation and health care for those hardest hit by the terrorism, particularly in the aviation industry.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle see a crack in the spirit of bipartisanship.</p><p>SENATOR TOM DASCHLE, MAJORITY LEADER: I'm disappointed, obviously, that our Republican colleagues have chosen what has been clearly an obstructionist approach, here.  That's their choice.</p><p>O'BRIEN: Daschle, however, praised President Bush who acted on his own to help displaced workers and who has been receptive to many Democratic proposals.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>O'BRIEN: Whatever stimulus package lawmakers settle on, it is all but certain to wipe out the surplus and return the government to deficit spending.  But there is a concerted effort to make the stimulus short term.  As Senator Lott put it today, \"We shall not loose the dogs of deficit spending. Responsible and limited government is not over.\" -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: So long as they have their way.  Tim, thanks.  Tim O'Brien in Washington.</p><p>One senator who is of course playing a key role in deciding the shape and the scale of any economic stimulus package is Senator Max Baucus.  Mr.  Baucus has been in closed-door meetings this week with ranking finance members and Congressional leadership.  He serves as the chairman of the Senate finance committee. Joining us now from the gallery.  Good to have you with us, Senator.</p><p>SENATOR MAX BAUCUS: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: The size of the package.  The has made it pretty clear that he is looking to the Democratic leadership in the Senate in particular for some guidance, some direction here.  What is your best judgment about the size of this package?</p><p>BAUCUS: I just met just recently -- a few minutes ago, actually --with Secretary O'Niell and with the top tax writers for both the House and the Senate, those committees.</p><p>There is general agreement that probably a stimulus in the nature of 60, 65 billion dollars in addition to what's already been appropriated makes the most sense.  I think there's a general feeling about that.</p><p>DOBBS: We've just heard Senator Lott talk about the fact that everybody is lining up with their hands out, if you will.  In some cases, perhaps a more elegant expression is appropriate for those more appropriately needful of that money.  But the fact is, you have a number of constituencies who are going to be appealing for part of the money. Which constituencies, if you will, are first priority?</p><p>BAUCUS: There's a strong feeling among those of us putting this together that this stimulus should be immediate.  It should be temporary. It should hit the bulls-eye.  It should not include peripheral, extraneous matters.  It should not include pork.  We can have a better result if we stick to what we're charged with doing, and I think we will inspire a little bit of American confidence if we don't add a lot of pork on.  I think that that trend will continue, at least that's my hope, that we get the job done but not add these extra additionals that just aren't necessary.</p><p>DOBBS: We just heard the leader be rather critical of Republicans. Do you feel the same way in the discussions that are going on right now?</p><p>BAUCUS: I'm very heartened with the very strong bipartisan spirit in our meetings.  I give great credit to president.  The president has resisted many partisan entreaties by some members from his party.  He has basically decided we're going do what's right, here.  This is a crisis and we're going to work with the Congress, Republicans and Democrats both.  That is very much the spirit of our meetings.  I don't share in ant criticism at all.  I'm frankly heartened by just how well we're working together.</p><p>DOBBS: How soon do you believe in that spirit of bipartisanship and urgency you will have a bill through for the president's signature?</p><p>BAUCUS: I think it will take a couple, three weeks.  In that neighborhood.  That's what we're shooting for.  I think that's our best guess.  The main point I want to make is, I've never seen a spirit like this before since the years I've been in Congress.</p><p>At one meeting there was Mr. Rangel, myself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Grassley with Secretary O'Neill.  It's the first time in memory that all four of us have met together in a good, kind of solid way.  I must add, too, that the budget committees got together and agreed on a single set of numbers.  That's never happened before. There's a lot that's good, here.  And we're all doing -- most of us -- what we can to maintain that spirit.</p><p>DOBBS: You have met, Senator, with Alan Greenspan, former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin in closed-door meetings, and of course with Secretary O'Neill.  How important have those meetings been to deciding the scale and the scope of the stimulus package?</p><p>BAUCUS: Those meetings are tremendously important.  We pay a lot of attention to Chairman Greenspan and Robert Rubin, as well, clearly, with Secretary O'Neill.  When they speak, we listen.  In many of these closed- door sessions many senators refer to one or the other.  Says, \"As Chairman Greenspan says,\" or \"As Bob Rubin says.\" They are very helpful.</p><p>DOBBS: Terrific.  Senator Max Baucus, thanks for being with us.'</p><p>BAUCUS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Still ahead on MONEYLINE, the terrorist attacks on the United States curtailed the travel plans of many Americans and many people around the world.  That has devastated many of the cities that rely on tourism.  We'll tell you about efforts now to revive that industry.  And with more people staying home, we'll tell you which industries are benefiting.  Yes, benefiting.  Then, of course, tracking terrorist money around the globe.  Later on MONEYLINE we'll be talking with a money laundering expert who has some definite plans about how to shut down the underground money pipeline.  All of that still ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: We'll have the latest developments for you in America's new war in just minutes.  First let's check in with Christine Romans over at the New York Stock Exchange, where the Dow Jones Industrials today fell 62 points -- Christine.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lou, it was a choppy day highlighted by late-session selling, as you can see by the charts. Folks were not very encouraged by that isolated incident of anthrax in Florida.  And there was a downbeat note to clients from Warren Buffett.  It was dated September 26.  It said, I'm sure we're in a recession, probably a deep and extended one, but they are part of business life and we are prepared.</p><p>The Dow down about just under one percent.  More warnings as well.  Corning, Marriott, Global Crossing, all moving here lower at least a dollar on warnings there.  We are out of that situation where stocks are actually moving higher on warnings.</p><p>Among the Dow losers, Alcoa.  AA.  It earned 39 cents in the third quarter, but investors were worried about business conditions for Q4.  GM, Home Depot, Proctor and Gamble also lower here.  And after the bell, yet another big tech company warning about its profits.  Take a look at this.  Down 90 percent over the past 52 weeks.  Going to lose 14 to 17 cents on the quarter as demand slumps in the wake of that September 11th attack.  Lou, $10,000 worth of Gateway shares purchased a year ago are worth just over $1,000 at the closing bell today.</p><p>DOBBS: All right, Christine. Thank you.</p><p>While Gateway is warning, Dell Computer reaffirming its targets and pushing the Nasdaq higher.  Greg Clarkin at the Nasdaq Market Site with the store -- Greg.</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, NASDAQ MARKET SITE: Lou, the Nasdaq faring a little better than Dow.  It was up about 16 points or so.  If you take a look at the chart for the day it had a real nice pop in the morning. It was up about 61 points.  And they sold off in the afternoon with the broader markets.  Dell really was the catalyst.  It becomes the second tech heavy weight in as many days to come out and reaffirm guidance for the present quarter, saying it will, indeed, meet its financial targets.</p><p>Dell really leading the way for the tech stocks.  It was up $1.68. That's good for a better than eight percent jump.  Other hardware stocks gained as well.  Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer also posting gains.  Software: Oracle and Microsoft up a small amount.  And the we have Brocade, the storage stock, getting a nice day on the upgrade out of Dain Rauscher Wessels.  So at this point, Lou, the Nasdaq has risen three days in a row.  It is up 15 percent off the recent session, lows that were hit two weeks ago or so but could not get over 1,600 today at the close, finishes a couple points shy of that.</p><p>DOBBS: Leaving something to be done tomorrow.  All right, Greg. Greg Clarkin.  That good news from Dell Computer taking many investors by surprise. Some analysts had expected the company to lower guidance.  Bruce Francis now with the story -- Bruce.</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That billion dollar shortfall from Compaq sure set the stage for some bad news.  We didn't get it, though, today from Dell.  Dell says that while U.S. corporate demand is weak, international and consumer sales stayed on track.  So the company is sticking with guidance delivered late in August.</p><p>Dell says that the quarter was actually running ahead of plan before the attacks on September 11th.  Then a sharp drop-off was followed by what the company calls a surprisingly fast pickup in demand.  The company won't forecast beyond the end of the current quarter, but Vice Chairman and President Kevin Rollins says that the release of Windows XP in late October could help a bit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN ROLLINS, VICE CHAIRMAN AND PRESIDENT, COMPAQ: We do think there is going to be an uptick on demand due to consumer acceptance of both XP combined with Pentium 4.  So we're fairly positive about the benefits.  I think we're in a more subdued market in general, but I think there is going to be a uptick due to those two products coming together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS: But Dell gets no more than 10 percent of its sales from U.S. consumers, and the company noted in its call that while corporate demand will pick up, it probably won't be until the first quarter of 2002 that that begins to take off.  So analysts like Dan Niles are bracing for more bad news in next quarter from Dell.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN NILES, LEHMAN BROTHERS: I think that's what's people are missing here, is that they said that big IT managers were postponing big-ticket purchases until early next year.  If you think about that, there's still a fair amount of time left to go.  Also, that's the reason why they didn't give guidance for the fourth quarter, because things are still so far up in the air.  I think that's what you need to do to try to put this into context.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS: And we'll get the details and the outlook from (UNINTELLIGIBLE) on November 15th.  Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: November 15. 10 percent of sales are U.S.?</p><p>FRANCIS: 10 percent of their overall sales. Less than 10 percent come from U.S. consumers.</p><p>DOBBS: OK.  Just wanted to make sure I understood that one correctly.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's my job.</p><p>DOBBS: Bruce, thanks a lot for doing your job.  Bruce Francis. Still ahead here on MONEYLINE, in the wake of the September 11th attacks, more of us are staying home.  It's called the \"cocoon effect,\" and it is having a very big impact on the economy.  We'll tell you which companies stand to benefit from it.  And as people drop their travel plans, many areas that rely on tourism are suffering. We'll tell you what people are doing trying to put folks back on the road and in the air.  And tonight, tracking the terrorist money trail. We'll have an inside look at some of the challenges investigators face.  We'll be joined by money laundering expert Nikos Passas. That's ahead on MONEYLINE.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: The terrorist attacks on the United States have left some Americans choosing to spend their free time at home instead of going out to restaurants or movies.  The result, to a degree, is called the \"cocooning effect.\" Allan Chernoff reports on the effect it is having on business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT: On the afternoon of September 11th, Blockbuster Video saw a surge in business across the nation. Since the deadly attacks, some Americans have been avoiding public places, staying home instead, sometimes simply watching movies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just really watching more television and actually renting videos, which I've never had a habit of in the past.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Since this has happened, I'm worried about what's happening.  I'm just very dubious and I wouldn't go out on my own.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Companies that cater to at-home activities stand to benefit if the cocooning of America becomes a lasting trend.  Already, the number two video chain, Hollywood Entertainment, is telling Wall Street this year's profits should be better than previously forecast. And stocks of video rental companies have become overnight stars.</p><p>Blockbuster is up 31 percent since the attacks.  Hollywood Entertainment up 64 percent and the number three chain, Movie Gallery, is up 49 percent.'</p><p>Pizza parlors have also been seeing a pickup in demand.</p><p>DAVE MELTON, DOMINO'S PIZZA: People in an event like this spend more time at home watching television and may be reluctant to leave home.  And Domino's pizza is able to fit their needs by delivering a meal to their home.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Domino's is privately owned, but publicly-traded Papa John's International has seen its stock rise 11 percent since September 11th.  The company says sales in recent days have begun returning to normal levels.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>The cocooning effect may be short-lived.  Here in New York City, Broadway theater attendance has been bouncing back every week since the attacks, although it remains about 10 percent below year-ago levels.  Success in the war on terrorism is likely to determine how long the cocooning of America will last.</p><p>DOBBS: Allan, thank you.  Allan Chernoff.  As more people do stay home, cities like Las Vegas are ramping up ad campaigns trying to boost tourism.  Casey Wian has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This previously unreleased Frank Sinatra song is part of a new Las Vegas ad campaign, telling potential visitors it's OK to have fun again.  After September 11th, Las Vegas resorts were stuck with tens of thousands of empty rooms.  Many laid off thousands of workers, and the already-troubled Aladdin filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>JASON ADER, BEAR STEARNS: It's very hard for a company to adjust immediately to such a huge decline in demand.  I think they're doing the best they can, but it's been a painful process for the employees of Las Vegas.</p><p>WIAN: To ease the pain, Vegas resorts are slashing prices. National Airlines, partly owned by Las Vegas hotels, now offers round- trip airfare as low as $50 from the West Coast, to $190 from the east -- plus a free night in one of 15 top hotels.  While National says the fares barely cover fuel costs, its planes are now more than 90 percent full.</p><p>MICHAEL CONWAY, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NATIONAL AIRLINES: Americans are just looking for any kind of an incentive to get back to the business that is America.  And people are willing to fly, and I think we've demonstrated that.</p><p>WIAN: Las Vegas and Orlando both avoided being put on credit watch by Standard and Poors this week.  Orlando got a boost from the president.</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Go down to Disney World in Florida.</p><p>WIAN: But S&amp;P did place Hawaii, the Washington, D.C. Convention Center and Anaheim, California on its list of potential debt downgrades.  Disney's new California Adventure in Anaheim was struggling even before the terrorist attacks.  Since it's lost two high profile restaurants. But Disney says overall theme park attendance is bad to near normal.</p><p>(on camera): While the tourism industry has had some success in bringing back visitors, there's still a long way to go.  A study this week by Ernst &amp; Young, for example, found that occupancy rates at California hotels have dropped to a 10-year low.</p><p>Casey Wian, CNN Financial News, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: And coming up next, who funds terrorists and how will we shut off their money supply?  We'll be talking with anti-terrorist expert Nikos Passas. And as the United States prepares for war, what effect will that of on the economy and the markets?  We will find out the answers to those questions next.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Next, Lou speaks with Chris Wolf, equity market strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: We'll bring you the latest developments in America's war in just a moment.  But first, a look at what happened on Wall Street today.  A mid morning rally, pressure from consumer products and financial issues initially pressuring news from -- reassuring news, that news that is from Dell sent stock prices, but not enough to keep the blue chips higher at the close.</p><p>On the New York Exchange, 68 new 52-week highs, 48 new lows.  On the Nasdaq, 47 new 52-week highs, while 80 new lows.</p><p>A volatile session for the Dow, down 63 points.  Advancing issues beating decliners by a 3 to 2 margin however.  Among the most actives, Global Crossing down nearly 50 percent.  That after the company announced a new chief executive officer, its sixth in less than four years.  Shares of EMC gaining 5 percent today.  EMC trading more than 85 percent from its 52-week-high.</p><p>Tyco shares jumping $5.00 today.  Tyco offering to buy the minority stake of Tyco it doesn't own.</p><p>The Nasdaq up 1 percent on the day, closing just below 1,600. Advancers beating declining issues by a 7 to 5 margin.  Among the most active issues, Cisco Systems up for the second day in a row, up nearly 50 cents today.  The networking company climbing 20 percent yesterday.</p><p>And one day after Cisco's positive comments, Dell Computer releasing its own, as we reported to you.  Dell today up 8 percent. Siebel Systems up $1.20 a share.  Siebel trading 85 percent below its 52-week high.</p><p>Well, not surprisingly, the day's leading sector, computer networking.  That group up 20 percent over the past week.  Also higher today, chip equipment makers, oil service stocks. On the down side today, automakers.  GM, in fact, the biggest loser.  Airline losses led by Continental.  And Wal-Mart, leaving the retail sector lower.</p><p>The Dow reversing course late in the session.</p><p>Christine Romans joins us from the New York Stock Exchange -- Christine.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Lou.  Well, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still up about 1,000 points from the trough it hit back on September 21.  And a lot of traders were saying that this market had become a little bit overbought. That's a word that they use that means the market had come too far, too fast and needed to blow off some steam.</p><p>They point out, there were a lot of bargains out there, and that some of these stocks had come pretty far.  Look at Home Depot.  Since its close on 9/21, it's up 23 percent.  GE, up 21 percent.  AT&amp;T, up more than 20 percent.</p><p>We've also go bargains in Citigroup, Wal-mart, Microsoft.  Good gains there if you were an investor who bought during that very rough week of 9/17 here on Wall Street.  Now the question is, was that just a trading balance?  Could it be over?  Or is this all part of building a base?  Traders keep telling me, the interest still comes in these stocks that are big liquid household names, that investors know and trust.  And they're taking very long-term views here.</p><p>But for the short-term, you can see, some of those stocks have done very well -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: OK, Christine, thank you.</p><p>Well, a surge in shares of Dell Computer, as we said, boosting the Nasdaq today.</p><p>Greg Clarkin, Greg, what does it look like?</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, I tell you, Lou, at this point, traders point out that the psychology of the marketplace still extremely fragile.  They say it does improve a little bit every day, at this point at least, but still can be easily derailed as we saw today's trading.</p><p>Well, a couple groups that really stood out today, we saw chips stocks, hardware, software, Internets, all posting substantial gains, as well the networking stocks you see there on your screen. Yesterday, Cisco saying it was on track to meet its financial targets, gave that whole group a boost.</p><p>Today, they continued with that rally.  So as Christine was saying with those big name stocks over on the NYSE, you see the same effect here on the Nasdaq.  Some of these big technology shares that have just been hammered attract a lot of folks when they get down to certain levels.</p><p>Cisco's been that like that.  We've seen Intel bounced nicely recently.  And then, of course, Dell today.  Now what traders want to know, again, as some of those bounces, are they nothing more than trading rallies?  Or is this something that can be a little more substantial than that and get carried on for the next couple days?</p><p>Gateway's preannouncement today, short impact to technology trading at least tomorrow.  But at the moment, we're looking at the Nasdaq right now is just a couple points shy of 1,600.  And it's up 15 percent from those session lows just about two weeks ago or so, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Greg, thank you very much.  Greg Clarkin from the Nasdaq marketsite.</p><p>Well, now for the latest developments on America's war against terrorism.  President Bush today pledging $320 million to help Afghan refugees.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld moving on to Cairo in his four nation to solidify support for U.S. military action against the Taliban.</p><p>The attack on the World Trade Center will cost New York City $105 billion over the next two years, that according to the city's first official estimates.  The FBI releasing new photographs of two of the hijackers taken from security cameras in Portland, Maine.</p><p>And a lethal hemmorhagic virus is reportedly affecting people along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.  According to the U.K.'s \"Daily Telegraph\" newspaper, the virus is similar to Ebola virus.  Ebola highly contagious virus.  It causes patients to bleed to death.  \"The Telegraph\" reporting at least 75 people have caught that disease.  8 have died so far.</p><p>The World Health Organization in Geneva tells us tonight that it has not been contacted about any outbreak in the region.</p><p>Well, the markets have put in a solid performance now for more than a week now, but Chris Wolfe tells me this pause is one before an earnings storm.  Chris, equity markets strategist with J.P. Morgan. Good to have you with us, Chris.</p><p>CHRIS WOLFE, J.P. MORGAN: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: What do you mean, pause before a storm?  That sounds ominous?</p><p>WOLFE: Oh, it does.  And not to be too foreboding here, I think a few things are going on.  We really look at the market in one clear message. You think about where we were before the attack, where are today.</p><p>We're in the same place.  You know, we trouble fathoming that. You know, did risk go down in this environment?  Did corporate earnings improve so much?</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>WOLFE: Is profitability going to be that much stronger next year? That kind of rhetoric kind of feeds our thought process about how do things look next year.  It was interesting to hear we take a long-term view.</p><p>You know, GE up from $30 to $39 is a bit disconcerting, when next year revenues may be at risk, let alone earnings.</p><p>DOBBS: I'm trying evaluate whether it's more disconcerting to think about a $30 to $39 or from the $40s down to $30.</p><p>WOLFE: Yeah, that's one way too look at it.  I would say the storm that's coming.  And we've talked about this.  There's been many analogies, the perfect storm.  The waves that will hit you are really in the form of the earnings announcements, etcetera for companies in the next two, three weeks.</p><p>DOBBS: Greg Clarkin, as he's reporting from the Nasdaq, making reference to these prices being so low that people can simply not resist them. On a price basis, a price versus the price they remember from months ago. That's a dangerous trap for investors, is it not?</p><p>WOLFE: I would definitely agree with that.  You know, our viewpoint is really one based on you know, discounted cash flows and kind of earnings multiples here, and how do they compare versus industries and in the absolute.</p><p>And I think our viewpoints are that we'll see corporate profit margins still be relatively weak into next year and that cash flows be weak.  So there are some bargains out there, but the wholesale move here is really, we think, well, some of the trading viewpoints, it does looks overbought.</p><p>DOBBS: Is it overbought by small investors or institutions?</p><p>WOLFE: We have clearly seen what we think is institutional buying here.  We've heard a few viewpoints.  Number one is institutions being underweight risk assets.  And of course, you've seen what happens.  You've saw very risky stocks, technology, etcetera, moving very aggressively.</p><p>Siebel actually moving from $11 to $19 or so.  And in that vein, we've also seen some hedge funds covering some of their shorts.  So our viewpoint is that there's a lot of things going with a lack of sellers in this environment, trying to catch trading profits.  It looks like it's a short-term effect.</p><p>DOBBS: And a short-term rally.</p><p>WOLFE: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: The -- you have been looking for a recovery in the second quarter -- excuse me, the first quarter of next year.</p><p>WOLFE: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: You said things have changed and that's one of the remarkable things about being at parity with where we were before September 11.  Has your view of when things begin to look better changed?</p><p>WOLFE: I think what will get us more confident about that view plan, I think the risks to our view that a recovery happens in the first quarter are really that it gets pushed out in a second or third.</p><p>What we'll get is more confident is if we start to see stabilization and margins earlier than we expect, meaning by the fourth quarter of this year, helps us along that we want to get more warm towards equities in November and December.  And we see were to show up, high frequency data like retail sales.</p><p>That happens, we'll get comfortable with the story that we see a pretty strong recovery somewhere in the first part of '02.</p><p>DOBBS: Comfortable with it.  What should investor do here, because I suspect anyone listening to you thinks, well, one, this looks like stability and some recovery from September 11 will soon give way to a decline.  Secondly, we won't see a recovery until the first quarter of 2002. I'll just hold my money back and hope for the best in the interim.  Is that a fair assessment?</p><p>WOLFE: It is.  And to that extent, we're providing advise to our clients along those lines.  Protect what have here.  And our clients are very concerned with their wealth levels and want to be available next year, have enough cash, enough power to try to play the game the first part of next year.</p><p>DOBBS: Specifically, what should they do?</p><p>WOLFE: We're looking at high quality companies, earnings visibility, still playing a little bit of defense in this environment, protecting accounts.  We do like stocks.  There's no doubt about it. Companies like Cardinal Healthcare and even some value arguments like Valero Energy.</p><p>DOBBS: OK, Chris Wolfe, thanks for being with us.</p><p>WOLFE: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, just ahead here on MONEYLINE, our next guest is an expert on money laundering expert.  He will tell us what he believes is the way in which to unraveling the complex terrorist money trial. Stay with us.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Next Temple University's professor of criminal justice Nikos Passas.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Now we're focusing on the latest efforts to track down terrorist money, to seize it.</p><p>My next guest believes infiltrating some underground cash networks called hawalas could take years and be counterproductive. Nikos Passas is a professor of criminal justice at Temple University. Good to have you with us, Nikos.</p><p>NIKOS PASSAS, PROFESSOR, TEMLE UNIVERSITY: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: The hawalas.  Much has been made of them recently.  Some $2 to 3 billion apparently exchanged just out of Pakistan alone through the use of hawala.  How large is this underground money apparatus worldwide?</p><p>PASSAS: Well, nobody really knows.  A lot of people may have opinions, but nobody really knows because agencies around the world have not concentrated their attention, have not focused attention on that problem so far.</p><p>They're -- all we have, in other words, is just a few cases that tell us that in some instances, those operate for a few thousand dollars. Others have hundreds of millions of dollars.  So yes, substantial amounts of money go through that.  But bear in mind that most of that money is actually legitimate.</p><p>DOBBS: Very legitimate and also at the same time, illegitimate, almost impossible for the authorities to track.</p><p>PASSAS: Well, unlike what many people believe, there are trails. A lot of people think that there is absolutely no record that people who operate those networks keep for themselves.  In fact they do.</p><p>And another misconception is that there is no contact with legitimate financial or other institutions.  There often is.  We simply do not know.  And before we take action, and before we perhaps bring about effects that we would come to regret, we would have to get the facts right.  That's the first priority right now.</p><p>DOBBS: What is your best judgment?  We call them the hawallas in the case of the Muslim world.  For example, in Pakistan or Afghanistan.</p><p>The Chinese also have these syndicates of trust and money transfer around the world as do other countries.  What should the United States be doing in following and understanding and seizing money where it's identified as supportive of terrorism?</p><p>PASSAS: Well, the first thing to understand is that hawala is one of several types of informal value transfer systems around the world.  There's have -- there is hundi (ph) in Pakistan.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>PASSAS: There is fei chin (ph) elsewhere And it's very, very widespread.  What we need to do is understand how these things work. What you have to understand is that these things originated many, many decades ago, perhaps centuries ago, for very legitimate purposes. They operate in parts of the world where there are no banks.</p><p>DOBBS: I understand that there may be legitimate purpose.  And they do take the place of institutions in some places.  But confronted as we are with what we must now do, and that is understand the money supply inflows that support terrorists, what can we do here?</p><p>PASSAS: The first thing we have to do is not act in haste. First of all, we have to understand something and rather than act insensitively and rush, we have to understand how these things operate.</p><p>This may take some patients.  This make take some time. Attempting to regulate or shut down those things is not going to help us for a number of reasons.</p><p>First of all, if I'm a terrorist, I'm simply going to switch to a different method to move about a few thousand dollars that it takes to mount an operation like the one on September 11.  But more importantly, there are possible negative effects that we can have.</p><p>Families depend on those things.  Legitimate economic activities would be disrupted. Insensitive actions are going to fuel passions against the United States\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>PASSAS: ...or the Western world in parts of the world that we want to rally behind us.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>PASSAS: And therefore, there are possible counterproductive consequences that we have to measure carefully before we do anything.</p><p>DOBBS: Nikos, sound council. And we thank you for being with us.  Nikos, Passas,</p><p>PASSAS: My pleasure.</p><p>DOBBS: Coming up here on MONEYLINE, yet another blow to Bridgestone/Firestone.  We'll be talking about federal regulators who have found fault with more of the company's tires.  We'll have that story for you next here on MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: In tonight's MONEYLINE movers, shares of Corning down 15 percent, warning it will miss third quarter estimates.  Corning also announcing 4,000 job cuts, saying it will post a loss in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Juniper Networks up 10 percent, following a more than $2 run-up yesterday.  Morgan Stanley upgrading the stock, sending shares higher. And shares of Nextel Communications up 25 percent today.  Nextel saying upgrades to its mobile communications network will double capacity.  Nextel currently trading about 80 percent below its 52-week high.</p><p>In other corporate news tonight, another big tire recall for Bridgestone/Firestone.  Federal regulators requesting that recall of 3.5 million Wilderness A.T. tires, after completing an investigation that began in May of last year.</p><p>Barr Laboratories raising its earnings forecast.  The news comes after Eli Lilly warned it will miss quarterly estimates, blaming falling sales of Prozac after its patent on Prozac expired.</p><p>Yet another airline announcing layoff.  KLM Royal Dutch Airlines cutting 2,500 jobs.  KLM also says it's in talks with employees for substantial salaries cuts.  The Dutch airline attributing the hardships to fallout from the September 11 terrorist attacks.</p><p>\"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS\" begins in just a few minutes here on CNN. Let's go to Wolf now in Washington for a preview -- Wolf.</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, HOST, \"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS\": Thank you very much, Lou.  Up next, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld continues his mission to prepare for possible military strikes.  We'll get the latest from our military affairs correspondent, Jamie McIntyre.  And as the manhunt for Osama bin Laden continues, I'll talk live with Mark Bowden, the author of \"Blackhawk Down,\" the story of the disastrous manhunt for a Somali warlord exactly eight years ago today.  What are the lessons learned?  That and the days other developments next -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Looking forward to it, Wolf. Thank you.</p><p>Coming up next here on MONEYLINE, interest rates are down.  The Fed has cut rates in fact by 60 percent?  But what's going on with those credit card rates?  We'll tell you next.  Your e-mails and \"Ahead of the Curve,\" coming right up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Tomorrow, the Labor Department will report the first look at monthly employment since the terrorist attacks. Although government officials say these figures will show only a limited impact from those attacks because of the way they are constructed.</p><p>Economists, nonetheless, are expecting the unemployment rate to climb to 5.0 percent or higher for the month of September.</p><p>Also out tomorrow, we'll have the consumer credit report from the month of August.  Economists expecting a decline for the fourth consecutive month.  And please be sure to join us here on MONEYLINE tomorrow night.  Peter Bart, the editor-in-chief of \"Variety\" joins us, as does Daniel Yergin of Cambridge Energy, one of the world's foremost experts on energy.  And economist Bruce Steinburg of Merrill Lynch will be here, to discuss recovery and of course, economic stimulus plans and markets.  All of that tomorrow night.</p><p>Time now for a look of some of your thoughts.  Regular MONEYLINE viewer, Susan Davis of Talent, Oregon writes in to ask, \"Just who's benefiting from these lower interest rates?  My Visa interest rate hasn't dropped one iota.  Why not?\"</p><p>Gary Dowdy on the very same subject writing, \"Want to spur the economy?  Ask those credit companies to drop their interest rates.\" When it comes to credit rates, by the way we should tell you, what goes up doesn't necessarily come back down apparently.  Credit card interest rates have fallen, but many of you say they haven't been falling nearly enough.</p><p>And here is why.  At the beginning of the year, the average credit card rate has plummeted from 15.5 percent all the way down to 14.3 percent.  That's a drop of only 6 percent, in the same period that the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by 60 percent.</p><p>The prime rate in that period has fallen 40 percent. Well, bankrate.com tells us about some of the best credit card deals in the country.  Take a look at those deals.</p><p>Wachovia Bank Card Services, it offers a Mastercard with a variable rate of just 6 percent.  That's less than half the national average.  Chase Manhattan Bank has a Mastercard with a variable rate of 8.15 percent.</p><p>And you can get a Visa card from Capital One with a fixed rate of 9.5 percent.  Now those are just standard cards.  If you get gold or platinum cards, you will have even better interest rates.</p><p>And by the way, according to the American Bankers Association, on average, credit cards represent 5 percent of a bank's profits.  Of course, some banks make a lot less on them. And some a great deal more.</p><p>Thanks for writing in to tell us what's on your mind. Send us your e-mails at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:moneyline@cnn.com\">moneyline@cnn.com</email>.  </p><p>For this Thursday evening, that is MONEYLINE. We thank you for being with us. I'm Lou Dobbs. Goodnight from New York. \"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS\" begins right now.

Tech correction: News that big tech companies face antitrust scrutiny from US lawmakers and regulators has pushed the Nasdaq into a correction.</p><p>The US House Judiciary Committee said Monday it is launching a \"top-to-bottom\" antitrust investigation of the tech industry, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. </p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are reportedly taking steps to begin their own probes.</p><p>Already under pressure from global trade tensions, the Nasdaq dropped 1.6% on Monday. It's now 11% off highs at the beginning of May.</p><p>Google parent Alphabet closed down more than 6%, while Facebook fell 7.5%. Shares in both companies stabilized in premarket trading on Tuesday.</p><p>Elsewhere, stocks are mixed. US stock futures point slightly higher, with the Dow set to rise 100 points, or 0.4%. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 are set for similar gains.</p><p>In Europe, the FTSE 100 climbed 0.2% in early trading, while Germany's DAX rose 0.9%. Stocks in Asia finished lower, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropping 0.5% and the Shanghai Composite losing almost 1%.</p><p>2. Shell gives back: Shell said Tuesday that it anticipates spending $125 billion on dividends and share buybacks between 2021 and 2025.</p><p>The move suggests management believes the company is well positioned despite recent pressure on oil prices. Brent crude, the global benchmark, dropped more than 11% last month.</p><p>The company reaffirmed its commitment to its conventional oil and gas business, along with its investment in natural gas and chemicals, even as it pursues climate change standards.</p><p>Shell is the only major energy company that has committed to cutting emissions generated by both its activities and the products it sells. It said in December it would link executive pay to the goals.</p><p>The company's shares dropped 0.9% Tuesday.</p><p>3. Trump in the UK: President Donald Trump's trip to London is shifting to business. Trump is meeting with UK Prime Minister Theresa May and business leaders, and a potential US-UK trade deal is on the agenda.</p><p>Trump said Tuesday that a trade agreement between the countries would be \"substantial\" and \"very fair.\" </p><p>\"It's an honor to have worked with you,\" Trump told May, who has already set her departure date. \"Stick around. Let's do this deal.\"</p><p>Don't expect a large market reaction. America and Britain are far from putting pen to paper, and the countries remain far apart on key issues such as agriculture.</p><p>4.

In May, it was U.S.-China trade tension that dealt a blow to the space and now it is the Justice Department's likely launch of an antitrust probe against big tech names that shoved the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to correction territory. The net result is a 10.2% slump in Invesco QQQ Trust(QQQ) in the past month.It all started with the Trump administration raising tariffs on $200-billion worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on May 10 and China announcing a retaliatory move \u2014- a tariff hike on $60-billion worth of American goods to 25% startingJun 1[1]. Not only this, Washington has U.S. firms from doing business with the Chinese giant Huawei, citing national security concerns (read: Top ETF Stories of May[2]).On May 23, the U.S. Commerce Department stated thatit was proposing a new rule[3]to implement anti-subsidy duties on products from countries that undervalue their currencies against the U.S. dollar, another move that could undermine Chinese trade. The Trump administration also intensified trade tensions with Mexico at the end of the month. </p><p>Investorsare worried about[4]the fact that the trade war may last much longer than anticipated.Trade ...ch Tech companies, specifically semiconductors and tech hardware and equipment, are exposed the most to this trade war. This is because the rising tariffs will make the products of tech giants like Apple and other American biggies costlier to manufacture. This, in turn, will likely compel hardware manufacturers to hike prices at home whileduties on finished goods exporting to China[5]could also make products expensive for buyers in that country, per techcrunch.com (read: Tense About Trade War? Follow Goldman With 5 ETF Strategies[6]).Regulatory Fears ...chIf this was not enough, the tech space started June on a weak note with the U.S. government planning to grill a host of big companies in the industry with antitrust and business practice probes. Shares of tech giants like Alphabet GOOGL[7] (down 6.1%), Amazon AMZN[8] (down 4.6%), FacebookFB[9] (down 7.5%) and AppleAAPL[10] (down 1%) were hard hit.ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ[11]) - Up 6.4% on Jun 4The fund looks at daily investment results, before fees and expenses, which correspond to triple the inverse of the daily performance of the NASDAQ-100 Index.The underlying index includes 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies. It reflects companies across major industry groups including computer hardware and software, telecommunications, retail/wholesale trade and biotechnology. The fund charges 95 bps in fees.ProShares UltraShortQQQ (QID[12]) - Up 4.3% on Jun 4The fund looks to attain daily investment results, before fees and expenses, which correspond to twice (200%) the inverse (opposite) of the daily performance of the NASDAQ-100 Index. The expense ratio of the fund is 0.95%.Proshares Short QQQ(PSQ)[13]- Up 2.2% on Jun 4The fund looks to track the inverse of the daily performance of the NASDAQ-100 Index. It charges 95 bps in fees (read: Profit From Trump's Anti-Trade Policies With Inverse ETFs[14]).Word of CautionThe strategy is beneficial for short-term traders as it could lead to huge losses compared with traditional funds in fluctuating markets. Further, their performances could vary significantly from the actual performance of their underlying index over a longer period when compared with the shorter period (such as, weeks or months) due to their compounding effect. Still, for ETF investors who are bearish on Nasdaq for the near term, either of the above products could make an interesting choice (see:all the Inverse Equity ETFs here[15]).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free &gt;&gt;[16]Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Reporting tonight from New York, Stuart Varney.</p><p>VARNEY: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to MONEYLINE. Willow is off tonight.</p><p>Well, to call it a blockbuster verdict would be a colossal understatement.  A jury in Florida has ordered tobacco companies to pay a total of $145 billion in punitive damages, after finding them negligent for marketing a dangerous product.  It is an unprecedented punishment against a corporation -- in this case five corporations, the world's biggest cigarette makers -- and it is certainly a climax in the most important legal challenge the industry has ever faced. But the drama will not be over until the last appeal is exhausted.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank has been following the case for two years now, and he joins us now live from Miami -- Allan. ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The jury took than five hours to hand its verdict to the judge.  And guys, you got to give me the out cue of the judge.  I can't hear anything.</p><p>VARNEY: OK, we have serious technical problems there.  Let me continue.</p><p>Before the news came down today from Florida -- from that Florida courtroom -- tobacco stocks were mixed.  After the news, they turned decidedly lower, though the losses were hardly dramatic.  Dow component Philip Morris about 1/4.  RJR, R.J. Reynolds, down almost a point.  British-AmericanTobacco, which owns Brown &amp; Williamson, down 1/4.  And Loews, which owns Lorillard and the Vector Group -- and that Vector group, by the way, is the owner of Liggett -- both of them down nearly 1/2 on the day.</p><p>As the legal drama has climaxed this year, Philip Morris has actually rallied.  In fact, it is one of the best Dow performers in the year 2000.</p><p>Well, some on Wall Street believe that the damage has already been done to tobacco stocks.  But is that optimism misguided considering today's mammoth verdict?</p><p>Joining us now with more on the industry's fate: David Adelman. He's named as one of \"Wall Street Journal's\" -- \"Wall Street Journal\" names him as the \"All-Star Analyst,\" and they've named him that three times.</p><p>Mr. Adelman, welcome to MONEYLINE.</p><p>DAVID ADELMAN, MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER: It's a pleasure to be here.</p><p>VARNEY: If this thing goes to appeal, what do you think happens?</p><p>ADELMAN: Well, I don't think there's any question this lawsuit will ultimately be thrown out on appeal.  There have been a total of 26 different courts that have assessed whether tobacco cases are appropriate as class actions, looking at the same law.  Twenty-five have said no.  This is the one exception.</p><p>VARNEY: You think it will be thrown out completely?</p><p>ADELMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>VARNEY: No punitive damages at all?  That's it?  Gone?</p><p>ADELMAN: Correct.  I think the most likely outcome is that the industry will not pay a single cent to resolve this lawsuit.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, what's wrong with the trial?  What happened in the trial that makes you say that it would be so completely reversed?</p><p>ADELMAN: Right, I think that there are two fundamental aspects. One is that it should never have been a class action.  You simply cannot assess and litigate a mass product liability case where there are so many individual issues and so many differences among the class members in one aggregated mass.  It simply doesn't make sense that. And that's why each and every class member will need to have to his or her own individual trial in subsequent years if the case proceeds.</p><p>The second fatal fundamental flaw in this case is that the mass aggregate, punitive-damage award you were speaking about earlier is fundamentally unconstitutional because who knows how many class members there are.  Who knows how many people will ultimately prevail? Who knows what the scale of their injury is.  And it's a fundamental aspect of our legal system, you have to establish the compensatory damage first.  That hasn't been done.  And Florida's attorney general himself has said that this trial process has been unconstitutional.</p><p>VARNEY: Now, as the appeal process goes forward, can Philip Morris continue to pay a dividend, for example?  I mean, the plaintiffs' lawyers would say: Wait a minute, you can't do that, that's our money.  Can they do it?  Can they pay it?</p><p>ADELMAN: Absolutely.  I think that for the industry as a whole -- whether it's Philip Morris or other manufacturers -- it's going to be business as usual in terms of dividend payments, investments in the business, the level of profitability, sharing, purchases, strategic activity and so forth.</p><p>VARNEY: Now -- well, there's been some sale of a food business as well, by R.J. Reynolds I believe.  Now, I'm not quite sure which way round that is, but can they take the money without giving it to the plaintiffs' lawyers?</p><p>ADELMAN: Absolutely.  The court system in our country doesn't have the right to seize assets.  What they can do -- and what they may do in this instance -- is attempt to allow the plaintiff attorneys to execute on the judgment and try the seize the manufacturer's assets. But I feel very strongly that, in this circumstance, given the nature and the structure of this case, that that would be improper, it would be inappropriate, and that would be very quickly overturned on appeal.</p><p>VARNEY: Are there large-scale suits coming towards the point of judgment?</p><p>ADELMAN: No.  Actually, if you step back, Engels has obviously been an ongoing dilemma for the industry for has been a ongoing dilemma for quite some time.  But the big-picture legal environment continues to improve.  The industry just won a case in Mississippi, an individual smoker case last week.  They won a case in Brooklyn, New York a month ago.  The caseload continues to decline.  The number of class actions that have been thrown out continue to grow.  The one major case that continues to be out there is the federal government's case brought by the Department of Justice.  That case will probably hear a motion on the industry's initial motion to dismiss around Labor Day.</p><p>VARNEY: Fair enough.  David Adelmen, Morgan, thanks for joining us.</p><p>ADELMAN: My pleasure, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: OK.</p><p>Miles -- in fact more than a thousand miles away from Miami -- investors were talking tech as much as they were talking tobacco.  On Wall Street today, the hardest-hit stocks of the year 2000 extended their winning streak to three sessions.  The Nasdaq began the week below 4000 and fell for two days before strong profits from Yahoo! set off an encouraging comeback.  The rally brought the index back into the black for the year.  It is now off just 16 from its high, out of what many consider bear-market territory.</p><p>Allan Chernoff has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): High-tech fever is gripping Wall Street as investors snap up shares of companies delivering strong growth in profits or revenues.  The Nasdaq composite gained for the third straight session, closing at 4246, up 71 points for the day and up five percent for the week.  Big-name Internet stocks are back in vogue.  TheStreet.com Internet Index climbed nearly seven percent his week.  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, the SOX, was up more than six percent.</p><p>Altera's strong earnings are raising hopes that other chip-makers will deliver blockbuster results.</p><p>BRIAN FINNERTY, C.E. UNTERBERG, TOWBIN: They seemed to have built a very nice base over three months.  Now the strong earnings are coming in and there's money out there to buy those strong earnings.</p><p>CHERNOFF: A drop in June's core rate of wholesale inflation, which excluded food and energy, ignited interest-sensitive financial stocks.  The banking index rose two percent on the day, led by Dow component J.P. Morgan, while shares of Lehman rose on news it's in talks to buy SG Cowen's retail brokerage business.</p><p>A decline in drug stocks, though, limited the Dow's gains.  The index closed at 10812, up 24 points on the day and 1.6 percent for the week.</p><p>JOSEPH ZOCK, CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ASSOC.: To get a Dow stock to move takes a lot more investor enthusiasm, a lot more buying pressure. So I'll think you'll still have that divergence going forward.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: No question about it, the Nasdaq once again has assumed the leadership position on Wall Street.  Investors sense that the negative psychology surrounding technology and promising Internet names is disappearing.  If earnings continue looking strong next week, traders believe the techs will keep on rallying -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: That sounds pretty good, doesn't it, on a Friday afternoon?  Alan Chernoff reporting.  Thank you, Allan. Well, earlier we had some technical problems.  Those problems have now been resolved.  So let's go back to Allan Dodds Frank, reporting live from Miami on that massive punitive damage award against the tobacco companies -- Allan.</p><p>FRANK: Stuart, we've had some rain and wet equipment problems here.  So let me just talk you through this.  The jury took less than five hours to give their verdict to the judge.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT P. KAYE, DADE COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE: We the jury return the following verdict.  What is the total amount of punitive damages, if any, that you have assessed against to defendants.  Philip Morris Inc.: $73 billion, $960 million.  R.J. Reynolds tobacco company $36 billion, $280 dollars.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHERNOFF: The verdict sheet in my hand here says it was bad news for the others defendants too: $17 billion against Brown &amp; Williamson: $16.25 billion for Lorillard: $79 million for the Liggett Group.</p><p>Now, right after the verdict was announced, in a completely quiet courtroom, I might add, the lawyers for the tobacco companies came to the press room and they were quite defiant, saying that a penny would never be paid on this, and that, in fact, it would be appealed for years.  The case could go on for 75 years.  Then Stanley Rosenblatt challenged, the attorney for the plaintiffs, who got what he wanted from the jury, challenged Philip Morris chairman Geoffrey Bible, to give him a call offer him a settlement.</p><p>And that what's happened here today, Stuart.  On Monday, the judge will decide whether -- will be asked whether he'll reduce this award or throw it out.  And then we'll take it from there.  In the meantime, I would say the atmosphere is right for settlement talks -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Fair enough.  Allan Dodds Frank reporting live from Miami.  Thank you, Allan.</p><p>And still ahead on MONEYLINE, we'll tell you about the Wall Street analysts who say their lives have been threatened for downgrading hot stocks.</p><p>Plus, now that the Sprint-WorldCom marriage is off, is Deutsche Telekom waiting in the wings with a bouquet and a proposal?  We've got \"The Bottom Line\" on that.</p><p>And we'll ask Bank One chief economist Diane Swonk about today's news on inflation and what it means to the Fed.  All of that next on MONEYLINE.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: From CNN's New York headquarters, this is THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: There was a great deal of economic news out today, but it offered a mixed picture on whether runaway growth is really slowing down.  Producer prices last month shot up six-tenths of one percent, more than expected.  But take energy out of the equation, and the so- called \"core rate\" actually fell, in the first decline since January.</p><p>Retail sales during June jumped a half a percent, but without car sales that would have been a much smaller gain.</p><p>And factory output last month edged up just 0.2 percent, less than expected and the smallest rise in nearly a year.</p><p>Still, the bond market took the news badly.  The 10- and 30-year notes and Treasury bonds both falling nearly a point on the day.</p><p>And a report released today by a group of business economists didn't help the mood either.  The National Association of Business Economists is out with its second-quarter survey of 127 companies.  It found that 33 percent are hiking their profits, the highest percentage in five years.  A full 60 percent say material costs are rising, way up from the previous quarter, and nearly half plan further price hikes this year.</p><p>Joining us now from Chicago, the president of the organization, who is also the chief economist at Bank One, Diane Swonk.</p><p>Diane, welcome back to MONEYLINE.</p><p>DIANE SWONK, BANK ONE: Good to see you, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Do we have an inflation problem a'brewing here?</p><p>SWONK: We certainly have a very ripe environment for inflation. What we saw in the survey, and I think this is important, is in the first quarter we saw a marked shift in pricing power.  This is the first shift we've seen where companies were able to actually push through price increases in more than two years.  That shift in pricing power not only continued in the second quarter, but it actually worsened a bit.</p><p>The other thing we've seen in the survey is a lack of deflation. For many years now, we've had a hefty percentage of companies, or at least a fairly large percentage of companies, that said they actually had prices that were declining out there.  That has now neatly disappeared.  There's very few firms who are actually reducing prices, some firms actually increasing prices, and what we're left with is a very mild inflationary environment.</p><p>VARNEY: Now for the last few years, we've been running along in this economy with an inflation rate of around 2.5 percent per year or less.  Can you see it moving significantly above 3 percent in the near future?</p><p>SWONK: I think, on the core rate of inflation, I think this is a gradual inflation, the kind of inflation that sneaks up on you.  I don't think we're going to see above 3 percent core rate inflation until well into the end of next year.  So I think this is going to be a very gradual and slow process.  That's the hardest kind of process for financial markets, financial markets looking for black and white, and here we are shifting in shades of gray with regard to inflation.</p><p>In many ways, I like to liken the current environment, we've just moved from very cool water to tepid water.  No one's being scorched yet, so it doesn't seem like it's a problem, but clearly something has changed in the business environment over the past six months.</p><p>I think it's also important to note, picked up in the survey, was how bullish industry is about hiring again.  In fact, hiring plans increased in the second quarter, despite the fact that complaints are widespread that they can't find workers to fill the jobs that they already have.  This suggests we'll see further declines in the unemployment rate this year.  As welcome as that is for Main Street, it certainly will be more concern for the Federal Reserve.</p><p>VARNEY: Well said, indeed.  Diane Swonk, chief economist at Bank One, thanks for joining us, Diane.</p><p>SWONK: Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, here's what's coming up for you, the latest on a story we told you about last night: death threats leveled against Wall Street analysts.</p><p>Plus, the perils of double-tasking, and why you should stay off the cell phone while driving.</p><p>MONEYLINE will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Now a follow-up on the disturbing story we brought to you exclusively last night: death threats against Wall Street analysts who issue critical comments on stocks.  Last night, we told you about a Salomon Smith Barney analyst who received such threats last week, and tonight another analyst tells his story.</p><p>Steve young reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Wall Street's top analysts know about exposure and vulnerability.</p><p>Today, a highly visible technology analyst tells MONEYLINE, quote, \"You watch your back.  If they wanted to kill you they could.\"</p><p>He recently downgraded an important tech stock and now doesn't want to be named because that could invite trouble.  He got e-mails just short of death threats, but says his firm's security force decided he didn't need a bodyguard.  He blames what he calls, quote, \"sleazy day-traders.\" Internet chat rooms provide a fertile, if anonymous, venue for investors to vent.  Several blasted the SalomonSmith Barney analyst who have received death threats after downgrading the entire semiconductor sector.  With the volatile stock market playing an increasingly central role in American life, the Wall Street pros who evaluate stocks are center stage.</p><p>LORI MEISLER, THESTREET.COM: Analysts have definitely become superstars.  I've been tracking them for, you know, nearly 20 years, and I've watched them rise from relative obscurity to becoming, you know, household names.  Not only do, you know, institutional investors know about analysts, but individual investors see analysts splashed all over the TV and in the press.</p><p>YOUNG: After downgrading Dell and Rambus, e-mail and phone death threats were received by analyst Dan Niles.</p><p>DAN NILES, LEHMAN BROTHERS: To some extent, it's like anything, right?  The more high-profile you are, the more you impact stocks, the more you can move stocks, the more likely this is to happen to you.</p><p>YOUNG: The phenomenon isn't exactly new.  Back in 1987, Elaine Garzarelli (ph) forecasted a market collapse on MONEYLINE, and when it occurred, she got death threats, too.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YOUNG: The fortunate news, according to Kroll Associates security experts, is that while each Wall Street death threat incident is chilling, the phenomenon does not appear to be widespread -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Steve is there any suggestion that this is a trend and it's getting more prevalent?</p><p>YOUNG: Well, it certainly has been a trend during the era of day-trading.  Perhaps as the dot.com implosion continues, it might calm down -- at least everybody hopes so.</p><p>VARNEY: We do, indeed.  Steve Young, thank you.</p><p>In tonight's \"Tech Watch,\" the risk of driving while talking on a cell phone.  Federal safety regulators are launching a study into the risks of these distractions, as more and more people have electronic equipment in their cars.  They estimate that 44 percent of all drivers have phones in their vehicles.  And according to AAA, one-fourth of the more than 6 million accidents each year are caused by distracted drivers.</p><p>In New Jersey, Marlboro Township voted late yesterday to prohibit the use of hand-held cell phones while driving.  It is the fifth community in the country to approve such a ban.</p><p>All right, for more tech news, you can log on to our Web site at cnnfn.com, or AOL keyword CNNfn.</p><p>Still to come on MONEYLINE, the battle over the so-called \"death tax.\" We'll tell you how the Senate voted.</p><p>Plus, controversy over high gas prices in the Midwest flares all over again.</p><p>That story and more just ahead in out \"News Digest.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: On Capitol Hill today, the Senate voted to repeal the estate tax, legislation that would cut an estimated $105 billion in taxes over the next 10 years.  The measure now goes to President Clinton, who says he's going to veto it because it benefits too few people at too high a cost.  The bill did not garner the two-thirds margin needed to override a veto, 59 voting in favor, 39 against it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. PHIL GRAMM (R), TEXAS: The good news is the Congress has repealed the death tax.  The bad news is the president says he's going to veto it.  But the good news is Bill Clinton is not going to be president next year.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VARNEY: Immediately after the estate tax vote, the Senate turned to a 10-year, $248 billion bill to repeal the so-called \"marriage penalty\" tax.  Passage of that bill is expected on Monday.</p><p>House Speaker Dennis Hastert today charging that the Clinton administration misled members of Congress over high gas prices in the Midwest.</p><p>For more on that now, here's Jim Moret, with the \"MONEYLINE News Digest\" -- Jim.</p><p>JIM MORET, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you, Stuart.</p><p>Hastert said the administration publicly implied oil companies colluded in the increase.  But he charged an internal Department of Energy memo shows administration officials knew that other causes contributed to the high prices, among them the lack of inventory.  The administration is dismissing Hastert's claims as gas-pump-price politics.</p><p>At Camp David today, President Clinton held one-on-one meetings with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders.  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Palestinian opposition politicians who want to join the talks.  The peace summit continues this weekend.</p><p>Democratic sources on Capitol Hill tell CNN that Al Gore's campaign is talking with Dick Gephardt about becoming Gore's running mate.  The sources describe the discussions with the House minority leader as \"serious.\"</p><p>And a jury decision today in the Branch Davidian wrongful-death suit.  The jurors concluded the government did not cause the 1993 gunfight at the group's Waco compound.</p><p>Those are the top stories at this hour.

Mr. Bloomberg has reportedly acquired a host of Web domain names.  On the list: mikeformayor.com, mikebloomberg2001.org, and newyorkcitymayor.org.

Here again, Stuart Varney.</p><p>VARNEY: In tonight's headlines, tech shares close the week with a bang, as some new-economy high-flyers unveil profits that put a charge into Wall Street.</p><p>And an insurance merger on ice: Is it another blow to one-time corporate raider Saul Steinberg?</p><p>Plus, an in-depth look at the German phone giant that is looking to make major inroads in this country.  \"The Bottom Line\" at Deutsche Telekom.</p><p>But first, more on tonight's top story: a landmark ruling against the tobacco industry, as a Florida jury issues a staggering verdict, nearly $145 billion in punitive damages against the cigarette makers. The verdict is sure to be appealed, but it did hit tobacco stocks. Philip Morris, for example, down nearly a quarter point, R.J. Reynolds down almost 1; British-American Tobacco, which owns Brown &amp; Williamson, down a quarter; Loews, which owns Lorillard and Vector Group, and Vector Group, owner of Liggett, both slid nearly a half point. For the tobacco industry's perspective on this verdict, we're joined now by William Ohlmeyer.  He is the general counsel of Philip Morris.</p><p>Mr. Ohlmeyer, welcome to MONEYLINE.  Good to have you with us.</p><p>WILLIAM OHLMEYER, GENERAL COUNSEL, PHILIP MORRIS: Good evening.</p><p>VARNEY: Sir, you have said that this was an \"illegal\" trial, and that you will, therefore, win on appeal.  What was illegal about it?</p><p>OHLMEYER: Well, the case was tried using a procedural device known as a \"class action,\" and more than two dozen state and federal courts have decided in 28 other cases that it's inappropriate and illegal to use a class action to decide these kinds of cases, specifically tobacco cases, because the individual issues that have to be decided before you can determine liability are not decided in a case like this, only common issues are.  And the common issues aren't the ones that are important to determine what's entitled to recover dollar damages.</p><p>So essentially, you have a procedure that prevents a company like Philip Morris from defending itself and prevents a jury from hearing all the evidence it needs to hear to determine who's entitled to collect compensatory damages, if anyone is.</p><p>VARNEY: Let's suppose for a moment that you do not win on appeal, that, in fact, you lose.  You've got to pay out literally tens of billions of dollars.  Would Philip Morris consider a bankruptcy declaration?</p><p>OHLMEYER: Well, I think that's hypothetical, but the fact of the matter is nobody, no company in this lawsuit or in this country could write a check for this kind of damage award.  And that's one of the reasons why it will get a lot of scrutiny in the appellate court.  And the appellate court will look very carefully at it because it is a verdict that was the result of procedures that violated the law and gave the jury an opportunity to do things that it should never have been given a chance to do.</p><p>So the verdict will certainly be appealed, and we're optimistic that it will be reversed on appeal.</p><p>VARNEY: Down the road -- some way, perhaps, down the road -- but do you think we're on the way towards de facto prohibition of tobacco?</p><p>OHLMEYER: Well, that's what Mr. Rosenblatt asked the jury to do. And that was the theme of his cross examination of the company chief executive officers who testified.  And I don't think one jury and one state should be allowed to essentially or de facto prohibit the sale of a legal product in this country, even if it's a controversial one and even if it's one that's manufactured and sold by a company that many people -- that is not as popular as another company.  I think those are legislative decisions that the Congress and the state legislature should decide.  And no jury should be in the position and no lawyer should be able to ask a jury to do that kind of legislating through litigation.</p><p>VARNEY: Your shareholders at Philip Morris currently receive a very generous dividend.  Will they continue to receive that dividend? Because I can see, perhaps, the plaintiffs' lawyers suggesting that that money really should go towards the settlement.</p><p>OHLMEYER: Well, there's a verdict that's going to be appealed, but the thing you need to remember is the company involved in this lawsuit is Philip Morris USA.  That's a tobacco company.  Philip Morris Companies owns a number of companies, including Philip Morris USA, but Kraft and Miller.  And they're all separate companies, none of which was involved in this lawsuit.  The only company involved in this lawsuit was the tobacco company.</p><p>VARNEY: William Ohlmeyer, general counsel at Philip Morris, we thank you very much for joining us tonight.  Thank you, sir.</p><p>OHLMEYER: Thank you, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: OK.</p><p>Now let's get more detail on this verdict, this award that was given today in Miami.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank has been following the case for two years.  He was there this afternoon, and he filed this report for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK (voice-over): The jury took less than five hours.</p><p>KAYE: We the jury return the following verdict.  What is the total amount of punitive damage, if any, which you have assessed against the defendants?</p><p>Philip Morris Incorporated: $73,960,000,000.</p><p>R.J.R. Reynolds Tobacco Company: $36,280,000,000.</p><p>FRANK: For the other defendants, more bad news.</p><p>Brown &amp; Williamson: nearly $17.6 billion.</p><p>For Lorillard: $16.25 billion.</p><p>And got Liggett and Meyers: $790 million.</p><p>The award, from a jury of four men and two women, who heard the case for nearly two years, far exceeds earlier record punitive damage awards against corporations of about $5 billion.  The verdict is almost 10 times greater than the total $15.2 billion net worth of the five companies.</p><p>The tobacco companies had argued that such a massive verdict on behalf of 500,000 or more would sign a death warrant for the industry. But the lead tobacco lawyer insisted it will be overturned, and that no payment will ever be made.  And he argued the companies will not seek a compromise.</p><p>WEBB: There's no incentive to settle, and the reason for that is very simple: These companies, and particularly my client Philip Morris, believe this was an unfair procedure.  It has been unheard of in American history to do anything like this.  The unfairness, the unconstitutionality of it, my client wants to take this through the court process.</p><p>STANLEY ROSENBLATT, PLAINTIFFS' ATTORNEY: It was a day of reckoning.  Six thoughtful, courageous Americans listened quietly and carefully to testimony for close to two years and, dammit, they did the right thing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK: The next move is up to Judge Robert Kaye.  The companies will ask him to throw out the jury verdict or at least greatly reduce it to an amount they might be able to afford, something in the single billion-dollar digit range -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: That's Allan Dodds Frank at the courthouse in Miami. Thanks, Allan.</p><p>Now back to Wall Street.  It closed the week on an up note today, as tech shares led the Nasdaq to its the third straight winning session, gaining strength from some powerful profit reports.  The Nasdaq put on another solid showing, rising 71 points to 4246.  For the week, the index jumped more than 5 percent.</p><p>Check some of the big tech movers: Cisco gained 3, JDS Uniphase rose more than 6, eBay up 7 3/4, Inktomi picked up nearly 5 1/2, Lycos gained more than 4 1/4.</p><p>As for the Dow industrials, well, struggled early on in the day but finished in the black, up 24 at 10812, as the financial sector rallied in the wake of some supportive inflation news.</p><p>Check that sector: J.P. Morgan jumped nearly 4 1/2; American Express gained more than 2 points; Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, both of them hit 52-week highs, Merrill up 1 and Lehman, which is reportedly in talks to but SG Cowen's private banking business, rose nearly 2 1/2.  As for Chase Manhattan, it gained almost 2 points on the day.</p><p>But it was tech stocks that were the week's big winners, and that momentum carried over to Wall Street as a whole.  Kitty Pilgrim has more on that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KITTY PILGRIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A flurry in technology late in the week caused a sea change in market sentiment. After two days of weakness, the Nasdaq composite solidly broke through the 4100 level, closing above that level on Thursday for the first time since mid-April. FRANK LA SALLA, BHF SECURITIES: Techs have really started to rally again.  I think we got really good news this week all across the board on the inflation front.  I think we're going to continue to get solid earnings growth on the upside, and I think that we're going to start to see -- we've begun the base for a summer rally.  I think that's going to go all the way through to September and October.</p><p>PILGRIM: Yahoo!, Amazon, Extreme Networks and Applied Microcircuits were all solidly higher on Friday.</p><p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor index posted a 4 percent gain for the week.  The thinking there: that chips will be in high demand if tech continues to dominate.</p><p>Telecommunications drew investors with the formal call off of the WorldCom-Sprint deal.  That put much of the sector in play, as investors considered possible new alliance combinations.</p><p>Large cap industrial stocks lagged, and pharmaceutical stocks also stayed out of favor.  Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers sold off on Friday.</p><p>Many stock strategists say the tech focus may continue.</p><p>JAMES GREFENSTETTE, FEDERATED INVESTORS: We really think it's a big, long story that's going to encompass literally rewiring the world so that you can have Internet access and the productivity that comes with it in every country and every continent.  So we think it's a real big deal and there's lots of legs left to the story.</p><p>PILGRIM: Earnings season is launched with a fair amount of positive sentiment.  However, investors are likely to keep their eye on things, especially the economy, until the next Fed meeting in late August.</p><p>Kitty Pilgrim, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: A late-day update on the proposed merger of UAL, parent of United Airlines, and U.S. Airways.  The Justice Department today asked UAL for more information regarding the deal.  This step had been expected as the government reviews the antitrust implications of the merger.</p><p>And, in other late breaking airline news, the \"Financial Times\" is reporting that AMR, parent of American, has all but given up its effort to buy Northwest.  A deal, of course, could still be struck, but the two sides are far apart in terms of money.  The \"FT\" cited sources familiar with the deal as saying that AMR is willing to pay $44 a share for Northwest, while Northwest was looking for a pricetag of more like $70 per share.</p><p>Up next: hints that the red-hot economy is slowing down, but the American consumer still going strong: what it all means to the Federal Reserve.  And later, a bottom-line look at Deutsche Telekom.  We'll be back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Mixed signals today on inflation and economic growth. Wholesale prices in June jumped six-tenths of one percent overall, but cut out food and energy sectors, and producer prices actually declined.</p><p>Lisa Leiter reports from Chicago on that and other economic news of the day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISA LEITER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Prices for computers, cars, and cigarettes fell in June, pulling down the core rate of wholesale inflation unexpectedly.</p><p>STAN SHIPLEY, MERRILL LYNCH: I think it says in prices, we do not have an inflation problem, except for energy prices.</p><p>LEITER: Higher gas prices also factored in to a surprising jump in retail sales.  In dollar terms, they shot up one half of a percent in June, the biggest increase in four months.  But excluding gasoline and autos, sales barely budged.</p><p>SHIPLEY: It looks likes this economy has downshifted to slower growth rates of probably around 3 1/2 percent as consumer spending looks to slow down about same amount.</p><p>LEITER: Output at the nation's factories also slowed in June, posting the weakest gain in nine months.  Still, industrial production has climbed for 18 months straight.</p><p>MIKE PARSZE, A. FINKL &amp; SONS: It's a slight slowdown.  We don't anticipate it getting any weaker.  Obviously, we are watching the market very closely.  We're talking to our customers on a regular basis, and being prepared for whichever way it turns.</p><p>LEITER: The direction of the economy is the now the great debate on Wall Street and on Main Street.  Is the recent slowdown a new trend, or just a breather in the breakneck pace of growth over the past few years?</p><p>CARL TANNENBAUM, LASALLE BANK: There's a scenario out there that economists are calling the head-fake, that maybe this is a soft quarter to be followed by strength going forward.  After all, consumers are still very confident.</p><p>LEITER: That's evident in a new reading on consumer sentiment, hovering this month near the record level set in January.</p><p>(on camera): That's why many economists are unwilling, at least for now, to declare an end to the Central Bank's credit tightening. They want more evidence a year's worth of rate hikes will curtail consumer spending.</p><p>Lisa Leiter, CNN Financial News, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: And still ahead on MONEYLINE, more trouble for Saul Steinberg as a planned merger stalls out.  That and more just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: In Tonight's MONEYLINE's \"Focus,\" another blow for famed corporate raider Saul Steinberg.  Leucadia National, which had agreed to acquire his troubled insurance company, Reliance, is putting the breaks on the deal.</p><p>Greg Clarkin has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was the launching pad for daring bids for Disney and Chemical Bank.  But now Saul Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings is teetering after its merger partner backs away; Leucadia National saying it will not go ahead with the deal on the current terms.  The news comes just seven weeks after Leucadia agreed to purchase Reliance in a $293 stock swap.  Since then, Reliance has sold off some businesses, sales that have driven Leucadia away, and weakened what's left of the insurer.</p><p>ROBERT HARTWIG, INSURANCE INFO. INSTITUTE: Reliance probably is not a viable entity going forward if it's not acquired very soon by a very healthy suitor.  It's been selling off some of its most profitable businesses, such as its surety business, some of its liability lines, and its re-insurance business.  So, there really won't be much left in the near future in the way of profitable business.</p><p>CLARKIN: Reliance has been hit by falling premiums in the insurance business.  And analysts say one-time corporate raider Steinberg, whose family owns more than 40 percent of the stock, ran the company with little accountability.  Shares of Reliance have plunged from $19 two years ago to 50 cents a share.  And analysts say things could get worse.</p><p>MATTHEW COYLE, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S: Reliance is in a very weak financial condition, and right now, the most imminent issue they have to face is refinancing their debt at the holding company, which is approximately 500-plus million dollars.  And they have to refinance that by November of this year.</p><p>CLARK (on camera): Leucadia and Reliance say they are working on alternative transactions, but Leucadia can terminate the merger agreement entirely by July 21st, and that gives the companies just one week to work out their differences.</p><p>Greg Clarkin, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) VARNEY: And coming up next: \"The Bottom Line\" on Europe's biggest telecom.  With the WorldCom-Sprint deal history, Deutsche Telekom is in hot pursuit of an American partner.  That story is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: A year ago, very few people had ever heard of VoiceStream Wireless.  Now it's one of the hottest properties in the telecom business.</p><p>Tonight, the company has no comment on reports that NTT DoCoMo of Japan is once again interested in buying part -- if not all -- of VoiceStream.  In fact, DoCoMo may try to outbid Deutsche Telekom, which is said to be interested as well.</p><p>No surprise then that VoiceStream's stock shot up nearly 8 3/4 today.  It's up more than 300 percent over the past year.</p><p>And that brings us to \"The Bottom Line,\" our regular Friday feature on one company making moves and making news.  Tonight, the company competing with DoCoMo for VoiceStream: Deutsche Telekom.  The German phone giant has been thrust back into the merger spotlight this week, and not just because of its interest in VoiceStream.  There's been a flurry of speculation that DT might step in after the collapse of the WorldCom-Sprint megadeal.</p><p>But Deutsche Telekom's track record in actually sealing a deal is nothing to call home about.</p><p>Peter Viles reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(SPEAKING IN GERMAN)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): That's the language in Frankfurt and Hamburg, where the pink logo of Deutsche Telekom means market dominance in telephone and Internet service.  But DT is trying to learn a new language, the one spoken in Kansas City and Denver.</p><p>It's not that CEO Ron Sommer has trouble with English.</p><p>RON SOMMER, CEO, DEUTSCHE TELEKOM: No, because the German government behaves very clearly\u2026</p><p>VILES: It's the language of business and politics he's trying to master, and right now Washington is giving him lessons.</p><p>SEN. FRITZ HOLLINGS (D), SOUTH CAROLINA: Recent comments by Deutsche Telekom are particularly disturbing.  During a recent press conference in New York, DT's CEO, Ron Sommer, stated -- quote -- \"The market cap of Deutsche Telekom today versus any American potential acquisition candidate means that nobody is out of reach.\"</p><p>VILES: DT's desire to own an American phone company is an open secret.  The question is which one and at what price and whether Washington will let it happen.</p><p>GREG MILLER, ING BARINGS: I think Deutsche Telekom would probably be most interested in acquiring anything that would give it a nationwide footprint.  Now, if I were Deutsche Telekom, I would be most interested in both the wireless business as well as the wireline business.</p><p>VILES: Recent speculation has focused on VoiceStream Wireless of suburban Seattle, which uses the same GSM technology that DT uses. But VoiceStream has a problem: It loses about $2 million a day.</p><p>There's always Sprint in Kansas City.  DT already owns 10 percent of it.  But the road leads through Bill Esrey and the toll starts at about $100 billion.  If it's Qwest in Denver, the price is about the same and the deal-maker is battle-tested Joe Nacchio.</p><p>RICHARD KLUGMAN, DONALDSON, LUFKIN &amp; JENRETTE: You know, pick and choose, I suppose.  You could put WorldCom on that list as well. I think the most likely scenario for Deutsche Telekom is Sprint given the familiarity, given the nationwide wireless that comes along with it, given the Internet backbone of Sprint.  It's the second-largest, after WorldCom.  I think that probably makes the most sense.</p><p>VILES: In any case, Deutsche Telekom will need friends in Washington.  The German government owns 57 percent of the company and U.S. law bars outside governments from owning more than 25 percent of U.S. phone companies.  DT would probably need a special waiver from the FCC to buy American.</p><p>In its young life as a public company, DT shares have more doubled, easily outperforming the S&amp;P 500.  With 36 billion in revenue last year, it is Europe's biggest phone company and the fourth-largest in the world.  Its T-Online Internet service with 5 million subscribers is Europe's largest and second in the world only to American Online.</p><p>Sommers gets credit for cutting jobs -- he slashed another 1,500 jobs today -- and transforming a sluggish monopoly into a potential global player.  But in the U.S. and Europe, he has kicked a lot of tires without closing a big deal.  DT's alliance with France Telecom collapsed in bitterness and a bid for Telecom Italia also fell apart.</p><p>(on camera): European companies have been coming to America for centuries, but Deutsche Telekom's journey could be the most expensive trans-Atlantic trip in history.  It could easily cost more than $100 billion, and even then, the company will have to convince Washington that when it gets here, it will act like a good citizens.</p><p>Peter Viles, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: Now take a look at some stocks at the center of the telecom speculation: VoiceStream, as we mentioned, soared, and Nextel, another potential wireless target, was up more than 2 1/2.  Sprint, up more than two points.  WorldCom gained a point and a quarter.  And Deutsche Telekom was up nearly one point in New York trading.</p><p>Coming up, a rich payday for a corporate executive whose stock has seen better days.  Plus, \"Ahead of the Curve\": some of what you need to know before the markets open come Monday morning.  We'll be back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Here's some of what could make news on Wall Street next week.  Nearly half of the Dow components are slated to report their earnings next week.  They include Honeywell, which warned of lower earnings last month, Microsoft, and Philip Morris.</p><p>Also watch for reports from big tech names like America Online and Lucent Technologies.</p><p>On the economic front, look for the Consumer Price Index, international trade and housing start figures.</p><p>And to stay a step ahead of the markets, tune in to \"AHEAD OF THE CURVE\" every weekday at 5:00 a.m. Eastern on CNN.</p><p>Finally from us tonight, a huge payout for a chief executive whose stock has been in the tank this year.  In an SEC filing released today, Computer Associates showed that chairman and chief executive Charles Wang got a pay package worth up to $95 million in salary, bonus and stock options for the fiscal year 2000: this coming while the stock is down more than 58 percent this year, hit hard by an earnings warning earlier this month.</p><p>That's MONEYLINE for this Friday.  I'm Stuart Varney.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STUART VARNEY, CNN ANCHOR: Tonight, two disturbing trends throw Wall Street for a loop, the dollar plunges again and oil takes another dizzying surge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WILLOW BAY, CNN ANCHOR: You've got trouble.  Why stock in America Online and a host of other Net giants lost momentum.</p><p>VARNEY: In Florida, escape from Hurricane Floyd.  As one meteorologist put it, this is Andrew's big brother.</p><p>BAY: And the lifestyles of the rich and powerful played out in a New York courtroom.  We'll hear from the ex-wife of Revlon chief Ron Perelman.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is the MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR.  Reporting tonight from New York, Willow Bay and Stuart Varney.</p><p>VARNEY: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to MONEYLINE.  Well, hopes that tech stocks would build on Friday's record run faded fast.</p><p>BAY: The Nasdaq today retreated from its lofty levels: that as the greenback today sunk to a new three-year low against the yen.  The dollar downdraft, along with another spike in oil prices, fueled more fears of inflation and rising interest rates.</p><p>Rhonda Schaffler has more in today's \"Street Sweep.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A market held hostage: That's how one strategist described the day on Wall Street. Investors, hamstrung by interest rate fears and the dollar slide.  The greenback tumbled again, pressuring stocks and bonds.</p><p>Blue chips treaded water all day, ending up less than two points. The big loser was last week's winner: The Nasdaq, retreating from Friday's record, down 42 points to 2,844.</p><p>Interest rate concerns hit \"big board\" financials and tech stocks on both the Dow and Nasdaq.</p><p>PETER HENDERSON, HENDERSON BROTHERS: Not a lot to sink your teeth into today.  And the fact that the techs and the financials were very weak and the Standard &amp; Poor's was down, you really can't look at the industrial average and say, well, it was a pretty much of a neutral day, because the market does not act well today.</p><p>And short term, I would predict that we see a follow through of not great trading tomorrow.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: Among today's high-tech decliners, IBM, Hewlett- Packard, Dell and Microsoft.  Net stocks took bigger dives.  AOL, one of the big board's most active, was off sharply on negative comments in this week's \"Barron's.\"</p><p>On the Nasdaq, eBay, Yahoo! and CMGI all pulled back.</p><p>One big fear going forward, that the Fed will have to hike interest rates to support the sagging dollar.  Some say that fear is overblown.</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICE: I think this would be more of a problem for Federal Reserve policy-makers and for financial markets if dollar weakness was broader-based.  Thus far, the dollar still holds up quite well against the euro.</p><p>However, if as expected European economies do quicken, then I would look for the dollar perhaps to soften against the euro later in the year.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: Also sure to figure into the Fed's thinking, two key reports out over the next few days.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Tomorrow will bring retail sales for August.  On Wednesday -- the one Wall Street is really waiting for -- the latest reading on consumer prices -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Rhonda: Rhonda Schaffler from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>VARNEY: Aside from those economic numbers, the Fed will clearly factor the weakening dollar into its deliberations.  Today, the currency lost more than two yen, trading at 106 yen.  That's a new three-year low.  That as Japan failed to intervene, as it did last week.</p><p>At the same time, oil shot to a 31-month high: at $24.21 a barrel, more than double what it was in January of this year.</p><p>Now, considering the inflation threats, bonds were relatively resilient.  The 30-year issue fell five ticks.  The yield at 6.04 percent.</p><p>Wall Street has been surprisingly resilient as well, considering the dollar's recent slide, that is.  But our guest tonight warns that investors may not be taking the dollar doldrums seriously enough.</p><p>He remembers some lessons from 1987.  Hugh Johnson of First Albany joins us now.</p><p>Hugh, welcome back to MONEYLINE.</p><p>HUGH JOHNSON, FIRST ALBANY SECURITIES: Thanks, Willow, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Let's deal with 1987 in a moment.  But first of all, this question.  If the dollar does keep on falling, does Wall Street sell off big time?</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.  There have been a lot of studies done about the relationship between currencies and stock markets, and they're pretty strong relationships.  When you see the dollar sag, it presents all sorts of problems to a Federal Reserve that has plenty of problems right now.</p><p>So it really implies that inflation down the road is going to be a little bit higher.  They can't sit by and preserve their credibility.  They will need to raise short-term interest rates if we get further weakness in the dollar.  I hope we don't, but if we do, it gives them a problem.</p><p>BAY: Inflation, interest rates, a concern.  How concerned should we be about foreign investors moving their money out of the stock market, of course, but then the bond market.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, Willow, you know, we have to remember that foreign investors now own 34 percent of all U.S. Treasuries.  So if they start to exit our markets, they can drive bond prices down, interest rates up.  They own 7 percent of U.S. stocks.  So any way you look at it, the dollar declines and it dissuades investors from our markets -- it's going to have an impact on our markets.</p><p>BAY: How likely is that to happen, given what you're seeing right now?</p><p>JOHNSON: You know, I kind of go along with the idea that the strength in the economies abroad, particularly in Europe, is not going to be quite what everybody expects it to be.  So I'm not looking for a dollar crisis, but believe me, I think everybody has to stay tuned and watch very carefully.</p><p>VARNEY: Let's regurgitate 1987, shall we?  Do you think we're in a similar situation right now?</p><p>JOHNSON: It's not quite as bad.  In 1987, we had significant weakness in the dollar.  And as you remember, Paul Volcker said enough is enough.  All of the countries, Western countries, got together, decided to take steps to support the dollar.</p><p>They were raising interest rates.  We had, quite frankly, a stronger threat of inflation, and then we had cooperation between Germany and the United States break down, and that led to the real problem.  So it's not at the crisis level of 1987.  It's a dangerous level but it's not a crisis level.</p><p>VARNEY: Hugh Johnson, First Albany, thanks for being back with us again on MONEYLINE.</p><p>JOHNSON: My pleasure.</p><p>VARNEY: OK -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Thanks.</p><p>Now, let's take a quick look at what some of MONEYLINE's other reporters are working on for the rest of the show.  We begin with Bruce Francis -- Bruce.</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Willow.  3Com is cutting off the Palm that feeds it.  Will investors be satisfied with what's left of the struggling networking giant?  I'll have that story.</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Steve Young.  Wall Street today whacked Motorola stock and General Instrument, too, on news Motorola is ready to acquire the biggest set-top box maker.  I'll explain why analysts still say the deal makes sense.</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Allan Dodds Frank. I'll have the latest on a bitter child custody battle between New York's richest man, Ronald Perelman, and his former wife, Patricia Duff.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Allan.  We'll have much more on those stories coming up in the hour.</p><p>VARNEY: But first, our top story outside the world of business. Florida is bracing for potential catastrophe tonight as Hurricane Floyd whips itself into a massive category 4 storm with winds maxing out at 155 miles per hour.  Floyd is currently located 450 miles off the coast of Florida, moving west at 16 miles an hour.  Evacuation orders have been given for low-lying areas and building materials and food staples have flown off the shelves.</p><p>Question: Why such great concern?  Well, there's one word in the answer and that's Andrew.</p><p>In 1992, that category 4 storm smashed into Florida, taking 65 lives and causing $26 billion worth of damage.  Floyd is also fierce and three to four times as big.</p><p>Obvious question: Will Floyd make landfall?  Well, joining us now to talk about where Floyd may be going is Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.</p><p>Sir, welcome to MONEYLINE.</p><p>MAX MAYFIELD, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER: Good evening, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Obvious question, Max, is your best judgment, please, on when and where this hurricane could make landfall on the Eastern Seaboard. MAYFIELD: Well, two things.  One, as you've already stated, this is a very powerful category 4 hurricane: borderline category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale.  Extremely dangerous.  If it were to make a direct hit on the Southeastern United States coast, I would expect extreme damage from this hurricane.</p><p>Our current forecast track has it turning gradually toward the Northwest into the northern Bahamas.  And this time tomorrow night it should be centered somewhere east of Palm Beach, Florida, and then this time on the following night to be very near the South Carolina coast.</p><p>However, the timing of this turning north is not at all certain, and therefore, the risks are just too great.  So we upgraded the hurricane watch to a hurricane warning for the Florida East Coast.</p><p>Now, tonight the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is flying the jet aircraft and two of the P-3 aircraft in environment around the hurricane to initialize the computer models, to get the best estimate of the steering (ph) flow that we possibly can.</p><p>So we're doing everything we can to make a good forecast.  Even though, we're forecasting the center of this hurricane to remain just off the Florida east coast, it's just too close for comfort here.  And so, that's why we have the hurricane warning.</p><p>VARNEY: Is it possible to make a judgment as to whether or not this hurricane could be upgraded to a category 5 storm?  What's its normal behavior, of a storm of this kind?</p><p>MAYFIELD: I think that there is certainly some possibility that could happen.  We've only had two category 5 hurricanes to strike the United States this century: the Labor Day hurricane in 1935 in the Florida Keys and Hurricane Camille on the Mississippi coast in 1969.</p><p>So it's very unlikely really, if you look at the statistics, that it would become a category 5.  But I can assure you a category 4 could cause just extreme damage.</p><p>VARNEY: Max Mayfield of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, we thank you for joining us tonight.  Thank you, Max.</p><p>MAYFIELD: You're welcome.</p><p>VARNEY: Willow.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Stuart.  Other stories making headlines tonight: In Moscow, another powerful bomb explosion ripped out an entire apartment block early this morning: 66 are dead in the fourth violent blast to rock the Russian capital in two weeks.  Two were arrested in connection with the bombing.  Russia's interior minister blames Islamic rebels for the attacks.</p><p>A strong earthquake claimed six lives and injured more than 320 in Turkey.  The magnitude 5.8 jolt struck the same part of Turkey hit by a massive quake in mid-August.  More than 15,000 died then. VARNEY: And Australian troops are tonight preparing to lead a peacekeeping mission to East Timor.  Officials are meeting at the U.N. to organize the operation.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of East Timorese have gone into hiding or escaped to West Timor.  Aid workers say food and supplies are desperately needed.</p><p>BAY: Coming up on MONEYLINE, the Palm Pilot cleared for takeoff. 3Com is taking its hand-held computer division to \"The Street.\"</p><p>VARNEY: Plus, with billions at stake, the coming battle over genetically modified crops: Are too few companies controlling the course of agriculture?  We'll be back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Plans tonight for a spin-off by the No. 2 computer networking firm.  3Com announced today it will sell shares in its popular palm computing unit through an IPO planned for early next year.  The market liked it; 3Com stock up 1 5/8.</p><p>Bruce Francis has our report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): 3Com is shedding palm computing, one of its fastest growing assets, in order to make sure it thrives.</p><p>ERIC BENHAMOU, CEO, 3Com: It was important for us to be able to nurture Palm to a point where there was a thriving hand-held computer industry.  The ownership of Palm is not essential to the strategy we pursue.</p><p>FRANCIS: But some five million users have found it essential to own a Palm Pilot, now bringing in more than $500 million a year for 3Com.  3Com plans to sell a minority stake in the palm pilot business in a public offering.  Then 3Com shareholders will receive stock in the rest of Palm.</p><p>BERT HOCHFELD, ANALYST, JOSEPTHAL: 3Com has been attempting to restructure its business to maximize shareholder value since the stumbles that they have had, and this is just part of that strategy. I think it's just -- it's an appropriate time for them to spin this off.</p><p>FRANCIS: But even the cash 3Com could raise in an IPO, analysts say as much as $1 billion, won't necessarily fix 3Com.  3Com stock peaked in late 1996 at over $81 a share.  Since then, 3Com has lost almost two-thirds of its value.  The culprit?  Much of its revenue comes from slower growth products like cards that hook personal computers up to networks.  Intel entered that market and slashed prices.</p><p>MARTIN PYYKKONEN, CIBC WORLD MARKETS: I'm not meaning that I'm optimistic in terms of what they can do in terms of their revenue growth in the existing business, but, you know, there's a day of reckoning where they really have to try to reinvest for growth.  But it's going to be tough.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: For those that think that that day of reckoning will come in a merger, 3Com's CEO, Eric Benhamou, says the company's strategy is to remain independent.  But, Stuart, as today's news shows, strategies change.</p><p>VARNEY: Do they not indeed.  Bruce Francis, thank you.</p><p>And by the way, later on MONEYLINE, we will speak with the CEO of 3Com, Eric Bienhamou.</p><p>BAY: In tonight's \"MONEYLINE Movers,\" IDEC Pharmaceuticals surged more than 14 on an upgrade from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. The stock came under pressure last week on concerns about sales of one of its anti-cancer treatments.</p><p>Ziff-Davis up nearly one 1 1/4.  The computer trade magazine and online publisher denies reports it's considering a takeover offer from News Corp.</p><p>Watson Pharmaceuticals tumbled 3 1/4.  A court has blocked sales of its gum to help quit smoking, a ruling that will wipe $10 million off the bottom line.</p><p>And Hitachi jumped 7 1/2.  Morgan Stanley Dean Witter upgraded the Japanese electronics maker because of its strong chip sales.</p><p>VARNEY: Now one of the biggest losers on the Big Board: Motorola.  The stock plunged eight -- more than eight points.  In fact, that's about 10 percent -- on a report that it is in talks to buy General Instruments.  The price there is roughly $10 billion. Shares of General Instruments, which is the leading maker of cable TV set boxes, also fell, down more than 2 3/4 points.</p><p>As Steve Young reports, it's Motorola's first big move after a huge restructuring.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Motorola, the maker of cell phones, two-way radios, pagers and business electronic equipment, is ready for growth after tough times.  Just a year ago, the company suspended work on its biggest investment ever, a $3 billion advanced chip plant, because of a worldwide slowdown in chip demand.</p><p>MONA ERAIBA, GRUNTAL &amp; CO.: Now they are in the position to really construct alliances, have partnerships whether through just a partnership or acquisition.  It's a changed company and in a changed market. YOUNG: A company whose stock has climbed nearly 50 percent this year.  To get there, Motorola had to do some painful downsizing to get costs into line.  The company last year cut its workforce by about 24,000 employees, took a staggering one-time charge of nearly $2 billion, and, as a result, improved its profits by more than $1 billion a year.</p><p>The company's $2.2 billion investment in the bankrupt satellite communications system Iridium is one of the few lingering problems. Motorola says it expects Iridium to survive and won't be jolted if it doesn't.</p><p>Analysts say General Instrument would fit well with Motorola. It's already invested in cable-modem technology, which will benefit from broadband connections controlled by General Instrument boxes..</p><p>DAVID POWERS, EDWARD JONES: If you look in technology right now, one of the fastest growing areas over the next several year is going to be for broadband access.  And certainly cable is going to have a large role in that process.</p><p>YOUNG: Motorola stock was walloped after news of the pending deal got out, but analysts say that reaction ignored General Instrument's broadband potential.</p><p>ERAIBA: A lot of people are really making a judgment on the acquisition based on history rather than the future opportunities.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YOUNG: Motorola has wanted to enter the home entertainment business, and if it acquires General Instrument there's one thing analysts today said you can be sure of: playing on the better-known brand, the set-top boxes will carry the Motorola name -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Steve.  Steve Young reporting.</p><p>One of the biggest names in computers today dismissed the idea that Y2K would hurt his business.  Michael Dell today told Reuters, after speaking at an Internet conference in Paris, that he expects no slowdown in sales of Dell computers as companies scramble to avoid the millennium bug.  Rather, Dell's chief executive predicts a very healthy second half of the year.</p><p>VARNEY: Now, still ahead on MONEYLINE, the battle over farming's genetic future.</p><p>BAY: It is going to court with billions at stake.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: In California tonight, news of a huge drop in cigarette sales.  New state figures show cigarette purchases down a full 30 percent in the first half of this year.  Officials say that higher state taxes and an increase in tobacco prices are at least partly responsible for that decrease.  But they also believe some smokers are buying out of state, of course, to dodge those higher taxes.</p><p>BAY: A multi-billion dollar antitrust battle shaping up tonight for the world's biotech giants.  Two U.S. economic and farm groups say they'll file suit in November, claiming the firms use bioengineering techniques to lock up agricultural markets.  Among the companies they are challenging: Monsanto, Dupont and Novartis.</p><p>Kelli Arena reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Farmers around the world say they're growing more hostile toward an industry they say is exercising too much control.</p><p>AARON BUTLER, FARMER: I think the motive is pure and simple profit.  I mean, I think it's the ultimate example of greed.</p><p>ARENA: There are a handful of companies which produce the seed used to grow most genetically modified crops, an estimated $10 billion market, and growing.  They include Monsanto, Novartis, Astrazeneca, Dupont and the soon-to-be-formed Aventis.  All five are targets in planned antitrust suits being brought by farmers joined by two distinctly different Washington groups: the Family Farm Coalition, which supports small farmers, and the Foundation on Economic Trends, run by a biotech activist.</p><p>MICHAEL HAUSFELD, PLAINTIFFS' ATTORNEY: What the companies are doing are imposing restrictive conditions on the seed.  They're either selling it to the farmer and saying to the farmer, you can only purchase this seed for one year, and at the end of the year, you are prohibited from collecting that seed and using it in next year's harvest, and if you do, we'll sue you for it.</p><p>ARENA: While not being able to reuse seed is financially hard on farmers, it's not necessarily a violation of antitrust laws.</p><p>KEVIN ARQUITT, ROGERS &amp; WELLS: If they're simply accused of restricting the use of their intellectual property, it's hard to imagine how an antitrust case could succeed.</p><p>ARENA: What's more, analysts say healthy competition exists, further undercutting the antitrust argument.</p><p>WILLIAM YOUNG, DONALDSON, LUFKIN &amp; JENRETTE: During the past year, the price of seed either came down or the farmer was offered a special financing tool by the seed companies so that each one had a chance to gain market share.  Of course, they can't all gain market share, but it shows you that it's a very competitive environment.</p><p>ARENA: The companies will have more to say once the suit is filed, probably within the next two months.</p><p>(on camera): This all comes at a sensitive time for the genetic farming industry, which is facing growing consumer and political resistance.  Even so, analysts say the industry represents the future, and predict the companies are strong enough to weather this new storm.</p><p>Kelli Arena, CNN Financial News, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: And turning now to a country with a leading edge on Internet growth -- tomorrow's edition of \"The Financial Times\" says China is warning off overseas companies who want to invest in the country's burgeoning Internet business.  \"The Times\" says it is still unclear how this will affect China.com, which went public in July, and other Chinese Internet content providers.</p><p>BAY: MONEYLINE will return in just a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: And before we wrap up this half hour, an after-the-bell deal to tell you about.  Solectron, that's an electronics maker, is buying Smart Modular Technologies for about $2 billion in stock. Smart Modular is a computer memory developer and will become a major part of Solectron's new technology solutions unit.  Solectron shares tumbled more than $3 from the New York Stock Exchange close.</p><p>BAY: Coming up on THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR, what's behind the dollar's relentless decline against the yen?</p><p>VARNEY: And those fickle technology investors at it again.  The Nasdaq pulls back from Friday's all-time high.</p><p>BAY: And the latest twist in a high-stakes divorce case.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: The MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR continues.  Here again, Stuart Varney and Willow Bay.</p><p>BAY: In tonight's headlines, the world watches as the dollar sinks to new depths against the Japanese yen: a temporary blip or a troubling trend.  An IPO for the gadget you can't live without: the Palm Pilot.  3Com is spinning it off.  We'll find out why from the company's chief executive.</p><p>And the divorce battle that has New York and the rest of the business world buzzing: Duff versus Perelman.</p><p>VARNEY: But tonight, we begin on Wall Street with the sudden U- turn in technology stocks.  The Nasdaq composite reversed Friday's record-setting rally, tumbling 42 points, close to 1 1/2 percent, to finish at 2,844 on volume of almost 1 billion shares.</p><p>The Dow industrials, however, managed to bounce back from a 46- point deficit, closing up slightly at 11,030.  The volume on the big board, just 657 million shares. One big winner: International Paper, up 2 1/2 -- that on a favorable industry report.  Still, there were many more losers. Declining issues outpaced winners by a margin of nearly three to two. There were 70 stocks that climbed to 52-week highs, but 148 tumbled to new lows.</p><p>BAY: Today's big loser is one of the most celebrated tech stocks: America Online.  AOL stock lost more than six today, erasing almost $7 billion of the company's market cap: that after an article in \"Barron's\" over the weekend quoted a hedge fund manager worried about price pressures, subscriber growth and insider selling.</p><p>It has certainly been a dark few months for AOL investors.  Since hitting a high in April, the stock has lost almost half its value and wiped out much of its gains for the year.  Other Internet stocks today followed suit, with eBay, Amazon.com, CMGI, Yahoo! and Inktomi all heading south.</p><p>And as we told you, it was a losing day for other big tech names. Microsoft, Intel and Dell pulled down the Nasdaq composite.  And on the big board, Gateway fell 1 1/2.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, but the real drama today was in fact in the currency markets, with the relentless selloff of the dollar.  The buck continued to dive against the Japanese yen, to levels not seen since 1996.  But unlike last week, Japan didn't intervene to stop the yen's rapid rise.</p><p>Bill Dorman has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL DORMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If you believe the currency markets, Japan's economy may be on the comeback trail, driving the yen to its highest level against the dollar in more than three years.  It's all about capital flows: money going where investors detect the best chances for higher returns.  Right now, that's Japan.</p><p>Over the last two months, the dollar has lost 13 percent of its value against the yen.  So far, that has not pushed Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to intervene in the markets.</p><p>MAUREEN MCFARLAND, MAINSTAY FUNDS, MACKAY SHIELDS: If we were to break through 100 yen to the dollar, we could actually start to see Summers start at least having some verbal intervention that enough is enough and we don't want the yen to continue to strengthen so dramatically.</p><p>DORMAN: Summers has maintained the strong dollar policy of his predecessor, Robert Rubin, but some traders are eager to test that policy.  While still in his professorial days at Harvard, Summers wrote that a strong dollar may not always serve the national interest. For U.S.  exporters, a weaker dollar over time means higher profits from overseas.  But as the dollar weakens, inflation here in the United States will rise.  And a lower dollar may discourage some overseas investors from holding U.S.  assets, such as bonds.</p><p>But even those who watch currencies for a living warn against reading too much into short-term moves in the dollar/yen relationship.</p><p>MARC CHANDLER, MELLON BANK: We saw the Nasdaq market make record highs on Friday as the dollar was falling to three-year lows.  So I think the relationship between the U.S. stock market, U.S. asset prices in general and the dollar is still really tenuous.</p><p>DORMAN: The dollar is also holding up relatively well against the euro.</p><p>(on camera): A weaker dollar against the yen by itself should not cripple the stock market.  But a dollar that stays weak will add to market worries, starting with inflation.</p><p>Bill Dorman, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: Now, the dollar's decline against the yen today was swift indeed: the greenback down more than two yen, one of the worst single-day drops in the past year.  It was down slightly against the euro, up a little against the British pound.</p><p>BAY: Another milestone today for the oil market.  Prices hit $24 a barrel and kept going on hopes that oil-producing countries will keep a lid on supplies.  In New York trading, light sweet crude jumped 66 cents to $24.21 a barrel.  The last time oil went for more than $24 a barrel was January of 1997.</p><p>Meanwhile, the dollar's slump continues to weigh on bond prices. The 30-year Treasury down 5/32 in price, the yield moving up to 6.04 percent.</p><p>VARNEY: Here now to help us put the markets into perspective is Mansoor Ijaz.  He's the chairman of Crescent Investment Management, where he runs a hedge fund that's done rather well betting against the dollar.</p><p>Mansoor, many thanks for joining us here on MONEYLINE.</p><p>MANSOOR IJAZ, CHAIRMAN, CRESCENT INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT: Good to see you again, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Do you believe that the dollar will continue to fall against the Japanese yen?</p><p>IJAZ: Yes, I do.  I think you'll certainly see it test a 100 yen in the not-too-distant future.</p><p>VARNEY: Now, as a manager of money in America, does that continuing dollar decline worry you, trouble you about America's stock market?</p><p>IJAZ: Not yet.  I think you have to keep in mind that probably some of the thinking in Washington goes like the -- as follows: And that is that Japan's import pattern has to be altered for the long term if Asia's recovery is to stay intact.</p><p>As we all know, during the past 3 1/2 to four years, Asia has had quite a bit of difficulty based on the rise and the fall of the yen. And one fact that we have to keep in mind is that every time the yen rises 1 percent -- and I'm talking about now the yen versus the dollar -- you can have an increase in the growth -- GDP growth of Taiwan and countries like Korea of almost 25 basis points.  So certainly, the rise of the yen, if it were to stay where it is right now, would encourage a significant increase in the growth patterns for the Asian economies that were hit very hard in the 1996-1997 period.</p><p>VARNEY: But as far America is concerned, presumably this lower dollar is quite a significant first test for the new treasury secretary, Larry Summers.  What do you think he's going to do about it?</p><p>IJAZ: Well, this is an interesting part of the equation. There's where the political economy gets matched in with the raw mathematical calculations that traders and money managers do.</p><p>Clearly, Mr. Summers is intellectually capable of understanding the implications of a strong yen.  But where Mr. Rubin, his predecessor, was from the trading world and people knew his capabilities as a trader and understood that he knew our moves and knew how we would think about things as well as he did -- as well as we did, I think Mr. Summers probably doesn't have the same experience as far as markets are concerned.</p><p>So as a money manager, you definitely want to try and test the metal of a central banker or a treasury secretary that has such an important responsibility within the G-7 framework.</p><p>VARNEY: Mansoor, let me wrap it up, 10 seconds left.  You do think the dollar is going to fall below 100 yen, correct?</p><p>IJAZ: I think it will definitely challenge 100 yen, and I think you'll see Mr. Summers' metal challenged in the process.</p><p>VARNEY: Well-said, indeed.  Mansoor Ijaz, chairman of Crescent Investment Management, joining us here.  Thanks very much, Mansoor.</p><p>IJAZ: Good to see you again.</p><p>BAY: Just ahead on MONEYLINE, rival suitors become merger partners.  We'll tell you about the latest takeover talk in telecom.</p><p>VARNEY: And investors turn cold on a once-hot telecom stock. But are the fears about Qualcomm justified?  That story's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Here are some of today's big stock movers: Qualcomm skidded more than 12 1/4.  The digital and wireless communications provider pulled out of SG Cowen's annual tech conference this morning.  The company blamed a scheduling conflict, but it reignited speculation Qualcomm will not meet earnings expectations.</p><p>Those concerns have rattled the stock.  It's down 20 percent since the beginning of the month.</p><p>One of the most active stocks on the Nasdaq, Global Telesystems tumbled nearly 5 1/2.  Several Wall Street firms cut earnings estimates for the telecom firm, citing increased competition overseas. Thestreet.com, up nearly 6.  The venture capital arm of Chase Manhattan invested $17 million in Thestreet.com's new British financial news Web site.</p><p>And Eastman Kodak added 2 7/8.  CS First Boston repeated a strong buy rating on the stock, on strength in Kodak's digital product line.</p><p>VARNEY: Here's a switch.  A hostile takeover battle turns friendly after a two-month standoff.  French oil companies Totalfina and Elf Aquitaine have agreed to merge in a $54 billion deal. Totalfina offering 19 of its shares for 13 Elf shares.  The deal will create the fourth largest oil group in the world.  In U.S. trading, shares of Elf jumped more than 3 points today; Totalfina, down 5/8. By the way, today's merger marks the third biggest oil deal in history, right behind Exxon-Mobil and BP Amoco.</p><p>BAY: Bell Atlantic could get a major boost.  The largest of the baby bells confirms it is in talks to combine its wireless operation with Vodaphone.</p><p>And as Fred Katayama reports, the new combination could prove to be a strong competitor to AT&amp;T.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Bell Atlantic is trying to hook up with a company it once lost in a battle with Vodafone: Airtouch.  It's discussing a joint venture that would unite Vodafone Airtouch's big U.S. wireless network with its own.</p><p>MICHAEL BALHOFF, LEGG MASON: Ultimately, the companies that have done better in wireless here in the United States have been companies that have been able to offer to consumers a national footprint.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Bell Atlantic is strong in the East, with more than 7 million wireless subscribers.  A pending merger with GTE would add another 5 million.  Vodafone Airtouch is powerful in the West, with 9 million subscribers.  A joint venture would make it by far the largest U.S.  wireless operator, with more than twice the number of users of leader, AT&amp;T.</p><p>Giving users nationwide access is becoming increasingly important, especially for business users, so that subscribers can avoid roaming charges and companies can offer cheap flat-rate calling plans.  Wall Street indicated its approval of the merger talks, lifting shares of both companies.  Analysts say regulators would bless a venture, since it has given the green light to other big telecom combinations like MCI-WorldCom and SBC PacBell. ERIC STRUMINGHER, PAINEWEBBER: I don't see any deal killing regulatory impediment.  This is a deal that regulators should like. There are some issues that will have to be looked at on a market-by- market basis.</p><p>KATAYAMA (on camera): Neither company would comment on reports that the boards of both sides would meet tomorrow to discuss the venture.  Bell Atlantic would only say no timetable has been set for the talks.</p><p>Fred Katayama, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Investors were enthusiastic about the possibility.  Shares of Vodaphone-Airtouch up 10 3/4; Bell Atlantic gaining 1 3/4.</p><p>VARNEY: Motorola took a hit today on reports that it's in negotiations to acquire General Instrument, cable's leading maker of set-top boxes.  Neither company would comment on a deal said to be worth some $10 billion.  Motorola tanked 8 3/8, or more than 10 percent, on fears that the purchase would dilute earnings.  General Instrument was also down by nearly 3 points.  There was backlash from the report.  Broadcom's stock fell more than 9 points on fears that the chip maker will lose business from its No. 1 customer, General Instrument.  But a rival set-top box maker, Scientific Atlanta, rose more than $2.50 on all that takeover talk.</p><p>BAY: Checking some of today's other corporate headlines: Hershey Foods issuing another profit warning.  The candy company says 1999 results could fall 8 percent to 10 percent below forecasts, with most of the damage showing up in the third quarter.  LVMH adding timepieces to its luxury line of products.  Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer accepting a $745 million cash bid from the French conglomerate.  In U.S. trading, shares of LVMH losing more than $1; Tag Heuer up more than 1/2.  LaidLaw wants to focus just on buses.  North America's largest school bus company plans to sell its U.S. health-care units and its stake in Safety-Kleen Corporation.  The moves are expected to fetch over $2 billion.</p><p>VARNEY: Now when MONEYLINE returns, 3Com plans to put its trademark product in the hands of the public.</p><p>BAY: We will talk to the company's chief executive, Eric Benhamou, that's next.  You're watching MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's MONEYLINE \"Focus\": 3Com.  The company today announced it was spinning off the unit that makes its popular handheld computers, the Palm Pilots.  3Com plans to sell 20 percent of the business to the public in an IPO early next year, and may eventually sell more.  Despite the Palm Pilot's success, 3Com's stock price is lagging, losing almost half its value from its 52-week high.  Joining us now, the company's chief executive, Eric Benhamou.  Mr. Benhamou, welcome to MONEYLINE. ERIC BENHAMOU, CEO, 3COM: Thank you.</p><p>BAY: So is this a strategy shift, or a pretty effective way to take advantage of a hot IPO market?</p><p>BENHAMOU: There's certainly no strategy shift.  There has been all along a plan to create a thriving business in the field of handheld computing, and it's essential to a networking strategy as well.</p><p>BAY: So why is 3Com better off spinning off Palm Pilot?</p><p>BENHAMOU: Well there are several reasons.  The largest of which is the fact that the market opportunity for handheld computing has dramatically expanded over the last year into new directions.  For example, the direction of licensing the operating system to a proliferation of new devices that will be handheld.  The opportunity to also create services, wireline and wireless services for handheld access.</p><p>BAY: Now who would be creating those services?  Would it be the Palm Pilot spinoff or would it be 3Com?</p><p>BENHAMOU: It would be certainly the handheld computing company. So all of these new segments are appearing in the handheld space.  It is to be able to best position ourselves to take advantage of the services, that we came to the conclusion that a structure of a publically traded independent company would be optimal.</p><p>BAY: But what about 3Com?  What about the business that's left? In other words, if you're spinning off this high-growth unit, what's left to deliver that kind of growth potential to your investors?</p><p>BENHAMOU: 3Com the networking company benefits immediately from this move by virtue of the clarity of focus that it brings to a networking business.  You wouldn't believe how many times as of late 3Com was introduced as the maker of the Palm Pilot, ignoring 90 percent of what we do.  So clearly the brand 3Com will become much more synonymous with connectivity without having to refer to handheld. In addition to this, the management bandwidth assigned to networking will expand by virtue of having a dedicated team running the palm business.</p><p>BAY: You have been handicapped by some slow-growing businesses. Now that you have this ability to focus after spinning off Palm Pilot, where do you expect the growth to come from?</p><p>BENHAMOU: The slow businesses you're referring to happen to be related to two of all of those product lines, namely analog modems and network interface card connectivity.  We have been hard at work for the last 69 months transforming the niche of our business, emphasizing new areas of growth, particularly in the area of land telephony, in the areas of like voice-over IP, the ability to carry voice traffic on IP infrastructure for carriers, wireless access, as well as broadband access.  There are several high-growth areas on which we intend to focus. BAY: And you're confident that this is going to deliver the kind of growth that you will see reflected in your stock price?</p><p>BENHAMOU: We know that we have great opportunities.  And if we execute well, the opportunity on the networking side of the business is just as attractive as on the handheld side of the business.</p><p>BAY: Eric Benhamou of 3Com, thanks for joining us tonight on MONEYLINE.</p><p>BENHAMOU: Thank you.</p><p>BAY: Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Ahead on MONEYLINE, all's fair in love and divorce wars. The ugly custody battle between Revlon's Ron Perelman and his ex-wife.</p><p>That's next on MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: A story tonight about a corporate titan involved in a very messy and very public divorce.  The custody battle involving Revlon's Ron Perelman continued today in a New York courtroom with testimony from his ex-wife.  Their fight gives a rare glimpse inside the world of the super wealthy.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank looks at the case of a little girl at the heart of a big-money battle.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Patricia Duff, the former wife of the Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, says her 4-year-old daughter needs a million and a half dollars a year to support the lifestyle her mother wants for her.</p><p>Duff was married to Perelman, often regarded as New York's richest man, for less than two years.  Now they are locked in a bitter court fight over their daughter, who shuttles between the two.</p><p>PATRICIA DUFF: This is just to try to provide for Caleigh some reasonable lifestyle so that she is not -- she has a wonderful life of yachts and private jets and helicopters with her father.  And obviously we're not asking for anything remotely resembling that, but something resembling a normal Upper East Side kind of upbringing for a child of privilege, which is what she is.</p><p>FRANK: Perelman's net worth is estimated at somewhere between $4 billion to $6 six billion.  But Duff's not poor, either.  She says she is worth $23 million.</p><p>The divorce, however, seems to have boosted Duff's assets. Perelman says he has given his former wife cash, jewelry, property and art work worth an estimated $30 million.  So far, Perelman says he paid another $300,000 to look after Caleigh for her education, health care, nannies, camp and $12,000 a month in child support.</p><p>But Duff is asking the court for between $108,000 and $131,000 a month for Caleigh's support, in addition to renovations on a possible new home in East Hampton, Long Island, which came up in today's testimony.</p><p>In court, Perelman's lawyer attacked what she called Duff's \"fantasy budget,\" that includes $120,000 a year for travel, $60,000 a year for a nanny, and more than $1.5 million in one-time redecorating costs.</p><p>State Supreme Court Justice Franklin Weissberg allowed Duff to testify about her daughter's potential future needs, but said there were clearly items that may not be covered by child support.</p><p>(on camera): This saga is far from over.  There are more child support hearings, more child custody hearings, and even a suit about the prenuptial agreement, even though the divorce is final.</p><p>As the judge said today, if the lawyers would just stop bickering with one another, the case might be over in his lifetime.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank, CNN financial news. New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: You know, as interesting as it maybe to read about figures like that and the twists and turns in a story like that, you just can't help but feel terribly for that child to have this tragically played out in the headlines.</p><p>VARNEY: I agree entirely.</p><p>BAY: It's grossly unfair to her.</p><p>VARNEY: Don't get me started.</p><p>BAY: OK, I won't.</p><p>Up next, \"Ahead of the Curve,\" some of what you need to know tonight before the markets open tomorrow.</p><p>VARNEY: You're watching MONEYLINE.  We'll be right back.</p><p>BAY: I won't get you going there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Here's some of what could move the markets tomorrow.</p><p>The government releases its latest report on retail sales.</p><p>Oracle will report earnings after the bell.  The consensus estimate is for profits of 16 cents a share.</p><p>Best Buy will also report results.  The stock has been suffering lately, down nearly 25 percent in two months.</p><p>And keep an eye on shares of Solectron.  The electronics maker is buying Smart Modular for $2 billion in stock.</p><p>VARNEY: In stock.</p><p>BAY: Exactly.</p><p>Well that is MONEYLINE for this Monday.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. We are taking a look at the markets this morning after yesterday's flash freeze at the NASDAQ, it's been a fairly flat morning today. We currently got future is in the red, Dow futures are down about 15, we've got the S&amp;P down about one point, the NASDAQ is down about a quarter of a point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Looking over at oil and gold, those are in the green this morning, we've got oil up about $0.16 cents, gold is up almost $4. Looking at Asia, those markets finished today mixed and for all the details on how they got there, let's go to business reporter Jacqueline Maddock in Beijing. Hi, Jacqueline.</p><p/><p>JACQUELINE MADDOCK, BUSINESS REPORTER: Hi, Diane. Yes. It was a bit of a mixed results here for Friday afternoon, here in the mainland and also in Hong Kong. Markets lost ground throughout the afternoon largely because of some pretty disappointing corporate results particularly from Everbright Security if you remember that, the brokerage firm responsible for last Friday's fat-finger fiasco and it was the banks did the biggest falls today, that whispers that the PBO is preparing to unleash the new regulations on China's banking sector, China merchant banks down more than three percent.</p><p/><p>But as you say, a different story in Japan, the Nikkei climbed Diane, more than two percent, and every markets that day indeed in the green which is a -- and that was as the yen moved up to the 99 point level accept the Tepco, Diane. Obviously Tepco, the Fukushima nuclear plant operator -- Tepco, fell another five percent at it looks that though as contamination leak has -- some way to play out (INAUDIBLE). Across to Australia though there where markets climbed almost four percent still running high on China's PMI numbers from yesterday, results of stocks love to see signs that China's economy is getting back on track -- Diane.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right. Jacqueline Maddock from Beijing. Thanks, Jacqueline.</p><p/><p>And now, for a look at the European markets, let's go live to London where Jan Lambregts, global head of financial markets research at Rabobank is now joining us. Jan, we saw some positive second quarter GDP reports from the UK and Germany confirmed by the follow-up reading. Any surprise there, and why aren't markets having more reaction to that?</p><p/><p>It looks like we just lost Jan. We will try to get him back in a second but let's take a look at the European markets. You can see London up about 16, Parris is down about 12, Frankfurt up about three. Again, those positive GDP report possibly being mitigated by a little un-eased there over the NASDAQ freeze. But let's take a look at some of the important economic news we'll be looking forward to and one of them is a big meeting coming up, some of the most important economic figures in the world are gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the Kansas City Fed's annual conference but one difference is here, is that the biggest figure of the mall, Fed Chairman Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>won't be attending due to a scheduling conflict.</p><p/><p>The main focus of the conference will be the impact of the Fed's unconventional policies both at home and abroad and FOX Business's Peter Barnes is there. He will have reports for us throughout the morning.</p><p/><p>And we've got Jan Lambregts back again, global head of financial markets research at Rabobank. Jan, I'm not sure if you heard my question the first-time, but we're looking at these GDP reports from the UK and Germany both coming in positive. Any big surprise here?</p><p/><p>JAN LAMBREGTS, RABOBANK FINANCIAL MARKETS RESEARCH: Not really. And I don't think the markets really watching it too closely, second revisions, it adds to the general trend that things are a little bit better in Europe but still not great. I think a lot of people in the market can be watching more of these headlines coming out of Jackson Hole and thinking what that would mean for, for tapering than watching these GDP figures.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Markets still seem a little tentative today. You know, good GDP information and yet, they're fairly flat. Paris is even down. Are people tentative this morning over what happened at the NASDAQ yesterday?</p><p/><p>LAMBREGTS: I don't think that is not necessarily overshadowing. Like I said, I think the more tentative reacting to positive GDP which is a fairly old number, second quarters after all, more worried that had lines later today as more news comes from Jackson Hole, actually shift perceptions in how likely tapering is and how much tapering is we will see in September.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right. It's all about stimulus, Jan Lambregts at Rabobank. We appreciate it. Thanks.</p><p/><p>LAMBREGTS: You're welcome.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: And the Wall Street Journal says, federal prosecutors are turning up the pressure in an insider-trading case against the former portfolio manager at SAC Capital. A new indictment unsealed yesterday alleges that Matthew Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an Alzheimer's drug trial at the heart of the case. Martoma is accused of using insider information about results of that drug trial to allow SAC Capital to make $275 million in profits. He is due to go on trial in November and a hearing is set for this morning.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business giving you the power to prosper.</p><p/><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, Doug Chrispin (ph), he's a -- but he's a local rancher and he's doing all kinds of stuff, he won the New Mexico, may it's a national bow and arrow contest that I told you about Mike, from Texas, bans all these -- here. So he says to me, you know, it took awhile for Delbert McClinton to catch on in Austin. All right.</p><p/><p>I said, who's -- they found that of course. So he says who is better? Name one person who is better in Austin than Delbert McClinton? He said, there are lots of people. I said what? I didn't have my gun with me, fortunately.</p><p/><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Thank God. Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He said Omar and the Howlers.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: Oh, those guys.</p><p/><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: Oh, yes.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Omar and the Howlers?</p><p/><p>IMUS: I said, Omar and the Howlers?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Sure.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, we were at the horse barn, up at the horse barn. So, I got in the truck and went back to the house and go to iTunes.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And listened to Omar and the Howlers.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Uh-huh.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And they suck.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Hey, Omar.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I thought he was kidding.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: He said, Omar --</p><p/><p>IMUS: And then he is a big Joe Walsh fan. You know? I said, well, have you seen that Eagles? Didn't have any interest. Do you like the Eagles? He said they are all right. So when I first heard the Eagles, sounded like a cross between the Beach Boys and the four perhaps.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh-oh!</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: You got to carry that gun at all times.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, be ready.</p><p/><p>IMUS: The only place I don't carry it is on the ranch for some reason.</p><p/><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: Omar and the Howlers?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Omar and the Howlers?</p><p/><p>RUFINO: I'm probably the only person who knew that band that you just mentioned.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Yes. I played that band in college.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, you did.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: -- Back in school and they still together barely alive.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, they may not, he is going back years, so.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Omar and the Howlers.</p><p/><p>GUNZELMAN: This guy is crazy.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That is insane, didn't he?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Lunacy.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Paul Begala is coming up this morning. We no longer need him, so.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's not right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: One of my new best friends, one of them, is Bill Powers, the president of U.T., the University of Texas. So, I better not blow of Begala just yet. You know? And Tom Friedman. Hey, Warner?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Who won those little league world series games?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Tijuana beat Panama. So, Tijuana, they will now play Tokyo for the international championship and the Westport Washington State game was rained out. So, they will play today at 3:00.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: And the winner will play Chula Vista for the title on Sunday.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And the winner of that will play either Tijuana or Tokyo.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Probably.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Which is it? Tijuana or --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, Tijuana beat Panama. So, Tijuana will play Tokyo.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That is what I just said.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's right.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: We got it, yes.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes. We had some other stories too.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What are they?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, the umpire, they blew a call in the Yankee game which is going to fit right in with next year's videotape replay. They messed up a caught ball and called it a trap and we have got Ryan Braun, what a phony, man. Instead of --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're kidding, Warner.</p><p/><p>WOLF: He comes out --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Hey, Tom, should we have a breaking news thing up on the FOX NewsChannel, the business channel?</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's right. This just in. But the way he did it, he apologize that he made a mistake, but it was issued in a statement. I mean, he didn't even have the, you know, guts to stand up and faced the press. Really weak. And the other thing, you had two exhibition football games last night. And finally we are going to hear about Jeremy Lin, cut out the whining. Remember him? Jeremy Lin.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, of course.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Today is his birthday.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Oh, it is?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes. He's 25 today.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, maybe give him some slack.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Jay Mohr, of the funnier people on the planet is 43 today. OK.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Happy Birthday.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And Dagen McDowell is not here again.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: She's out again, yes.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, man.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, I said, well, she said she can't put anything on her face. How about a paper bag?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, she did. You went there. It wasn't funny.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And there is something here we don't know. I don't know what it is. But man, there is something here. Hey, what happened to the NASDAQ yesterday?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes. It was a mess with the computers, they don't know 100 percent what happened but they had to halt the number, all the stocks that trade on it and the middle of the day, it went down for hours which is odd, Wall Street has had a number of computer problems the last few years but there is a report this morning, there may have been some connectivity issues with another exchange so they continue their investigation. No panic.</p><p/><p>IMUS: NASDAQ stocks.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, no panic on the market though. You know?</p><p/><p>IMUS: You want to get listed on the NASDAQ, you can't get on the big one. Right?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: No. That's Apple and all these big tech companies if you're over on the NASDAQ, Google, Microsoft.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, they are?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, so.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I have been to see Cavuto yesterday, he looks great. You know, that?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sometimes he needs to take good care of himself as he should. But man, he looks terrific. He is really good. You know who else is pretty good is that Charles Payne guy.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Charles Payne, yes, absolutely, good guy. Yep.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: No pain, no gain.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What is coming up with you, Bernie?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Sydney Leathers.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh God.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. Well, this is true. She made a porn tape.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, please.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: .called Weiner and me but that is not where this stops. She very well may have exposed herself to HIV.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh, wow!</p><p/><p>IMUS: Not amusing. That is your hilarious Bernie briefing this morning?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: I was not presenting that as a joke.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: No punch-line there.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That's a story. You remember that kid that gave the rousing speech at Georgia tech?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, yes.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well, he may have ripped it off from somebody. And he was interviewed by your friend Neil Cavuto yesterday. We have little piece of that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Cavuto is -- all over him, just the -- it was great. But he may not be for real.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Rob Bartlett and Tony Powell are both here this morning. They're both appearing places. Rob is going to be at the Leavitt Theater in Ogunquit, Maine.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Ogunquit.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes. September 21st. For tickets, go to Robshow.com. And Tony Powell, Powell to the People, he will be appearing at the Belmar Theater on Saturday, September 28th. That is coming up here pretty soon and you can get tickets to that by either calling that theater there. The Belmar Theater, or go to NewYorkentertainmentclub.com. I guess, he gets stuff there. It is 13 after the hour, let's do some news. And here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Hey, good morning, I-man. The number of refugees created by the Syrian civil war has not topped one million, a million refugees and a U.N. agency adding to that says 740,000 of them are children under age 11. So, some numbers, it all comes out as we are seeing new pictures of what the rebels claim are another chemical weapons attack.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And this is the fourteenth time that the central regime uses chemical weapons against innocent civilians and each time we've asked and we've said that the international community does not move this, the regime will enlarge the scale that use these chemical weapons.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: And the U.N. secretary-general did say today, these claims of chemical weapons must be investigated immediately. We also have reports this morning coming in of Israeli airstrikes just south of Beirut said to be a response to four rockets that were fired yesterday into Israel. Back here at home, you mention the problems on Wall Street yesterday, computer problems at the NASDAQ, trading stocks listed there. The Apples and the Google of the world, a lot of big tech names were halted in the middle of the day because of problems with the system that disseminates quotes.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Is it going to affect the way that they look at individual companies and want to invest in companies for 10, 15 or 20 years? No. It will just going to say that this game is not really being played.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Jonathan Kurpido (ph) works at the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Now, to get more on that, this web site All Things D is reporting this morning. NASDAQ thinks the issue may be a problem with connectivity at a rival exchange.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What does that mean?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: This another digital exchange, NYSCR by the way, the New York Stock Exchange digital component that there may have been problems with the two exchanges connecting with one another. Apparently, according to this report, and they are basically saying --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Each other by the way. But go ahead.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: You are right. May say, more on this later on but I don't know exactly what the --</p><p/><p>IMUS: How do we know it wasn't deliberate?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Sabotage.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well, there all these rumors going around yesterday, and it's where the NASDAQ was not really that transparent about it, didn't talk about it during the day, it's hard to get all of them, there are no comments and then the rumors, what if there was a cyber attack and all this kind of thing. That is what people were worried about.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, the Russians.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: But no evidence of that at all and now they're saying that could have been the exchanges, digital exchanges having trouble connecting with each other but --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Everybody is lying.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Probably.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Don't you think?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well, the thing, you know, I thought there was sort of reassuring about it is, that the markets, not like the market -- or crashed yesterday on this when people, you know, wasn't that many jitters.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: The Dow was actually up. The NASDAQ ended up. So, you know, got through it. And they've been computer problems in the past. The last big one I guess was like three years ago. Although, the NASDAQ had big time issue about Facebook IPO. You may remember.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes. That was a mess. But this, we will see. The investigation continues and we will get more on it later today, exactly what happened, so.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, yes, great.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well, from Washington --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sixteen after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Connell continues.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well, you'll going to start hearing talk about a possible government shutdown again. I know you will be looking forward to that. More than a third of House Republicans urging the Speaker John Boehner to shut down the government rather than fund the president's health-care law. They sent him a letter on that 80 Republicans yesterday.</p><p/><p>And then we have this U.S. soldier who killed 16 civilians in Afghanistan last year, he apologized yesterday for the first time for what he called his act of cowardice. The Staff Sergeant Robert Bales is in the middle of a sentencing hearing. Here is Marc Edwards, he's a friend of his who used to play in the NFL, this guy Marc Edwards, he spoke with reporters.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MARC EDWARDS, FORMER NFL PLAYER: The person I knew a long time ago has changed quite a bit, the experience that he's had over there. I am not in a position to understand. None of us are.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: None of us are, he says. Well, the sentencing hearing will continue there. And there's no --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Why are you repeating what the people are saying?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: I just thought it was a little fuzzy.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sounds like Conan O'Brien.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program sponsored by Hackensack University Medical Center, a place where medicine meets innovation. What were you saying now?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well, no verdict for the Fort Hood shooter. That continues deliberations yesterday. And the final thing in the news is Bradley Manning who we talked about a lot in the show yesterday. He says, he felt that he has been a female since childhood and he wants people to refer to him as Chelsea. So, this is the convicted Wiki leaker so to speak. Back in forth, Leavenworth begin serving 35 years in a military prison.</p><p/><p>Now, a military spokesman said, if Bradley wants to change his name to Chelsea, a name change would have to be approved in court, then a petition submitted to the army to make it official. So, that's where we are on all that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: The Godfather will have some thoughts on Bradley Manning and his wishes coming up here in just a little bit. This moment is also sponsored by the Hackensack University Medical Center, a place where medicine meets innovation, the home of the Deirdre Imus environmental health center. So, well, any business news? Business news incidentally Connell.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Is presented by this clown over here at the -- well, he is not a clown, that is unfortunate, Don.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Clown?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Dr. Gill Leatherman.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh!</p><p/><p>IMUS: Hit the cancer.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Hit the cancer, baby.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Hit the cancer. Shut-up.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, it's OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: This radio search deal, he has got going.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You can call Dr. Gill Leatherman at 212-scam -- no, not scam.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: No, no, that's not the word.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's unfortunate.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: 212-choices. What is going on in business news other than the tedious NASDAQ deal?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well, that's the big I guess story up. I'll give you an update on the markets on where we are. The Dow futures are down a little bit this morning. But the Dow was up yesterday, actually the first time it was up in seven sessions. Got lost a little bit in that NASDAQ story.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I'll be darn.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: .of 66 to 14,963. So, not much of an effect in terms of the markets going up and down from that NASDAQ mess, the traders able to shake it off. Commerce Department today releasing some numbers on new home sales on housing numbers, Dow futures are down this morning by 18 points ahead to all that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Is that it?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well, I mean, yes, there's --</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. Can't just stop talking. I thought you had a stroke.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: I thought --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, no. But just stop talking. What's the matter with you?</p><p/><p>RUFINO: He stopped.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, I know he stopped but I mean, back to you, I-man, anything.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That will be the way --</p><p/><p>IMUS: No, no, no.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Connell do it every time.</p><p/><p>(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p/><p>I am Connell McShane.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Almost 20 minutes past.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Omar and the Howlers.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Back to you, I-man.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Doug Crispin's big band is the Beatles I guess to him. I guess they are out of AustinTexas, they're coming up here, he told me they were better than Delbert McClinton. I mean, you -- that is insanity, isn't it? Never heard anything like that.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Never.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: I can't believe my ears.</p><p/><p>IMUS: There is nobody better than Delbert McClinton. Anyway, Warner with sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Go to Peerlessboilers.com and get one of them. Anyway, it's 20 minutes after the hour, here is Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Good morning, I-man.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yankees beat the Jays five-three, they sweep the series make it ten of 12, they cut the race for the last wild card team, the three-and- a-half, blown call by the umpire in the bottom of the fifth gave the Yankees the lead for good. Bases loaded, one-out, Michael Kay, Yes Network.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MICHAEL KAY, YES NETWORK: (INAUDIBLE) To the second and it is a double play. He's tagging everybody but it is a double play to end the inning. Did he kick the catch? Now, they're saying that he didn't make the catch.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, if you watch your FOX Business, you can see that he did indeed make the catch. So instead of a double play to end the inning, Wells is given an RBI and the Yankees take the lead. Well, that is one of the things they will correct next year with video tape replay. Dodgers beat the Marlins six-nothing. Clayton Kershaw on the shut out, he's earned run average is now 1.72. And Brian Wilson pitched for the first time in a year and a half in the ninth inning, he struck out two batters and Wilson has been offered $1 million to shave his beard by 800razors.com.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: He looks scary like that, man.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Pirates and Cardinals win, Pirates by one. Ryan Braun --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Maybe could have fought ahead with this and had a photograph of him that we could have put up. I guess not.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: He makes the duck dynasty guys look like Park Avenue socialites.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: He really does.</p><p/><p>WOLF: What we did have him after the game, Brian Wilson with this brief comment.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, no.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Ryan Braun has issued a statement through the Brewers. They talked about a guy, he say, he said he was sorry he took the PEDs during the --</p><p/><p>IMUS: You and Doug are going down.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Two-11 MVP year. You know, what? Braun ought to give back the MVP trophy and give it to Matt Kemp.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That is enough sports. I am bored now.</p><p/><p>WOLF: OK. How come, I don't know about a Thursday night football game?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Thursday football. I've got it. Lions beat the Patriots 40 to nine.</p><p/><p>IMUS: How come there wasn't any.</p><p/><p>WOLF: There were two.</p><p/><p>IMUS: They were?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Why you didn't tell me about this?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, because you said that was the end of this --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, no, but the Lions beat the Patriots -- what?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Forty to nine. Patriots turned the ball over three of the first four possessions.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Tebow play?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Tebow did not play.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh, God!</p><p/><p>WOLF: Not a good sign.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: He got to bail out Hernandez.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Twenty three after the hour. What is coming up in the briefing, Bernie?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well, Sydney Leathers may have HIV and we have that kid who may be a fraud and Ben Affleck, as Batman.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. That is all. This would be Omar and the Howlers. Doug Crispin, told me with a straight face why you thought this loser was better than Delbert McClinton. I mean, how do you even say that with the --</p><p/><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p/><p>ANNOUNCER: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Are you kidding me? Some fat hillbilly screaming his guts out?

The list of banks includes JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. Moody's also says, it may downgrade Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley bonds and it says Bank of America and Citigroup bonds may also be downgraded for the same reasons but they could also be upgraded because the bank's operations are improving.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, you did not know I called Bigfoot just foot?</p><p/><p>DEIRDRE IMUS, WIFE OF DON IMUS: I could not stop laughing, I was crying.

She is the real deal. If you were still advising presidents, what would you advise them to do?</p><p/><p>BEGALA: I would advise caution. Measure twice and cut once. This country suffered previously by rushing into a war where we had no business fighting. We had no threat against our country. What are the threats to America's interest? also to our credibility. Superpowers never bluff. It is a very difficult situation. The chances of it getting worse because of our intervention is very great. Made me the chairman of the caucus. I have been to walter reed.

He is suing Marvin Gaye's family to prevent them from suing him. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and I wholeheartedly agree.

And now here is Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning everyone. Yesterday's flash freeze at the NASDAQ has been traced to a connectivity issue. According to All Things Digital sources say officials at NASDAQ OMX Group which owns the exchange are pointing to a connectivity problem with NYSE Arca as the trigger for that three-hour trading halt. A NYSE spokesman declined to comment but NASDAQ officials did acknowledge that connectivity issue they just wouldn't say who the exchange participant was.</p><p/><p>Now the trouble started at about 12:15 p.m. Eastern when NASDAQ said it was halting trading in NASDAQ listed stocks. Sources say it took the exchange another half hour to determine it had fixed the problem. But the reopening process which required regulatory approval and testing took more than two hours. All Things D says NASDAQ executives expect the normal start to trading this morning.</p><p/><p>Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., futures have been fairly flat, but to the downside this morning Dow futures are down 16, the S&amp;P is down one point, the NASDAQ is down just a fraction of a point.</p><p/><p>And for a recap on the Asian markets now, let's go to business reporter Jacqueline Maddock in Beijing. Hi, Jacqueline.</p><p/><p>JACQUELINE MADDOCK, BUSINESS REPORTER: Well Diane it was certainly a mixed bag for the end of the week. Mainland markets and also Hong Kong (inaudible) around steadily throughout the afternoon as disappointing corporate earnings results rolled out particularly, from Ever Bright Securities. That of course is the brokerage firm that made all the headlines responsible in fact for last Friday's fat finger fiasco.</p><p/><p>But we also saw banking stocks do some pretty serious polls. And that was because there are plenty of whisper and lots of speculation here that the People's Bank of China is preparing to unleash some new regulations on Chinese lenders.</p><p/><p>A different story though across in Japan the Nikkei managed to put on more than two percent that's because the yen strengthened. And in fact all markets sectors Diane are the very end in the green.</p><p/><p>And finally to Australia. Australia is still riding high on that Thursday's PMI data out in China. (inaudible) stocks could very well there. And the Australian market putting on almost one percent on the hope that China is getting back on track -- Diane.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right that's business reporter Jacqueline Maddock in Beijing.</p><p/><p>And now we're getting earnings in from Foot Locker. The company is reporting an adjusted profit of 46 cents a share. Almost -- almost matching the estimate there analyst were expecting 47 cents. Revenue came in at $1.45 billion. That was right in line with expectations.</p><p/><p>For more on the European markets now, let's go to London where Jan Randolph director of Sovereign Risk at IHS Global Insight is standing by. Jan, the U.K. came out on -- out of recession and now the second reading of GDP has been revised even higher. How optimistic should investors be about this?</p><p/><p>JAN RANDOLPH, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT: Well I think so particularly if you put it into context with Germany, which also showed good -- good revised figures. The recovery in the U.K. is more broad-based now. It includes construction as well the old traditional consumptions. And that's good news and exports were up, particularly to Europe and Germany. So combined, it looks like a better picture all around both the U.K. and from northern Europe.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: And Jan our last guest said the traders are being kind of cautious ahead of the Jackson Hole Conference. What is it that they want to hear?</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: Well actually, the important people are not there. And that's Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>and Mario Draghi. I mean they are the ones that are ultimately going to stir policy going forward. But yes, I mean there have been some interesting comments. Nowotny, for example, the Austrian member of the ECB said, \"The improving news from Europe means that there will no longer be a cuff and interest rates in Europe\". There seems to be no argument for that.</p><p/><p>So I think Jackson Hole, yes it is -- it's a bit more of a sideshow I think this year compared to previous years.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right Jan Randolph at IHS Global Insight thanks Jan.</p><p/><p>And the \"Wall Street Journal\" says federal prosecutors are turning up the pressure in an insider trading case against a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital. A new indictment unsealed yesterday alleges that Mathew Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an Alzheimer's drug trial at the heart of the case. Martoma is accused of using inside information about the results of that drug trial to allow SAC Capital to make $275 million in profit. He is due to go on trial in November and a hearing is set for this morning.</p><p/><p>SAC Capital has been charged with encouraging insider trading but Steven Cohen the hedge fund's founder has not been charged. Cohen and his firm have denied any wrongdoing.</p><p/><p>Here is a look at commodities now. We have been watching oil and gold for you this morning. We've got green arrows there. Oil is up eight cents it's trading around $105 a barrel. Gold is up a little more than $3 at $1,374 an ounce.</p><p/><p>Now here is the I-Man on Fox Business giving you the power to prosper.</p><p/><p>CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Ladies and gentlemen.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCCORD: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know once in a while, I have my iPod Touch with me. I will check my e-mails I mean sometimes during the show not always but -- so I was going to talk about something else but I'm going to talk about this briefly.</p><p/><p>You know we've been talking about Roxanne Roundtree. And \"Roxy's Recipe\" her book you can go to Imus.com and right there on the homepage, you can click on the video and watch the video of Roxanne Roundtree that Patrick Gottsch at RFD did and it's -- it change their live. So if you still need cook books and well you still to be buying the cookbooks. Although Esther Newberg or she got a couple of the New York publishers she's going to fighting over it, it's time to get to published it.</p><p/><p>But I've got -- I got -- this woman is confined she has the Lou Gehrig's disease and is confined to a wheelchair and communicates by blinking her eyes. She has a three great sons and her husband's a saint, Don. And I just got an e-mail from him, a long e-mail -- too long to read. But as -- I don't know how to describe it, actually. It is wonderfully well-written. Let's start there.</p><p/><p>But he fell in love with Roxanne who is 34 or 35 now. She -- she came down with Lou Gehrig's Disease of five, six or four, five years ago. But Don fell in love with her in the first grade. And then talked about, in this e-mail, about how long it took to persuade her to marry him. And of course, she couldn't have married a better person on the planet than this guy. Man I mean so -- so that's what I was doing well storming Norman who is yakking about whatever they were doing. Anyway --</p><p/><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I got to help these people. Come on man.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: It's such a good story.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And really is just --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: It's unbelievable.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It really is. All right seven minutes after the hour. Hey Warner, who's -- who's the best football team in the pros?</p><p/><p>WOLF: I would you know barring any more injury I would go with the Broncos.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes. The addition of Wes Welker makes them strong. They have a good running game.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He hurt himself the other day didn't he?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes he did.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Is he all right now? Or --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Hopefully he'll open the season. But they already had a good passing game.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p/><p>WOLF: And they lost at -- on that fluke play. Do you remember the Baltimore in the playoff?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>WOLF: So I would think on paper --</p><p/><p>IMUS: They threw that interception.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well that's true in the second overtime yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>WOLF: You know when you -- when you pick one out of 32 teams before the season.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>WOLF: It's really part luck because of the injury factor like no other sports so.</p><p/><p>IMUS: How about the Giants going to be -- we heard this --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well you know they finished nine and seven but they lost their last two games of the year by a combined score 67-1. And they lost Amad Bradshaw (ph) they are leading Rusher (ph) and now they have two offensive linemen two out of the five offensive lineman don't look like they'll start the season. So I -- I would say, at best, nine and seven again maybe worst. They don't -- I don't see a running game. They said oh Wilson and --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Ok fine. Jet's a joke.</p><p/><p>WOLF: On Jets eight-eight at best.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes at best yes. And its fat coach he'll be gone, but he's not fat anymore.</p><p/><p>WOLF: No he's not but that might not help him.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He'll be sucking toes someplace else so.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Anybody else any good? Are the -- well the Patriots got to be pretty good right?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Sure always good. Again except the year that Brady got hurt at the start of the season.</p><p/><p>IMUS: How is Alec Smith is he any good?</p><p/><p>WOLF: He is but not with this cast, not with Kansas City.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p/><p>WOLF: No and it's too bad because you know he was playing great for the 49ers.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I know.</p><p/><p>WOLF: When Kaepernick --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Kaepernick came in yes. How about -- what else -- how about Seattle?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, yes, Russell Wilson I mean he turned them around. They are very good sure.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Speaking of Kaepernick how about the 49ers?</p><p/><p>WOLF: 49ers are strong yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Any other strong teams?</p><p/><p>WOLF: I think you have named the best strong teams.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p/><p>WOLF: But again, you know that's what's great about the National Football League.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>WOLF: You only have 16 games it's not like baseball you know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What happened in this Little League World Series situation?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well you had Taiwan eliminating Panama.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>WOLF: So Taiwan -- Tijuana, excuse me, not Taiwan. Tijuana will now play Tokyo for the international title.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>WOLF: And the West Port Washington State game was rained out so they'll play today.</p><p/><p>IMUS: We got to bet full for West Port and Tijuana.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Ok it's all right yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Ok.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Tijuana, what 23 miles from San Diego and as you pointed out even closer to -- Tiu Lavista (ph).</p><p/><p>IMUS: I used to go to Tijuana when I was in the Marine Corps stationed at Camp Pendleton.</p><p/><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS IN THE MORNING: For what?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes exactly for what?</p><p/><p>ROB BARTLETT, IMUS IN THE MORNING: The art.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I think is -- well I forget this was 1957 so --</p><p/><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS IN THE MORNING: We'll be love you time Mr. -- Private Imus.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Eleven minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Well a lot of good stuff coming up. That dingbat, Liz Claman --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh, Oh no, no. Oh no, no. You knew what we are, you knew, what is what ding bat; we are in for it here. Let's just restart that sentence please.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: I hate it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh man she's a wacko. But she's going to interview the guy who runs the NASDAQ.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Bob Greifeld.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And that's coming and I wasn't -- we weren't going to carry it on the radio because I don't care about it.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But they want to carry it on the television. And that's your job and that's my job to make sure they do. That it gets done which I'm delighted to do.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Of course.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But now I've decided we're going to carry it on the radio as well.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh ok.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And we will carry it for as long as we can stand it.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Got it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And it's just drones on, then we'll bail. So -- I mean that's coming up the next hour. The Godfather is here, of course.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And he'll be discussing some stuff this hour and particularly the Bradley Manning situation. And then Powell to the People Tony is out in the street. Big Foot do we have any of that?</p><p/><p>TOM BOWMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING: We're going to have some momentarily. But he was out because of the One Direction concert on the \"Today\" show. They're expecting like 15,000 people, mostly kids. Some of them have been waiting since Tuesday to get a front row.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I like that. I like somebody who would stand (inaudible). I wonder if Doug Christie thinks One Direction is better than Delbert.</p><p/><p>Anyway. Thirteen minutes past the hour. Let's do some news. And here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning Connell.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Hey good morning I-Man.</p><p/><p>These wildfires are really a big issue out west. And the one that's burning outside of Yosemite National Park nearly has quadruples now inside, in size. So officials are going door to door -- they're urging people to get out. But the evacuations are not mandatory. So you have some people like this that are hanging in there.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you sticking here.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh yes. Absolutely. I will stay in place, protect what I can as long as I can.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: As long, yes, they stayed there. A lot of times this happens. This fire is only about one percent contained though they're saying at this point.</p><p/><p>We have new comments coming in this morning from President Obama on Syria. CNN had him on just about an hour ago saying allegations of chemical weapons used in Syria is according to the President's quote, a big even. And then they asked him about his redline comments that he'd made about the use of those types of weapons. And the president said the latest event in Syria is something the U.S. has to look at. So that's how he phrased it.</p><p/><p>Well, we'll see where we go from there but speaking of Syria two UN agencies say the rising number of children who are turning into refugees over there resulted in greater threats.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have recorded a million refugees, children that are found and now in camp settings with host communities and in very challenging environments.</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Nearly three quarters of all of these refugees under the age of 11. You have 1 million refugees as you heard in all. Nearly three quarters under 11.</p><p/><p>In Egypt today, security and military forces are deployed around the city of Cairo. They've closed off traffic in some of the major roadways. This comes ahead of protests by the supporters of the former President Mohamed Morsi and these rallies today kind of a test for the Morsi supporters. See if they can keep the pressure up despite the crack down that we've seen here on the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p/><p>We mentioned President Obama on CNN; later today he visits Pennsylvania for the first time in more than a year bringing in this plan. He's been out on the road promoting for college affordability to Scranton. Joe Biden's hometown -- Scranton Pennsylvania -- Lakawana College (ph) she'll be later on in the day.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. Coming up on 15 minutes after the hour. Dagen McDowell is not here today because, well, what did she tell you, Connell?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well, she hit her head on a cabinet the other day and had wounds so, you know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: On her face apparently -- not just her head or something.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right. Some kind of a wound on her face.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Did you ever get any more information? Did you every talk to her, Carley?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Hold on one second.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What happened to Carley?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: There she is.</p><p/><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING: I'm right here, hi. I spoke to with her, but I did not ask any questions. I want to get the real story when she comes in first thing on Monday.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Wait a minute.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, when you spoke to her what was the conversation about then.</p><p/><p>SHIMKUS: I just asked her if she needed anything. If she was in Manhattan, I'd go over and see her. She said she is fine, but she needs to heal up a little bit more.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Ok, good.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That's a good friend you are.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So something is not -- we are not getting the story here.</p><p/><p>SHIMKUS: I mean it is Friday. Something is fishy. Let's be honest.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Come on Carley.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What did you say Carley?</p><p/><p>SHIMKUS: I said it's Friday. Something's fishy. Let's be honest.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. Time for a little sports now and sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Hey Warner --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Patrick Gottsch, you know, did you ever meet him?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes. Sure at your golf tournament, yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sure. So he calls me yesterday or texted me. He says we are having a big announcement on Rural Radio which is on Sirius XM. Could you listen and I was with the kids and I could not. He said well, we're going to have it on TV.</p><p/><p>Here is what they are going to do. They will have a one day two million dollar rodeo at Cowboys Stadium.</p><p/><p>WOLF: No kidding.</p><p/><p>IMUS: No. So I do not know the details of that yet but it is not until March 2. But it's going to be $2 million in prize money which should be the richest rodeo ever held. And they've invited all of the -- I guess the ten best cowboys in all events. Everybody from saddle block riding to (inaudible) to calf roping team.</p><p/><p>Then, anybody else can enter, I think. A limited number of them or just what they call qualifiers and that would be guys who no longer compete. Like Joe Beaver could come back and calf-rope if he put on knee brace and other people could as well.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Cody Ohl.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Cody Ohl is still -- he's still going to the national finals. He will go again this year. He is still out winning beau coup money. He's in the top 15 in the world now. So that is a huge deal at Cowboys Stadium.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Maybe Jerry Jones will be there.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, Warner.</p><p/><p>Anyway, it is time for sports. Sports sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Did I say that.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Anyway, here's the great Warner Wolf.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Thank you. Good morning I-Man.</p><p/><p>Yankees beat the Jays 5-3, they sweep the series. They've won 10 of 12. They cut the race for that second wild card spot to 3.5 games.</p><p/><p>IMUS: By the way, every time Patrick e-mails me and asked me to watch something or listen to something, I then critique it. He does not ask me to do that. He doesn't say be sure and e-mail me or text me and tell me what you think of my people who are announcing on the radio or on RFD. The announcer that he had on RFD was so annoying and irritating. I cannot think of the guy's name. Some dope.</p><p/><p>Randy Bernard -- he used to be the PBR and the Hyundai car deal and he's a great guy. He has terrific ideas. And this whole rodeo thing is his idea. I don't know. It's just -- I watched him for a few minutes and it irritated me.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That is so unlike you.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I did hear Joe Beaver call in. He said he's in day 13 of a 15- day clinic. That is odd, he just left here eight days ago. That must be the new math or something.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Two a day.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, maybe two a day or something.</p><p/><p>Anyway, what were you saying now.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, Yanks got a big break when the umps blew a call in the last of the fifth inning, if you want to see it on Fox Business --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p/><p>WOLF: It was called by Buck Martinez of CTV sports network.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BUCK MARTINEZ, CTV SPORTS: -- goes after the first pitch. Davis -- no catch -- they sit on the tracks and now they have two runners at second. They tag and try to tag out each. So now, we have all sorts of confusion.</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well if you look at it again, you'll see that catch is made. Instead of an inning ending double play, it was incorrectly ruled an RBI for Wells. The Yanks took the lead and never trailed. This is exactly one of the instances that videotape replay will be used next year.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. No justice, no peace.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Pirates and Cards win. Pirates still by one.</p><p/><p>And Dodgers Clay Kershaw, eighth inning, shut out the Marlins. He lowers his earned run average to 1.72. Man, that's Gibson, Kofax, (inaudible) numbers. And in their playoff drive, the Mets have just signed former Red Sox right-hander, Daisuke Matsuzaka --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p/><p>WOLF: -- who has never been the same since his big 2008 season when he went 18 and 3. In fact, he'll pitch tonight.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Did you say the Mets playoff drive?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes, I did.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Of course.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: I just wanted to make sure I was hearing properly.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Of course, come on.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: There's still time.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's hurtful, Warner.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's not funny.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Not at all. Exhibition football, the Lions beat the Patriots 40-9.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What?</p><p/><p>WOLF: The Patriots turned the ball over three of the first four possessions.</p><p/><p>Here was Patriots coach Bill Belichick.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BILL BELICHICK, COACH NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS: When you turn the ball over four times in the first quarter, that will knock you out of most any game.</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's right. Again, you know, Reggie Bush is the new running back for the Lions. One yard in six carries. He did catch five passes, 103 yards.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Must have had the Kardashian girl he used to be married to on his back.</p><p/><p>Twenty-one after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING -- what's coming up in the briefing, Bernie?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: President Obama, he pulled a boner in front of a bunch of college kids if I may employ some old school vernacular. And comedian Louis C.K., he finds a dead body in the river. We have the audio --</p><p/><p>IMUS: What?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. Yes, indeed. True story boss, true story.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And the Godfather's coming up and Powell to the people is coming up as well. Well, I hope Doug Christine has got his TV on or his radio.</p><p/><p>You're telling me that Omar (inaudible). Delbert McClinton. Have you lost your mind?</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning everyone. I'm Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>And we will get a new reading on the housing market this morning. New home sales for July are expected to fall 1.5 percent from June to 490,000. That would be disappointing reading after existing home sales for last month jumped 6.5 percent to their highest level in four years.</p><p/><p>The mood of the housing market though does seem to be improving. Home builder confidence jumped last week to its highest level in eight years despite rising interest rates.</p><p/><p>Moody's investors service is putting the 6 U.S. Banks on review to weather the possibility of reducing support if they run into financial trouble. Of those banks, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are under review with downgrade implications while Bank of America and Citigroup are being evaluated as direction uncertain.</p><p/><p>Moody's also says it may downgrade bonds at Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, B of A, and Citigroup though Bank of America and Citigroup bonds could also be upgraded because their operations are improving. Ratings downgrades can increase a bank's borrowing costs and force it to close more collateral and derivative trades weighing on its profitability and draining its cash.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business giving you the power to prosper.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Diane, what the hell are doing, Diane? Are you spraying your hair?</p><p/><p>MACEDO: I was putting it in place for you.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh my goodness.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Your hair looks great Diane.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Thank you.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You already have a guy who is going to marry you so you can get fat now. What do you care?</p><p/><p>Anyway back to Lupi.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Good focus.</p><p/><p>MIKE LUPICA: You just really like talking. You're a crazy person.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, I am sitting here watching the monitor and Diane is spraying her hair.</p><p/><p>LUPICA: Don't look at the monitor. Don't look in the monitor -- focus on what you are doing.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: 28 after the hour. We have (inaudible) coming up. So is Tony Powell, Powell to the people. The business report, did you do it Connell?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: I don't think I did specific business report.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You don't have to now.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, the Nasdaq thing --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sponsored by Ativia for natural pain relief. Go ativia.com and send those Vicodin out here to the I-Man.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's the style.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Although I'm leaving here to go to Texas in a few days and then about a week. The last group of kids and then I will be at the Joe Beaver junior superstar roping in Steubenville, Texas over Labor Day. And then I will be in Huntsville. Then I'll be at Wyatt's first high school rodeo September 8th and then on September 9, I'll be back in the studio at Fox.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Pretty good, pretty good.</p><p/><p>I should point out on Labor Day that's when that special on the Imus Ranch on Fox Business Network will premiere. And (inaudible) and editor John here doing a great job on. I saw part of it yesterday that they're putting together.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know, I was going to say I'm a not be able to watch it but I have satellite DirecTV in my horse trailer.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Of course you do. You'll have it. I believe the times are going to noon Eastern and 4:00 Eastern and then I'm sure, it will repeat after that. But that will be when it premieres.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I can just set my TIVO in my horse trailer. I have a plug in for Randy.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That is big pimping right there.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I've two televisions in the living quarters of my horse trailer. Room for four horses and three people.</p><p/><p>This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program is sponsored by BMW of Bayside -- you sick -- anyway --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Nothing.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Nothing at all.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It is time for a Bernie Briefing, the 30 minutes past the hour. That, of course, is sponsored by MyPillow, which - by the way we're in - or in horse trailers. So. Anyway, good morning, Bernie.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, boss. President Obama up at SUNY, Buffalo in upstate New York yesterday, giving his speech and he made a little bit of a mistake and a recovery. Take a listen.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Your outstanding mayor Brian Higgins is here.</p><p/><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p/><p>OBAMA: Give him a big (inaudible) of applause.</p><p/><p>AUDIENCE: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p/><p>OBAMA: What?</p><p/><p>Byron Brown.

Your mayor, Byron Brown is here.</p><p/><p>This is what happens when you get to be 52 years old.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>OBAMA: When I was 51, everything was smooth.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Pretty good. He can be charming.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yeah, very likable.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: And your friend, comedian Louis C.K. .</p><p/><p>IMUS: I love him.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: He was on with David Letterman the other night, but nobody would know it because half the country can't get CBS and the other half just doesn't watch. But .</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Or doesn't try.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: In any case, Mr. C.K., he was boating in the East River here in New York City and the following transpired between him and Letterman. Listen.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>LOUIS C.K., COMEDIAN: I got a boat, I saw the Coast Guard comes on and they say, please be aware there's other - a report of a body in the water south of the Queensboro Bridge, which is where I was, and as soon as they said I looked down and there was the dude in the water.</p><p/><p>DAVID LETTERMAN, LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST: Oh, my God.</p><p/><p>LOUIS C.K.: Yeah.</p><p/><p>LETTERMAN: So you are like right in there at the crime - well, we think crime scene. We don't know.</p><p/><p>LOUIS C.K.: I don't know. It's just floating dead person.</p><p/><p>LETTERMAN: Yeah.</p><p/><p>LOUIS C.K.: And I've never seen a dead guy. Have you ever seen a dead person?</p><p/><p>LETTERMAN: Well, I have been to various funerals .</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>LETTERMAN: . but not like this. This is a dead guy in the wild.</p><p/><p>LOUIS C.K.: That is right. That is right. That is right. This is a freshly dead person.</p><p/><p>LETTERMAN: Yeah.</p><p/><p>LOUIS C.K.: Has he been all - you know .</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>LOUIS C.K.: It's just .</p><p/><p>LETTERMAN: Must have been creepy.</p><p/><p>LOUIS C.K.: It was creepy and weird and I felt embarrassed for him a little bit. And .</p><p/><p>LETTERMAN: You should have gotten the picture of him. You should .</p><p/><p>LOUIS C.K.: What's that?</p><p/><p>LETTERMAN: You should have got .</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>LETTERMAN: Then we would have that to look at.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Not a lot of sympathy on the .</p><p/><p>IMUS: Not (inaudible). What's that clip about?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well, the story of the dead body. You know, we listened to Letterman's monologue. He is the only guy that's on live this week, everybody is off, everybody .</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Not one funny thing could we use from Mr. Letterman, but that was the best and here we are bringing it to the I-Man. A dead body in the East River, just another day in New York City.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: And at least they didn't speculate that it was Jay Leno or something like that, some mean-spirited thing.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yeah. Something we'd have done .</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: But you know what, Jimmy Kimmel, thought, remember that kid, he was - the judge told the parents that no, you cannot name your kid Messiah, you're going to name him Martin, all right? In any case, Jimmy Kimmel has this to say about that.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST: Guys. So no, you are not naming your son Messiah and forced him to change it to Martin. So, we'd better - if your first name is Messiah, you will never find little personalized license plates for your bike.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>KIMMEL: Plus, there's a lot of pressure to have. Oh, great, Messiah wet his bed again.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>KIMMEL: I don't think what the judge did was legal, but I'm glad she did it. In fact, I think we should bring her to Hollywood, put her in charge of celebrity baby names.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>KIMMEL: Because there is - not even giving their kids names anymore, they're giving them nouns. You go to any playground in L.A., yell the word River, ten kids will come running.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: River!</p><p/><p>IMUS: And really.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: True story.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Low on material here. It is 34 minutes past the hour.</p><p/><p>Brutal. Here is some \"Rusty Truck.\" Man, I love this .</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I am Diane Macedo. And central bankers are in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for their annual conference. Fox Business' Peter Barnes is there too. Here is an update.</p><p/><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, let's just call it taper talk in the teatimes this time around in Jackson Hole. It's the Fed officials and central bankers from around the world gathering to hear the latest research on the economy and on monetary policy, but the real action takes place on the sidelines during the breaks and in the hallways where the participants can talk to each other one-on-one and share information and talk about the effectiveness of policy and the state of the recovery and of easy money policies. Of course, the big question here is when the Fed could start to wind down, to dial back its $85 billion a month in quantitative easing bond purchases designed to help keep interest rates low on mortgages and other types of loans coming in to the conference. The handicapping is that the Fed could start small at its next policy meeting in September.</p><p/><p>The big elephant not in the room this time around at Jackson Hole is Fed Chairman Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke. </nameText></person>He is skipping the conference for the first time since he became Fed chairman back in 2005. The Fed says he has a personal scheduling conflict, but a lot of folks here are looking and talking about who may succeed Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>as the chairman, who President Obama will appoint. One of the leading contenders is the vice chairman of the Fed, Janet Yellen. She is here and will moderate a panel on Saturday on her leading rival in the contest. Larry Summers, former economic adviser to the president is not attending. Back to you in New York.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right. That's Peter Barnes in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p><p/><p>Taking a look at futures, we've got a fairly flat morning, Dow futures are down eight. \"Imus in the Morning\" continues right now.</p><p/><p>IMUS: To my man. Freddie Toyota on Highland Boulevard in Staten Island, 19 minutes now until the hour. Please welcome to the program Don Corleone, the godfather. Good morning, godfather.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: Good morning, Don Imus. At first I was disappointed in this Bradley Manning leaking the classified information, but now there are some suggestions that he did so because he preferred to - I'm now a woman - literally. He may think that he is a female trapped in a man's body, as if that catzone (ph) hanging of him with some kind of padlock .</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: And all this time I assumed he wasn't that good at keeping secrets. Man, he says that he has - a feminile (ph) - and wishes to be treated as such. Well, I hope he will be relieved to know that his wish will be partially granted when serving his sentence. He will be surrounded by men who will be more than happy to treat him as the receptacle for their (speaking Italian). Trust me, you don't want that translated.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: What bothers me is that this revelation suggests his punishment is less a penalty than a reward. He will spend his years in jail like it was some kind of Fire Island Labor Day barbecue. The only thing that won't be part of his plan is the being referred to as Chelsea. For I think the name he will be known by will be more along the lines of bitch.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: But if it were up to me he would be for his infamnia (ph) with the real punishment like being extradited to Russia where they would be more than happy to cut off the very thing that is trapping him in a man's body. He divulged classified information, but the leaking has just begun.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Thank you, Godfather. For - that's assessment - and 17 until the hour. \"Powell to the People\" coming up next. This is an unauthorized airing of this record of (inaudible)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Hi, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo, and let's check the markets now, the day after the NASDAQ flash freed that halted trading for three hours. Asian markets ended the day mixed: Japan's Nikkei followed the U.S., rebounded, finished the day at more than two percent. South Korea's KOSPI gained more than one percent, but the Hang Seng and Shanghai did end with red arrows. Over in Europe, we got the second reading on second quarter GDP for the U.K. And Germany, both rose seven tenths of a percent, London's up about 35, Frankfurt is up about 18, but Paris is down almost two points.</p><p/><p>Here, in the U.S. futures have been pointing to a lower open for most of the morning. Dow futures are still down by about a four, but the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are showing some slight gains. We will be keeping an eye on those for you. Gap raised its full year earnings outlook and annual dividend after reporting a 25 percent jump in its second quarter profit compared to last year. The retailer said it earned $0.64 a share matching the estimate. Revenue rose just over eight percent to $3.7 billion. That also tops expectations. Gap now expects to report a profit of $2.57 to $2.65 a share. That's $0.05 above its previous range. The company also raised its annual dividend to $0.80 per share up from $0.60.</p><p/><p>We're getting earnings in now from Ann Inc, formally Ann Taylor, the company is reporting a profit of $0.76 a share, topping the estimate for $0.65. Revenue, though, was a slight miss at $638,2 million. Analysts were expecting $639 million. \"Imus in the Morning\" continues right now on Fox Business.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Why did that commercial sound like it was under water, Lou?</p><p/><p>RUFINO: My fault, I guess.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, now, that was - comes from your studio or the other studio?</p><p/><p>RUFINO: No, I don't know anything about it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But do you care about it?</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Does it sound like I care?</p><p/><p>IMUS: No, it doesn't. It's just like - you're parallel.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: No, I guess so.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, yeah - but I mean we charge these people all these money for this commercial, and want people to be able to hear them.</p><p/><p>This part of the program is sponsored by Freddie Toyota on the Highland Boulevard in Staten Island.</p><p/><p>Well, hey, Bernie, is CBS off in how much of the country?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well, Time Warner, I don't know what the percentage is, my guess is, approximately half. But I think they just got back on Verizon files.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: I don't know if it's - but the big, the funny thing was they put them back on Channel 2 last night, just to have the debate between - what Spitzer was on.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: They didn't want, you know, to be accused of keeping that off the air.</p><p/><p>IMUS: One direction is appearing on the \"Today Show,\" which is only a couple of blocks from where the Fox Studios are.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yeah.</p><p/><p>IMUS: They are on 6th Avenue, the Avenue of the Americas.

I mean - want an erection talking to kids?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Where did you get that from?</p><p/><p>IMUS: What is the matter with you?</p><p/><p>POWELL: I don't know. It's just - I don't know. It seemed funny to me. I don't know why it means .</p><p/><p>IMUS: It wasn't funny, not in that context, you idiot.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh-oh.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It is eight minutes until -- what is the matter with you, Bigfoot? So, here is the new rule. Before we put any of these on the air you have got to show them to me. You understand.</p><p/><p>POWELL: Yes, starting next week.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Because, well, I am going to be off next week.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's a good time to start it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Because your judgment sucks.</p><p/><p>POWELL: One time.

He said, well, when did you go here?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: It's just me.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. We need to figure it out. But I guess - at the University of Virginia, you missed that day.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Some of them say they got - some of them said they .</p><p/><p>IMUS: No, not Tony - it's not - this is not an opportunity to debate. So, Rob Bartlett will be appearing at the Leavitt Theater in Ogunsuck (ph) Maine.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Ogunquit.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Whatever. September 21st, and Tony will be appearing at the Belmar Theater on Saturday, September 28th for an evening with Tony Powell. That ought to be good. Well, it could be good as long as he doesn't do any of this and you could get tickets to that by going to NY entrainmentclub.com or you could get a hold of that Bellmore theater, and I want to see Tony.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I am confident that he is funny. If you want to see evidence of this. Now that this dingbat Liz Claman--</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: No, no, no.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He is going to interview the head of the NASDAQ .</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, great.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Because they got shutdown yesterday. And we don't know - nobody knows why. I mean there was - you know, the suspicion is that they are lying, whatever they tell her. But we just - we have Warner watch this and see if we can determine if either one of them was lying. Five minute now till the hour.</p><p/><p>IMUS: A lot of the people out there - what did you think, Dagen, again?</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: I just thought it was badly cast, like the comedian, why is he there and then they have this woman sitting off to the side on - reporting on what people are tweeting about, reading stuff on the Twitter, off the Internet, and just pointless.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: They could be a better way to integrate it. I mean if you want to have like a hot check, just have her sit there and do nothing. And just cut - OK, let's give them the hot check a few minutes, you just take a shot of her and then go back talking about some sports. It was just exhausting.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sounds to me like you are kind of dissing Carley in an odd way.</p><p/><p>CARLEY: Yeah, come on, Dagen. Come on there.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Hey, Carley.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Doesn't sound that way to you, Carley?</p><p/><p>CARLEY: Yeah, what is going on? All that hate?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: You know what - that chick on (inaudible) is a brunette. So, that was not .</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Like we have said Carley redeemed and stuffed.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: And I was great when .</p><p/><p>CARLEY: And I would be happy to read some tweets.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Hey, so.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Yeah.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Do whatever you want, Carley.</p><p/><p>CARLEY: All right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I thought you liked Carley.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: I love Carley.</p><p/><p>CARLEY: I love Dagen.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Do you really want me to drive down this road? Because it will get dirty real quick.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: OK, put the pedal to the metal.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I don't have a problem with it. I mean I've got nothing to do.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: I love Carley. It was not a shot at Carley.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But your kids were not up yet. Go for it.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>IMUS: This is the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program on the Fox Business Network. Now here's Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning everyone. Let's check the markets now the day after a NASDAQ flash freeze halted trading for three hours. U.S. futures are mixed. We have Dow futures down by one point. The S&amp;P and NASDAQ turned things around. The S&amp;P is up by almost a point, about a point exactly. There now NASDAQ is up almost four. Now, for more on what happened at the NASDAQ yesterday let's go to Nicole Petallides who joins us in the newsroom. Hi, Nicole.</p><p/><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS: Hey, good morning, Diane, good morning everybody. Well, yesterday's flash freeze from someone who was standing right on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange felt more like an eternity freeze, right?</p><p/><p>So, it took them about a half hour to really figure out what the problem was and then another two and a half hours to actually reopen the Nasdaq MarketSite.</p><p/><p>So, it's very interesting as we watch what happened, it was actually due to a glitch in the processor. A securities information processor SIP which now seems to be regular wording that we use now on Wall Street today.</p><p/><p>But basically it's a way that they give out prices to all the different exchanges, 13 exchanges, 40 dark pools. And when this had a glitch, they basically halted trading across the board.</p><p/><p>Names like Apple, Blackberry, Costco, Cisco, Dow components as well. So, you have Google, JetBlue, just to name a few of the names.</p><p/><p>So, what's interesting is you have different people speaking out today, Bob Greifeld, the CEO of Nasdaq seems very proud of the way that they figured out what the problem was.</p><p/><p>And order and had an orderly reopening and didn't feel the need to address any transparency or address the press, et cetera.</p><p/><p>He said he's working closely with other exchanges. However, when you talk to SEC chair, Mary Jo White, also Harvey Pitt, former SEC chairman, Arthur Levitt, former SEC chairman, they seem less than pleased.</p><p/><p>Obviously noting that this was a serious issue, that's according to Mary Jo White, Harvey Pitt said this, it shouldn't have happened at all.</p><p/><p>And so obviously and Arthur Levitt as well expressing displeasure. So, now what happens today and how do we ensure that this doesn't happen again and really leave Americans and people all over the world with their money tied up and not sure as to when they will be able to execute trades again?</p><p/><p>Now, this is reminiscent of what we remember from Facebook, that debacle of an IPO, you know the ink is barely dry on that $10 million check that Nasdaq had to pay out in order to calm that issue.</p><p/><p>So, this remains an issue and it's all about the complexity of trading which as I noted, 13 exchanges, more than 40 dark pools and that trillions of dollars at hand.</p><p/><p>So, this is a very tough day yesterday on Wall Street. And of course, once again, it's a blast to investor confidence. Diane.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Nicole Petallides from the newsroom, thanks, Nicole. And central bankers are gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the Kansas City Fed's annual conference.</p><p/><p>Fox Business' Peter Barnes joins us live with a preview, good morning, Peter.</p><p/><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS: Hey, good morning, Diane. Well, the topic at this year's conference is global dimensions of unconventional monetary policy.</p><p/><p>What does that mean? Well, basically they're here to talk about low long- term interest rates, quantitative easing, those billions and trillions of dollars that the Fed has spent to buy mortgage-backed securities and treasury securities.</p><p/><p>All of it to try to keep interest rates low for average consumers so they can go out and buy cars and get low-cost mortgages and their businesses can get low loans.</p><p/><p>So, that -- this stuff matters to the average consumer. The big topic here and the big buzz is, when will the Fed start to now dial back all of this quantitative easing?</p><p/><p>It's been doing $85 billion a month since September but it appears that the Fed is now getting ready to start pull that back, to start tapering that, to start dialing that down.</p><p/><p>And that's what's given a lot of heartburn to the markets and caused a lot of these, a lot of the roller coaster ride out in the markets.</p><p/><p>And there will be some papers presented here that talk about quantitative easing, there's been some other recent papers that say basically, you know what?</p><p/><p>It's really not working anymore and that kind of research could help push the Fed to get out of quantitative easing quicker, sooner rather than later.</p><p/><p>I want to mention we got a great lineup of guests here in Jackson Hole this year and just a little bit later in this hour, we'll talk to Dennis Lockhart, he is the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.</p><p/><p>We'll be talking later today to Jim Bullard, the President of the Saint Louis Federal Reserve, they both have been very vocal on this issue of quantitative easing.</p><p/><p>And later this afternoon at 5:00, we'll be talking to Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund who is doing all those bailouts around the world. Diane, back to you.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Peter Barnes in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Is the United States planning for airstrikes in Syria? The \"Wall Street Journal\" actually has a report on this -- in this morning's paper that officials began, \"refining their options\" for possible airstrikes.</p><p/><p>You know, supposedly updating target lists and the like for the possibility of striking Syria.</p><p/><p>U.S. airstrikes but we'll see. Here is President Obama making an appearance, talking about some of these things on \"Cnn\", he was on with Chris Cuomo earlier this morning. Here's a little bit of the interview.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Where is it?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Where are we on that Tom? Remember that Cuomo --</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN: Do you believe at this point you need to investigate --</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Here we go --</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CUOMO: In order to say what seems obvious, which is that the U.S. needs to do more.</p><p/><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, we are right now gathering information about this particular event but --</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Chemical weapons --</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>OBAMA: I can say that unlike some of the evidence --</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: We have to interrupt this, that's enough. Now, stop it! --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Not --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Playing a cut from \"Cnn\", that's just idiotic. All right, please welcome now to the program Liz Claman, good morning, Miss Claman.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right --</p><p/><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Don and to all of your listeners and viewers, we are live at the Nasdaq MarketSite.</p><p/><p>You know, there are many exchanges, but the two biggest, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, one of them went down yesterday for a full three hours.</p><p/><p>Throwing the entire trading system for all of you who maybe have 401(k)s or trade stocks, it went down for a full three hours and of course, now, it's been attributed to a highly technical glitch.</p><p/><p>We're joined now by the CEO of the Nasdaq, Bob Greifeld. Thank you for being here --</p><p/><p>ROBERT GREIFELD, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NASDAQ: I'm glad to have you here, Liz.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: OK, this is not a great day for you, this was a nightmare yesterday, but it was also a nightmare for companies like Yahoo!, Apple, Google who list on the Nasdaq but also the individual investor.</p><p/><p>Right off the bat, I have to ask you because so many people were questioning this. Was there any indication of any kind of computer hacking or system hacking here?</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: No, none whatsoever. So, this had nothing to do with hacking. Hacking is a fact of life but had nothing to do with the problem yesterday.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: That worries some people that it was an internal system because it indicates to some people, you guys don't have your arms wrapped around your system?</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: Well, certainly we're deeply disappointed with what happened yesterday and what we had to do is improve what I call defensive driving.</p><p/><p>So, our system by itself was working but you have interconnections in the world we live in today and we have to handle bad actions from some of those people connected to us.</p><p/><p>And we have to improve on that. So, we're deeply disappointed but I would highlight that one of the reasons it took three hours was, we have a first and foremost responsibility for fair and orderly markets.</p><p/><p>So, we spent two and a half hours really making sure the entire industry, we had opened telephone lines with them, we made sure the entire industry was ready to come live and we did come live, we came live quite successfully and finished the day in normal course of business.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Nobody begrudges you that moment where you have to work and make sure that once you do press go again, it's going to be fine.</p><p/><p>What they do get very upset about, Bob, is the lack of communication. I talked to CEOs of Nasdaq-traded companies who said I got nothing.</p><p/><p>I'm sitting in meetings, I'm checking my Blackberry, I'm checking my phone, there's nothing from the Nasdaq.</p><p/><p>They do know that you were putting out some 20 missives to the trading community, but that's not the CEOs of all of these companies who are worried about their stocks.</p><p/><p>What's wrong with your communication system?</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: Well, our communication system I think worked well yesterday. It can always be improved.</p><p/><p>First order of businesses to focus on solving the problem and then dealing with people directly involved with the problem.</p><p/><p>Now, in one of those open lines we had people representing our issuers on the call and they were -- they are to give regular updates out.</p><p/><p>We gave a formal update out after the close of trading which we wanted to do. So, I think we did well, we'll certainly reflect upon how we communicate, see if we can do better.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Can't you just --</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: But certainly --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Hire somebody to work the phones and call the IR offices? The --</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: Oh, they were doing that --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You know --</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: Although we had teams --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Investor relations offices --</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: No --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: On the stock --</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: We had teams of people doing that. As I'm saying, we had the people responsible for the issuers on the open lines so they could hear first-hand exactly what was going on.</p><p/><p>They were taking inbound calls, we took hundreds of inbound calls, reaching, making outbound calls. So, there was active communication going on.</p><p/><p>In this type of situation, you probably didn't get to every single CEO or every single IRO, but we communicated quite actively to a large number of them.</p><p/><p>Then the official communication went out after the close of trading day to everybody.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: OK --</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: Right, so, it happened you know, quite rapidly.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: I get the explanations but we had former Securities and Exchange Commission head, Harvey Pitt on yesterday, he was very harsh.</p><p/><p>You were probably busy working the situation, but he said the Nasdaq handled this \"terribly\". What he didn't like too was when you started the systems up.</p><p/><p>He said you only allowed trading in certain stocks, and he said how can you be fair when you're only allowing certain stocks to get up --</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: Well, I think it's hard for people outside direct involvement with the problem to comment and comment intelligently on it.</p><p/><p>So we have --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Well, you're taking the smack at Harvey Pitt?</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: Well --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: I mean, he's not --</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: I'm just saying for anybody who is not there, right? So, they -- you know the people who are not on the open lines, who are not in the head trader alert communication, it's hard for them to know, right?</p><p/><p>And hard for them to comment intelligently in terms of what happened. So, everybody was directly involved, the exchanges were on what's called the UTP line.</p><p/><p>SIP arranged a line with our members, in addition to that, we had the head trader alert. So, that happened all the way and each plan, right?</p><p/><p>And we solved the problem within half an hour, right? And certain members made a request in terms of having a longer period of time to quote --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: OK --</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: Instead of five-15 minutes, that cost a half hour of time to get ready for that. So, that communication was there and I think to the extent that anybody who wasn't involved became involved, we said OK, that was as active as you can get.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You guys are considered the sexier exchange.</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: Yes.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: You know, you've got the lots of the dotcoms of the world but there are some that aren't public yet. Twitter, for example, everybody is waiting for that to go public.</p><p/><p>Do you think you've lost Twitter? Can you make a 30-second pitch to Twitter to say here is why you should still consider listing on Nasdaq?</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: Well, I think it's important to recognize that we aspire towards perfection with respect to the operations of our systems.</p><p/><p>And technology people, Twitter and all the companies recognize that. We will always fall short of that but we have to keep trying, right?</p><p/><p>And we get better all the time, and the number of problems have actually declined. But probably as importantly, we have to make sure we handle problems in the proper way, right?</p><p/><p>So, what we did yesterday, right, nobody wanted to be down for three hours and if we had been quite reckless we could have been up a lot sooner than that.</p><p/><p>But I think the procedures we had in place, the industry had in place worked well. So, we would say to any technology-based company, we're not perfect, right?</p><p/><p>We're 99.99 percent perfect, we're not perfect, we'll have problems but if we do, we're going to make sure we maintain a fair and orderly market.</p><p/><p>And that's what we did yesterday. And it's important to recognize the fact we didn't trade for several hours. If you're a traditional long investor, a mom-and-pop, institutional investor, that three hours doesn't matter.</p><p/><p>You're buying the stock for the longer period of time, right? And the fact is, every single person was in the same situation. Nobody was relatively advantaged or disadvantaged because the market was down for that --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: I --</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: Period of time.</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Some moms and pops are a little more sophisticated these days and like to trade a lot. But either way, we appreciate you coming on Fox --</p><p/><p>GREIFELD: Right --</p><p/><p>CLAMAN: Business and IMUS IN THE MORNING to talk about this. Bob Greifeld is the CEO of the Nasdaq, we now rejoin IMUS IN THE MORNING on Fox Business and on radio. Back to you.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Praise God --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p/><p>IMUS: He sounds like he might have had a head injury, doesn't he?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>Jesus -- well, he's been up all night --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: But Warner was on top of it over there, I saw --</p><p/><p>IMUS: What do you think, Warner?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, my question is if you grabbed his hands, could he talk? I mean, that guy just broke the record for gestures with hands.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What does that mean?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, it means you're not quite comfortable enough with just verbalizing and you think you have to emphasize everything --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, he's on the spot here. My favorite part of the interview is when Liz breathlessly --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Like she said, you don't have your arms wrapped around your problem. What kind of question is that?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>Don't have your arms wrapped around -- oh, God.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That was fun.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So we don't know anything, do we? We don't know any more now than we knew, so --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: It's kind of what I was thinking, there was --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Man, at least she got him on.</p><p/><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, IMUS IN THE MORNING: She'll get all this press all day long, she interviewed him and it's all good.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: You need to get Warner to analyze all our business interviews from now on, on the 11:00 show with me, it would be great, Warner.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Sure, I'll be --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Or anybody who is on --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Right --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Who we can see --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, could be great --</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>RUFINO: I was looking at Connell's --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Liar --</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Yes, before and --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Look at this --</p><p/><p>IMUS: We didn't have any answers.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But she asked the right questions, just --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, she did --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Damn right --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: She was fine, yes --</p><p/><p>IMUS: That breathless --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: At least --</p><p/><p>IMUS: I don't know, it's fine, she's fine.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's all fine, it's all good.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: It's all --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Really is --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Good --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Quote Mark Seliger and Rusty Truck, \"It's All Good\".</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p/><p>IMUS: What are we supposed to do now? 17 after the hour?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Some sports, you know --</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right, let's do that, sponsored by Peerless Boilers, good morning, Warner.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Good morning, i-man. All right, here we go, Yanks beat the Jays 5- 3, they sweep the series 10 out of 12. A blown call by the umpire in the bottom of the fifth with the bases loaded really gave the Yanks a huge break.</p><p/><p>Here was the call by Michael Kay, \"YES Network\".</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MICHAEL KAY, SPORTSCASTER: Right through the centerfield, it is caught. It's going to be -- no, he drops the ball about five seconds and it is a double play.</p><p/><p>He's tagging everybody whether it's a double play, the ending inning. Did he make the catch?</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No --</p><p/><p>KAY: Now they're saying that he didn't make the catch?</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, he didn't make the catch --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes --</p><p/><p>WOLF: So, instead of a double play ending the inning, Wells was given an RBI, the Yanks took the lead and never trailed. And this is exactly what videotape replay will be used next year.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, thank God.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p/><p>RUFINO: That will help --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes --</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Everything --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Amen --</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Game will be five hours.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, fantastic --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Clayton Kershaw --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, that's just great, Warner --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Bring the videotape delay --</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Well, the umpires are still looking --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, they're supposed to --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Hey, what sporting activity is around today, Warner?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well today, you have -- if you want to watch NFL football tonight, Seahawks, Packers, Bears and Raiders.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, I'll watch that and I might watch the Seahawks.</p><p/><p>WOLF: And also you can watch the little league game between Westport and Sammamish.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh --</p><p/><p>WOLF: That will be --</p><p/><p>IMUS: What time is that?</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's a 3:00 game.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Is that Eastern Time?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes, Westport --</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, Williamsport --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right --</p><p/><p>WOLF: And of course, the winner will play Chula Vista for the U.S. title.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, yes --</p><p/><p>WOLF: So, that's a huge game.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Anything else?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, kind of funny, you have Brian Wilson, a pitch to the ninth inning of the Dodgers game.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They did --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Take a look at him, if you don't know, the big beard and he's been offered a million dollars to shave his beard by 800razors.com.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes --</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's it. In golf, Kevin Stadler has the first round lead of the Charles Barkley tournament as you have said.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right --</p><p/><p>WOLF: And --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That was unfunny joke three hours ago when --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Oh --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: You just going to ride it until it's --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Oh, yes --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: But yesterday was funny --</p><p/><p>WOLF: I think it's clever, yes --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, very well --</p><p/><p>WOLF: It's a terrible joke but it's clever.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: A good line --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, it is --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Tiger Woods was three back at 67 and Rory McIlroy who Gary Player said needs a good woman, had three double-bogeys.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>In football last night, the Panthers beat the Ravens, all four touchdowns came on turnovers. Two interceptions, a punt return and a fumble return.</p><p/><p>And the Lions beat the Patriots 40 to 9.

New home sales for July are expected to fall 1.5 percent from June to 490,000.</p><p/><p>That would be a disappointing reading after existing home sales for last month jumped 6.5 percent to their highest level in four years.</p><p/><p>But the mood of the housing market does appear to be improving. Home builders confidence jumped last week to its highest level in eight years despite rising interest rates.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Meanwhile, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman says the Yanks will win --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Hello?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Hello? --</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, wait --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Hello, Warner.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>WOLF: Hey, Brian.

Our last day from the ranch for this summer, so -- and Glenn and everybody out here, Glenn is great and been doing it forever. He and his crew, and Glenn and Ken, Ken's great. Glenn's great and kid over here with the camera and the woman whatever her name is.</p><p/><p>In fact, I know these people and only worked with them 15 years, but it's a great crew here at the ranch. They really, they're here on -- they're never late and everything works.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Very good.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And they're real pros. And out of Albuquerque and do a lot of film work and they're real professionals and I greatly appreciate it, like all of them. It's 31 past the hour. Time for a Bernie Briefing and that's sponsored by My Pillow. Here with it is Bernard McGuirk. Good morning, Mr. McGuirk.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, Mr. Imus. Yesterday, as Warner Wolf pointed out, the day before yesterday, Ichiro Suzuki, 4,000 hits combined with his Japanese career and his Major League Baseball career. And this dude, JJ from Staten Island called in, as sportsgreat.com writes and so it began on Mike Francesa's dozy time sleep train as our host lambasted a startled caller on Yankees celebration of Ichiro's 4,000 hits and repeated himself. JJ stayed Suzuki had an accomplishment. Take a listen.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>MIKE FRANCESA, SPORTS RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: JJ in Staten Island, what's up.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's very, very unbelievable accomplishment, you know?</p><p/><p>FRANCESA: No, I don't know. I disagree completely. Disagree completely and I think it's ridiculous. He has 4,000 hits? Why? We now, the Major League and the Japanese leagues are now co-leagues? He has 2,700 major league hits. He doesn't have anything more than that. I think it's utterly ridiculous that we are now going to act like Ichiro got 4,000 hits. He didn't get 4,000 hits, he has 2,700 hits. I give you that, but only 2700 hits as far as we're concerned.</p><p/><p>He doesn't have 3,000 hits and how the heck does he have 4,000 hits? I mean, when did that start? When did we start mingling the Japan statistics with the American statistics? He's got 2,700 Major League hits. He doesn't have 4,000 Major League hits. It doesn't make sense to me. When did we decide that? Who decided the Japanese hits are equal to the major league hits. We've got the statistics.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Stop, stop, if I wanted to listen to him, I'd listen. I know he does that, repeats himself ad nauseam. I love Mike, but --</p><p/><p>RUFINO: I think it's a great accomplishment.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But it's unlistenable.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: And sportscreed.com, they write, of course, Francesa's argument is fatuous, the only surprise there being that he stayed awake long enough to make it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What are you doing, be like if you're trying to rope, Wyatt.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, Wyatt.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Wait a second, what's going on there.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Are you roping today?</p><p/><p>WYATT: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK, I'm going to fool with you, talk to you when you're backing your horse in the box on the rope.</p><p/><p>WYATT: You're not doing anything, you're talking.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Physical.</p><p/><p>WYATT: And having breakfast while you're talking.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're purposely going out of your way to annoy me.</p><p/><p>WYATT: I'm bringing you breakfast.</p><p/><p>IMUS: If I could, I'd whip your little ass no, no, leave my yogurt away.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: And have your own kid spitting in your coffee soon.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Soon?</p><p/><p>IMUS: He makes me laugh as much as anybody on the planet. God, he's funny. What are you saying?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: I was saying that I'm done and we're late for Tom Friedman, cutting into Tom Friedman's time. It's an outrage.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, get the whining comy on, 25 until the hour.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network, and now, here is Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, everyone. Some of the most important economic figures in the world are gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the fed annual conference. A big difference this year is that Fed Chairman Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>won't be attending due to a scheduling conflict. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will also miss this meeting. The main focus of the conference, though, will be the impact of the fed's unconventional policies at home and abroad.</p><p/><p>Now let's get the latest on weather from meteorologist Maria Molina in our Fox Business Weather Center. Hi, Maria.</p><p/><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOX BUSINESS WEATHER CENTER: Hi. Good morning, Diane. Good morning, everyone. Today we're looking at a beautiful day across sections of the northeast. Yesterday, we had storms roll through, leaving behind lower humidity and also pleasant temperatures, like in New York City, 83 degrees for a high temperature and parts of the Midwest and the plains heating in the upper 80's and widespread 90's and feeling like August across the center of the country.</p><p/><p>And out west, a danger of fires, and red flags, that leaves the hours and eventually into the west. Much-need rain across parts of Nevada, Utah and across parts of Southern California, several inches could fall out here so flooding could be a concern. Diane, back to you.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Maria Molina from the weather center. Let's take a quick look at futures. Those have been searching for direction today. Dow futures are now up by 2 points. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's 20 minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Please welcome now from the New York sometimes, Tom Friedman. Good morning, Mr. Friedman.</p><p/><p>TOM FRIEDMAN, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" (via telephone): Good morning, Don.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Wonder how long the \"New York Times\" is going to stay in business?</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: Gosh, you know, I really think, you know, we've got a strong enough global brand, I don't worry about the times per se, but what I worry, if you look at the numbers, our -- the newspaper ads, you know, have been, I don't know how long it is, six, nine, 12 quarters, you know, they continue to decline and you know, you just hope that we'll find a bottom.</p><p/><p>We're still making a profit, thank God, but if that doesn't find a bottom, you know, at some point, you know, it will affect obviously what we can do, but you hope it will find a bottom. I don't know if you realize, I think last quarter, the quarter before, we made more money selling the paper than we did from advertising and like that's a huge line to cross.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, and are you working on another book?</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: I'm thinking about something, Don. You know, sort of pushing ahead from the last book I did that used to be about just kind of the new phase of globalization where it's going, technology, how it's all merging, how it's affecting business, education, et cetera. It's germinating in my head, but I'm not quite there yet, but thinking about something on the Middle East, too.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're not kidding. That sounds hideous. You've got to come up with a better idea than that. Geez, are you kidding me? Nobody's going to read that.</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: You want to write a book called \"The World Is Flat\" nobody's going to read that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, no.</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: I'm thinking about something.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That was a great book, though, the olive tree and that stuff, but this latest one. Have you just given up? Said the hell with it?</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Anyway, let me ask you a couple of serious questions. Syria, what the hell is going on there?</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: Well, we don't have the conclusive proof, but you look at those pictures of those bodies, don, how they died, unmarked by any kind of wounds, you know, it's pretty clear the regime used some kind of chemical weapon and obviously Obama said that would be a red line. They already crossed it once. What he will do this time once it's conclusively proved, I don't know.</p><p/><p>There's a big discussion at the White House yesterday, as you reported, that three hours where they debated what to do. One of the problems, the problem is this so let's say we launched a cruise missile attack in response to this to deter chemical weapons.</p><p/><p>What targets to hit. Do you cause more refugee outflow from Syria and destabilize Jordan, for instance? So there's a lot of real-- so many moving parts with this, it's going to be a difficult one to sort out, but, you know, I'm glad they're considering something because once you start introducing those kind of weapons, you know, it's Katie bar the door.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What would you recommend that we do?</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: You know, I would be in favor of -- as I sit here right now, I'd be in favor of some kind of military response at that simply says we're not going to tolerate that. The world is not going to tolerate that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Would you want troops on the ground?</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: No, no, I'm talking about some kind of aerial response. It's sort of something I'd be ready to consider. I want to see all the facts, they haven't all come out, some kind of response not just by us, but by the world, the allies, NATO that draws a red line there. I think it's something that it's really worth considering.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Talking with Tom Friedman from the \"New York Times\" who probably has an e-mail address at the times in which you can contact him and here is what I'd like you to do, send him some ideas for a book. He hasn't got any. And every day I say to Connell, well, why should I care about Egypt? So, let me ask you, why should I?</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: You know, there are a lot of reasons, Don. It's a country of 85 million people. It sits astride the Suez Canal. It's the partner with Israel in the Camp David peace treaty and has been traditionally the bedrock of the geopolitics there and the leader of the Arab world, as Egypt goes, so goes the Arab world.</p><p/><p>You want the country to have a decent outcome of this revolutionary process. The problem in Egypt right now, Don, you've had two choices historically, that is either the army or the Muslim Brotherhood. In Egypt if you look at its history oscillated between those two for the last 60-odd years.</p><p/><p>And the question, really, is can they-- can they find a third way, a way that's actually forward-looking, inclusive, progressive that doesn't just involve one of these narrow-minded options or the other? You know, one of the things that's been rattling around in my head, Don. Princess Di once said with Prince Charles there are three people in this marriage.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: Historically we've looked at Egypt and saying there's two people in the marriage, the Muslim Brotherhood and the army. If that's the choice we'll go with the army, with Mubarak, but we talked about this in earlier conversation, I think there are three people in this story now, there's the military, the Muslim Brotherhood and Mother Nature.</p><p/><p>And by that, I mean there is all of these incredible water, environmental population stresses that have built up over the last 60 years, precisely because of the incompetence of the military government and the Muslim Brotherhood in managing the problems and stresses, if they don't get the act together, find a third way that can sort of tilt Egypt forward to deal with some of these problems, Don, half the women in Egypt can't read.</p><p/><p>After $30 billion in U.S. aid, over the last 30-odd years, half the women still can't read and these other social stresses I think are just going to blow the place apart.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What in your view would be a decent outcome in Egypt?</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: I think a decent outcome would be a government that would -- where the military says to this government that they've appointed and they actually-- when they ousted the Muslim Brotherhood government they appointed a new president and he appointed a new cabinet. And you know some of these people and they're pretty decent people, if they would assign that government the task of writing a new constitution, one that would guarantee minority rights, that would be -- that would guarantee women's rights, that would be basically progressive leaning and take out some of the bad stuff the Muslim Brotherhood had in the constitution, and begin to organize an elective process gradually.</p><p/><p>Giving time for not just the Muslim Brotherhood or Islamists as it were, but the liberal and progressive parties to get organize and contest that election, to put Egypt on that gradual transition path, not to just stop with the military government.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Why did you decide to employ the Princess Di analogy?</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: I have no idea. It popped into my head there. There are three different parties in this story now.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're a weird dude, sometimes, so -- but you do sometimes in your columns it works well.</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Have you gotten away this summer at all?</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: A little bit. Just kind of on and off. I just turned 60, Don. So I'm going out to California next week.</p><p/><p>IMUS: When was your birthday?</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: July 20th.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, happy birthday.</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: Thank you very much.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You look pretty good for 60. I guess 60 is -- 60 is getting up there.</p><p/><p>FRIEDMAN: I'm trying to take care of myself. In this day and age, there are a few miles on these treads so I'm trying to take care of myself, and looking forward to getting away.</p><p/><p>IMUS: In spite of what you think, the times is not long for this world so get a good idea for a book. Tom Friedman.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. It's time to check the markets now, the day after the Nasdaq flash free that halted trading for three hours. The U.S. futures are fairly flat this morning, but now point to go a higher open. Dow futures are up 3. The S&amp;P is up about 1. The Nasdaq is up 3.5.</p><p/><p>Over in Europe, we got the second quarter reading on second quarter GDP in the U.K. and Germany, both rose 7/10 of a percent. London is now up about 37. Paris is down barely and Frankfurt is up 16.</p><p/><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" says that federal prosecutors are turning up the pressure in an insider trading case against a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital. The new indictment unsealed yesterday alleges that Matthew Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an Alzheimer's drug trial at the heart of the case.</p><p/><p>Martoma is accused of using insider information about results of that drug trial, which then allowed SAC Capital to make $275 million in profits. He's due to go on trial in November. A hearing is set for this morning, SAC Capital has been charged with encouraging insider trader, but Steven Cohen, the hedge fund's founder has not been charged. Cohen and his firm deny any wrongdoing.</p><p/><p>Here's a look at commodities now. We're watching oil and gold for you this morning. Those have been also fairly flat. Oil is now down up 13 cents. Gold is up 20. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He looks like he is he doesn't have any energy, doesn't he? Here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, coming up on the radio, a fascinating, funny conversation with the great Terry Bradshaw.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And before that, it's 9:20 Eastern Time on the Fox Business Network. The lying limey, Stuart Varney, so --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: We love Varney.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I do like Varney a lot. So I don't know.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: What's wrong?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, and the Godfather is going to be on to talk about -- I forget what he's going to talk about. What, Godfather.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Good question.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Down, Godfather.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: The gentleman --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Can barely hear the Godfather, so the Godfather decided well, mail it in this morning. Did he have his mic off, Connell?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: I think his headphones were down and he couldn't hear.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: Turn it up.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Now he's better. And solving yet another problem and working through a lot this morning.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Got to project, Rob.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: Yes, sir.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: He couldn't hear.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Also, you did a -- a lousy job on the last script. Why was that?</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: I'm a little under the weather today. It affected my performance, I apologize.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What's the matter with you?</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: Got a little bit of a -- a touch of a bug, I think.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, why didn't you tell me that instead of turning in a performance that sucks? Because we don't have to do it, you know?</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: Just, I'm going to suck it up, I didn't --</p><p/><p>IMUS: No, you didn't suck it up because you gave in like a finocchio.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Finocchio.</p><p/><p>IMUS: To your little sniffles.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: I have 135 fever.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You gave in to your 135 degree fever and provided all of us with a weenie performance.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Struggling, Rob, the last couple.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It would be better if you said to me, Don, I don't feel great and I would say, fine. So every time you want off, I mean, you ever -- a problem getting off when you need it? Of course not, neither one of you.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox NewsNetwork, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. We are taking a look at the markets this morning after yesterday's flash freeze at the NASDAQ, it's been a fairly flat morning today. We currently got future is in the red, Dow futures are down about 15, we've got the S&amp;P down about one point, the NASDAQ is down about a quarter of a point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Looking over at oil and gold, those are in the green this morning, we've got oil up about $0.16 cents, gold is up almost $4. Looking at Asia, those markets finished today mixed and for all the details on how they got there, let's go to business reporter Jacqueline Maddock in Beijing. Hi, Jacqueline.</p><p>JACQUELINE MADDOCK, BUSINESS REPORTER: Hi, Diane. Yes. It was a bit of a mixed results here for Friday afternoon, here in the mainland and also in Hong Kong. Markets lost ground throughout the afternoon largely because of some pretty disappointing corporate results particularly from Everbright Security if you remember that, the brokerage firm responsible for last Friday's fat-finger fiasco and it was the banks did the biggest falls today, that whispers that the PBO is preparing to unleash the new regulations on China's banking sector, China merchant banks down more than three percent.</p><p>But as you say, a different story in Japan, the Nikkei climbed Diane, more than two percent, and every markets that day indeed in the green which is a -- and that was as the yen moved up to the 99 point level accept the Tepco, Diane. Obviously Tepco, the Fukushima nuclear plant operator -- Tepco, fell another five percent at it looks that though as contamination leak has -- some way to play out (INAUDIBLE). Across to Australia though there where markets climbed almost four percent still running high on China's PMI numbers from yesterday, results of stocks love to see signs that China's economy is getting back on track -- Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: All right. Jacqueline Maddock from Beijing. Thanks, Jacqueline.</p><p>And now, for a look at the European markets, let's go live to London where Jan Lambregts, global head of financial markets research at Rabobank is now joining us. Jan, we saw some positive second quarter GDP reports from the UK and Germany confirmed by the follow-up reading. Any surprise there, and why aren't markets having more reaction to that?</p><p>It looks like we just lost Jan. We will try to get him back in a second but let's take a look at the European markets. You can see London up about 16, Parris is down about 12, Frankfurt up about three. Again, those positive GDP report possibly being mitigated by a little un-eased there over the NASDAQ freeze. But let's take a look at some of the important economic news we'll be looking forward to and one of them is a big meeting coming up, some of the most important economic figures in the world are gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the Kansas City Fed's annual conference but one difference is here, is that the biggest figure of the mall, Fed Chairman Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>won't be attending due to a scheduling conflict.</p><p>The main focus of the conference will be the impact of the Fed's unconventional policies both at home and abroad and FOX Business's Peter Barnes is there. He will have reports for us throughout the morning.</p><p>And we've got Jan Lambregts back again, global head of financial markets research at Rabobank. Jan, I'm not sure if you heard my question the first-time, but we're looking at these GDP reports from the UK and Germany both coming in positive. Any big surprise here?</p><p>JAN LAMBREGTS, RABOBANK FINANCIAL MARKETS RESEARCH: Not really. And I don't think the markets really watching it too closely, second revisions, it adds to the general trend that things are a little bit better in Europe but still not great. I think a lot of people in the market can be watching more of these headlines coming out of Jackson Hole and thinking what that would mean for, for tapering than watching these GDP figures.</p><p>MACEDO: Markets still seem a little tentative today. You know, good GDP information and yet, they're fairly flat. Paris is even down. Are people tentative this morning over what happened at the NASDAQ yesterday?</p><p>LAMBREGTS: I don't think that is not necessarily overshadowing. Like I said, I think the more tentative reacting to positive GDP which is a fairly old number, second quarters after all, more worried that had lines later today as more news comes from Jackson Hole, actually shift perceptions in how likely tapering is and how much tapering is we will see in September.</p><p>MACEDO: All right. It's all about stimulus, Jan Lambregts at Rabobank. We appreciate it. Thanks.</p><p>LAMBREGTS: You're welcome.</p><p>MACEDO: And the Wall Street Journal says, federal prosecutors are turning up the pressure in an insider-trading case against the former portfolio manager at SAC Capital. A new indictment unsealed yesterday alleges that Matthew Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an Alzheimer's drug trial at the heart of the case. Martoma is accused of using insider information about results of that drug trial to allow SAC Capital to make $275 million in profits. He is due to go on trial in November and a hearing is set for this morning.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: So, Doug Chrispin (ph), he's a -- but he's a local rancher and he's doing all kinds of stuff, he won the New Mexico, may it's a national bow and arrow contest that I told you about Mike, from Texas, bans all these -- here. So he says to me, you know, it took awhile for Delbert McClinton to catch on in Austin. All right.</p><p>I said, who's -- they found that of course. So he says who is better? Name one person who is better in Austin than Delbert McClinton? He said, there are lots of people. I said what? I didn't have my gun with me, fortunately.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Thank God. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: He said Omar and the Howlers.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: Oh, those guys.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: Oh, yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: Omar and the Howlers?</p><p>IMUS: I said, Omar and the Howlers?</p><p>WOLF: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: So, we were at the horse barn, up at the horse barn. So, I got in the truck and went back to the house and go to iTunes.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And listened to Omar and the Howlers.</p><p>MCSHANE: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: And they suck.</p><p>MCSHANE: Hey, Omar.</p><p>IMUS: I thought he was kidding.</p><p>MCSHANE: He said, Omar --</p><p>IMUS: And then he is a big Joe Walsh fan. You know? I said, well, have you seen that Eagles? Didn't have any interest. Do you like the Eagles? He said they are all right. So when I first heard the Eagles, sounded like a cross between the Beach Boys and the four perhaps.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh-oh!</p><p>IMUS: Well.</p><p>MCGUIRK: You got to carry that gun at all times.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, be ready.</p><p>IMUS: The only place I don't carry it is on the ranch for some reason.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: Omar and the Howlers?</p><p>IMUS: Omar and the Howlers?</p><p>RUFINO: I'm probably the only person who knew that band that you just mentioned.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>RUFINO: Yes. I played that band in college.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you did.</p><p>RUFINO: -- Back in school and they still together barely alive.</p><p>IMUS: Well, they may not, he is going back years, so.</p><p>RUFINO: Omar and the Howlers.</p><p>GUNZELMAN: This guy is crazy.</p><p>IMUS: That is insane, didn't he?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Lunacy.</p><p>IMUS: Paul Begala is coming up this morning. We no longer need him, so.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's not right.</p><p>IMUS: One of my new best friends, one of them, is Bill Powers, the president of U.T., the University of Texas. So, I better not blow of Begala just yet. You know? And Tom Friedman. Hey, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Who won those little league world series games?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Tijuana beat Panama. So, Tijuana, they will now play Tokyo for the international championship and the Westport Washington State game was rained out. So, they will play today at 3:00.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And the winner will play Chula Vista for the title on Sunday.</p><p>IMUS: And the winner of that will play either Tijuana or Tokyo.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Probably.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Which is it? Tijuana or --</p><p>WOLF: Well, Tijuana beat Panama. So, Tijuana will play Tokyo.</p><p>IMUS: That is what I just said.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>WOLF: That's right.</p><p>MCSHANE: We got it, yes.</p><p>WOLF: Yes. We had some other stories too.</p><p>IMUS: What are they?</p><p>WOLF: Well, the umpire, they blew a call in the Yankee game which is going to fit right in with next year's videotape replay. They messed up a caught ball and called it a trap and we have got Ryan Braun, what a phony, man. Instead of --</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: You're kidding, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: He comes out --</p><p>IMUS: Hey, Tom, should we have a breaking news thing up on the FOX News Channel, the business channel?</p><p>WOLF: That's right. This just in. But the way he did it, he apologize that he made a mistake, but it was issued in a statement. I mean, he didn't even have the, you know, guts to stand up and faced the press. Really weak. And the other thing, you had two exhibition football games last night. And finally we are going to hear about Jeremy Lin, cut out the whining. Remember him? Jeremy Lin.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, of course.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Today is his birthday.</p><p>WOLF: Oh, it is?</p><p>IMUS: Yes. He's 25 today.</p><p>WOLF: Well, maybe give him some slack.</p><p>IMUS: Jay Mohr, of the funnier people on the planet is 43 today. OK.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Happy Birthday.</p><p>IMUS: And Dagen McDowell is not here again.</p><p>MCSHANE: She's out again, yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: So, I said, well, she said she can't put anything on her face. How about a paper bag?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, she did. You went there. It wasn't funny.</p><p>IMUS: And there is something here we don't know. I don't know what it is. But man, there is something here. Hey, what happened to the NASDAQ yesterday?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. It was a mess with the computers, they don't know 100 percent what happened but they had to halt the number, all the stocks that trade on it and the middle of the day, it went down for hours which is odd, Wall Street has had a number of computer problems the last few years but there is a report this morning, there may have been some connectivity issues with another exchange so they continue their investigation. No panic.</p><p>IMUS: NASDAQ stocks.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, no panic on the market though. You know?</p><p>IMUS: You want to get listed on the NASDAQ, you can't get on the big one. Right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No. That's Apple and all these big tech companies if you're over on the NASDAQ, Google, Microsoft.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, they are?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, so.</p><p>IMUS: I have been to see Cavuto yesterday, he looks great. You know, that?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Sometimes he needs to take good care of himself as he should. But man, he looks terrific. He is really good. You know who else is pretty good is that Charles Payne guy.</p><p>MCSHANE: Charles Payne, yes, absolutely, good guy. Yep.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No pain, no gain.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: What is coming up with you, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Sydney Leathers.</p><p>IMUS: Oh God.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. Well, this is true. She made a porn tape.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, please.</p><p>MCGUIRK: .called Weiner and me but that is not where this stops. She very well may have exposed herself to HIV.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, wow!</p><p>IMUS: Not amusing. That is your hilarious Bernie briefing this morning?</p><p>MCGUIRK: I was not presenting that as a joke.</p><p>MCSHANE: No punch-line there.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's a story. You remember that kid that gave the rousing speech at Georgia tech?</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, he may have ripped it off from somebody. And he was interviewed by your friend Neil Cavuto yesterday. We have little piece of that.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Cavuto is -- all over him, just the -- it was great. But he may not be for real.</p><p>IMUS: Rob Bartlett and Tony Powell are both here this morning. They're both appearing places. Rob is going to be at the Leavitt Theater in Ogunquit, Maine.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Ogunquit.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. September 21st. For tickets, go to Robshow.com. And Tony Powell, Powell to the People, he will be appearing at the Belmar Theater on Saturday, September 28th. That is coming up here pretty soon and you can get tickets to that by either calling that theater there. The Belmar Theater, or go to NewYorkentertainmentclub.com. I guess, he gets stuff there. It is 13 after the hour, let's do some news. And here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Hey, good morning, I-man. The number of refugees created by the Syrian civil war has not topped one million, a million refugees and a U.N. agency adding to that says 740,000 of them are children under age 11. So, some numbers, it all comes out as we are seeing new pictures of what the rebels claim are another chemical weapons attack.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And this is the fourteenth time that the central regime uses chemical weapons against innocent civilians and each time we've asked and we've said that the international community does not move this, the regime will enlarge the scale that use these chemical weapons.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: And the U.N. secretary-general did say today, these claims of chemical weapons must be investigated immediately. We also have reports this morning coming in of Israeli airstrikes just south of Beirut said to be a response to four rockets that were fired yesterday into Israel. Back here at home, you mention the problems on Wall Street yesterday, computer problems at the NASDAQ, trading stocks listed there. The Apples and the Google of the world, a lot of big tech names were halted in the middle of the day because of problems with the system that disseminates quotes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Is it going to affect the way that they look at individual companies and want to invest in companies for 10, 15 or 20 years? No. It will just going to say that this game is not really being played.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Jonathan Kurpido (ph) works at the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Now, to get more on that, this web site All Things D is reporting this morning. NASDAQ thinks the issue may be a problem with connectivity at a rival exchange.</p><p>IMUS: What does that mean?</p><p>MCSHANE: This another digital exchange, NYSCR by the way, the New York Stock Exchange digital component that there may have been problems with the two exchanges connecting with one another. Apparently, according to this report, and they are basically saying --</p><p>IMUS: Each other by the way. But go ahead.</p><p>MCSHANE: You are right. May say, more on this later on but I don't know exactly what the --</p><p>IMUS: How do we know it wasn't deliberate?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Sabotage.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, there all these rumors going around yesterday, and it's where the NASDAQ was not really that transparent about it, didn't talk about it during the day, it's hard to get all of them, there are no comments and then the rumors, what if there was a cyber attack and all this kind of thing. That is what people were worried about.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, the Russians.</p><p>MCSHANE: But no evidence of that at all and now they're saying that could have been the exchanges, digital exchanges having trouble connecting with each other but --</p><p>IMUS: Everybody is lying.</p><p>MCSHANE: Probably.</p><p>IMUS: Don't you think?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, the thing, you know, I thought there was sort of reassuring about it is, that the markets, not like the market -- or crashed yesterday on this when people, you know, wasn't that many jitters.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: The Dow was actually up. The NASDAQ ended up. So, you know, got through it. And they've been computer problems in the past. The last big one I guess was like three years ago. Although, the NASDAQ had big time issue about Facebook IPO. You may remember.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. That was a mess. But this, we will see. The investigation continues and we will get more on it later today, exactly what happened, so.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes, great.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, from Washington --</p><p>IMUS: Sixteen after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Connell continues.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, you'll going to start hearing talk about a possible government shutdown again. I know you will be looking forward to that. More than a third of House Republicans urging the Speaker John Boehner to shut down the government rather than fund the president's health-care law. They sent him a letter on that 80 Republicans yesterday.</p><p>And then we have this U.S. soldier who killed 16 civilians in Afghanistan last year, he apologized yesterday for the first time for what he called his act of cowardice. The Staff Sergeant Robert Bales is in the middle of a sentencing hearing. Here is Marc Edwards, he's a friend of his who used to play in the NFL, this guy Marc Edwards, he spoke with reporters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARC EDWARDS, FORMER NFL PLAYER: The person I knew a long time ago has changed quite a bit, the experience that he's had over there. I am not in a position to understand. None of us are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: None of us are, he says. Well, the sentencing hearing will continue there. And there's no --</p><p>IMUS: Why are you repeating what the people are saying?</p><p>MCSHANE: I just thought it was a little fuzzy.</p><p>IMUS: Sounds like Conan O'Brien.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program sponsored by Hackensack University Medical Center, a place where medicine meets innovation. What were you saying now?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, no verdict for the Fort Hood shooter. That continues deliberations yesterday. And the final thing in the news is Bradley Manning who we talked about a lot in the show yesterday. He says, he felt that he has been a female since childhood and he wants people to refer to him as Chelsea. So, this is the convicted Wiki leaker so to speak. Back in forth, Leavenworth begin serving 35 years in a military prison.</p><p>Now, a military spokesman said, if Bradley wants to change his name to Chelsea, a name change would have to be approved in court, then a petition submitted to the army to make it official. So, that's where we are on all that.</p><p>IMUS: The Godfather will have some thoughts on Bradley Manning and his wishes coming up here in just a little bit. This moment is also sponsored by the Hackensack University Medical Center, a place where medicine meets innovation, the home of the Deirdre Imus environmental health center. So, well, any business news? Business news incidentally Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Is presented by this clown over here at the -- well, he is not a clown, that is unfortunate, Don.</p><p>MCSHANE: Clown?</p><p>IMUS: Dr. Gill Leatherman.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh!</p><p>IMUS: Hit the cancer.</p><p>MCSHANE: Hit the cancer, baby.</p><p>IMUS: Hit the cancer. Shut-up.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, it's OK.</p><p>IMUS: This radio search deal, he has got going.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: You can call Dr. Gill Leatherman at 212-scam -- no, not scam.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, no, that's not the word.</p><p>IMUS: That's unfortunate.</p><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p>IMUS: 212-choices. What is going on in business news other than the tedious NASDAQ deal?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, that's the big I guess story up. I'll give you an update on the markets on where we are. The Dow futures are down a little bit this morning. But the Dow was up yesterday, actually the first time it was up in seven sessions. Got lost a little bit in that NASDAQ story.</p><p>IMUS: I'll be darn.</p><p>MCSHANE: .of 66 to 14,963. So, not much of an effect in terms of the markets going up and down from that NASDAQ mess, the traders able to shake it off. Commerce Department today releasing some numbers on new home sales on housing numbers, Dow futures are down this morning by 18 points ahead to all that.</p><p>IMUS: Is that it?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, I mean, yes, there's --</p><p>IMUS: OK. Can't just stop talking. I thought you had a stroke.</p><p>MCSHANE: I thought --</p><p>IMUS: Well, no. But just stop talking. What's the matter with you?</p><p>RUFINO: He stopped.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I know he stopped but I mean, back to you, I-man, anything.</p><p>MCSHANE: That will be the way --</p><p>IMUS: No, no, no.</p><p>RUFINO: Connell do it every time.</p><p>(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p>I am Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: Almost 20 minutes past.</p><p>IMUS: Omar and the Howlers.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Back to you, I-man.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Doug Crispin's big band is the Beatles I guess to him. I guess they are out of AustinTexas, they're coming up here, he told me they were better than Delbert McClinton. I mean, you -- that is insanity, isn't it? Never heard anything like that.</p><p>MCSHANE: Never.</p><p>RUFINO: I can't believe my ears.</p><p>IMUS: There is nobody better than Delbert McClinton. Anyway, Warner with sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Go to Peerlessboilers.com and get one of them. Anyway, it's 20 minutes after the hour, here is Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: Yankees beat the Jays five-three, they sweep the series make it ten of 12, they cut the race for the last wild card team, the three-and- a-half, blown call by the umpire in the bottom of the fifth gave the Yankees the lead for good. Bases loaded, one-out, Michael Kay, Yes Network.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL KAY, YES NETWORK: (INAUDIBLE) To the second and it is a double play. He's tagging everybody but it is a double play to end the inning. Did he kick the catch? Now, they're saying that he didn't make the catch.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Well, if you watch your FOX Business, you can see that he did indeed make the catch. So instead of a double play to end the inning, Wells is given an RBI and the Yankees take the lead. Well, that is one of the things they will correct next year with video tape replay. Dodgers beat the Marlins six-nothing. Clayton Kershaw on the shut out, he's earned run average is now 1.72. And Brian Wilson pitched for the first time in a year and a half in the ninth inning, he struck out two batters and Wilson has been offered $1 million to shave his beard by 800razors.com.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He looks scary like that, man.</p><p>WOLF: Pirates and Cardinals win, Pirates by one. Ryan Braun --</p><p>IMUS: Maybe could have fought ahead with this and had a photograph of him that we could have put up. I guess not.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He makes the duck dynasty guys look like Park Avenue socialites.</p><p>MCSHANE: He really does.</p><p>WOLF: What we did have him after the game, Brian Wilson with this brief comment.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, no.</p><p>WOLF: Ryan Braun has issued a statement through the Brewers. They talked about a guy, he say, he said he was sorry he took the PEDs during the --</p><p>IMUS: You and Doug are going down.</p><p>WOLF: Two-11 MVP year. You know, what? Braun ought to give back the MVP trophy and give it to Matt Kemp.</p><p>IMUS: That is enough sports. I am bored now.</p><p>WOLF: OK. How come, I don't know about a Thursday night football game?</p><p>WOLF: Thursday football. I've got it. Lions beat the Patriots 40 to nine.</p><p>IMUS: How come there wasn't any.</p><p>WOLF: There were two.</p><p>IMUS: They were?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Why you didn't tell me about this?</p><p>WOLF: Well, because you said that was the end of this --</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, but the Lions beat the Patriots -- what?</p><p>WOLF: Forty to nine. Patriots turned the ball over three of the first four possessions.</p><p>IMUS: Tebow play?</p><p>WOLF: Tebow did not play.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, God!</p><p>WOLF: Not a good sign.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He got to bail out Hernandez.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty three after the hour. What is coming up in the briefing, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, Sydney Leathers may have HIV and we have that kid who may be a fraud and Ben Affleck, as Batman.</p><p>IMUS: OK. That is all. This would be Omar and the Howlers. Doug Crispin, told me with a straight face why you thought this loser was better than Delbert McClinton. I mean, how do you even say that with the --</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: Are you kidding me? Some fat hillbilly screaming his guts out? Well, that is ridiculous. If you have not ordered your MyPillow yet, you probably are missing out. You have missed out. I'm also irritated this morning because I slept completely straight through the night. When I woke up, I had to get up. I hate that.

And Moody's investor service says, it may cut the credit ratings of major U.S. banks due to the possibility of reduced government support for the institutions if they ran into financial trouble. The list of banks includes JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. Moody's also says, it may downgrade Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley bonds and it says Bank of America and Citigroup bonds may also be downgraded for the same reasons but they could also be upgraded because the bank's operations are improving.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: So, you did not know I called Bigfoot just foot?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS, WIFE OF DON IMUS: I could not stop laughing, I was crying. You reduced it where you're saving your breath, I guess you just call him foot.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: I mean, it is just -- I couldn't believe it. I mean, that's crazy. It is hilarious.</p><p>IMUS: It's not that funny.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Yes, it is. It is hilarious. I got to get come up with one for you, Lis.</p><p>LIS WIEHL, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: You cannot shorten my name anymore than it already is.</p><p>IMUS: How about Cheapskate?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh my God! Cheapskate is not right.</p><p>WIEHL: This is just not right. How about just Kate?</p><p>IMUS: How about, what?</p><p>WIEHL: Just Kate. You can't say the whole word anyway.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: 30 minutes after the hour. I realize on your TV around the country you do not get to hear these guys, but you could pretty much have a creep off. They just sound creepy to me.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Any distinguished gentleman who comes off to the I-man, I guess is a little eccentric.</p><p>IMUS: He eats puppies. [laughter]</p><p>IMUS: Let's hope that he doesn't. I do not have to suck up anymore.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The hell with him.</p><p>IMUS: We will get him on when we feel like it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Sydney Leathers, she recently , she was in an adult video. It was called Winter and Me. She had sex with this guy. This guy tested positive for HIV. Sydney Leathers and the dude tested negative before and after. HIV negative test results within three months of exposure could be false. It will take a couple of months for Ms. Leathers to find out whether or not she is infected.</p><p>IMUS: We already know that she is infected.</p><p>MCSHANE: She needs to be fumigated, without a doubt.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The kid at Georgia tech welcoming incoming freshman. Take a listen.</p><p>I am telling you, if you want to change the world, you are at Georgia tech. You can do that. If you want to fill the Ironman suit, you are at Georgia tech, you can do that. We are at Georgia tech. We can do that. I am doing that. Double both. [laughter]</p><p>MCGUIRK: One of the top YouTube things. Whatever. Neil Cavuto had the kid on yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: Is life normal now? [laughter]</p><p>It is not quite normal just yet. I am doing my 15 minutes of fame. People have been asking for pictures and autographs.</p><p>CAVUTO: I get that all the time.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Neil Cavuto was not done.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: An amazing young man. I want to hook you up with my daughter. We will talk about that another time. [laughter]</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCGUIRK: You heard that, right? he is playing matchmaker for his daughter. It turns out that this gets high school speech coach, he actually gave a speech just like that. Almost identical. This is the guy, his speech.</p><p>You can do that. That is a lie, you can do that. I am doing that.</p><p>MCGUIRK: There you go. We have all been had. We will see if Neil Cavuto ensues this date.</p><p>John Oliver was talking about legalizing marijuana.</p><p>On that note, if you want this to be taken seriously, how about dancing up the names a little bit. Just a suggestion.</p><p>IMUS: 36 minutes past the hour.</p><p>IMUS: I am a man of the people.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I am Diane Macedo. Peter Barnes has a preview.</p><p>BARNES: Let's just call it taper talk in Jackson Hole. Gathering to hear the latest research on the economy and on monetary policy. The real action takes place on the sidelines. Participants can talk to each other one on one and share information. The big question here is when the Fed could start to wind down, to dial back. The handicapping is that the Fed could start small at its next policy meeting in September.</p><p>The big elephant not in the room is Fed Chairman <person><nameText>Bernanke. </nameText></person>He is skipping the conference for the first time since he became Fed chairman in 2005. He says he has a scheduling conflict. A lot of folks are looking and talking about who may succeed <person><nameText>bernanke </nameText></person>as the chairman. Janet Yellen is here and will monitor a panel on Saturday on her leading rival in the contest. Larry Summers is not attending. Back to you.</p><p>MACEDO: Thank you. Dow futures are down 17. The S&amp;P is down about one.</p><p>Imus in the Morning continues right now on Fox business.</p><p>IMUS: Please welcome to the program our old friend, Paul Begala.</p><p>BEGALA: Good morning.</p><p>IMUS: I was going to apologize for having you on late.</p><p>BEGALA: It was great.</p><p>IMUS: I no longer need you. [laughter]</p><p>BEGALA: You got a better and?</p><p>IMUS: Take a guess.</p><p>BEGALA: The president of the university, he is a terrific guy.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I am his new best friend.</p><p>BEGALA: He has done a great job at the university. Rick Perry has been trying to run him out of that job.</p><p>IMUS: I got a nice letter from him.</p><p>BEGALA: He was a legendary psychology professor.</p><p>IMUS: How much time do you spend there?</p><p>BEGALA: A fair amount.</p><p>IMUS: I love Omar. Where did you see them?</p><p>BEGALA: I have not seen them and I will not see them. Doug christine, that is just kind of a sideline. He is one of the more interesting people I have ever met in my life.</p><p>IMUS: I like Omar a lot. I hate to side with you on anything, but I think you are right. [laughter]</p><p>IMUS: All right. Carolyn Wonderland, ever met her? she is wonderful.</p><p>She came up to our nations capital.</p><p>IMUS: Carolyn Wonderland plays the guitar and that girl can sing the blues. She is the real deal. If you were still advising presidents, what would you advise them to do?</p><p>BEGALA: I would advise caution. Measure twice and cut once. This country suffered previously by rushing into a war where we had no business fighting. We had no threat against our country. What are the threats to America's interest? also to our credibility. Superpowers never bluff. It is a very difficult situation. The chances of it getting worse because of our intervention is very great. Made me the chairman of the caucus. I have been to walter reed. I would be real careful.</p><p>IMUS: Video of these kids dying. That is pretty tough to take. I agree with you.</p><p>We may have to act. We can take out the Air Force. We can take out the sources of the weaponry. He makes a pretty powerful case.</p><p>IMUS: Hillary Clinton going to be the next president?</p><p>God, I hope so. I would have to be the cochairman.</p><p>IMUS: I have to admit, I kind of like her.</p><p>She is strong. She is smart. She did a great job as secretary of state.</p><p>IMUS: Back up a second. What did she do there that was so great?</p><p>She helped and the war. That is a pretty important thing. She tried hard to set the reset button.</p><p>IMUS: This is sad. We will have to put up with for years of it. Eleven minutes till the hour.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I am Diane Macedo. Time to check the markets. Asian markets ended the day split. The Nikkei ended up. And Europe, we got the second reading on second-quarter gdp. Both gross. London is up 13. Here in the U.S., the futures are down.</p><p>We will also get a new reading on the housing market this morning. New home sales are expected to fall 1.5 percent from june. That would be a disappointing reading. The mood of the housing market does appear to be improving. Homebuilder confidence jumped to the highest level last week. Here is a look at commodities now. We are watching oil and gold for you.</p><p>Imus in the Morning continues right now on Fox Business.</p><p>IMUS: Coming up, the Godfather. Apparently, One Direction is the boy band, kind of, on the today show doing something. Power to the people. Some of them have been out there all night long. Five minutes until the hour.</p><p>IMUS: Welcome to the Imus in the Morning program.</p><p>BARTLETT: Thank you. Thank you very much. Hey, hey, hey. Maybe I am going deaf, maybe I am going crazy, but that new Robin Thicke song sounds like Marvin Gaye. That boy have to give it up. He is just joining an old standing tradition of rock and roll riff off jobs. Jesus, he is so fine. Vanilla Ice stole, but only because he knew he could take that dude in a fist fight. He is suing Marvin Gaye's family to prevent them from suing him. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and I wholeheartedly agree. Sometimes, it is a crime when people just cannot do their own thing. You hear me, Lady Gaga? You Madonna wannabes. [laughter]</p><p>IMUS: That is not funny.</p><p>DON IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network. And now here is Diane Macedo.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning everyone. Yesterday's flash freeze at the NASDAQ has been traced to a connectivity issue. According to All Things Digital sources say officials at NASDAQ OMX Group which owns the exchange are pointing to a connectivity problem with NYSE Arca as the trigger for that three-hour trading halt. A NYSE spokesman declined to comment but NASDAQ officials did acknowledge that connectivity issue they just wouldn't say who the exchange participant was.</p><p>Now the trouble started at about 12:15 p.m. Eastern when NASDAQ said it was halting trading in NASDAQ listed stocks. Sources say it took the exchange another half hour to determine it had fixed the problem. But the reopening process which required regulatory approval and testing took more than two hours. All Things D says NASDAQ executives expect the normal start to trading this morning.</p><p>Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., futures have been fairly flat, but to the downside this morning Dow futures are down 16, the S&amp;P is down one point, the NASDAQ is down just a fraction of a point.</p><p>And for a recap on the Asian markets now, let's go to business reporter Jacqueline Maddock in Beijing. Hi, Jacqueline.</p><p>JACQUELINE MADDOCK, BUSINESS REPORTER: Well Diane it was certainly a mixed bag for the end of the week. Mainland markets and also Hong Kong (inaudible) around steadily throughout the afternoon as disappointing corporate earnings results rolled out particularly, from Ever Bright Securities. That of course is the brokerage firm that made all the headlines responsible in fact for last Friday's fat finger fiasco.</p><p>But we also saw banking stocks do some pretty serious polls. And that was because there are plenty of whisper and lots of speculation here that the People's Bank of China is preparing to unleash some new regulations on Chinese lenders.</p><p>A different story though across in Japan the Nikkei managed to put on more than two percent that's because the yen strengthened. And in fact all markets sectors Diane are the very end in the green.</p><p>And finally to Australia. Australia is still riding high on that Thursday's PMI data out in China. (inaudible) stocks could very well there. And the Australian market putting on almost one percent on the hope that China is getting back on track -- Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: All right that's business reporter Jacqueline Maddock in Beijing.</p><p>And now we're getting earnings in from Foot Locker. The company is reporting an adjusted profit of 46 cents a share. Almost -- almost matching the estimate there analyst were expecting 47 cents. Revenue came in at $1.45 billion. That was right in line with expectations.</p><p>For more on the European markets now, let's go to London where Jan Randolph director of Sovereign Risk at IHS Global Insight is standing by. Jan, the U.K. came out on -- out of recession and now the second reading of GDP has been revised even higher. How optimistic should investors be about this?</p><p>JAN RANDOLPH, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT: Well I think so particularly if you put it into context with Germany, which also showed good -- good revised figures. The recovery in the U.K. is more broad-based now. It includes construction as well the old traditional consumptions. And that's good news and exports were up, particularly to Europe and Germany. So combined, it looks like a better picture all around both the U.K. and from northern Europe.</p><p>MACEDO: And Jan our last guest said the traders are being kind of cautious ahead of the Jackson Hole Conference. What is it that they want to hear?</p><p>RANDOLPH: Well actually, the important people are not there. And that's Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>and Mario Draghi. I mean they are the ones that are ultimately going to stir policy going forward. But yes, I mean there have been some interesting comments. Nowotny, for example, the Austrian member of the ECB said, \"The improving news from Europe means that there will no longer be a cuff and interest rates in Europe\". There seems to be no argument for that.</p><p>So I think Jackson Hole, yes it is -- it's a bit more of a sideshow I think this year compared to previous years.</p><p>MACEDO: All right Jan Randolph at IHS Global Insight thanks Jan.</p><p>And the \"Wall Street Journal\" says federal prosecutors are turning up the pressure in an insider trading case against a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital. A new indictment unsealed yesterday alleges that Mathew Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an Alzheimer's drug trial at the heart of the case. Martoma is accused of using inside information about the results of that drug trial to allow SAC Capital to make $275 million in profit. He is due to go on trial in November and a hearing is set for this morning.</p><p>SAC Capital has been charged with encouraging insider trading but Steven Cohen the hedge fund's founder has not been charged. Cohen and his firm have denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>Here is a look at commodities now. We have been watching oil and gold for you this morning. We've got green arrows there. Oil is up eight cents it's trading around $105 a barrel. Gold is up a little more than $3 at $1,374 an ounce.</p><p>Now here is the I-Man on Fox Business giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: You know once in a while, I have my iPod Touch with me. I will check my e-mails I mean sometimes during the show not always but -- so I was going to talk about something else but I'm going to talk about this briefly.</p><p>You know we've been talking about Roxanne Roundtree. And \"Roxy's Recipe\" her book you can go to Imus.com and right there on the homepage, you can click on the video and watch the video of Roxanne Roundtree that Patrick Gottsch at RFD did and it's -- it change their live. So if you still need cook books and well you still to be buying the cookbooks. Although Esther Newberg or she got a couple of the New York publishers she's going to fighting over it, it's time to get to published it.</p><p>But I've got -- I got -- this woman is confined she has the Lou Gehrig's disease and is confined to a wheelchair and communicates by blinking her eyes. She has a three great sons and her husband's a saint, Don. And I just got an e-mail from him, a long e-mail -- too long to read. But as -- I don't know how to describe it, actually. It is wonderfully well-written. Let's start there.</p><p>But he fell in love with Roxanne who is 34 or 35 now. She -- she came down with Lou Gehrig's Disease of five, six or four, five years ago. But Don fell in love with her in the first grade. And then talked about, in this e-mail, about how long it took to persuade her to marry him. And of course, she couldn't have married a better person on the planet than this guy. Man I mean so -- so that's what I was doing well storming Norman who is yakking about whatever they were doing. Anyway --</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I got to help these people. Come on man.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's such a good story.</p><p>IMUS: And really is just --</p><p>MCSHANE: It's unbelievable.</p><p>IMUS: It really is. All right seven minutes after the hour. Hey Warner, who's -- who's the best football team in the pros?</p><p>WOLF: I would you know barring any more injury I would go with the Broncos.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>WOLF: Yes. The addition of Wes Welker makes them strong. They have a good running game.</p><p>IMUS: He hurt himself the other day didn't he?</p><p>WOLF: Yes he did.</p><p>IMUS: Is he all right now? Or --</p><p>WOLF: Hopefully he'll open the season. But they already had a good passing game.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>WOLF: And they lost at -- on that fluke play. Do you remember the Baltimore in the playoff?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: So I would think on paper --</p><p>IMUS: They threw that interception.</p><p>WOLF: Well that's true in the second overtime yes.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: You know when you -- when you pick one out of 32 teams before the season.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: It's really part luck because of the injury factor like no other sports so.</p><p>IMUS: How about the Giants going to be -- we heard this --</p><p>WOLF: Well you know they finished nine and seven but they lost their last two games of the year by a combined score 67-1. And they lost Amad Bradshaw (ph) they are leading Rusher (ph) and now they have two offensive linemen two out of the five offensive lineman don't look like they'll start the season. So I -- I would say, at best, nine and seven again maybe worst. They don't -- I don't see a running game. They said oh Wilson and --</p><p>IMUS: Ok fine. Jet's a joke.</p><p>WOLF: On Jets eight-eight at best.</p><p>IMUS: Yes at best yes. And its fat coach he'll be gone, but he's not fat anymore.</p><p>WOLF: No he's not but that might not help him.</p><p>IMUS: He'll be sucking toes someplace else so.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: Anybody else any good? Are the -- well the Patriots got to be pretty good right?</p><p>WOLF: Sure always good. Again except the year that Brady got hurt at the start of the season.</p><p>IMUS: How is Alec Smith is he any good?</p><p>WOLF: He is but not with this cast, not with Kansas City.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>WOLF: No and it's too bad because you know he was playing great for the 49ers.</p><p>IMUS: I know.</p><p>WOLF: When Kaepernick --</p><p>IMUS: Kaepernick came in yes. How about -- what else -- how about Seattle?</p><p>WOLF: Well, yes, Russell Wilson I mean he turned them around. They are very good sure.</p><p>IMUS: Speaking of Kaepernick how about the 49ers?</p><p>WOLF: 49ers are strong yes.</p><p>IMUS: Any other strong teams?</p><p>WOLF: I think you have named the best strong teams.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>WOLF: But again, you know that's what's great about the National Football League.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: You only have 16 games it's not like baseball you know.</p><p>IMUS: What happened in this Little League World Series situation?</p><p>WOLF: Well you had Taiwan eliminating Panama.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: So Taiwan -- Tijuana, excuse me, not Taiwan. Tijuana will now play Tokyo for the international title.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: And the West Port Washington State game was rained out so they'll play today.</p><p>IMUS: We got to bet full for West Port and Tijuana.</p><p>WOLF: Ok it's all right yes.</p><p>IMUS: Ok.</p><p>WOLF: Tijuana, what 23 miles from San Diego and as you pointed out even closer to -- Tiu Lavista (ph).</p><p>IMUS: I used to go to Tijuana when I was in the Marine Corps stationed at Camp Pendleton.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS IN THE MORNING: For what?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes exactly for what?</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, IMUS IN THE MORNING: The art.</p><p>IMUS: I think is -- well I forget this was 1957 so --</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS IN THE MORNING: We'll be love you time Mr. -- Private Imus.</p><p>IMUS: Eleven minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Well a lot of good stuff coming up. That dingbat, Liz Claman --</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, Oh no, no. Oh no, no. You knew what we are, you knew, what is what ding bat; we are in for it here. Let's just restart that sentence please.</p><p>RUFINO: I hate it.</p><p>IMUS: Oh man she's a wacko. But she's going to interview the guy who runs the NASDAQ.</p><p>MCSHANE: Bob Greifeld.</p><p>IMUS: And that's coming and I wasn't -- we weren't going to carry it on the radio because I don't care about it.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: But they want to carry it on the television. And that's your job and that's my job to make sure they do. That it gets done which I'm delighted to do.</p><p>MCSHANE: Of course.</p><p>IMUS: But now I've decided we're going to carry it on the radio as well.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh ok.</p><p>IMUS: And we will carry it for as long as we can stand it.</p><p>MCSHANE: Got it.</p><p>IMUS: And it's just drones on, then we'll bail. So -- I mean that's coming up the next hour. The Godfather is here, of course.</p><p>BARTLETT: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And he'll be discussing some stuff this hour and particularly the Bradley Manning situation. And then Powell to the People Tony is out in the street. Big Foot do we have any of that?</p><p>TOM BOWMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING: We're going to have some momentarily. But he was out because of the One Direction concert on the \"Today\" show. They're expecting like 15,000 people, mostly kids. Some of them have been waiting since Tuesday to get a front row.</p><p>IMUS: I like that. I like somebody who would stand (inaudible). I wonder if Doug Christie thinks One Direction is better than Delbert.</p><p>Anyway. Thirteen minutes past the hour. Let's do some news. And here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Hey good morning I-Man.</p><p>These wildfires are really a big issue out west. And the one that's burning outside of Yosemite National Park nearly has quadruples now inside, in size. So officials are going door to door -- they're urging people to get out. But the evacuations are not mandatory. So you have some people like this that are hanging in there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you sticking here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh yes. Absolutely. I will stay in place, protect what I can as long as I can.</p><p>MCSHANE: As long, yes, they stayed there. A lot of times this happens. This fire is only about one percent contained though they're saying at this point.</p><p>We have new comments coming in this morning from President Obama on Syria. CNN had him on just about an hour ago saying allegations of chemical weapons used in Syria is according to the President's quote, a big even. And then they asked him about his redline comments that he'd made about the use of those types of weapons. And the president said the latest event in Syria is something the U.S. has to look at. So that's how he phrased it.</p><p>Well, we'll see where we go from there but speaking of Syria two UN agencies say the rising number of children who are turning into refugees over there resulted in greater threats.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have recorded a million refugees, children that are found and now in camp settings with host communities and in very challenging environments.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Nearly three quarters of all of these refugees under the age of 11. You have 1 million refugees as you heard in all. Nearly three quarters under 11.</p><p>In Egypt today, security and military forces are deployed around the city of Cairo. They've closed off traffic in some of the major roadways. This comes ahead of protests by the supporters of the former President Mohamed Morsi and these rallies today kind of a test for the Morsi supporters. See if they can keep the pressure up despite the crack down that we've seen here on the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p>We mentioned President Obama on CNN; later today he visits Pennsylvania for the first time in more than a year bringing in this plan. He's been out on the road promoting for college affordability to Scranton. Joe Biden's hometown -- Scranton Pennsylvania -- Lakawana College (ph) she'll be later on in the day.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Coming up on 15 minutes after the hour. Dagen McDowell is not here today because, well, what did she tell you, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, she hit her head on a cabinet the other day and had wounds so, you know.</p><p>IMUS: On her face apparently -- not just her head or something.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right. Some kind of a wound on her face.</p><p>IMUS: Did you ever get any more information? Did you every talk to her, Carley?</p><p>MCSHANE: Hold on one second.</p><p>IMUS: What happened to Carley?</p><p>MCSHANE: There she is.</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING: I'm right here, hi. I spoke to with her, but I did not ask any questions. I want to get the real story when she comes in first thing on Monday.</p><p>MCSHANE: Wait a minute.</p><p>IMUS: Well, when you spoke to her what was the conversation about then.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I just asked her if she needed anything. If she was in Manhattan, I'd go over and see her. She said she is fine, but she needs to heal up a little bit more.</p><p>MCSHANE: Ok, good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's a good friend you are.</p><p>IMUS: So something is not -- we are not getting the story here.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I mean it is Friday. Something is fishy. Let's be honest.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>MCSHANE: Come on Carley.</p><p>IMUS: What did you say Carley?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I said it's Friday. Something's fishy. Let's be honest.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Time for a little sports now and sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Hey Warner --</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Patrick Gottsch, you know, did you ever meet him?</p><p>WOLF: Yes. Sure at your golf tournament, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Sure. So he calls me yesterday or texted me. He says we are having a big announcement on Rural Radio which is on Sirius XM. Could you listen and I was with the kids and I could not. He said well, we're going to have it on TV.</p><p>Here is what they are going to do. They will have a one day two million dollar rodeo at Cowboys Stadium.</p><p>WOLF: No kidding.</p><p>IMUS: No. So I do not know the details of that yet but it is not until March 2. But it's going to be $2 million in prize money which should be the richest rodeo ever held. And they've invited all of the -- I guess the ten best cowboys in all events. Everybody from saddle block riding to (inaudible) to calf roping team.</p><p>Then, anybody else can enter, I think. A limited number of them or just what they call qualifiers and that would be guys who no longer compete. Like Joe Beaver could come back and calf-rope if he put on knee brace and other people could as well.</p><p>WOLF: Cody Ohl.</p><p>IMUS: Cody Ohl is still -- he's still going to the national finals. He will go again this year. He is still out winning beau coup money. He's in the top 15 in the world now. So that is a huge deal at Cowboys Stadium.</p><p>WOLF: Maybe Jerry Jones will be there.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, Warner.</p><p>Anyway, it is time for sports. Sports sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Did I say that.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, here's the great Warner Wolf.</p><p>WOLF: Thank you. Good morning I-Man.</p><p>Yankees beat the Jays 5-3, they sweep the series. They've won 10 of 12. They cut the race for that second wild card spot to 3.5 games.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, every time Patrick e-mails me and asked me to watch something or listen to something, I then critique it. He does not ask me to do that. He doesn't say be sure and e-mail me or text me and tell me what you think of my people who are announcing on the radio or on RFD. The announcer that he had on RFD was so annoying and irritating. I cannot think of the guy's name. Some dope.</p><p>Randy Bernard -- he used to be the PBR and the Hyundai car deal and he's a great guy. He has terrific ideas. And this whole rodeo thing is his idea. I don't know. It's just -- I watched him for a few minutes and it irritated me.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That is so unlike you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I did hear Joe Beaver call in. He said he's in day 13 of a 15- day clinic. That is odd, he just left here eight days ago. That must be the new math or something.</p><p>WOLF: Two a day.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, maybe two a day or something.</p><p>Anyway, what were you saying now.</p><p>WOLF: Well, Yanks got a big break when the umps blew a call in the last of the fifth inning, if you want to see it on Fox Business --</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>WOLF: It was called by Buck Martinez of CTV sports network.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BUCK MARTINEZ, CTV SPORTS: -- goes after the first pitch. Davis -- no catch -- they sit on the tracks and now they have two runners at second. They tag and try to tag out each. So now, we have all sorts of confusion.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Well if you look at it again, you'll see that catch is made. Instead of an inning ending double play, it was incorrectly ruled an RBI for Wells. The Yanks took the lead and never trailed. This is exactly one of the instances that videotape replay will be used next year.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. No justice, no peace.</p><p>WOLF: Pirates and Cards win. Pirates still by one.</p><p>And Dodgers Clay Kershaw, eighth inning, shut out the Marlins. He lowers his earned run average to 1.72. Man, that's Gibson, Kofax, (inaudible) numbers. And in their playoff drive, the Mets have just signed former Red Sox right-hander, Daisuke Matsuzaka --</p><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p>WOLF: -- who has never been the same since his big 2008 season when he went 18 and 3. In fact, he'll pitch tonight.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Did you say the Mets playoff drive?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, I did.</p><p>MCSHANE: Of course.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I just wanted to make sure I was hearing properly.</p><p>WOLF: Of course, come on.</p><p>MCSHANE: There's still time.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: That's hurtful, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: That's not funny.</p><p>WOLF: Not at all. Exhibition football, the Lions beat the Patriots 40-9.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>WOLF: The Patriots turned the ball over three of the first four possessions.</p><p>Here was Patriots coach Bill Belichick.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BILL BELICHICK, COACH NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS: When you turn the ball over four times in the first quarter, that will knock you out of most any game.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: That's right. Again, you know, Reggie Bush is the new running back for the Lions. One yard in six carries. He did catch five passes, 103 yards.</p><p>IMUS: Must have had the Kardashian girl he used to be married to on his back.</p><p>Twenty-one after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING -- what's coming up in the briefing, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: President Obama, he pulled a boner in front of a bunch of college kids if I may employ some old school vernacular. And comedian Louis C.K., he finds a dead body in the river. We have the audio --</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. Yes, indeed. True story boss, true story.</p><p>IMUS: And the Godfather's coming up and Powell to the people is coming up as well. Well, I hope Doug Christine has got his TV on or his radio.</p><p>You're telling me that Omar (inaudible). Delbert McClinton. Have you lost your mind?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning everyone. I'm Diane Macedo.</p><p>And we will get a new reading on the housing market this morning. New home sales for July are expected to fall 1.5 percent from June to 490,000. That would be disappointing reading after existing home sales for last month jumped 6.5 percent to their highest level in four years.</p><p>The mood of the housing market though does seem to be improving. Home builder confidence jumped last week to its highest level in eight years despite rising interest rates.</p><p>Moody's investors service is putting the 6 U.S. Banks on review to weather the possibility of reducing support if they run into financial trouble. Of those banks, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are under review with downgrade implications while Bank of America and Citigroup are being evaluated as direction uncertain.</p><p>Moody's also says it may downgrade bonds at Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, B of A, and Citigroup though Bank of America and Citigroup bonds could also be upgraded because their operations are improving. Ratings downgrades can increase a bank's borrowing costs and force it to close more collateral and derivative trades weighing on its profitability and draining its cash.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Diane, what the hell are doing, Diane? Are you spraying your hair?</p><p>MACEDO: I was putting it in place for you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh my goodness.</p><p>IMUS: Your hair looks great Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: Thank you.</p><p>IMUS: You already have a guy who is going to marry you so you can get fat now. What do you care?</p><p>Anyway back to Lupi.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good focus.</p><p>MIKE LUPICA: You just really like talking. You're a crazy person.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I am sitting here watching the monitor and Diane is spraying her hair.</p><p>LUPICA: Don't look at the monitor. Don't look in the monitor -- focus on what you are doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: 28 after the hour. We have (inaudible) coming up. So is Tony Powell, Powell to the people. The business report, did you do it Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: I don't think I did specific business report.</p><p>IMUS: You don't have to now.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, the Nasdaq thing --</p><p>IMUS: Sponsored by Ativia for natural pain relief. Go ativia.com and send those Vicodin out here to the I-Man.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's the style.</p><p>IMUS: Although I'm leaving here to go to Texas in a few days and then about a week. The last group of kids and then I will be at the Joe Beaver junior superstar roping in Steubenville, Texas over Labor Day. And then I will be in Huntsville. Then I'll be at Wyatt's first high school rodeo September 8th and then on September 9, I'll be back in the studio at Fox.</p><p>MCSHANE: Pretty good, pretty good.</p><p>I should point out on Labor Day that's when that special on the Imus Ranch on Fox Business Networkwill premiere. And (inaudible) and editor John here doing a great job on. I saw part of it yesterday that they're putting together.</p><p>IMUS: You know, I was going to say I'm a not be able to watch it but I have satellite DirecTV in my horse trailer.</p><p>MCSHANE: Of course you do. You'll have it. I believe the times are going to noon Eastern and 4:00 Eastern and then I'm sure, it will repeat after that. But that will be when it premieres.</p><p>IMUS: I can just set my TIVO in my horse trailer. I have a plug in for Randy.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That is big pimping right there.</p><p>IMUS: I've two televisions in the living quarters of my horse trailer. Room for four horses and three people.</p><p>This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program is sponsored by BMW of Bayside -- you sick -- anyway --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Nothing.</p><p>MCSHANE: Nothing at all.</p><p>IMUS: It is time for a Bernie Briefing, the 30 minutes past the hour. That, of course, is sponsored by MyPillow, which - by the way we're in - or in horse trailers. So. Anyway, good morning, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, boss. President Obama up at SUNY, Buffalo in upstate New York yesterday, giving his speech and he made a little bit of a mistake and a recovery. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Your outstanding mayor Brian Higgins is here.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>OBAMA: Give him a big (inaudible) of applause.</p><p>AUDIENCE: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>OBAMA: What?</p><p>Byron Brown. That's - I would - I am sorry, Byron.</p><p>Let me -- what I meant was your congressman, Brian Higgins is here. Your mayor, Byron Brown is here.</p><p>This is what happens when you get to be 52 years old.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>OBAMA: When I was 51, everything was smooth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Pretty good. He can be charming.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yeah, very likable.</p><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And your friend, comedian Louis C.K. .</p><p>IMUS: I love him.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He was on with David Letterman the other night, but nobody would know it because half the country can't get CBS and the other half just doesn't watch. But .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Or doesn't try.</p><p>MCGUIRK: In any case, Mr. C.K., he was boating in the East River here in New York City and the following transpired between him and Letterman. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LOUIS C.K., COMEDIAN: I got a boat, I saw the Coast Guard comes on and they say, please be aware there's other - a report of a body in the water south of the Queensboro Bridge, which is where I was, and as soon as they said I looked down and there was the dude in the water.</p><p>DAVID LETTERMAN, LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST: Oh, my God.</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: Yeah.</p><p>LETTERMAN: So you are like right in there at the crime - well, we think crime scene. We don't know.</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: I don't know. It's just floating dead person.</p><p>LETTERMAN: Yeah.</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: And I've never seen a dead guy. Have you ever seen a dead person?</p><p>LETTERMAN: Well, I have been to various funerals .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LETTERMAN: . but not like this. This is a dead guy in the wild.</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: That is right. That is right. That is right. This is a freshly dead person.</p><p>LETTERMAN: Yeah.</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: Has he been all - you know .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: It's just .</p><p>LETTERMAN: Must have been creepy.</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: It was creepy and weird and I felt embarrassed for him a little bit. And .</p><p>LETTERMAN: You should have gotten the picture of him. You should .</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: What's that?</p><p>LETTERMAN: You should have got .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LETTERMAN: Then we would have that to look at.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Not a lot of sympathy on the .</p><p>IMUS: Not (inaudible). What's that clip about?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, the story of the dead body. You know, we listened to Letterman's monologue. He is the only guy that's on live this week, everybody is off, everybody .</p><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Not one funny thing could we use from Mr. Letterman, but that was the best and here we are bringing it to the I-Man. A dead body in the East River, just another day in New York City.</p><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And at least they didn't speculate that it was Jay Leno or something like that, some mean-spirited thing.</p><p>IMUS: Yeah. Something we'd have done .</p><p>MCGUIRK: But you know what, Jimmy Kimmel, thought, remember that kid, he was - the judge told the parents that no, you cannot name your kid Messiah, you're going to name him Martin, all right? In any case, Jimmy Kimmel has this to say about that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST: Guys. So no, you are not naming your son Messiah and forced him to change it to Martin. So, we'd better - if your first name is Messiah, you will never find little personalized license plates for your bike.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KIMMEL: Plus, there's a lot of pressure to have. Oh, great, Messiah wet his bed again.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KIMMEL: I don't think what the judge did was legal, but I'm glad she did it. In fact, I think we should bring her to Hollywood, put her in charge of celebrity baby names.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KIMMEL: Because there is - not even giving their kids names anymore, they're giving them nouns. You go to any playground in L.A., yell the word River, ten kids will come running.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: River!</p><p>IMUS: And really.</p><p>MCGUIRK: True story.</p><p>IMUS: Low on material here. It is 34 minutes past the hour.</p><p>Brutal. Here is some \"Rusty Truck.\" Man, I love this .</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I am Diane Macedo. And central bankers are in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for their annual conference. Fox Business' Peter Barnes is there too. Here is an update.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, let's just call it taper talk in the teatimes this time around in Jackson Hole. It's the Fed officials and central bankers from around the world gathering to hear the latest research on the economy and on monetary policy, but the real action takes place on the sidelines during the breaks and in the hallways where the participants can talk to each other one-on-one and share information and talk about the effectiveness of policy and the state of the recovery and of easy money policies. Of course, the big question here is when the Fed could start to wind down, to dial back its $85 billion a month in quantitative easing bond purchases designed to help keep interest rates low on mortgages and other types of loans coming in to the conference. The handicapping is that the Fed could start small at its next policy meeting in September.</p><p>The big elephant not in the room this time around at Jackson Hole is Fed Chairman Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke. </nameText></person>He is skipping the conference for the first time since he became Fed chairman back in 2005. The Fed says he has a personal scheduling conflict, but a lot of folks here are looking and talking about who may succeed Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>as the chairman, who President Obama will appoint. One of the leading contenders is the vice chairman of the Fed, Janet Yellen. She is here and will moderate a panel on Saturday on her leading rival in the contest. Larry Summers, former economic adviser to the president is not attending. Back to you in New York.</p><p>MACEDO: All right. That's Peter Barnes in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p><p>Taking a look at futures, we've got a fairly flat morning, Dow futures are down eight. \"Imus in the Morning\" continues right now.</p><p>IMUS: To my man. Freddie Toyota on Highland Boulevard in Staten Island, 19 minutes now until the hour. Please welcome to the program Don Corleone, the godfather. Good morning, godfather.</p><p>BARTLETT: Good morning, Don Imus. At first I was disappointed in this Bradley Manning leaking the classified information, but now there are some suggestions that he did so because he preferred to - I'm now a woman - literally. He may think that he is a female trapped in a man's body, as if that catzone (ph) hanging of him with some kind of padlock .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT: And all this time I assumed he wasn't that good at keeping secrets. Man, he says that he has - a feminile (ph) - and wishes to be treated as such. Well, I hope he will be relieved to know that his wish will be partially granted when serving his sentence. He will be surrounded by men who will be more than happy to treat him as the receptacle for their (speaking Italian). Trust me, you don't want that translated.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT: What bothers me is that this revelation suggests his punishment is less a penalty than a reward. He will spend his years in jail like it was some kind of Fire Island Labor Day barbecue. The only thing that won't be part of his plan is the being referred to as Chelsea. For I think the name he will be known by will be more along the lines of bitch.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT: But if it were up to me he would be for his infamnia (ph) with the real punishment like being extradited to Russia where they would be more than happy to cut off the very thing that is trapping him in a man's body. He divulged classified information, but the leaking has just begun.</p><p>IMUS: Thank you, Godfather. For - that's assessment - and 17 until the hour. \"Powell to the People\" coming up next. This is an unauthorized airing of this record of (inaudible)</p><p>MACEDO: Hi, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo, and let's check the markets now, the day after the NASDAQ flash freed that halted trading for three hours. Asian markets ended the day mixed: Japan's Nikkei followed the U.S., rebounded, finished the day at more than two percent. South Korea's KOSPI gained more than one percent, but the Hang Seng and Shanghai did end with red arrows. Over in Europe, we got the second reading on second quarter GDP for the U.K. And Germany, both rose seven tenths of a percent, London's up about 35, Frankfurt is up about 18, but Paris is down almost two points.</p><p>Here, in the U.S. futures have been pointing to a lower open for most of the morning. Dow futures are still down by about a four, but the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are showing some slight gains. We will be keeping an eye on those for you. Gap raised its full year earnings outlook and annual dividend after reporting a 25 percent jump in its second quarter profit compared to last year. The retailer said it earned $0.64 a share matching the estimate. Revenue rose just over eight percent to $3.7 billion. That also tops expectations. Gap now expects to report a profit of $2.57 to $2.65 a share. That's $0.05 above its previous range. The company also raised its annual dividend to $0.80 per share up from $0.60.</p><p>We're getting earnings in now from Ann Inc, formally Ann Taylor, the company is reporting a profit of $0.76 a share, topping the estimate for $0.65. Revenue, though, was a slight miss at $638,2 million. Analysts were expecting $639 million. \"Imus in the Morning\" continues right now on Fox Business.</p><p>IMUS: Why did that commercial sound like it was under water, Lou?</p><p>RUFINO: My fault, I guess.</p><p>IMUS: Well, now, that was - comes from your studio or the other studio?</p><p>RUFINO: No, I don't know anything about it.</p><p>IMUS: But do you care about it?</p><p>RUFINO: Does it sound like I care?</p><p>IMUS: No, it doesn't. It's just like - you're parallel.</p><p>RUFINO: No, I guess so.</p><p>IMUS: Well, yeah - but I mean we charge these people all these money for this commercial, and want people to be able to hear them.</p><p>This part of the program is sponsored by Freddie Toyota on the Highland Boulevard in Staten Island.</p><p>Well, hey, Bernie, is CBS off in how much of the country?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, Time Warner, I don't know what the percentage is, my guess is, approximately half. But I think they just got back on Verizon files.</p><p>MCSHANE: I don't know if it's - but the big, the funny thing was they put them back on Channel 2 last night, just to have the debate between - what Spitzer was on.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>MCSHANE: They didn't want, you know, to be accused of keeping that off the air.</p><p>IMUS: One direction is appearing on the \"Today Show,\" which is only a couple of blocks from where the Fox Studios are.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yeah.</p><p>IMUS: They are on 6th Avenue, the Avenue of the Americas. And so, Powell to the People. Tony went out and talked to some folks. I guess, first some kids who have been waiting there for some time. Roll, Bigfoot.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TONY POWELL: How long have you been standing here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Two days.</p><p>POWELL: When did you get here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wednesday. I forgot what day is today.</p><p>POWELL: How long have you been here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Since Tuesday.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have been awake since 4:30 Thursday morning.</p><p>POWELL: Where did you go to the bathroom?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Plaza, McDonald's.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Random places.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah. Starbucks.</p><p>POWELL: So you like - it's almost like walking your dog. You mark every place in the neighborhood.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>POWELL: How long have you been here, Jay?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Three days.</p><p>POWELL: Three days. You must really love your child.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do.</p><p>POWELL: Do you know any lyrics?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't.</p><p>POWELL: So, if you hear it all the time, you can probably sing it there. Can you sing it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You mean best song ever?</p><p>POWELL: Can you sing it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not really well.</p><p>POWELL: So, you're excited to see one erection?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I don't care.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I'm very excited. My children are.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I bet you are.</p><p>POWELL: If somebody gave you $10 million or a chance to hang out with Harry Styles, which would you choose?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A chance to hang out with Harry Styles.</p><p>POWELL: Is that how you raise them?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would pay $20 million to have coffee with Neil.</p><p>POWELL: So, if you had a chance to be with Harry Styles and Neil Cavuto, who would you be with?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Cavuto.</p><p>POWELL: So, you like your men like you like your coffee.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Strong.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Smart.</p><p>POWELL: He makes the mood for you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah, in a strange way here, very strange.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Well, the kind of inappropriate. I mean - want an erection talking to kids?</p><p>MCSHANE: Where did you get that from?</p><p>IMUS: What is the matter with you?</p><p>POWELL: I don't know. It's just - I don't know. It seemed funny to me. I don't know why it means .</p><p>IMUS: It wasn't funny, not in that context, you idiot.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh-oh.</p><p>IMUS: It is eight minutes until -- what is the matter with you, Bigfoot? So, here is the new rule. Before we put any of these on the air you have got to show them to me. You understand.</p><p>POWELL: Yes, starting next week.</p><p>IMUS: Because, well, I am going to be off next week.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's a good time to start it.</p><p>IMUS: Because your judgment sucks.</p><p>POWELL: One time. I got it.</p><p>IMUS: Come on! Anyway.</p><p>MCSHANE: Back to you, I-Man.</p><p>IMUS: So, today is Friday and Tony says how many days have you been here? I say two. He said, well, when did you go here?</p><p>MCSHANE: It's just me.</p><p>IMUS: OK. We need to figure it out. But I guess - at the University of Virginia, you missed that day.</p><p>MCSHANE: Some of them say they got - some of them said they .</p><p>IMUS: No, not Tony - it's not - this is not an opportunity to debate. So, Rob Bartlett will be appearing at the Leavitt Theater in Ogunsuck (ph) Maine.</p><p>MCSHANE: Ogunquit.</p><p>IMUS: Whatever. September 21st, and Tony will be appearing at the Belmar Theater on Saturday, September 28th for an evening with Tony Powell. That ought to be good. Well, it could be good as long as he doesn't do any of this and you could get tickets to that by going to NY entrainmentclub.com or you could get a hold of that Bellmore theater, and I want to see Tony.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right.</p><p>IMUS: I am confident that he is funny. If you want to see evidence of this. Now that this dingbat Liz Claman--</p><p>MCSHANE: No, no, no.</p><p>IMUS: He is going to interview the head of the NASDAQ .</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, great.</p><p>IMUS: Because they got shutdown yesterday. And we don't know - nobody knows why. I mean there was - you know, the suspicion is that they are lying, whatever they tell her. But we just - we have Warner watch this and see if we can determine if either one of them was lying. Five minute now till the hour.</p><p>IMUS: A lot of the people out there - what did you think, Dagen, again?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just thought it was badly cast, like the comedian, why is he there and then they have this woman sitting off to the side on - reporting on what people are tweeting about, reading stuff on the Twitter, off the Internet, and just pointless.</p><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They could be a better way to integrate it. I mean if you want to have like a hot check, just have her sit there and do nothing. And just cut - OK, let's give them the hot check a few minutes, you just take a shot of her and then go back talking about some sports. It was just exhausting.</p><p>IMUS: Sounds to me like you are kind of dissing Carley in an odd way.</p><p>CARLEY: Yeah, come on, Dagen. Come on there.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Hey, Carley.</p><p>IMUS: Doesn't sound that way to you, Carley?</p><p>CARLEY: Yeah, what is going on? All that hate?</p><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what - that chick on (inaudible) is a brunette. So, that was not .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Like we have said Carley redeemed and stuffed.</p><p>MCSHANE: And I was great when .</p><p>CARLEY: And I would be happy to read some tweets.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yeah.</p><p>MCSHANE: Do whatever you want, Carley.</p><p>CARLEY: All right.</p><p>IMUS: I thought you liked Carley.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love Carley.</p><p>CARLEY: I love Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you really want me to drive down this road? Because it will get dirty real quick.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCGUIRK: OK, put the pedal to the metal.</p><p>IMUS: I don't have a problem with it. I mean I've got nothing to do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love Carley. It was not a shot at Carley.</p><p>IMUS: But your kids were not up yet. Go for it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: This is the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program on the Fox Business Network. Now here's Diane Macedo.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning everyone. Let's check the markets now the day after a NASDAQ flash freeze halted trading for three hours. U.S. futures are mixed. We have Dow futures down by one point. The S&amp;P and NASDAQ turned things around. The S&amp;P is up by almost a point, about a point exactly. There now NASDAQ is up almost four. Now, for more on what happened at the NASDAQ yesterday let's go to Nicole Petallides who joins us in the newsroom. Hi, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS: Hey, good morning, Diane, good morning everybody. Well, yesterday's flash freeze from someone who was standing right on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange felt more like an eternity freeze, right?</p><p>So, it took them about a half hour to really figure out what the problem was and then another two and a half hours to actually reopen the Nasdaq MarketSite.</p><p>So, it's very interesting as we watch what happened, it was actually due to a glitch in the processor. A securities information processor SIP which now seems to be regular wording that we use now on Wall Street today.</p><p>But basically it's a way that they give out prices to all the different exchanges, 13 exchanges, 40 dark pools. And when this had a glitch, they basically halted trading across the board.</p><p>Names like Apple, Blackberry, Costco, Cisco, Dow components as well. So, you have Google, JetBlue, just to name a few of the names.</p><p>So, what's interesting is you have different people speaking out today, Bob Greifeld, the CEO of Nasdaq seems very proud of the way that they figured out what the problem was.</p><p>And order and had an orderly reopening and didn't feel the need to address any transparency or address the press, et cetera.</p><p>He said he's working closely with other exchanges. However, when you talk to SEC chair, Mary Jo White, also Harvey Pitt, former SEC chairman, Arthur Levitt, former SEC chairman, they seem less than pleased.</p><p>Obviously noting that this was a serious issue, that's according to Mary Jo White, Harvey Pitt said this, it shouldn't have happened at all.</p><p>And so obviously and Arthur Levitt as well expressing displeasure. So, now what happens today and how do we ensure that this doesn't happen again and really leave Americans and people all over the world with their money tied up and not sure as to when they will be able to execute trades again?</p><p>Now, this is reminiscent of what we remember from Facebook, that debacle of an IPO, you know the ink is barely dry on that $10 million check that Nasdaq had to pay out in order to calm that issue.</p><p>So, this remains an issue and it's all about the complexity of trading which as I noted, 13 exchanges, more than 40 dark pools and that trillions of dollars at hand.</p><p>So, this is a very tough day yesterday on Wall Street. And of course, once again, it's a blast to investor confidence. Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Nicole Petallides from the newsroom, thanks, Nicole. And central bankers are gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the Kansas City Fed's annual conference.</p><p>Fox Business' Peter Barnes joins us live with a preview, good morning, Peter.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS: Hey, good morning, Diane. Well, the topic at this year's conference is global dimensions of unconventional monetary policy.</p><p>What does that mean? Well, basically they're here to talk about low long- term interest rates, quantitative easing, those billions and trillions of dollars that the Fed has spent to buy mortgage-backed securities and treasury securities.</p><p>All of it to try to keep interest rates low for average consumers so they can go out and buy cars and get low-cost mortgages and their businesses can get low loans.</p><p>So, that -- this stuff matters to the average consumer. The big topic here and the big buzz is, when will the Fed start to now dial back all of this quantitative easing?</p><p>It's been doing $85 billion a month since September but it appears that the Fed is now getting ready to start pull that back, to start tapering that, to start dialing that down.</p><p>And that's what's given a lot of heartburn to the markets and caused a lot of these, a lot of the roller coaster ride out in the markets.</p><p>And there will be some papers presented here that talk about quantitative easing, there's been some other recent papers that say basically, you know what?</p><p>It's really not working anymore and that kind of research could help push the Fed to get out of quantitative easing quicker, sooner rather than later.</p><p>I want to mention we got a great lineup of guests here in Jackson Hole this year and just a little bit later in this hour, we'll talk to Dennis Lockhart, he is the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.</p><p>We'll be talking later today to Jim Bullard, the President of the Saint Louis Federal Reserve, they both have been very vocal on this issue of quantitative easing.</p><p>And later this afternoon at 5:00, we'll be talking to Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund who is doing all those bailouts around the world. Diane, back to you.</p><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Peter Barnes in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Here is a quick look at commodities, oil and gold are up, IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.</p><p>DON IMUS, HOST, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Oh, well, Tom Friedman from the \"New York Times\" is coming up, we'll talk to him at the bottom of the hour.</p><p>And Warner has got sports, Bernie's briefing stuff, Dagen is not here today because she still has -- man, I don't know.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Injuries.</p><p>IMUS: The girl got some bruises that she -- so this makeup -- they can't put any makeup on it.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And it seems odd.

And if you guys think you know better, Tony, you think you know better or Bigfoot, you guys go do it yourself somewhere.</p><p>But for the time-being, we're going to do what I think is funny. See how that works out -- God --</p><p>MCSHANE: All right --</p><p>BOWMAN: Right you are, I'm good --</p><p>IMUS: It's not really --</p><p>BOWMAN: I'm all good --</p><p>IMUS: Sounds really like a jerk, don't they?</p><p>MCSHANE: We're going to have a great day --</p><p>IMUS: What a creep.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's it, let's move.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway --</p><p>MCSHANE: Keep it moving, everything is all right, nothing to see here --</p><p>IMUS: I need to get away from you bastards for a couple of weeks --</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, well, whether you know, that's --</p><p>IMUS: Jeez, I'm just sick of you --</p><p>MCSHANE: Perfect timing --</p><p>IMUS: I really am --</p><p>MCSHANE: Holy God, what are the odds?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You're off for two weeks, oh, this is the best news all morning.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER, IMUS IN THE MORNING: You got to get away from all of these bastards --</p><p>IMUS: Was that funny, Lou?</p><p>RUFINO: That is pretty damn funny, actually.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCSHANE: No, stop, Lou.</p><p>IMUS: Why don't you do some news --</p><p>MCSHANE: Sure, I'll be honored to --</p><p>IMUS: While I think about firing Tony and Rob --</p><p>MCSHANE: No, that's not --</p><p>IMUS: And fantasize --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know --</p><p>IMUS: It --</p><p>MCSHANE: Fantasize --</p><p>IMUS: Why don't you tell us what's going on then when Foot notifies me that Liz is ready, we'll go to her.</p><p>MCSHANE: Wait until you hear this first story, this will get you worked up anyway.</p><p>IMUS: Yes --</p><p>MCSHANE: About Syria. Is the United States planning for airstrikes in Syria? The \"Wall Street Journal\" actually has a report on this -- in this morning's paper that officials began, \"refining their options\" for possible airstrikes.</p><p>You know, supposedly updating target lists and the like for the possibility of striking Syria.</p><p>U.S. airstrikes but we'll see. Here is President Obama making an appearance, talking about some of these things on \"Cnn\", he was on with Chris Cuomo earlier this morning. Here's a little bit of the interview.</p><p>IMUS: Where is it?</p><p>MCSHANE: Where are we on that Tom? Remember that Cuomo --</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN: Do you believe at this point you need to investigate --</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Here we go --</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>CUOMO: In order to say what seems obvious, which is that the U.S. needs to do more.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, we are right now gathering information about this particular event but --</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Chemical weapons --</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: I can say that unlike some of the evidence --</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: We have to interrupt this, that's enough. Now, stop it! --</p><p>MCSHANE: Not --</p><p>IMUS: Playing a cut from \"Cnn\", that's just idiotic. All right, please welcome now to the program Liz Claman, good morning, Miss Claman.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right --</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Don and to all of your listeners and viewers, we are live at the Nasdaq MarketSite.</p><p>You know, there are many exchanges, but the two biggest, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, one of them went down yesterday for a full three hours.</p><p>Throwing the entire trading system for all of you who maybe have 401(k)s or trade stocks, it went down for a full three hours and of course, now, it's been attributed to a highly technical glitch.</p><p>We're joined now by the CEO of the Nasdaq, Bob Greifeld. Thank you for being here --</p><p>ROBERT GREIFELD, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NASDAQ: I'm glad to have you here, Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK, this is not a great day for you, this was a nightmare yesterday, but it was also a nightmare for companies like Yahoo!, Apple, Google who list on the Nasdaq but also the individual investor.</p><p>Right off the bat, I have to ask you because so many people were questioning this. Was there any indication of any kind of computer hacking or system hacking here?</p><p>GREIFELD: No, none whatsoever. So, this had nothing to do with hacking. Hacking is a fact of life but had nothing to do with the problem yesterday.</p><p>CLAMAN: That worries some people that it was an internal system because it indicates to some people, you guys don't have your arms wrapped around your system?</p><p>GREIFELD: Well, certainly we're deeply disappointed with what happened yesterday and what we had to do is improve what I call defensive driving.</p><p>So, our system by itself was working but you have interconnections in the world we live in today and we have to handle bad actions from some of those people connected to us.</p><p>And we have to improve on that. So, we're deeply disappointed but I would highlight that one of the reasons it took three hours was, we have a first and foremost responsibility for fair and orderly markets.</p><p>So, we spent two and a half hours really making sure the entire industry, we had opened telephone lines with them, we made sure the entire industry was ready to come live and we did come live, we came live quite successfully and finished the day in normal course of business.</p><p>CLAMAN: Nobody begrudges you that moment where you have to work and make sure that once you do press go again, it's going to be fine.</p><p>What they do get very upset about, Bob, is the lack of communication. I talked to CEOs of Nasdaq-traded companies who said I got nothing.</p><p>I'm sitting in meetings, I'm checking my Blackberry, I'm checking my phone, there's nothing from the Nasdaq.</p><p>They do know that you were putting out some 20 missives to the trading community, but that's not the CEOs of all of these companies who are worried about their stocks.</p><p>What's wrong with your communication system?</p><p>GREIFELD: Well, our communication system I think worked well yesterday. It can always be improved.</p><p>First order of businesses to focus on solving the problem and then dealing with people directly involved with the problem.</p><p>Now, in one of those open lines we had people representing our issuers on the call and they were -- they are to give regular updates out.</p><p>We gave a formal update out after the close of trading which we wanted to do. So, I think we did well, we'll certainly reflect upon how we communicate, see if we can do better.</p><p>CLAMAN: Can't you just --</p><p>GREIFELD: But certainly --</p><p>CLAMAN: Hire somebody to work the phones and call the IR offices? The --</p><p>GREIFELD: Oh, they were doing that --</p><p>CLAMAN: You know --</p><p>GREIFELD: Although we had teams --</p><p>CLAMAN: Investor relations offices --</p><p>GREIFELD: No --</p><p>CLAMAN: On the stock --</p><p>GREIFELD: We had teams of people doing that. As I'm saying, we had the people responsible for the issuers on the open lines so they could hear first-hand exactly what was going on.</p><p>They were taking inbound calls, we took hundreds of inbound calls, reaching, making outbound calls. So, there was active communication going on.</p><p>In this type of situation, you probably didn't get to every single CEO or every single IRO, but we communicated quite actively to a large number of them.</p><p>Then the official communication went out after the close of trading day to everybody.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK --</p><p>GREIFELD: Right, so, it happened you know, quite rapidly.</p><p>CLAMAN: I get the explanations but we had former Securities and Exchange Commission head, Harvey Pitt on yesterday, he was very harsh.</p><p>You were probably busy working the situation, but he said the Nasdaq handled this \"terribly\". What he didn't like too was when you started the systems up.</p><p>He said you only allowed trading in certain stocks, and he said how can you be fair when you're only allowing certain stocks to get up --</p><p>GREIFELD: Well, I think it's hard for people outside direct involvement with the problem to comment and comment intelligently on it.</p><p>So we have --</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, you're taking the smack at Harvey Pitt?</p><p>GREIFELD: Well --</p><p>CLAMAN: I mean, he's not --</p><p>GREIFELD: I'm just saying for anybody who is not there, right? So, they -- you know the people who are not on the open lines, who are not in the head trader alert communication, it's hard for them to know, right?</p><p>And hard for them to comment intelligently in terms of what happened. So, everybody was directly involved, the exchanges were on what's called the UTP line.</p><p>SIP arranged a line with our members, in addition to that, we had the head trader alert. So, that happened all the way and each plan, right?</p><p>And we solved the problem within half an hour, right? And certain members made a request in terms of having a longer period of time to quote --</p><p>CLAMAN: OK --</p><p>GREIFELD: Instead of five-15 minutes, that cost a half hour of time to get ready for that. So, that communication was there and I think to the extent that anybody who wasn't involved became involved, we said OK, that was as active as you can get.</p><p>CLAMAN: You guys are considered the sexier exchange.</p><p>GREIFELD: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: You know, you've got the lots of the dotcoms of the world but there are some that aren't public yet. Twitter, for example, everybody is waiting for that to go public.</p><p>Do you think you've lost Twitter? Can you make a 30-second pitch to Twitter to say here is why you should still consider listing on Nasdaq?</p><p>GREIFELD: Well, I think it's important to recognize that we aspire towards perfection with respect to the operations of our systems.</p><p>And technology people, Twitter and all the companies recognize that. We will always fall short of that but we have to keep trying, right?</p><p>And we get better all the time, and the number of problems have actually declined. But probably as importantly, we have to make sure we handle problems in the proper way, right?</p><p>So, what we did yesterday, right, nobody wanted to be down for three hours and if we had been quite reckless we could have been up a lot sooner than that.</p><p>But I think the procedures we had in place, the industry had in place worked well. So, we would say to any technology-based company, we're not perfect, right?</p><p>We're 99.99 percent perfect, we're not perfect, we'll have problems but if we do, we're going to make sure we maintain a fair and orderly market.</p><p>And that's what we did yesterday. And it's important to recognize the fact we didn't trade for several hours. If you're a traditional long investor, a mom-and-pop, institutional investor, that three hours doesn't matter.</p><p>You're buying the stock for the longer period of time, right? And the fact is, every single person was in the same situation. Nobody was relatively advantaged or disadvantaged because the market was down for that --</p><p>CLAMAN: I --</p><p>GREIFELD: Period of time.</p><p>CLAMAN: Some moms and pops are a little more sophisticated these days and like to trade a lot. But either way, we appreciate you coming on Fox --</p><p>GREIFELD: Right --</p><p>CLAMAN: Business and IMUS IN THE MORNING to talk about this. Bob Greifeld is the CEO of the Nasdaq, we now rejoin IMUS IN THE MORNING on Fox Business and on radio. Back to you.</p><p>IMUS: Praise God --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: He sounds like he might have had a head injury, doesn't he?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Jesus -- well, he's been up all night --</p><p>MCSHANE: But Warner was on top of it over there, I saw --</p><p>IMUS: What do you think, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: Well, my question is if you grabbed his hands, could he talk? I mean, that guy just broke the record for gestures with hands.</p><p>IMUS: What does that mean?</p><p>WOLF: Well, it means you're not quite comfortable enough with just verbalizing and you think you have to emphasize everything --</p><p>IMUS: Well, he's on the spot here. My favorite part of the interview is when Liz breathlessly --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: Like she said, you don't have your arms wrapped around your problem. What kind of question is that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Don't have your arms wrapped around -- oh, God.</p><p>MCSHANE: That was fun.</p><p>IMUS: So we don't know anything, do we? We don't know any more now than we knew, so --</p><p>MCSHANE: It's kind of what I was thinking, there was --</p><p>IMUS: Man, at least she got him on.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, IMUS IN THE MORNING: She'll get all this press all day long, she interviewed him and it's all good.</p><p>IMUS: Yes --</p><p>MCSHANE: You need to get Warner to analyze all our business interviews from now on, on the 11:00 show with me, it would be great, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Sure, I'll be --</p><p>IMUS: Or anybody who is on --</p><p>WOLF: Right --</p><p>IMUS: Who we can see --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, could be great --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RUFINO: I was looking at Connell's --</p><p>MCSHANE: Liar --</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, before and --</p><p>MCSHANE: Look at this --</p><p>IMUS: We didn't have any answers.</p><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p>IMUS: But she asked the right questions, just --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, she did --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Damn right --</p><p>MCSHANE: She was fine, yes --</p><p>IMUS: That breathless --</p><p>MCSHANE: At least --</p><p>IMUS: I don't know, it's fine, she's fine.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: It's all fine, it's all good.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's all --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Really is --</p><p>MCSHANE: Good --</p><p>IMUS: Quote Mark Seliger and Rusty Truck, \"It's All Good\".</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: What are we supposed to do now? 17 after the hour?</p><p>MCSHANE: Some sports, you know --</p><p>IMUS: All right, let's do that, sponsored by Peerless Boilers, good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Good morning, i-man. All right, here we go, Yanks beat the Jays 5- 3, they sweep the series 10 out of 12. A blown call by the umpire in the bottom of the fifth with the bases loaded really gave the Yanks a huge break.</p><p>Here was the call by Michael Kay, \"YES Network\".</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL KAY, SPORTSCASTER: Right through the centerfield, it is caught. It's going to be -- no, he drops the ball about five seconds and it is a double play.</p><p>He's tagging everybody whether it's a double play, the ending inning. Did he make the catch?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No --</p><p>KAY: Now they're saying that he didn't make the catch?</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Well, he didn't make the catch --</p><p>IMUS: Yes --</p><p>WOLF: So, instead of a double play ending the inning, Wells was given an RBI, the Yanks took the lead and never trailed. And this is exactly what videotape replay will be used next year.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, thank God.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>RUFINO: That will help --</p><p>WOLF: Yes --</p><p>RUFINO: Everything --</p><p>MCSHANE: Amen --</p><p>RUFINO: Game will be five hours.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, fantastic --</p><p>WOLF: Clayton Kershaw --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, that's just great, Warner --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Bring the videotape delay --</p><p>RUFINO: Well, the umpires are still looking --</p><p>WOLF: Well, they're supposed to --</p><p>IMUS: Hey, what sporting activity is around today, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: Well today, you have -- if you want to watch NFL football tonight, Seahawks, Packers, Bears and Raiders.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'll watch that and I might watch the Seahawks.</p><p>WOLF: And also you can watch the little league game between Westport and Sammamish.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh --</p><p>WOLF: That will be --</p><p>IMUS: What time is that?</p><p>WOLF: That's a 3:00 game.</p><p>IMUS: Is that Eastern Time?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, Westport --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, Williamsport --</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right --</p><p>WOLF: And of course, the winner will play Chula Vista for the U.S. title.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes --</p><p>WOLF: So, that's a huge game.</p><p>IMUS: Anything else?</p><p>WOLF: Well, kind of funny, you have Brian Wilson, a pitch to the ninth inning of the Dodgers game.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They did --</p><p>WOLF: Take a look at him, if you don't know, the big beard and he's been offered a million dollars to shave his beard by 800razors.com.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes --</p><p>WOLF: That's it. In golf, Kevin Stadler has the first round lead of the Charles Barkley tournament as you have said.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right --</p><p>WOLF: And --</p><p>MCSHANE: That was unfunny joke three hours ago when --</p><p>WOLF: Oh --</p><p>MCSHANE: You just going to ride it until it's --</p><p>WOLF: Oh, yes --</p><p>MCSHANE: But yesterday was funny --</p><p>WOLF: I think it's clever, yes --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, very well --</p><p>WOLF: It's a terrible joke but it's clever.</p><p>MCSHANE: A good line --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, it is --</p><p>WOLF: Tiger Woods was three back at 67 and Rory McIlroy who Gary Player said needs a good woman, had three double-bogeys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>In football last night, the Panthers beat the Ravens, all four touchdowns came on turnovers.

And I'm not sure, maybe they do call him Al Albuquerque, I don't even know.</p><p>But I've never seen that kid pitch before last night.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Was that Francesa?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>WOLF: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: Why does his voice sound so funny?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Maybe he was sucking that helium.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, he's sucking helium --</p><p>IMUS: Yes --</p><p>RUFINO: Sucking helium --</p><p>IMUS: What is that? --</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, he's sucking helium --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Maybe they, maybe they have these new helium doughnuts.</p><p>WOLF: Gunz was high when he was talking, he says --</p><p>IMUS: So --</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, exactly, one more diet coke and helium --</p><p>IMUS: Twenty three after the hour, well, we'll get that in the briefing coming up.</p><p>RUFINO: You know Albuquerque is a place, so, anyway, wait --</p><p>IMUS: You're nuts --</p><p>RUFINO: Dawg, you take this one --</p><p>IMUS: Ten minutes absolutely, Greifeld down there at the Nasdaq.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes, the jingle sound like part of the record, Lou. Sleeping through the night becomes more like a dream itself as folks get older.</p><p>But it's especially aggravating if it's related to your prostate. You got your wiener backed up on you there. But you can unplug that sucker with PT9.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Joel(ph) from New York, he heard the i-man talking about it and felt compelled to write a letter. This is -- don't you wonder about people who take something like PT9, which obviously works, it's from Chamonix, it's a great company.</p><p>Then they offer a money-back guarantee on all of their products, a money- back guarantee, period. Don't you wonder about these people?</p><p>They only write a letter and tell people about their problems I was having with my penis?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: I mean, why?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: We don't want to know that. We -- just order PT9, take it, get three bottles of Heart Factors absolutely free and keep it to yourself.</p><p>Man, I don't want to know about your dick, boy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>So call them at 800 -- I mean, keep it to yourself.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: Jeez. Oh, now (INAUDIBLE) the old lady now, i-man. shut up! Call 800-754-6980. Please, ixnay on the letters. 800-754-6980.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning everyone, I'm Diane Macedo. And we'll get a new reading on the housing market this morning. New home sales for July are expected to fall 1.5 percent from June to 490,000.</p><p>That would be a disappointing reading after existing home sales for last month jumped 6.5 percent to their highest level in four years.</p><p>But the mood of the housing market does appear to be improving. Home builders confidence jumped last week to its highest level in eight years despite rising interest rates.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.</p><p>WOLF: Meanwhile, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman says the Yanks will win --</p><p>IMUS: Hello?</p><p>MCSHANE: Hello? --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOLF: Well, wait --</p><p>IMUS: Hello, Warner.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOLF: Hey, Brian. Now major league baseball --</p><p>IMUS: Hello --</p><p>RUFINO: No Warner, don't say it back --</p><p>MCSHANE: Don't respond --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOLF: Now, this is Jerry Jones --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>This is Jerry Jones.</p><p>RUFINO: Do Cashman again.</p><p>IMUS: Warner.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I want to take a shower right now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: This is Jerry Jones.</p><p>RUFINO: Man, I've never get on with you, man --</p><p>WOLF: Hey, Jerry --</p><p>MCSHANE: You guys should do your medical talk in these, in these voices --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RUFINO: We'll see for steroids --</p><p>(IMUS EXTRA SEGMENTS)</p><p>IMUS: All right, we're going to talk with Tom Friedman, the \"New York Times\" coming up here on the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program. Our last day from the ranch for this summer, so -- and Glenn and everybody out here, Glenn is great and been doing it forever. He and his crew, and Glenn and Ken, Ken's great. Glenn's great and kid over here with the camera and the woman whatever her name is.</p><p>In fact, I know these people and only worked with them 15 years, but it's a great crew here at the ranch. They really, they're here on -- they're never late and everything works.</p><p>MCSHANE: Very good.</p><p>IMUS: And they're real pros. And out of Albuquerque and do a lot of film work and they're real professionals and I greatly appreciate it, like all of them. It's 31 past the hour. Time for a Bernie Briefing and that's sponsored by My Pillow. Here with it is Bernard McGuirk. Good morning, Mr. McGuirk.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, Mr. Imus. Yesterday, as Warner Wolf pointed out, the day before yesterday, Ichiro Suzuki, 4,000 hits combined with his Japanese career and his Major League Baseball career. And this dude, JJ from Staten Island called in, as sportsgreat.com writes and so it began on Mike Francesa's dozy time sleep train as our host lambasted a startled caller on Yankees celebration of Ichiro's 4,000 hits and repeated himself. JJ stayed Suzuki had an accomplishment. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE FRANCESA, SPORTS RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: JJ in Staten Island, what's up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's very, very unbelievable accomplishment, you know?</p><p>FRANCESA: No, I don't know. I disagree completely. Disagree completely and I think it's ridiculous. He has 4,000 hits? Why? We now, the Major League and the Japanese leagues are now co-leagues? He has 2,700 major league hits. He doesn't have anything more than that. I think it's utterly ridiculous that we are now going to act like Ichiro got 4,000 hits. He didn't get 4,000 hits, he has 2,700 hits. I give you that, but only 2700 hits as far as we're concerned.</p><p>He doesn't have 3,000 hits and how the heck does he have 4,000 hits? I mean, when did that start? When did we start mingling the Japan statistics with the American statistics? He's got 2,700 Major League hits. He doesn't have 4,000 Major League hits. It doesn't make sense to me. When did we decide that? Who decided the Japanese hits are equal to the major league hits. We've got the statistics.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IMUS: Stop, stop, if I wanted to listen to him, I'd listen. I know he does that, repeats himself ad nauseam. I love Mike, but --</p><p>RUFINO: I think it's a great accomplishment.</p><p>IMUS: But it's unlistenable.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And sportscreed.com, they write, of course, Francesa's argument is fatuous, the only surprise there being that he stayed awake long enough to make it.</p><p>IMUS: What are you doing, be like if you're trying to rope, Wyatt.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, Wyatt.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Wait a second, what's going on there.</p><p>IMUS: Are you roping today?</p><p>WYATT: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: OK, I'm going to fool with you, talk to you when you're backing your horse in the box on the rope.</p><p>WYATT: You're not doing anything, you're talking.</p><p>MCSHANE: Physical.</p><p>WYATT: And having breakfast while you're talking.</p><p>IMUS: You're purposely going out of your way to annoy me.</p><p>WYATT: I'm bringing you breakfast.</p><p>IMUS: If I could, I'd whip your little ass no, no, leave my yogurt away.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And have your own kid spitting in your coffee soon.</p><p>RUFINO: Soon?</p><p>IMUS: He makes me laugh as much as anybody on the planet. God, he's funny. What are you saying?</p><p>MCGUIRK: I was saying that I'm done and we're late for Tom Friedman, cutting into Tom Friedman's time. It's an outrage.</p><p>IMUS: So, get the whining comy on, 25 until the hour.</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network, and now, here is Diane Macedo.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, everyone. Some of the most important economic figures in the world are gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the fed annual conference. A big difference this year is that Fed Chairman Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>won't be attending due to a scheduling conflict. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will also miss this meeting. The main focus of the conference, though, will be the impact of the fed's unconventional policies at home and abroad.</p><p>Now let's get the latest on weather from meteorologist Maria Molina in our Fox Business Weather Center. Hi, Maria.</p><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOX BUSINESS WEATHER CENTER: Hi. Good morning, Diane. Good morning, everyone. Today we're looking at a beautiful day across sections of the northeast. Yesterday, we had storms roll through, leaving behind lower humidity and also pleasant temperatures, like in New York City, 83 degrees for a high temperature and parts of the Midwest and the plains heating in the upper 80's and widespread 90's and feeling like August across the center of the country.</p><p>And out west, a danger of fires, and red flags, that leaves the hours and eventually into the west. Much-need rain across parts of Nevada, Utah and across parts of Southern California, several inches could fall out here so flooding could be a concern. Diane, back to you.</p><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Maria Molina from the weather center. Let's take a quick look at futures. Those have been searching for direction today. Dow futures are now up by 2 points. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.</p><p>IMUS: It's 20 minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Please welcome now from the New York sometimes, Tom Friedman. Good morning, Mr. Friedman.</p><p>TOM FRIEDMAN, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" (via telephone): Good morning, Don.</p><p>IMUS: Wonder how long the \"New York Times\" is going to stay in business?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Gosh, you know, I really think, you know, we've got a strong enough global brand, I don't worry about the times per se, but what I worry, if you look at the numbers, our -- the newspaper ads, you know, have been, I don't know how long it is, six, nine, 12 quarters, you know, they continue to decline and you know, you just hope that we'll find a bottom.</p><p>We're still making a profit, thank God, but if that doesn't find a bottom, you know, at some point, you know, it will affect obviously what we can do, but you hope it will find a bottom. I don't know if you realize, I think last quarter, the quarter before, we made more money selling the paper than we did from advertising and like that's a huge line to cross.</p><p>IMUS: Well, and are you working on another book?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I'm thinking about something, Don. You know, sort of pushing ahead from the last book I did that used to be about just kind of the new phase of globalization where it's going, technology, how it's all merging, how it's affecting business, education, et cetera. It's germinating in my head, but I'm not quite there yet, but thinking about something on the Middle East, too.</p><p>IMUS: You're not kidding. That sounds hideous. You've got to come up with a better idea than that. Geez, are you kidding me? Nobody's going to read that.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: You want to write a book called \"The World Is Flat\" nobody's going to read that.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I'm thinking about something.</p><p>IMUS: That was a great book, though, the olive tree and that stuff, but this latest one. Have you just given up? Said the hell with it?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: No.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, let me ask you a couple of serious questions. Syria, what the hell is going on there?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Well, we don't have the conclusive proof, but you look at those pictures of those bodies, don, how they died, unmarked by any kind of wounds, you know, it's pretty clear the regime used some kind of chemical weapon and obviously Obama said that would be a red line. They already crossed it once. What he will do this time once it's conclusively proved, I don't know.</p><p>There's a big discussion at the White House yesterday, as you reported, that three hours where they debated what to do. One of the problems, the problem is this so let's say we launched a cruise missile attack in response to this to deter chemical weapons.</p><p>What targets to hit. Do you cause more refugee outflow from Syria and destabilize Jordan, for instance? So there's a lot of real-- so many moving parts with this, it's going to be a difficult one to sort out, but, you know, I'm glad they're considering something because once you start introducing those kind of weapons, you know, it's Katie bar the door.</p><p>IMUS: What would you recommend that we do?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: You know, I would be in favor of -- as I sit here right now, I'd be in favor of some kind of military response at that simply says we're not going to tolerate that. The world is not going to tolerate that.</p><p>IMUS: Would you want troops on the ground?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: No, no, I'm talking about some kind of aerial response. It's sort of something I'd be ready to consider. I want to see all the facts, they haven't all come out, some kind of response not just by us, but by the world, the allies, NATO that draws a red line there. I think it's something that it's really worth considering.</p><p>IMUS: Talking with Tom Friedman from the \"New York Times\" who probably has an e-mail address at the times in which you can contact him and here is what I'd like you to do, send him some ideas for a book. He hasn't got any. And every day I say to Connell, well, why should I care about Egypt? So, let me ask you, why should I?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: You know, there are a lot of reasons, Don. It's a country of 85 million people. It sits astride the Suez Canal. It's the partner with Israel in the Camp David peace treaty and has been traditionally the bedrock of the geopolitics there and the leader of the Arab world, as Egypt goes, so goes the Arab world.</p><p>You want the country to have a decent outcome of this revolutionary process. The problem in Egypt right now, Don, you've had two choices historically, that is either the army or the Muslim Brotherhood. In Egypt if you look at its history oscillated between those two for the last 60-odd years.</p><p>And the question, really, is can they-- can they find a third way, a way that's actually forward-looking, inclusive, progressive that doesn't just involve one of these narrow-minded options or the other? You know, one of the things that's been rattling around in my head, Don. Princess Di once said with Prince Charles there are three people in this marriage.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Historically we've looked at Egypt and saying there's two people in the marriage, the Muslim Brotherhood and the army. If that's the choice we'll go with the army, with Mubarak, but we talked about this in earlier conversation, I think there are three people in this story now, there's the military, the Muslim Brotherhood and Mother Nature.</p><p>And by that, I mean there is all of these incredible water, environmental population stresses that have built up over the last 60 years, precisely because of the incompetence of the military government and the Muslim Brotherhood in managing the problems and stresses, if they don't get the act together, find a third way that can sort of tilt Egypt forward to deal with some of these problems, Don, half the women in Egypt can't read.</p><p>After $30 billion in U.S. aid, over the last 30-odd years, half the women still can't read and these other social stresses I think are just going to blow the place apart.</p><p>IMUS: What in your view would be a decent outcome in Egypt?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I think a decent outcome would be a government that would -- where the military says to this government that they've appointed and they actually-- when they ousted the Muslim Brotherhood government they appointed a new president and he appointed a new cabinet. And you know some of these people and they're pretty decent people, if they would assign that government the task of writing a new constitution, one that would guarantee minority rights, that would be -- that would guarantee women's rights, that would be basically progressive leaning and take out some of the bad stuff the Muslim Brotherhood had in the constitution, and begin to organize an elective process gradually.</p><p>Giving time for not just the Muslim Brotherhood or Islamists as it were, but the liberal and progressive parties to get organize and contest that election, to put Egypt on that gradual transition path, not to just stop with the military government.</p><p>IMUS: Why did you decide to employ the Princess Di analogy?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I have no idea. It popped into my head there. There are three different parties in this story now.</p><p>IMUS: You're a weird dude, sometimes, so -- but you do sometimes in your columns it works well.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Have you gotten away this summer at all?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: A little bit. Just kind of on and off. I just turned 60, Don. So I'm going out to California next week.</p><p>IMUS: When was your birthday?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: July 20th.</p><p>IMUS: Well, happy birthday.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Thank you very much.</p><p>IMUS: You look pretty good for 60. I guess 60 is -- 60 is getting up there.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I'm trying to take care of myself. In this day and age, there are a few miles on these treads so I'm trying to take care of myself, and looking forward to getting away.</p><p>IMUS: In spite of what you think, the times is not long for this world so get a good idea for a book. Tom Friedman.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. It's time to check the markets now, the day after the Nasdaq flash free that halted trading for three hours. The U.S. futures are fairly flat this morning, but now point to go a higher open. Dow futures are up 3. The S&amp;P is up about 1. The Nasdaq is up 3.5.</p><p>Over in Europe, we got the second quarter reading on second quarter GDP in the U.K. and Germany, both rose 7/10 of a percent. London is now up about 37. Paris is down barely and Frankfurt is up 16.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" says that federal prosecutors are turning up the pressure in an insider trading case against a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital. The new indictment unsealed yesterday alleges that Matthew Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an Alzheimer's drug trial at the heart of the case.</p><p>Martoma is accused of using insider information about results of that drug trial, which then allowed SAC Capital to make $275 million in profits. He's due to go on trial in November. A hearing is set for this morning, SAC Capital has been charged with encouraging insider trader, but Steven Cohen, the hedge fund's founder has not been charged. Cohen and his firm deny any wrongdoing.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities now. We're watching oil and gold for you this morning. Those have been also fairly flat. Oil is now down up 13 cents. Gold is up 20. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.</p><p>IMUS: He looks like he is he doesn't have any energy, doesn't he? Here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, coming up on the radio, a fascinating, funny conversation with the great Terry Bradshaw.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p>IMUS: And before that, it's 9:20 Eastern Time on the Fox Business Network. The lying limey, Stuart Varney, so --</p><p>MCSHANE: We love Varney.</p><p>IMUS: I do like Varney a lot. So I don't know.</p><p>MCSHANE: What's wrong?</p><p>IMUS: Well, and the Godfather is going to be on to talk about -- I forget what he's going to talk about. What, Godfather.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good question.</p><p>IMUS: Down, Godfather.</p><p>BARTLETT: The gentleman --</p><p>IMUS: Can barely hear the Godfather, so the Godfather decided well, mail it in this morning. Did he have his mic off, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: I think his headphones were down and he couldn't hear.</p><p>BARTLETT: Turn it up.</p><p>MCSHANE: Now he's better. And solving yet another problem and working through a lot this morning.</p><p>IMUS: Got to project, Rob.</p><p>BARTLETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>MCSHANE: He couldn't hear.</p><p>IMUS: Also, you did a -- a lousy job on the last script. Why was that?</p><p>BARTLETT: I'm a little under the weather today. It affected my performance, I apologize.</p><p>IMUS: What's the matter with you?</p><p>BARTLETT: Got a little bit of a -- a touch of a bug, I think.</p><p>IMUS: Well, why didn't you tell me that instead of turning in a performance that sucks? Because we don't have to do it, you know?</p><p>BARTLETT: Just, I'm going to suck it up, I didn't --</p><p>IMUS: No, you didn't suck it up because you gave in like a finocchio.</p><p>MCSHANE: Finocchio.</p><p>IMUS: To your little sniffles.</p><p>BARTLETT: I have 135 fever.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: You gave in to your 135 degree fever and provided all of us with a weenie performance.</p><p>MCSHANE: Struggling, Rob, the last couple.</p><p>IMUS: It would be better if you said to me, Don, I don't feel great and I would say, fine. So every time you want off, I mean, you ever -- a problem getting off when you need it?

Now, here's Diane Macedo.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm  Diane Macedo.  We are taking a look at the markets this morning after  yesterday's flash freeze at the NASDAQ, it's been a fairly flat morning  today.  We currently got future is in the red, Dow futures are down about  15, we've got the S&amp;P down about one point, the NASDAQ is down about a  quarter of a point.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Looking over at oil and gold, those are in the green this morning,  we've got oil up about $0.16 cents, gold is up almost $4.  Looking at Asia,  those markets finished today mixed and for all the details on how they got  there, let's go to business reporter Jacqueline Maddock in Beijing.  Hi,  Jacqueline.  </p><p>JACQUELINE MADDOCK, BUSINESS REPORTER:  Hi, Diane.  Yes.  It was a bit  of a mixed results here for Friday afternoon, here in the mainland and also  in Hong Kong.  Markets lost ground throughout the afternoon largely because  of some pretty disappointing corporate results particularly from Everbright  Security if you remember that, the brokerage firm responsible for last  Friday's fat-finger fiasco and it was the banks did the biggest falls  today, that whispers that the PBO is preparing to unleash the new  regulations on China's banking sector, China merchant banks down more than  three percent.  </p><p>But as you say, a different story in Japan, the Nikkei climbed Diane,  more than two percent, and every markets that day indeed in the green which  is a -- and that was as the yen moved up to the 99 point level accept the  Tepco, Diane.  Obviously Tepco, the Fukushima nuclear plant operator --  Tepco, fell another five percent at it looks that though as contamination  leak has -- some way to play out (INAUDIBLE).  Across to Australia though  there where markets climbed almost four percent still running high on  China's PMI numbers from yesterday, results of stocks love to see signs  that China's economy is getting back on track -- Diane.  </p><p>MACEDO:  All right.  Jacqueline Maddock from Beijing.  Thanks,  Jacqueline.  </p><p>And now, for a look at the European markets, let's go live to London  where Jan Lambregts, global head of financial markets research at Rabobank  is now joining us.  Jan, we saw some positive second quarter GDP reports  from the UK and Germany confirmed by the follow-up reading.  Any surprise  there, and why aren't markets having more reaction to that?  </p><p>It looks like we just lost Jan.  We will try to get him back in a  second but let's take a look at the European markets.  You can see London  up about 16, Parris is down about 12, Frankfurt up about three.  Again,  those positive GDP report possibly being mitigated by a little un-eased  there over the NASDAQ freeze.  But let's take a look at some of the  important economic news we'll be looking forward to and one of them is a  big meeting coming up, some of the most important economic figures in the  world are gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the Kansas City Fed's  annual conference but one difference is here, is that the biggest figure of  the mall, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke won't be attending due to a scheduling  conflict.  </p><p>The main focus of the conference will be the impact of the Fed's  unconventional policies both at home and abroad and FOX Business's Peter  Barnes is there.  He will have reports for us throughout the morning.  </p><p>And we've got Jan Lambregts back again, global head of financial  markets research at Rabobank.  Jan, I'm not sure if you heard my question  the first-time, but we're looking at these GDP reports from the UK and  Germany both coming in positive.  Any big surprise here? </p><p>JAN LAMBREGTS, RABOBANK FINANCIAL MARKETS RESEARCH:  Not really.  And  I don't think the markets really watching it too closely, second revisions,  it adds to the general trend that things are a little bit better in Europe  but still not great.  I think a lot of people in the market can be watching  more of these headlines coming out of Jackson Hole and thinking what that  would mean for, for tapering than watching these GDP figures.  </p><p>MACEDO:  Markets still seem a little tentative today.  You know, good  GDP information and yet, they're fairly flat.  Paris is even down.  Are  people tentative this morning over what happened at the NASDAQ yesterday?  </p><p>LAMBREGTS:  I don't think that is not necessarily overshadowing.  Like  I said, I think the more tentative reacting to positive GDP which is a  fairly old number, second quarters after all, more worried that had lines  later today as more news comes from Jackson Hole, actually shift  perceptions in how likely tapering is and how much tapering is we will see  in September.  </p><p>MACEDO:  All right.  It's all about stimulus, Jan Lambregts at  Rabobank.  We appreciate it.  Thanks.  </p><p>LAMBREGTS:  You're welcome.  </p><p>MACEDO:  And the Wall Street Journal says, federal prosecutors are  turning up the pressure in an insider-trading case against the former  portfolio manager at SAC Capital.  A new indictment unsealed yesterday  alleges that Matthew Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an  Alzheimer's drug trial at the heart of the case.  Martoma is accused of  using insider information about results of that drug trial to allow SAC  Capital to make $275 million in profits.  He is due to go on trial in  November and a hearing is set for this morning.  </p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business giving you  the power to prosper.    </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.  </p><p>IMUS:  So, Doug Chrispin (ph), he's a -- but he's a local rancher and  he's doing all kinds of stuff, he won the New Mexico, may it's a national  bow and arrow contest that I told you about Mike, from Texas, bans all  these -- here.  So he says to me, you know, it took awhile for Delbert  McClinton to catch on in Austin.  All right.  </p><p>I said, who's -- they found that of course.  So he says who is  better?  Name one person who is better in Austin than Delbert McClinton?   He said, there are lots of people.  I said what?  I didn't have my gun with  me, fortunately.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Thank God.  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  He said Omar and the Howlers.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER:  Oh, those guys.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER:  Oh, yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Omar and the Howlers?</p><p>IMUS:  I said, Omar and the Howlers? </p><p>WOLF:  Sure.</p><p>IMUS:  So, we were at the horse barn, up at the horse barn.  So, I  got in the truck and went back to the house and go to iTunes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  And listened to Omar and the Howlers.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS:  And they suck.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Hey, Omar.</p><p>IMUS:  I thought he was kidding.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  He said, Omar --  </p><p>IMUS:  And then he is a big Joe Walsh fan.  You know?  I said, well,  have you seen that Eagles?  Didn't have any interest.  Do you like the  Eagles?  He said they are all right.  So when I first heard the Eagles,  sounded like a cross between the Beach Boys and the four perhaps.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh-oh!</p><p>IMUS:  Well.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  You got to carry that gun at all times.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, be ready.</p><p>IMUS:  The only place I don't carry it is on the ranch for some  reason.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER:  Omar and the Howlers?</p><p>IMUS:  Omar and the Howlers?  </p><p>RUFINO:  I'm probably the only person who knew that band that you  just mentioned.  </p><p>IMUS:  Really?  </p><p>RUFINO:  Yes.  I played that band in college.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, you did.</p><p>RUFINO: -- Back in school and they still together barely alive.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, they may not, he is going back years, so.  </p><p>RUFINO:  Omar and the Howlers.  </p><p>GUNZELMAN:  This guy is crazy.  </p><p>IMUS:  That is insane, didn't he? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Lunacy.  </p><p>IMUS:  Paul Begala is coming up this morning.  We no longer need him,  so.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's not right.  </p><p>IMUS:  One of my new best friends, one of them, is Bill Powers, the  president of U.T., the University of Texas.  So, I better not blow of  Begala just yet.  You know?  And Tom Friedman.  Hey, Warner?</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Who won those little league world series games? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Tijuana beat Panama.  So, Tijuana, they will now play Tokyo  for the international championship and the Westport Washington State game  was rained out.  So, they will play today at 3:00.</p><p>IMUS:  Right.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  And the winner will play Chula Vista for the title on  Sunday.  </p><p>IMUS:  And the winner of that will play either Tijuana or Tokyo.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Probably.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  Which is it?  Tijuana or --  </p><p>WOLF:  Well, Tijuana beat Panama.  So, Tijuana will play Tokyo.  </p><p>IMUS:  That is what I just said.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  That's right.</p><p>MCSHANE:  We got it, yes.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  We had some other stories too.  </p><p>IMUS:  What are they?</p><p>WOLF:  Well, the umpire, they blew a call in the Yankee game which is  going to fit right in with next year's videotape replay.  They messed up a  caught ball and called it a trap and we have got Ryan Braun, what a phony,  man.  Instead of --  </p><p>IMUS:  Really?  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  You're kidding, Warner.</p><p>WOLF:  He comes out --  </p><p>IMUS:  Hey, Tom, should we have a breaking news thing up on the FOX  News Channel, the business channel?  </p><p>WOLF:  That's right.  This just in.  But the way he did it, he  apologize that he made a mistake, but it was issued in a statement.  I  mean, he didn't even have the, you know, guts to stand up and faced the  press.  Really weak.  And the other thing, you had two exhibition football  games last night.  And finally we are going to hear about Jeremy Lin, cut  out the whining.  Remember him?  Jeremy Lin.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, of course.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Today is his birthday.  </p><p>WOLF:  Oh, it is?</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  He's 25 today.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well, maybe give him some slack.  </p><p>IMUS:  Jay Mohr, of the funnier people on the planet is 43 today.   OK.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Happy Birthday.</p><p>IMUS:  And Dagen McDowell is not here again.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  She's out again, yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS:  So, I said, well, she said she can't put anything on her face.   How about a paper bag? </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, she did.  You went there.  It wasn't funny.  </p><p>IMUS:  And there is something here we don't know.  I don't know what  it is.  But man, there is something here.  Hey, what happened to the NASDAQ  yesterday? </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  It was a mess with the computers, they don't know 100  percent what happened but they had to halt the number, all the stocks that  trade on it and the middle of the day, it went down for hours which is odd,  Wall Street has had a number of computer problems the last few years but  there is a report this morning, there may have been some connectivity  issues with another exchange so they continue their investigation.  No  panic.</p><p>IMUS:  NASDAQ stocks.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, no panic on the market though.  You know?  </p><p>IMUS:  You want to get listed on the NASDAQ, you can't get on the big  one.  Right?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  No.  That's Apple and all these big tech companies if  you're over on the NASDAQ, Google, Microsoft.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, they are?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, so.</p><p>IMUS:  I have been to see Cavuto yesterday, he looks great.  You  know, that?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Sometimes he needs to take good care of himself as he should.   But man, he looks terrific.  He is really good.  You know who else is  pretty good is that Charles Payne guy.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Charles Payne, yes, absolutely, good guy.  Yep.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  No pain, no gain.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's right.</p><p>IMUS:  What is coming up with you, Bernie? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Sydney Leathers.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh God.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes.  Well, this is true.  She made a porn tape.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, please.</p><p>MCGUIRK: .called Weiner and me but that is not where this stops.  She  very well may have exposed herself to HIV.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, wow!</p><p>IMUS:  Not amusing.  That is your hilarious Bernie briefing this  morning? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  I was not presenting that as a joke.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  No punch-line there.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  That's a story.  You remember that kid that gave the  rousing speech at Georgia tech? </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, he may have ripped it off from somebody.  And he was  interviewed by your friend Neil Cavuto yesterday.  We have little piece of  that.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Cavuto is -- all over him, just the -- it was great.  But  he may not be for real.  </p><p>IMUS:  Rob Bartlett and Tony Powell are both here this morning.   They're both appearing places.  Rob is going to be at the Leavitt Theater  in Ogunquit, Maine.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Ogunquit.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  September 21st.  For tickets, go to Robshow.com.  And  Tony Powell, Powell to the People, he will be appearing at the Belmar  Theater on Saturday, September 28th.  That is coming up here pretty soon  and you can get tickets to that by either calling that theater there.  The  Belmar Theater, or go to NewYorkentertainmentclub.com.  I guess, he gets  stuff there.  It is 13 after the hour, let's do some news.  And here with  that is Connell McShane.  Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Hey, good morning, I-man.  The number of refugees created  by the Syrian civil war has not topped one million, a million refugees and  a U.N. agency adding to that says 740,000 of them are children under age  11.  So, some numbers, it all comes out as we are seeing new pictures of  what the rebels claim are another chemical weapons attack.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  And this is the fourteenth time that the central  regime uses chemical weapons against innocent civilians and each time we've  asked and we've said that the international community does not move this,  the regime will enlarge the scale that use these chemical weapons.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  And the U.N. secretary-general did say today, these claims  of chemical weapons must be investigated immediately.  We also have reports  this morning coming in of Israeli airstrikes just south of Beirut said to  be a response to four rockets that were fired yesterday into Israel.  Back  here at home, you mention the problems on Wall Street yesterday, computer  problems at the NASDAQ, trading stocks listed there.  The Apples and the  Google of the world, a lot of big tech names were halted in the middle of  the day because of problems with the system that disseminates quotes.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  Is it going to affect the way that they look at  individual companies and want to invest in companies for 10, 15 or 20  years?  No.  It will just going to say that this game is not really being  played.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Jonathan Kurpido (ph) works at the floor of the New York  Stock Exchange.  Now, to get more on that, this web site All Things D is  reporting this morning.  NASDAQ thinks the issue may be a problem with  connectivity at a rival exchange.  </p><p>IMUS:  What does that mean? </p><p>MCSHANE:  This another digital exchange, NYSCR by the way, the New  York Stock Exchange digital component that there may have been problems  with the two exchanges connecting with one another.  Apparently, according  to this report, and they are basically saying --  </p><p>IMUS:  Each other by the way.  But go ahead.</p><p>MCSHANE:  You are right.  May say, more on this later on but I don't  know exactly what the --   </p><p>IMUS:  How do we know it wasn't deliberate? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Sabotage.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, there all these rumors going around yesterday, and  it's where the NASDAQ was not really that transparent about it, didn't talk  about it during the day, it's hard to get all of them, there are no  comments and then the rumors, what if there was a cyber attack and all this  kind of thing.  That is what people were worried about.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, the Russians.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  But no evidence of that at all and now they're saying that  could have been the exchanges, digital exchanges having trouble connecting  with each other but --   </p><p>IMUS:  Everybody is lying.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Probably.</p><p>IMUS:  Don't you think?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, the thing, you know, I thought there was sort of  reassuring about it is, that the markets, not like the market -- or crashed  yesterday on this when people, you know, wasn't that many jitters.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  The Dow was actually up.  The NASDAQ ended up.  So, you  know, got through it.  And they've been computer problems in the past.  The  last big one I guess was like three years ago.  Although, the NASDAQ had  big time issue about Facebook IPO.  You may remember.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  That was a mess.  But this, we will see.  The  investigation continues and we will get more on it later today, exactly  what happened, so.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, yes, great.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, from Washington --  </p><p>IMUS:  Sixteen after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  Connell continues.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, you'll going to start hearing talk about a possible  government shutdown again.  I know you will be looking forward to that.   More than a third of House Republicans urging the Speaker John Boehner to  shut down the government rather than fund the president's health-care law.   They sent him a letter on that 80 Republicans yesterday.  </p><p>And then we have this U.S. soldier who killed 16 civilians in  Afghanistan last year, he apologized yesterday for the first time for what  he called his act of cowardice.  The Staff Sergeant Robert Bales is in the  middle of a sentencing hearing.  Here is Marc Edwards, he's a friend of his  who used to play in the NFL, this guy Marc Edwards, he spoke with  reporters.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARC EDWARDS, FORMER NFL PLAYER:  The person I knew a long time ago  has changed quite a bit, the experience that he's had over there.  I am not  in a position to understand.  None of us are.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  None of us are, he says.  Well, the sentencing hearing will  continue there.  And there's no --  </p><p>IMUS:  Why are you repeating what the people are saying?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I just thought it was a little fuzzy.  </p><p>IMUS:  Sounds like Conan O'Brien.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program sponsored by  Hackensack University Medical Center, a place where medicine meets  innovation.  What were you saying now?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, no verdict for the Fort Hood shooter.  That continues  deliberations yesterday.  And the final thing in the news is Bradley  Manning who we talked about a lot in the show yesterday.  He says, he felt  that he has been a female since childhood and he wants people to refer to  him as Chelsea.  So, this is the convicted Wiki leaker so to speak.  Back  in forth, Leavenworth begin serving 35 years in a military prison.  </p><p>Now, a military spokesman said, if Bradley wants to change his name  to Chelsea, a name change would have to be approved in court, then a  petition submitted to the army to make it official.  So, that's where we  are on all that.  </p><p>IMUS:  The Godfather will have some thoughts on Bradley Manning and  his wishes coming up here in just a little bit.  This moment is also  sponsored by the Hackensack University Medical Center, a place where  medicine meets innovation, the home of the Deirdre Imus environmental  health center.  So, well, any business news?  Business news incidentally  Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Is presented by this clown over here at the -- well, he is not  a clown, that is unfortunate, Don.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Clown?</p><p>IMUS:  Dr. Gill Leatherman.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh!</p><p>IMUS:  Hit the cancer. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Hit the cancer, baby.  </p><p>IMUS:  Hit the cancer.  Shut-up.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, it's OK.  </p><p>IMUS:  This radio search deal, he has got going.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  You can call Dr. Gill Leatherman at 212-scam -- no, not scam.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  No, no, that's not the word.</p><p>IMUS:  That's unfortunate.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  No.  </p><p>IMUS:  212-choices.  What is going on in business news other than the  tedious NASDAQ deal? </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, that's the big I guess story up.  I'll give you an  update on the markets on where we are.  The Dow futures are down a little  bit this morning.  But the Dow was up yesterday, actually the first time it  was up in seven sessions.  Got lost a little bit in that NASDAQ story.</p><p>IMUS:  I'll be darn.</p><p>MCSHANE: .of 66 to 14,963.  So, not much of an effect in terms of the  markets going up and down from that NASDAQ mess, the traders able to shake  it off.  Commerce Department today releasing some numbers on new home sales  on housing numbers, Dow futures are down this morning by 18 points ahead to  all that.  </p><p>IMUS:  Is that it? </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, I mean, yes, there's --   </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  Can't just stop talking.  I thought you had a stroke.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I thought --  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, no.  But just stop talking.  What's the matter with you?  </p><p>RUFINO:  He stopped.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, I know he stopped but I mean, back to you, I-man,  anything.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That will be the way --  </p><p>IMUS:  No, no, no.</p><p>RUFINO:  Connell do it every time.  </p><p>(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p>I am Connell McShane.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Almost 20 minutes past.  </p><p>IMUS:  Omar and the Howlers.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Back to you, I-man.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Doug Crispin's big band is the Beatles I guess to him.  I  guess they are out of AustinTexas, they're coming up here, he told me they  were better than Delbert McClinton.  I mean, you -- that is insanity, isn't  it?  Never heard anything like that. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Never.</p><p>RUFINO:  I can't believe my ears.</p><p>IMUS:  There is nobody better than Delbert McClinton.  Anyway, Warner  with sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers.  Go to Peerlessboilers.com  and get one of them.  Anyway, it's 20 minutes after the hour, here is  Warner Wolf.  Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF:  Good morning, I-man.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yankees beat the Jays five-three, they sweep the series make  it ten of 12, they cut the race for the last wild card team, the three-and- a-half, blown call by the umpire in the bottom of the fifth gave the  Yankees the lead for good.  Bases loaded, one-out, Michael Kay, Yes  Network.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL KAY, YES NETWORK:  (INAUDIBLE) To the second and it is a  double play.  He's tagging everybody but it is a double play to end the  inning.  Did he kick the catch?  Now, they're saying that he didn't make  the catch.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF:  Well, if you watch your FOX Business, you can see that he did  indeed make the catch.  So instead of a double play to end the inning,  Wells is given an RBI and the Yankees take the lead.  Well, that is one of  the things they will correct next year with video tape replay.  Dodgers  beat the Marlins six-nothing.  Clayton Kershaw on the shut out, he's earned  run average is now 1.72.  And Brian Wilson pitched for the first time in a  year and a half in the ninth inning, he struck out two batters and Wilson  has been offered $1 million to shave his beard by 800razors.com.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  He looks scary like that, man.  </p><p>WOLF:  Pirates and Cardinals win, Pirates by one.  Ryan Braun --  </p><p>IMUS:  Maybe could have fought ahead with this and had a photograph  of him that we could have put up.  I guess not.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  He makes the duck dynasty guys look like Park Avenue  socialites.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  He really does.  </p><p>WOLF:  What we did have him after the game, Brian Wilson with this  brief comment.    </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Oh, no.  </p><p>WOLF:  Ryan Braun has issued a statement through the Brewers.  They  talked about a guy, he say, he said he was sorry he took the PEDs during  the --  </p><p>IMUS:  You and Doug are going down.  </p><p>WOLF:  Two-11 MVP year.  You know, what?  Braun ought to give back  the MVP trophy and give it to Matt Kemp.  </p><p>IMUS:  That is enough sports.  I am bored now.  </p><p>WOLF:  OK.  How come, I don't know about a Thursday night football  game?  </p><p>WOLF:  Thursday football.  I've got it.  Lions beat the Patriots 40  to nine.  </p><p>IMUS:  How come there wasn't any.  </p><p>WOLF:  There were two.  </p><p>IMUS:  They were?</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  Why you didn't tell me about this?  </p><p>WOLF:  Well, because you said that was the end of this --   </p><p>IMUS:  Well, no, but the Lions beat the Patriots -- what? </p><p>WOLF:  Forty to nine.  Patriots turned the ball over three of the  first four possessions.  </p><p>IMUS:  Tebow play?</p><p>WOLF:  Tebow did not play.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, God!</p><p>WOLF:  Not a good sign.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  He got to bail out Hernandez.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Twenty three after the hour.  What is coming up in the  briefing, Bernie? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, Sydney Leathers may have HIV and we have that kid who  may be a fraud and Ben Affleck, as Batman.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  That is all.  This would be Omar and the Howlers.  Doug  Crispin, told me with a straight face why you thought this loser was better  than Delbert McClinton.  I mean, how do you even say that with the --    </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS:  Are you kidding me?  Some fat hillbilly screaming his guts  out?

The list of banks includes JP Morgan  Chase and Goldman Sachs.  Moody's also says, it may downgrade Wells Fargo  and Morgan Stanley bonds and it says Bank of America and Citigroup bonds  may also be downgraded for the same reasons but they could also be upgraded  because the bank's operations are improving.  </p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  So, you did not know I called Bigfoot just foot?  </p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS, WIFE OF DON IMUS:  I could not stop laughing, I was  crying.

It  was called Winter and Me.  She had sex with this guy.  This guy tested  positive for HIV.  Sydney Leathers and the dude tested negative before and  after.  HIV negative test results within three months of exposure could be  false.  It will take a couple of months for Ms. Leathers to find out  whether or not she is infected.  </p><p>IMUS: We already know that she is infected.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  She needs to be fumigated, without a doubt.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  The kid at Georgia tech welcoming incoming freshman.

The real action  takes place on the sidelines.  Participants can talk to each other one on  one and share information.  The big question here is when the Fed could  start to wind down, to dial back.  The handicapping is that the Fed could  start small at its next policy meeting in September.  </p><p>The big elephant not in the room is Fed Chairman Bernanke.  He is skipping  the conference for the first time since he became Fed chairman in 2005.  He  says he has a scheduling conflict.  A lot of folks are looking and talking  about who may succeed bernanke as the chairman.  Janet Yellen is here and  will monitor a panel on Saturday on her leading rival in the contest.   Larry Summers is not attending.  Back to you.  </p><p>MACEDO:  Thank you.  Dow futures are down 17.

Where did you see them?  </p><p>BEGALA:  I have not seen them and I will not see them.  Doug christine,  that is just kind of a sideline.  He is one of the more interesting people  I have ever met in my life.  </p><p>IMUS:  I like Omar a lot.  I hate to side with you on anything, but I think  you are right.  [laughter] </p><p>IMUS: All right.  Carolyn Wonderland, ever met her?  she is wonderful.  </p><p>She came up to our nations capital.  </p><p>IMUS: Carolyn Wonderland plays the guitar and that girl can sing the blues.   She is the real deal.  If you were still advising presidents, what would  you advise them to do?  </p><p>BEGALA:  I would advise caution.  Measure twice and cut once.  This country  suffered previously by rushing into a war where we had no business  fighting.  We had no threat against our country.  What are the threats to  America's interest?  also to our credibility.  Superpowers never bluff.  It  is a very difficult situation.  The chances of it getting worse because of  our intervention is very great.  Made me the chairman of the caucus.  I  have been to walter reed.  I would be real careful.  </p><p>IMUS: Video of these kids dying.  That is pretty tough to take.  I agree  with you.  </p><p>We may have to act.  We can take out the Air Force.  We can take out the  sources of the weaponry.  He makes a pretty powerful case.  </p><p>IMUS: Hillary Clinton going to be the next president?  </p><p>God, I hope so.  I would have to be the cochairman.  </p><p>IMUS: I have to admit, I kind of like her.  </p><p>She is strong.  She is smart.  She did a great job as secretary of state.  </p><p>IMUS: Back up a second.  What did she do there that was so great?  </p><p>She helped and the war.  That is a pretty important thing.  She tried hard  to set the reset button.  </p><p>IMUS: This is sad.  We will have to put up with for years of it.

The Nikkei ended up.  And  Europe, we got the second reading on second-quarter gdp.  Both gross.   London is up 13.  Here in the U.S., the futures are down.  </p><p>We will also get a new reading on the housing market this morning.  New  home sales are expected to fall 1.5 percent from june.  That would be a  disappointing reading.  The mood of the housing market does appear to be  improving.  Homebuilder confidence jumped to the highest level last week.   Here is a look at commodities now.  We are watching oil and gold for you.  </p><p>Imus in the Morning continues right now on Fox Business.  </p><p>IMUS: Coming up, the Godfather.  Apparently, One Direction is the boy band,  kind of, on the today show doing something.  Power to the people.  Some of  them have been out there all night long.  Five minutes until the hour.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: Welcome to the Imus in the Morning program.  </p><p>BARTLETT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Hey, hey, hey.  Maybe I am  going deaf, maybe I am going crazy, but that new Robin Thicke song sounds  like Marvin Gaye.  That boy have to give it up.  He is just joining an old  standing tradition of rock and roll riff off jobs.  Jesus, he is so fine.   Vanilla Ice stole, but only because he knew he could take that dude in a  fist fight.  He is suing Marvin Gaye's family to prevent them from suing  him.  They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and I  wholeheartedly agree.  Sometimes, it is a crime when people just cannot do  their own thing.  You hear me, Lady Gaga?  You Madonna wannabes.   [laughter] </p><p>IMUS: That is not funny.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DON IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program on the Fox Business Network.  And now here is Diane Macedo.  </p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning everyone.  Yesterday's  flash freeze at the NASDAQ has been traced to a connectivity issue.   According to All Things Digital sources say officials at NASDAQ OMX Group  which owns the exchange are pointing to a connectivity problem with NYSE  Arca as the trigger for that three-hour trading halt.  A NYSE spokesman  declined to comment but NASDAQ officials did acknowledge that connectivity  issue they just wouldn't say who the exchange participant was.  </p><p>Now the trouble started at about 12:15 p.m. Eastern when NASDAQ said  it was halting trading in NASDAQ listed stocks.  Sources say it took the  exchange another half hour to determine it had fixed the problem.  But the  reopening process which required regulatory approval and testing took more  than two hours.  All Things D says NASDAQ executives expect the normal  start to trading this morning.  </p><p>Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., futures have been fairly  flat, but to the downside this morning Dow futures are down 16, the S&amp;P is  down one point, the NASDAQ is down just a fraction of a point.  </p><p>And for a recap on the Asian markets now, let's go to business  reporter Jacqueline Maddock in Beijing.  Hi, Jacqueline.  </p><p>JACQUELINE MADDOCK, BUSINESS REPORTER:  Well Diane it was certainly a  mixed bag for the end of the week.  Mainland markets and also Hong Kong  (inaudible) around steadily throughout the afternoon as disappointing  corporate earnings results rolled out particularly, from Ever Bright  Securities.  That of course is the brokerage firm that made all the  headlines responsible in fact for last Friday's fat finger fiasco.</p><p>But we also saw banking stocks do some pretty serious polls.  And that  was because there are plenty of whisper and lots of speculation here that  the People's Bank of China is preparing to unleash some new regulations on  Chinese lenders.</p><p>A different story though across in Japan the Nikkei managed to put on  more than two percent that's because the yen strengthened.  And in fact all  markets sectors Diane are the very end in the green.  </p><p>And finally to Australia.  Australia is still riding high on that  Thursday's PMI data out in China.  (inaudible) stocks could very well  there.  And the Australian market putting on almost one percent on the hope  that China is getting back on track -- Diane.  </p><p>MACEDO:  All right that's business reporter Jacqueline Maddock in  Beijing.  </p><p>And now we're getting earnings in from Foot Locker.  The company is  reporting an adjusted profit of 46 cents a share.  Almost -- almost  matching the estimate there analyst were expecting 47 cents.  Revenue came  in at $1.45 billion.  That was right in line with expectations.  </p><p>For more on the European markets now, let's go to London where Jan  Randolph director of Sovereign Risk at IHS Global Insight is standing by.   Jan, the U.K. came out on -- out of recession and now the second reading of  GDP has been revised even higher.  How optimistic should investors be about  this?  </p><p>JAN RANDOLPH, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT:  Well I think so particularly if you  put it into context with Germany, which also showed good -- good revised  figures.  The recovery in the U.K. is more broad-based now.  It includes  construction as well the old traditional consumptions.  And that's good  news and exports were up, particularly to Europe and Germany.  So combined,  it looks like a better picture all around both the U.K. and from northern  Europe.  </p><p>MACEDO:  And Jan our last guest said the traders are being kind of  cautious ahead of the Jackson Hole Conference.  What is it that they want  to hear?  </p><p>RANDOLPH:  Well actually, the important people are not there.  And  that's Ben Bernanke and Mario Draghi.  I mean they are the ones that are  ultimately going to stir policy going forward.  But yes, I mean there have  been some interesting comments.  Nowotny, for example, the Austrian member  of the ECB said, \"The improving news from Europe means that there will no  longer be a cuff and interest rates in Europe\".  There seems to be no  argument for that.  </p><p>So I think Jackson Hole, yes it is -- it's a bit more of a sideshow I  think this year compared to previous years.  </p><p>MACEDO:  All right Jan Randolph at IHS Global Insight thanks Jan.  </p><p>And the \"Wall Street Journal\" says federal prosecutors are turning up  the pressure in an insider trading case against a former portfolio manager  at SAC Capital.  A new indictment unsealed yesterday alleges that Mathew  Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an Alzheimer's drug trial at  the heart of the case.  Martoma is accused of using inside information  about the results of that drug trial to allow SAC Capital to make $275  million in profit.  He is due to go on trial in November and a hearing is  set for this morning.</p><p>SAC Capital has been charged with encouraging insider trading but  Steven Cohen the hedge fund's founder has not been charged.  Cohen and his  firm have denied any wrongdoing.  </p><p>Here is a look at commodities now.  We have been watching oil and gold  for you this morning.  We've got green arrows there.  Oil is up eight cents  it's trading around $105 a barrel.  Gold is up a little more than $3 at  $1,374 an ounce.  </p><p>Now here is the I-Man on Fox Business giving you the power to prosper.  </p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Ladies and gentlemen.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MCCORD:  IMUS IN THE MORNING.  </p><p>IMUS:  You know once in a while, I have my iPod Touch with me.  I will  check my e-mails I mean sometimes during the show not always but -- so I  was going to talk about something else but I'm going to talk about this  briefly.</p><p>You know we've been talking about Roxanne Roundtree.  And \"Roxy's  Recipe\" her book you can go to Imus.com and right there on the homepage,  you can click on the video and watch the video of Roxanne Roundtree that  Patrick Gottsch at RFD did and it's -- it change their live.  So if you  still need cook books and well you still to be buying the cookbooks.   Although Esther Newberg or she got a couple of the New York publishers  she's going to fighting over it, it's time to get to published it.  </p><p>But I've got -- I got -- this woman is confined she has the Lou  Gehrig's disease and is confined to a wheelchair and communicates by  blinking her eyes.  She has a three great sons and her husband's a saint,  Don.  And I just got an e-mail from him, a long e-mail -- too long to read.   But as -- I don't know how to describe it, actually.  It is wonderfully  well-written.  Let's start there.</p><p>But he fell in love with Roxanne who is 34 or 35 now.  She -- she came  down with Lou Gehrig's Disease of five, six or four, five years ago.  But  Don fell in love with her in the first grade.  And then talked about, in  this e-mail, about how long it took to persuade her to marry him.  And of  course, she couldn't have married a better person on the planet than this  guy.  Man I mean so -- so that's what I was doing well storming Norman who  is yakking about whatever they were doing.  Anyway -- </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  I got to help these people.  Come on man.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's such a good story.  </p><p>IMUS:  And really is just -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's unbelievable.  </p><p>IMUS:  It really is.  All right seven minutes after the hour.  Hey  Warner, who's -- who's the best football team in the pros?  </p><p>WOLF:  I would you know barring any more injury I would go with the  Broncos.  </p><p>IMUS:  Really?  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  The addition of Wes Welker makes them strong.  They have  a good running game.  </p><p>IMUS:  He hurt himself the other day didn't he?  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes he did.  </p><p>IMUS:  Is he all right now?  Or -- </p><p>WOLF:  Hopefully he'll open the season.  But they already had a good  passing game.  </p><p>IMUS:  Sure.  </p><p>WOLF:  And they lost at -- on that fluke play.  Do you remember the  Baltimore in the playoff?  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>WOLF:  So I would think on paper -- </p><p>IMUS:  They threw that interception.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well that's true in the second overtime yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>WOLF:  You know when you -- when you pick one out of 32 teams before  the season.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>WOLF:  It's really part luck because of the injury factor like no  other sports so.  </p><p>IMUS:  How about the Giants going to be -- we heard this -- </p><p>WOLF:  Well you know they finished nine and seven but they lost their  last two games of the year by a combined score 67-1.  And they lost Amad  Bradshaw (ph) they are leading Rusher (ph) and now they have two offensive  linemen two out of the five offensive lineman don't look like they'll start  the season.  So I -- I would say, at best, nine and seven again maybe  worst.  They don't -- I don't see a running game.  They said oh Wilson and  -- </p><p>IMUS:  Ok fine.  Jet's a joke.  </p><p>WOLF:  On Jets eight-eight at best.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes at best yes.  And its fat coach he'll be gone, but he's not  fat anymore.  </p><p>WOLF:  No he's not but that might not help him.  </p><p>IMUS:  He'll be sucking toes someplace else so.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  </p><p>IMUS:  Anybody else any good?  Are the -- well the Patriots got to be  pretty good right?  </p><p>WOLF:  Sure always good.  Again except the year that Brady got hurt at  the start of the season.  </p><p>IMUS:  How is Alec Smith is he any good?  </p><p>WOLF:  He is but not with this cast, not with Kansas City.  </p><p>IMUS:  Right.  </p><p>WOLF:  No and it's too bad because you know he was playing great for  the 49ers.  </p><p>IMUS:  I know.  </p><p>WOLF:  When Kaepernick -- </p><p>IMUS:  Kaepernick came in yes.  How about -- what else -- how about  Seattle?  </p><p>WOLF:  Well, yes, Russell Wilson I mean he turned them around.  They  are very good sure.  </p><p>IMUS:  Speaking of Kaepernick how about the 49ers?  </p><p>WOLF:  49ers are strong yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  Any other strong teams?  </p><p>WOLF:  I think you have named the best strong teams.  </p><p>IMUS:  Sure.  </p><p>WOLF:  But again, you know that's what's great about the National  Football League.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>WOLF:  You only have 16 games it's not like baseball you know.  </p><p>IMUS:  What happened in this Little League World Series situation?  </p><p>WOLF:  Well you had Taiwan eliminating Panama.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>WOLF:  So Taiwan -- Tijuana, excuse me, not Taiwan.  Tijuana will now  play Tokyo for the international title.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>WOLF:  And the West Port Washington State game was rained out so  they'll play today.  </p><p>IMUS:  We got to bet full for West Port and Tijuana.  </p><p>WOLF:  Ok it's all right yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  Ok.  </p><p>WOLF:  Tijuana, what 23 miles from San Diego and as you pointed out  even closer to -- Tiu Lavista (ph).  </p><p>IMUS:  I used to go to Tijuana when I was in the Marine Corps  stationed at Camp Pendleton.  </p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  For what?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes exactly for what?  </p><p>ROB BARTLETT, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  The art.  </p><p>IMUS:  I think is -- well I forget this was 1957 so -- </p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  We'll be love you time Mr. --  Private Imus.  </p><p>IMUS:  Eleven minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  Well a lot of good stuff coming up.  That dingbat, Liz Claman -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, Oh no, no.  Oh no, no.  You knew what we are, you knew,  what is what ding bat; we are in for it here.  Let's just restart that  sentence please.  </p><p>RUFINO:  I hate it.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh man she's a wacko.  But she's going to interview the guy who  runs the NASDAQ.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Bob Greifeld.  </p><p>IMUS:  And that's coming and I wasn't -- we weren't going to carry it  on the radio because I don't care about it.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  </p><p>IMUS:  But they want to carry it on the television.  And that's your  job and that's my job to make sure they do.  That it gets done which I'm  delighted to do.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Of course.  </p><p>IMUS:  But now I've decided we're going to carry it on the radio as  well.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh ok.  </p><p>IMUS:  And we will carry it for as long as we can stand it.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Got it.  </p><p>IMUS:  And it's just drones on, then we'll bail.  So -- I mean that's  coming up the next hour.  The Godfather is here, of course.  </p><p>BARTLETT:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  And he'll be discussing some stuff this hour and particularly  the Bradley Manning situation.  And then Powell to the People Tony is out  in the street.  Big Foot do we have any of that?  </p><p>TOM BOWMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  We're going to have some  momentarily.  But he was out because of the One Direction concert on the  \"Today\" show.  They're expecting like 15,000 people, mostly kids.  Some of  them have been waiting since Tuesday to get a front row.</p><p>IMUS:  I like that.  I like somebody who would stand (inaudible).  I  wonder if Doug Christie thinks One Direction is better than Delbert.</p><p>Anyway.  Thirteen minutes past the hour.  Let's do some news.  And  here with that is Connell McShane.  Good morning Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Hey good morning I-Man.</p><p>These wildfires are really a big issue out west.  And the one that's  burning outside of Yosemite National Park nearly has quadruples now inside,  in size.  So officials are going door to door -- they're urging people to  get out.  But the evacuations are not mandatory.  So you have some people  like this that are hanging in there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you sticking here.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh yes.  Absolutely.  I will stay in place,  protect what I can as long as I can.</p><p>MCSHANE:  As long, yes, they stayed there.  A lot of times this  happens.  This fire is only about one percent contained though they're  saying at this point.</p><p>We have new comments coming in this morning from President Obama on  Syria.  CNN had him on just about an hour ago saying allegations of  chemical weapons used in Syria is according to the President's quote, a big  even.  And then they asked him about his redline comments that he'd made  about the use of those types of weapons.  And the president said the latest  event in Syria is something the U.S. has to look at.  So that's how he  phrased it.</p><p>Well, we'll see where we go from there but speaking of Syria two UN  agencies say the rising number of children who are turning into refugees  over there resulted in greater threats.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have recorded a million refugees, children  that are found and now in camp settings with host communities and in very  challenging environments.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Nearly three quarters of all of these refugees under the age  of 11.  You have 1 million refugees as you heard in all.  Nearly three  quarters under 11.  </p><p>In Egypt today, security and military forces are deployed around the  city of Cairo.  They've closed off traffic in some of the major roadways.   This comes ahead of protests by the supporters of the former President  Mohamed Morsi and these rallies today kind of a test for the Morsi  supporters.  See if they can keep the pressure up despite the crack down  that we've seen here on the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p>We mentioned President Obama on CNN; later today he visits  Pennsylvania for the first time in more than a year bringing in this plan.   He's been out on the road promoting for college affordability to Scranton.   Joe Biden's hometown -- Scranton Pennsylvania -- Lakawana College (ph)  she'll be later on in the day.</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Coming up on 15 minutes after the hour.  Dagen  McDowell is not here today because, well, what did she tell you, Connell?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, she hit her head on a cabinet the other day and had  wounds so, you know.  </p><p>IMUS:  On her face apparently -- not just her head or something.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  Some kind of a wound on her face.</p><p>IMUS:  Did you ever get any more information?  Did you every talk to  her, Carley?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Hold on one second.</p><p>IMUS:  What happened to Carley?</p><p>MCSHANE:  There she is.</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  I'm right here, hi.  I spoke to  with her, but I did not ask any questions.  I want to get the real story  when she comes in first thing on Monday.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Wait a minute.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, when you spoke to her what was the conversation about  then.</p><p>SHIMKUS:  I just asked her if she needed anything.  If she was in  Manhattan, I'd go over and see her.  She said she is fine, but she needs to  heal up a little bit more.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Ok, good.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  That's a good friend you are.</p><p>IMUS:  So something is not -- we are not getting the story here.  </p><p>SHIMKUS:  I mean it is Friday.  Something is fishy.  Let's be honest.  </p><p>IMUS:  What?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Come on Carley.</p><p>IMUS:  What did you say Carley?</p><p>SHIMKUS:  I said it's Friday.  Something's fishy.  Let's be honest.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Time for a little sports now and sports is  sponsored by Peerless Boilers.  Hey Warner -- </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Patrick Gottsch, you know, did you ever meet him?  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  Sure at your golf tournament, yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Sure.  So he calls me yesterday or texted me.  He says we are  having a big announcement on Rural Radio which is on Sirius XM.  Could you  listen and I was with the kids and I could not.  He said well, we're going  to have it on TV.</p><p>Here is what they are going to do.  They will have a one day two  million dollar rodeo at Cowboys Stadium.  </p><p>WOLF:  No kidding.  </p><p>IMUS:  No.  So I do not know the details of that yet but it is not  until March 2.  But it's going to be $2 million in prize money which should  be the richest rodeo ever held.  And they've invited all of the -- I guess  the ten best cowboys in all events.  Everybody from saddle block riding to  (inaudible) to calf roping team.</p><p>Then, anybody else can enter, I think.  A limited number of them or  just what they call qualifiers and that would be guys who no longer  compete.  Like Joe Beaver could come back and calf-rope if he put on knee  brace and other people could as well.</p><p>WOLF:  Cody Ohl.</p><p>IMUS:  Cody Ohl is still -- he's still going to the national finals.   He will go again this year.  He is still out winning beau coup money.  He's  in the top 15 in the world now.  So that is a huge deal at Cowboys Stadium.  </p><p>WOLF:  Maybe Jerry Jones will be there.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes, Warner.</p><p>Anyway, it is time for sports.  Sports sponsored by Peerless Boilers.   Did I say that.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Anyway, here's the great Warner Wolf.  </p><p>WOLF:  Thank you.  Good morning I-Man.</p><p>Yankees beat the Jays 5-3, they sweep the series.  They've won 10 of  12.  They cut the race for that second wild card spot to 3.5 games.</p><p>IMUS:  By the way, every time Patrick e-mails me and asked me to watch  something or listen to something, I then critique it.  He does not ask me  to do that.  He doesn't say be sure and e-mail me or text me and tell me  what you think of my people who are announcing on the radio or on RFD.  The  announcer that he had on RFD was so annoying and irritating.  I cannot  think of the guy's name.  Some dope.</p><p>Randy Bernard -- he used to be the PBR and the Hyundai car deal and  he's a great guy.  He has terrific ideas.  And this whole rodeo thing is  his idea.  I don't know.  It's just -- I watched him for a few minutes and  it irritated me.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  That is so unlike you.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  I did hear Joe Beaver call in.  He said he's in day 13 of a 15- day clinic.  That is odd, he just left here eight days ago.  That must be  the new math or something.  </p><p>WOLF:  Two a day.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes, maybe two a day or something.</p><p>Anyway, what were you saying now.</p><p>WOLF:  Well, Yanks got a big break when the umps blew a call in the  last of the fifth inning, if you want to see it on Fox Business -- </p><p>IMUS:  Sure.</p><p>WOLF:  It was called by Buck Martinez of CTV sports network.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BUCK MARTINEZ, CTV SPORTS:  -- goes after the first pitch.  Davis --  no catch -- they sit on the tracks and now they have two runners at second.   They tag and try to tag out each.  So now, we have all sorts of confusion.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF:  Well if you look at it again, you'll see that catch is made.   Instead of an inning ending double play, it was incorrectly ruled an RBI  for Wells.  The Yanks took the lead and never trailed.  This is exactly one  of the instances that videotape replay will be used next year.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes.  No justice, no peace.</p><p>WOLF:  Pirates and Cards win.  Pirates still by one.</p><p>And Dodgers Clay Kershaw, eighth inning, shut out the Marlins.  He  lowers his earned run average to 1.72.  Man, that's Gibson, Kofax,  (inaudible) numbers.  And in their playoff drive, the Mets have just signed  former Red Sox right-hander, Daisuke Matsuzaka -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.</p><p>WOLF:  -- who has never been the same since his big 2008 season when  he went 18 and 3.  In fact, he'll pitch tonight.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Did you say the Mets playoff drive?  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I did.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Of course.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  I just wanted to make sure I was hearing properly.</p><p>WOLF:  Of course, come on.</p><p>MCSHANE:  There's still time.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS:  That's hurtful, Warner.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  That's not funny.</p><p>WOLF:  Not at all.  Exhibition football, the Lions beat the Patriots  40-9.</p><p>IMUS:  What?</p><p>WOLF:  The Patriots turned the ball over three of the first four  possessions.  </p><p>Here was Patriots coach Bill Belichick.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BILL BELICHICK, COACH NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS:  When you turn the ball  over four times in the first quarter, that will knock you out of most any  game.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF:  That's right.  Again, you know, Reggie Bush is the new running  back for the Lions.  One yard in six carries.  He did catch five passes,  103 yards.</p><p>IMUS:  Must have had the Kardashian girl he used to be married to on  his back.</p><p>Twenty-one after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING -- what's  coming up in the briefing, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  President Obama, he pulled a boner in front of a bunch of  college kids if I may employ some old school vernacular.  And comedian  Louis C.K., he finds a dead body in the river.  We have the audio -- </p><p>IMUS:  What?  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes.  Yes, indeed.  True story boss, true story.</p><p>IMUS:  And the Godfather's coming up and Powell to the people is  coming up as well.  Well, I hope Doug Christine has got his TV on or his  radio.</p><p>You're telling me that Omar (inaudible).  Delbert McClinton.  Have you  lost your mind?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MACEDO:  Good morning everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo. </p><p>And we will get a new reading on the housing market this morning.  New  home sales for July are expected to fall 1.5 percent from June to 490,000.   That would be disappointing reading after existing home sales for last  month jumped 6.5 percent to their highest level in four years. </p><p>The mood of the housing market though does seem to be improving.

He is the only guy that's on live this week,  everybody is off, everybody .</p><p>IMUS:  Yeah.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Not one funny thing could we use from Mr. Letterman, but  that was the best and here we are bringing it to the I-Man.  A dead body in  the East River, just another day in New York City.</p><p>IMUS:  Yeah.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  And at least they didn't speculate that it was Jay Leno or  something like that, some mean-spirited thing.</p><p>IMUS:  Yeah.  Something we'd have done .</p><p>MCGUIRK:  But you know what, Jimmy Kimmel, thought, remember that  kid, he was - the judge told the parents that no, you cannot name your kid  Messiah, you're going to name him Martin, all right?  In any case, Jimmy  Kimmel has this to say about that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST:  Guys.  So no, you are not  naming your son Messiah and forced him to change it to Martin.  So, we'd  better - if your first name is Messiah, you will never find little  personalized license plates for your bike.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KIMMEL:  Plus, there's a lot of pressure to have.  Oh, great,  Messiah wet his bed again.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KIMMEL:  I don't think what the judge did was legal, but I'm glad  she did it.  In fact, I think we should bring her to Hollywood, put her in  charge of celebrity baby names.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KIMMEL:  Because there is - not even giving their kids names  anymore, they're giving them nouns.

And central  bankers are in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for their annual conference.  Fox  Business' Peter Barnes is there too.  Here is an update.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, let's just call it  taper talk in the teatimes this time around in Jackson Hole.  It's the Fed  officials and central bankers from around the world gathering to hear the  latest research on the economy and on monetary policy, but the real action  takes place on the sidelines during the breaks and in the hallways where  the participants can talk to each other one-on-one and share information  and talk about the effectiveness of policy and the state of the recovery  and of easy money policies.  Of course, the big question here is when the  Fed could start to wind down, to dial back its $85 billion a month in  quantitative easing bond purchases designed to help keep interest rates low  on mortgages and other types of loans coming in to the conference.  The  handicapping is that the Fed could start small at its next policy meeting  in September.</p><p>The big elephant not in the room this time around at Jackson Hole is  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.  He is skipping the conference for the first  time since he became Fed chairman back in 2005.  The Fed says he has a  personal scheduling conflict, but a lot of folks here are looking and  talking about who may succeed Ben Bernanke as the chairman, who President  Obama will appoint.  One of the leading contenders is the vice chairman of  the Fed, Janet Yellen.  She is here and will moderate a panel on Saturday  on her leading rival in the contest.  Larry Summers, former economic  adviser to the president is not attending.  Back to you in New York.</p><p>MACEDO:  All right.  That's Peter Barnes in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p><p>Taking a look at futures, we've got a fairly flat morning, Dow  futures are down eight.  \"Imus in the Morning\" continues right now.</p><p>IMUS:  To my man.  Freddie Toyota on Highland Boulevard in Staten  Island, 19 minutes now until the hour.  Please welcome to the program Don  Corleone, the godfather.  Good morning, godfather.</p><p>BARTLETT:  Good morning, Don Imus.  At first I was disappointed in  this Bradley Manning leaking the classified information, but now there are  some suggestions that he did so because he preferred to - I'm now a woman -  literally.  He may think that he is a female trapped in a man's body, as if  that catzone (ph) hanging of him with some kind of padlock .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT:  And all this time I assumed he wasn't that good at  keeping secrets.  Man, he says that he has - a feminile (ph) - and wishes  to be treated as such.  Well, I hope he will be relieved to know that his  wish will be partially granted when serving his sentence.  He will be  surrounded by men who will be more than happy to treat him as the  receptacle for their (speaking Italian).  Trust me, you don't want that  translated.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT:  What bothers me is that this revelation suggests his  punishment is less a penalty than a reward.  He will spend his years in  jail like it was some kind of Fire Island Labor Day barbecue.  The only  thing that won't be part of his plan is the being referred to as Chelsea.   For I think the name he will be known by will be more along the lines of  bitch.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT:  But if it were up to me he would be for his infamnia (ph)  with the real punishment like being extradited to Russia where they would  be more than happy to cut off the very thing that is trapping him in a  man's body.  He divulged classified information, but the leaking has just  begun.  </p><p>IMUS:  Thank you, Godfather.  For - that's assessment - and 17 until  the hour.  \"Powell to the People\" coming up next.  This is an unauthorized  airing of this record of (inaudible)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO:  Hi, everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo, and let's check the  markets now, the day after the NASDAQ flash freed that halted trading for  three hours.  Asian markets ended the day mixed:  Japan's Nikkei followed  the U.S., rebounded, finished the day at more than two percent.  South  Korea's KOSPI gained more than one percent, but the Hang Seng and Shanghai  did end with red arrows.  Over in Europe, we got the second reading on  second quarter GDP for the U.K.  And Germany, both rose seven tenths of a  percent, London's up about 35, Frankfurt is up about 18, but Paris is down  almost two points.</p><p>Here, in the U.S. futures have been pointing to a lower open for  most of the morning.  Dow futures are still down by about a four, but the  S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are showing some slight gains.  We will be keeping an  eye on those for you.  Gap raised its full year earnings outlook and annual  dividend after reporting a 25 percent jump in its second quarter profit  compared to last year.  The retailer said it earned $0.64 a share matching  the estimate.  Revenue rose just over eight percent to $3.7 billion.  That  also tops expectations.  Gap now expects to report a profit of $2.57 to  $2.65 a share.  That's $0.05 above its previous range.  The company also  raised its annual dividend to $0.80 per share up from $0.60.</p><p>We're getting earnings in now from Ann Inc, formally Ann Taylor, the  company is reporting a profit of $0.76 a share, topping the estimate for  $0.65.  Revenue, though, was a slight miss at $638,2 million.  Analysts  were expecting $639 million.  \"Imus in the Morning\" continues right now on  Fox Business.</p><p>IMUS:  Why did that commercial sound like it was under water, Lou?</p><p>RUFINO:  My fault, I guess.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, now, that was - comes from your studio or the other  studio?</p><p>RUFINO:  No, I don't know anything about it.</p><p>IMUS:  But do you care about it?</p><p>RUFINO:  Does it sound like I care?</p><p>IMUS:  No, it doesn't.  It's just like - you're parallel.</p><p>RUFINO:  No, I guess so.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, yeah - but I mean we charge these people all these  money for this commercial, and want people to be able to hear them.</p><p>This part of the program is sponsored by Freddie Toyota on the  Highland Boulevard in Staten Island.</p><p>Well, hey, Bernie, is CBS off in how much of the country?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, Time Warner, I don't know what the percentage is, my  guess is, approximately half.  But I think they just got back on Verizon  files.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I don't know if it's - but the big, the funny thing was  they put them back on Channel 2 last night, just to have the debate between  - what Spitzer was on.</p><p>IMUS:  Sure.</p><p>MCSHANE:  They didn't want, you know, to be accused of keeping that  off the air.</p><p>IMUS:  One direction is appearing on the \"Today Show,\" which is only  a couple of blocks from where the Fox Studios are.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yeah.</p><p>IMUS:  They are on 6th Avenue, the Avenue of the Americas.

Can you sing it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You mean best song ever?</p><p>POWELL:  Can you sing it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Not really well.  </p><p>POWELL:  So, you're excited to see one erection?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, I don't care.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I am.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, I'm very excited.

I mean - want an erection  talking to kids?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Where did you get that from?</p><p>IMUS:  What is the matter with you? </p><p>POWELL:  I don't know.  It's just - I don't know.  It seemed funny to  me.  I don't know why it means .</p><p>IMUS:  It wasn't funny, not in that context, you idiot.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh-oh.</p><p>IMUS:  It is eight minutes until -- what is the matter with you,  Bigfoot?  So, here is the new rule.  Before we put any of these on the air  you have got to show them to me.  You understand.</p><p>POWELL:  Yes, starting next week.</p><p>IMUS:  Because, well, I am going to be off next week.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's a good time to start it.</p><p>IMUS:  Because your judgment sucks.</p><p>POWELL:  One time.

He said, well, when did you go here? </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's just me.</p><p>IMUS:  OK.  We need to figure it out.  But I guess - at the  University of Virginia, you missed that day.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Some of them say they got - some of them said they .</p><p>IMUS:  No, not Tony - it's not - this is not an opportunity to  debate.  So, Rob Bartlett will be appearing at the Leavitt Theater in  Ogunsuck (ph) Maine.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Ogunquit.</p><p>IMUS:  Whatever.  September 21st, and Tony will be appearing at the  Belmar Theater on Saturday, September 28th for an evening with Tony Powell.   That ought to be good.  Well, it could be good as long as he doesn't do any  of this and you could get tickets to that by going to NY  entrainmentclub.com or you could get a hold of that Bellmore theater, and I  want to see Tony.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  I am confident that he is funny.  If you want to see evidence  of this.  Now that this dingbat Liz Claman--</p><p>MCSHANE:  No, no, no.</p><p>IMUS:  He is going to interview the head of the NASDAQ .</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Oh, great.</p><p>IMUS:  Because they got shutdown yesterday.  And we don't know -  nobody knows why.  I mean there was - you know, the suspicion is that they  are lying, whatever they tell her.  But we just - we have Warner watch this  and see if we can determine if either one of them was lying.  Five minute  now till the hour.</p><p>IMUS:  A lot of the people out there - what did you think, Dagen,  again?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just thought it was badly cast, like the comedian, why  is he there and then they have this woman sitting off to the side on -  reporting on what people are tweeting about, reading stuff on the Twitter,  off the Internet, and just pointless.</p><p>IMUS:  Yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They could be a better way to integrate it.  I mean if  you want to have like a hot check, just have her sit there and do nothing.   And just cut - OK, let's give them the hot check a few minutes, you just  take a shot of her and then go back talking about some sports.  It was just  exhausting.</p><p>IMUS:  Sounds to me like you are kind of dissing Carley in an odd  way.</p><p>CARLEY:  Yeah, come on, Dagen.  Come on there.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Hey, Carley.</p><p>IMUS:  Doesn't sound that way to you, Carley?</p><p>CARLEY:  Yeah, what is going on?  All that hate?</p><p>IMUS:  Yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what - that chick on (inaudible) is a brunette.   So, that was not .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  Like we have said Carley redeemed and stuffed.</p><p>MCSHANE:  And I was great when .</p><p>CARLEY:  And I would be happy to read some tweets.</p><p>IMUS:  Hey, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yeah.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Do whatever you want, Carley.</p><p>CARLEY:  All right.</p><p>IMUS:  I thought you liked Carley.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love Carley.</p><p>CARLEY:  I love Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you really want me to drive down this road?  Because  it will get dirty real quick.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  OK, put the pedal to the metal.</p><p>IMUS:  I don't have a problem with it.  I mean I've got nothing to  do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love Carley.  It was not a shot at Carley.</p><p>IMUS:  But your kids were not up yet.  Go for it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS:  This is the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program on the Fox Business  Network.  Now here's Diane Macedo.</p><p>MACEDO:  Good morning everyone.  Let's check the markets now the day  after a NASDAQ flash freeze halted trading for three hours.  U.S. futures  are mixed.  We have Dow futures down by one point.  The S&amp;P and NASDAQ  turned things around.  The S&amp;P is up by almost a point, about a point  exactly.  There now NASDAQ is up almost four.  Now, for more on what  happened at the NASDAQ yesterday let's go to Nicole Petallides who joins us  in the newsroom.  Hi, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS:  Hey, good morning, Diane, good morning  everybody.  Well, yesterday's flash freeze from someone who was standing  right on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange felt more like an  eternity freeze, right? </p><p>So, it took them about a half hour to really figure out what the problem  was and then another two and a half hours to actually reopen the Nasdaq  MarketSite. </p><p>So, it's very interesting as we watch what happened, it was actually due to  a glitch in the processor.  A securities information processor SIP which  now seems to be regular wording that we use now on Wall Street today.</p><p>But basically it's a way that they give out prices to all the different  exchanges, 13 exchanges, 40 dark pools.  And when this had a glitch, they  basically halted trading across the board.  </p><p>Names like Apple, Blackberry, Costco, Cisco, Dow components as well.  So,  you have Google, JetBlue, just to name a few of the names.</p><p>So, what's interesting is you have different people speaking out today, Bob  Greifeld, the CEO of Nasdaq seems very proud of the way that they figured  out what the problem was. </p><p>And order and had an orderly reopening and didn't feel the need to address  any transparency or address the press, et cetera. </p><p>He said he's working closely with other exchanges.  However, when you talk  to SEC chair, Mary Jo White, also Harvey Pitt, former SEC chairman, Arthur  Levitt, former SEC chairman, they seem less than pleased. </p><p>Obviously noting that this was a serious issue, that's according to Mary Jo  White, Harvey Pitt said this, it shouldn't have happened at all. </p><p>And so obviously and Arthur Levitt as well expressing displeasure.  So, now  what happens today and how do we ensure that this doesn't happen again and  really leave Americans and people all over the world with their money tied  up and not sure as to when they will be able to execute trades again? </p><p>Now, this is reminiscent of what we remember from Facebook, that debacle of  an IPO, you know the ink is barely dry on that $10 million check that  Nasdaq had to pay out in order to calm that issue. </p><p>So, this remains an issue and it's all about the complexity of trading  which as I noted, 13 exchanges, more than 40 dark pools and that trillions  of dollars at hand. </p><p>So, this is a very tough day yesterday on Wall Street.  And of course, once  again, it's a blast to investor confidence.  Diane. </p><p>MACEDO:  All right, that's Nicole Petallides from the newsroom, thanks,  Nicole.  And central bankers are gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the  Kansas City Fed's annual conference. </p><p>Fox Business' Peter Barnes joins us live with a preview, good morning,  Peter. </p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS:  Hey, good morning, Diane.  Well, the topic at  this year's conference is global dimensions of unconventional monetary  policy. </p><p>What does that mean? Well, basically they're here to talk about low long- term interest rates, quantitative easing, those billions and trillions of  dollars that the Fed has spent to buy mortgage-backed securities and  treasury securities. </p><p>All of it to try to keep interest rates low for average consumers so they  can go out and buy cars and get low-cost mortgages and their businesses can  get low loans. </p><p>So, that -- this stuff matters to the average consumer.  The big topic here  and the big buzz is, when will the Fed start to now dial back all of this  quantitative easing? </p><p>It's been doing $85 billion a month since September but it appears that the  Fed is now getting ready to start pull that back, to start tapering that,  to start dialing that down. </p><p>And that's what's given a lot of heartburn to the markets and caused a lot  of these, a lot of the roller coaster ride out in the markets. </p><p>And there will be some papers presented here that talk about quantitative  easing, there's been some other recent papers that say basically, you know  what? </p><p>It's really not working anymore and that kind of research could help push  the Fed to get out of quantitative easing quicker, sooner rather than  later. </p><p>I want to mention we got a great lineup of guests here in Jackson Hole this  year and just a little bit later in this hour, we'll talk to Dennis  Lockhart, he is the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. </p><p>We'll be talking later today to Jim Bullard, the President of the Saint  Louis Federal Reserve, they both have been very vocal on this issue of  quantitative easing. </p><p>And later this afternoon at 5:00, we'll be talking to Christine Lagarde,  the head of the International Monetary Fund who is doing all those bailouts  around the world.  Diane, back to you. </p><p>MACEDO:  All right, that's Peter Barnes in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  Here is  a quick look at commodities, oil and gold are up, IMUS IN THE MORNING  continues right now.  </p><p>DON IMUS, HOST, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Oh, well, Tom Friedman from the \"New  York Times\" is coming up, we'll talk to him at the bottom of the hour. </p><p>And Warner has got sports, Bernie's briefing stuff, Dagen is not here today  because she still has -- man, I don't know. </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Injuries. </p><p>IMUS:  The girl got some bruises that she -- so this makeup -- they can't  put any makeup on it. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right. </p><p>IMUS:  And it seems odd.  So, and we just -- I just don't think we're  probably ever going to get to -- well, she claims she walked into a  cabinet, right? </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's what she said, yes, that's it, and we have to take her at  her word, i-man? </p><p>IMUS:  No.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, I see. </p><p>IMUS:  No, of course not. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Just asking. </p><p>IMUS:  Hey, Bigfoot, Liz Claman is coming up and talking to Greifeld,  right? </p><p>TOM BOWMAN, PRODUCER, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Yes, she is sitting down right  now, so, in just about four minutes. </p><p>IMUS:  This is a guy who is -- what does this guy do? </p><p>BOWMAN:  He is the head of Nasdaq, so -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, OK -- </p><p>BOWMAN:  He is going to -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, right though -- </p><p>BOWMAN:  Try and explain what happened yesterday. </p><p>IMUS:  So he'll be on -- </p><p>BOWMAN:  Yes -- </p><p>IMUS:  Camera? --  </p><p>BOWMAN:  She'll be sitting down with him for a quick four or five minutes  in interview. </p><p>IMUS:  OK, I want you to get a look at him, Warner. </p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTS PRESENTER, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  OK -- </p><p>IMUS:  Pay attention here -- </p><p>WOLF:  All right, see if his eyes wiggle around, see if -- </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, yes -- </p><p>WOLF:  He fidgets -- </p><p>IMUS:  Hey, well Bigfoot, well, how am I going to know whether she's ready  -- </p><p>BOWMAN:  I'm going to let you know -- </p><p>IMUS:  You going to tell me? -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  That also be great -- </p><p>BOWMAN:  Hey, and by the way you're not -- </p><p>IMUS:  And then I'll listen -- </p><p>BOWMAN:  Tossing the people, he was talking to parents, he didn't ask that  question to the minors about -- </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, with the kids standing around there --  </p><p>BOWMAN:  But he was directing it to the parents and Tony's -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  No children, right -- </p><p>BOWMAN:  No children -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's a good point, Tom. </p><p>IMUS:  But it wasn't funny anyway, so, you want to discuss it --  </p><p>BOWMAN:  No, that's why from now on we're going to have you -- </p><p>IMUS:  No -- </p><p>BOWMAN:  Look at it first. </p><p>IMUS:  Going to have to show me because I don't trust you or him. </p><p>BOWMAN:  Oh, wait a minute -- </p><p>IMUS:  I mean I -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BOWMAN:  Just Tony and others, the only people on the show you don't trust? </p><p>IMUS:  I've been doing this a while, I know what I'm doing.  And if you  guys think you know better, Tony, you think you know better or Bigfoot, you  guys go do it yourself somewhere. </p><p>But for the time-being, we're going to do what I think is funny.  See how  that works out -- God -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right --  </p><p>BOWMAN:  Right you are, I'm good -- </p><p>IMUS:  It's not really -- </p><p>BOWMAN:  I'm all good -- </p><p>IMUS:  Sounds really like a jerk, don't they? </p><p>MCSHANE:  We're going to have a great day -- </p><p>IMUS:  What a creep. </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's it, let's move.  </p><p>IMUS:  Anyway -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Keep it moving, everything is all right, nothing to see here -- </p><p>IMUS:  I need to get away from you bastards for a couple of weeks -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, well, whether you know, that's -- </p><p>IMUS:  Jeez, I'm just sick of you -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Perfect timing -- </p><p>IMUS:  I really am -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Holy God, what are the odds? </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You're off for two weeks, oh, this is the best news all morning.  </p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  You got to get away  from all of these bastards -- </p><p>IMUS:  Was that funny, Lou? </p><p>RUFINO:  That is pretty damn funny, actually.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCSHANE:  No, stop, Lou.  </p><p>IMUS:  Why don't you do some news -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Sure, I'll be honored to -- </p><p>IMUS:  While I think about firing Tony and Rob -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  No, that's not -- </p><p>IMUS:  And fantasize -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I know -- </p><p>IMUS:  It -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Fantasize -- </p><p>IMUS:  Why don't you tell us what's going on then when Foot notifies me  that Liz is ready, we'll go to her.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Wait until you hear this first story, this will get you worked up  anyway.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  About Syria.  Is the United States planning for airstrikes in  Syria?  The \"Wall Street Journal\" actually has a report on this -- in this  morning's paper that officials began,  \"refining their options\" for  possible airstrikes. </p><p>You know, supposedly updating target lists and the like for the possibility  of striking Syria. </p><p>U.S. airstrikes but we'll see.  Here is President Obama making an  appearance, talking about some of these things on \"Cnn\", he was on with  Chris Cuomo earlier this morning.  Here's a little bit of the interview. </p><p>IMUS:  Where is it? </p><p>MCSHANE:  Where are we on that Tom? Remember that Cuomo -- </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) </p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN:  Do you believe at this point you need to investigate -- </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)   </p><p>MCSHANE:  Here we go -- </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>CUOMO:  In order to say what seems obvious, which is that the U.S. needs to  do more. </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, we are right now  gathering information about this particular event but -- </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Chemical weapons -- </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>OBAMA:  I can say that unlike some of the evidence -- </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>IMUS:  We have to interrupt this, that's enough.  Now, stop it! -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Not -- </p><p>IMUS:  Playing a cut from \"Cnn\", that's just idiotic.  All right, please  welcome now to the program Liz Claman, good morning, Miss Claman. </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right -- </p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Good morning, Don and to all of your listeners  and viewers, we are live at the Nasdaq MarketSite. </p><p>You know, there are many exchanges, but the two biggest, the New York Stock  Exchange and the Nasdaq, one of them went down yesterday for a full three  hours. </p><p>Throwing the entire trading system for all of you who maybe have 401(k)s or  trade stocks, it went down for a full three hours and of course, now, it's  been attributed to a highly technical glitch. </p><p>We're joined now by the CEO of the Nasdaq, Bob Greifeld.  Thank you for  being here --  </p><p>ROBERT GREIFELD, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NASDAQ:  I'm glad to have you  here, Liz. </p><p>CLAMAN:  OK, this is not a great day for you, this was a nightmare  yesterday, but it was also a nightmare for companies like Yahoo!, Apple,  Google who list on the Nasdaq but also the individual investor. </p><p>Right off the bat, I have to ask you because so many people were  questioning this.  Was there any indication of any kind of computer hacking  or system hacking here? </p><p>GREIFELD:  No, none whatsoever.  So, this had nothing to do with hacking.   Hacking is a fact of life but had nothing to do with the problem yesterday. </p><p>CLAMAN:  That worries some people that it was an internal system because it  indicates to some people, you guys don't have your arms wrapped around your  system? </p><p>GREIFELD:  Well, certainly we're deeply disappointed with what happened  yesterday and what we had to do is improve what I call defensive driving. </p><p>So, our system by itself was working but you have interconnections in the  world we live in today and we have to handle bad actions from some of those  people connected to us.  </p><p>And we have to improve on that.  So, we're deeply disappointed but I would  highlight that one of the reasons it took three hours was, we have a first  and foremost responsibility for fair and orderly markets. </p><p>So, we spent two and a half hours really making sure the entire industry,  we had opened telephone lines with them, we made sure the entire industry  was ready to come live and we did come live, we came live quite  successfully and finished the day in normal course of business. </p><p>CLAMAN:  Nobody begrudges you that moment where you have to work and make  sure that once you do press go again, it's going to be fine. </p><p>What they do get very upset about, Bob, is the lack of communication.  I  talked to CEOs of Nasdaq-traded companies who said I got nothing. </p><p>I'm sitting in meetings, I'm checking my Blackberry, I'm checking my phone,  there's nothing from the Nasdaq.  </p><p>They do know that you were putting out some 20 missives to the trading  community, but that's not the CEOs of all of these companies who are  worried about their stocks. </p><p>What's wrong with your communication system? </p><p>GREIFELD:  Well, our communication system I think worked well yesterday.   It can always be improved.  </p><p>First order of businesses to focus on solving the problem and then dealing  with people directly involved with the problem. </p><p>Now, in one of those open lines we had people representing our issuers on  the call and they were -- they are to give regular updates out. </p><p>We gave a formal update out after the close of trading which we wanted to  do.  So, I think we did well, we'll certainly reflect upon how we  communicate, see if we can do better. </p><p>CLAMAN:  Can't you just -- </p><p>GREIFELD:  But certainly -- </p><p>CLAMAN:  Hire somebody to work the phones and call the IR offices? The --  </p><p>GREIFELD:  Oh, they were doing that -- </p><p>CLAMAN:  You know -- </p><p>GREIFELD:  Although we had teams --  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Investor relations offices -- </p><p>GREIFELD:  No -- </p><p>CLAMAN:  On the stock --   </p><p>GREIFELD:  We had teams of people doing that.  As I'm saying, we had the  people responsible for the issuers on the open lines so they could hear  first-hand exactly what was going on. </p><p>They were taking inbound calls, we took hundreds of inbound calls,  reaching, making outbound calls.  So, there was active communication going  on. </p><p>In this type of situation, you probably didn't get to every single CEO or  every single IRO, but we communicated quite actively to a large number of  them. </p><p>Then the official communication went out after the close of trading day to  everybody. </p><p>CLAMAN:  OK -- </p><p>GREIFELD:  Right, so, it happened you know, quite rapidly. </p><p>CLAMAN:  I get the explanations but we had former Securities and Exchange  Commission head, Harvey Pitt on yesterday, he was very harsh. </p><p>You were probably busy working the situation, but he said the Nasdaq  handled this \"terribly\".  What he didn't like too was when you started the  systems up.  </p><p>He said you only allowed trading in certain stocks, and he said how can you  be fair when you're only allowing certain stocks to get up -- </p><p>GREIFELD:  Well, I think it's hard for people outside direct involvement  with the problem to comment and comment intelligently on it. </p><p>So we have -- </p><p>CLAMAN:  Well, you're taking the smack at Harvey Pitt? </p><p>GREIFELD:  Well -- </p><p>CLAMAN:  I mean, he's not -- </p><p>GREIFELD:  I'm just saying for anybody who is not there, right? So, they --  you know the people who are not on the open lines, who are not in the head  trader alert communication, it's hard for them to know, right? </p><p>And hard for them to comment intelligently in terms of what happened.  So,  everybody was directly involved, the exchanges were on what's called the  UTP line. </p><p>SIP arranged a line with our members, in addition to that, we had the head  trader alert.  So, that happened all the way and each plan, right?</p><p>And we solved the problem within half an hour, right? And certain members  made a request in terms of having a longer period of time to quote -- </p><p>CLAMAN:  OK -- </p><p>GREIFELD:  Instead of five-15 minutes, that cost a half hour of time to get  ready for that.  So, that communication was there and I think to the extent  that anybody who wasn't involved became involved, we said OK, that was as  active as you can get. </p><p>CLAMAN:  You guys are considered the sexier exchange. </p><p>GREIFELD:  Yes.   </p><p>CLAMAN:  You know, you've got the lots of the dotcoms of the world but  there are some that aren't public yet.  Twitter, for example, everybody is  waiting for that to go public. </p><p>Do you think you've lost Twitter? Can you make a 30-second pitch to Twitter  to say here is why you should still consider listing on Nasdaq? </p><p>GREIFELD:  Well, I think it's important to recognize that we aspire towards  perfection with respect to the operations of our systems. </p><p>And technology people, Twitter and all the companies recognize that.  We  will always fall short of that but we have to keep trying, right? </p><p>And we get better all the time, and the number of problems have actually  declined.  But probably as importantly, we have to make sure we handle  problems in the proper way, right? </p><p>So, what we did yesterday, right, nobody wanted to be down for three hours  and if we had been quite reckless we could have been up a lot sooner than  that. </p><p>But I think the procedures we had in place, the industry had in place  worked well.  So, we would say to any technology-based company, we're not  perfect, right? </p><p>We're 99.99 percent perfect, we're not perfect, we'll have problems but if  we do, we're going to make sure we maintain a fair and orderly market. </p><p>And that's what we did yesterday.  And it's important to recognize the fact  we didn't trade for several hours.  If you're a traditional long investor,  a mom-and-pop, institutional investor, that three hours doesn't matter. </p><p>You're buying the stock for the longer period of time, right? And the fact  is, every single person was in the same situation.  Nobody was relatively  advantaged or disadvantaged because the market was down for that -- </p><p>CLAMAN:  I -- </p><p>GREIFELD:  Period of time. </p><p>CLAMAN:  Some moms and pops are a little more sophisticated these days and  like to trade a lot.  But either way, we appreciate you coming on Fox -- </p><p>GREIFELD:  Right -- </p><p>CLAMAN:  Business and IMUS IN THE MORNING to talk about this.  Bob Greifeld  is the CEO of the Nasdaq, we now rejoin IMUS IN THE MORNING on Fox Business  and on radio.  Back to you. </p><p>IMUS:  Praise God -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p>IMUS:  He sounds like he might have had a head injury, doesn't he? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Jesus -- well, he's been up all night -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  But Warner was on top of it over there, I saw -- </p><p>IMUS:  What do you think, Warner? </p><p>WOLF:  Well, my question is if you grabbed his hands, could he talk? I  mean, that guy just broke the record for gestures with hands. </p><p>IMUS:  What does that mean? </p><p>WOLF:  Well, it means you're not quite comfortable enough with just  verbalizing and you think you have to emphasize everything -- </p><p>IMUS:  Well, he's on the spot here.  My favorite part of the interview is  when Liz breathlessly -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p>IMUS:  Like she said, you don't have your arms wrapped around your problem.   What kind of question is that? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Don't have your arms wrapped around -- oh, God. </p><p>MCSHANE:  That was fun. </p><p>IMUS:  So we don't know anything, do we? We don't know any more now than we  knew, so -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's kind of what I was thinking, there was -- </p><p>IMUS:  Man, at least she got him on. </p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  She'll get all  this press all day long, she interviewed him and it's all good.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  You need to get Warner to analyze all our business interviews  from now on, on the 11:00 show with me, it would be great, Warner.  </p><p>WOLF:  Sure, I'll be -- </p><p>IMUS:  Or anybody who is on -- </p><p>WOLF:  Right -- </p><p>IMUS:  Who we can see -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, could be great -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RUFINO:  I was looking at Connell's -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Liar -- </p><p>RUFINO:  Yes, before and -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Look at this -- </p><p>IMUS:  We didn't have any answers. </p><p>MCSHANE:  No. </p><p>IMUS:  But she asked the right questions, just -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, she did -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Damn right -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  She was fine, yes -- </p><p>IMUS:  That breathless -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  At least -- </p><p>IMUS:  I don't know, it's fine, she's fine. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p>IMUS:  It's all fine, it's all good. </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's all -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Really is -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Good --  </p><p>IMUS:  Quote Mark Seliger and Rusty Truck, \"It's All Good\".  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p>IMUS:  What are we supposed to do now? 17 after the hour?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Some sports, you know -- </p><p>IMUS:  All right, let's do that, sponsored by Peerless Boilers, good  morning, Warner. </p><p>WOLF:  Good morning, i-man.  All right, here we go, Yanks beat the Jays 5- 3, they sweep the series 10 out of 12.  A blown call by the umpire in the  bottom of the fifth with the bases loaded really gave the Yanks a huge  break. </p><p>Here was the call by Michael Kay, \"YES Network\". </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>MICHAEL KAY, SPORTSCASTER:  Right through the centerfield, it is caught.   It's going to be -- no, he drops the ball about five seconds and it is a  double play. </p><p>He's tagging everybody whether it's a double play, the ending inning.  Did  he make the catch? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No -- </p><p>KAY:  Now they're saying that he didn't make the catch? </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>WOLF:  Well, he didn't make the catch -- </p><p>IMUS:  Yes -- </p><p>WOLF:  So, instead of a double play ending the inning, Wells was given an  RBI, the Yanks took the lead and never trailed.  And this is exactly what  videotape replay will be used next year. </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, thank God. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p>RUFINO:  That will help -- </p><p>WOLF:  Yes -- </p><p>RUFINO:  Everything -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Amen -- </p><p>RUFINO:  Game will be five hours. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, fantastic -- </p><p>WOLF:  Clayton Kershaw -- </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, that's just great, Warner -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Bring the videotape delay -- </p><p>RUFINO:  Well, the umpires are still looking -- </p><p>WOLF:  Well, they're supposed to -- </p><p>IMUS:  Hey, what sporting activity is around today, Warner? </p><p>WOLF:  Well today, you have -- if you want to watch NFL football tonight,  Seahawks, Packers, Bears and Raiders. </p><p>IMUS:  Well, I'll watch that and I might watch the Seahawks. </p><p>WOLF:  And also you can watch the little league game between Westport and  Sammamish. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh -- </p><p>WOLF:  That will be -- </p><p>IMUS:  What time is that? </p><p>WOLF:  That's a 3:00 game. </p><p>IMUS:  Is that Eastern Time? </p><p>WOLF:  Yes, Westport -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, Williamsport -- </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right -- </p><p>WOLF:  And of course, the winner will play Chula Vista for the U.S. title.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, yes -- </p><p>WOLF:  So, that's a huge game. </p><p>IMUS:  Anything else? </p><p>WOLF:  Well, kind of funny, you have Brian Wilson, a pitch to the ninth  inning of the Dodgers game.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They did -- </p><p>WOLF:  Take a look at him, if you don't know, the big beard and he's been  offered a million dollars to shave his beard by 800razors.com. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes -- </p><p>WOLF:  That's it.  In golf, Kevin Stadler has the first round lead of the  Charles Barkley tournament as you have said. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right -- </p><p>WOLF:  And -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  That was unfunny joke three hours ago when -- </p><p>WOLF:  Oh -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  You just going to ride it until it's -- </p><p>WOLF:  Oh, yes -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  But yesterday was funny -- </p><p>WOLF:  I think it's clever, yes -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, very well -- </p><p>WOLF:  It's a terrible joke but it's clever. </p><p>MCSHANE:  A good line -- </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, it is -- </p><p>WOLF:  Tiger Woods was three back at 67 and Rory McIlroy who Gary Player  said needs a good woman, had three double-bogeys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>In football last night, the Panthers beat the Ravens, all four touchdowns  came on turnovers.  Two interceptions, a punt return and a fumble return. </p><p>And the Lions beat the Patriots 40 to 9.

Please, ixnay on the letters.  800-754-6980. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MACEDO:  Good morning everyone, I'm Diane Macedo.  And we'll get a new  reading on the housing market this morning.  New home sales for July are  expected to fall 1.5 percent from June to 490,000.  </p><p>That would be a disappointing reading after existing home sales for last  month jumped 6.5 percent to their highest level in four years. </p><p>But the mood of the housing market does appear to be improving.  Home  builders confidence jumped last week to its highest level in eight years  despite rising interest rates.  </p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.  </p><p>WOLF:  Meanwhile, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman says the Yanks will  win -- </p><p>IMUS:  Hello? </p><p>MCSHANE:  Hello? -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>WOLF:  Well, wait -- </p><p>IMUS:  Hello, Warner. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>WOLF:  Hey, Brian.

Our last day  from the ranch for this summer, so -- and Glenn and everybody out here,  Glenn is great and been doing it forever.  He and his crew, and Glenn and  Ken, Ken's great.  Glenn's great and kid over here with the camera and the  woman whatever her name is.</p><p>In fact, I know these people and only worked with them 15 years, but  it's a great crew here at the ranch.  They really, they're here on --  they're never late and everything works.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Very good.</p><p>IMUS:  And they're real pros.  And out of Albuquerque and do a lot of film  work and they're real professionals and I greatly appreciate it, like all  of them.  It's 31 past the hour.  Time for a Bernie Briefing and that's  sponsored by My Pillow.  Here with it is Bernard McGuirk.  Good morning,  Mr. McGuirk.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Good morning, Mr. Imus.  Yesterday, as Warner Wolf pointed out,  the day before yesterday, Ichiro Suzuki, 4,000 hits combined with his  Japanese career and his Major League Baseball career.  And this dude, JJ  from Staten Island called in, as sportsgreat.com writes and so it began on  Mike Francesa's dozy time sleep train as our host lambasted a startled  caller on Yankees celebration of Ichiro's 4,000 hits and repeated himself.   JJ stayed Suzuki had an accomplishment.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE FRANCESA, SPORTS RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  JJ in Staten Island, what's  up. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it's very, very unbelievable accomplishment,  you know?</p><p>FRANCESA:  No, I don't know.  I disagree completely.  Disagree completely  and I think it's ridiculous.  He has 4,000 hits?  Why?  We now, the Major  League and the Japanese leagues are now co-leagues?  He has 2,700 major  league hits.  He doesn't have anything more than that.  I think it's  utterly ridiculous that we are now going to act like Ichiro got 4,000 hits.   He didn't get 4,000 hits, he has 2,700 hits.  I give you that, but only  2700 hits as far as we're concerned.</p><p>He doesn't have 3,000 hits and how the heck does he have 4,000 hits?   I mean, when did that start?  When did we start mingling the Japan  statistics with the American statistics?  He's got 2,700 Major League hits.  He doesn't have 4,000 Major League hits.  It doesn't make sense to me.   When did we decide that?  Who decided the Japanese hits are equal to the  major league hits.  We've got the statistics.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IMUS:  Stop, stop, if I wanted to listen to him, I'd listen.  I know he  does that, repeats himself ad nauseam.  I love Mike, but -- </p><p>RUFINO:  I think it's a great accomplishment.</p><p>IMUS:  But it's unlistenable.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  And sportscreed.com, they write, of course, Francesa's argument  is fatuous, the only surprise there being that he stayed awake long enough  to make it.</p><p>IMUS:  What are you doing, be like if you're trying to rope, Wyatt.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Good morning, Wyatt.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Wait a second, what's going on there.</p><p>IMUS:  Are you roping today?</p><p>WYATT:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  OK, I'm going to fool with you, talk to you when you're backing your  horse in the box on the rope.</p><p>WYATT:  You're not doing anything, you're talking.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Physical.</p><p>WYATT:  And having breakfast while you're talking.</p><p>IMUS:  You're purposely going out of your way to annoy me.</p><p>WYATT:  I'm bringing you breakfast.</p><p>IMUS:  If I could, I'd whip your little ass no, no, leave my yogurt away.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  And have your own kid spitting in your coffee soon.</p><p>RUFINO:  Soon?</p><p>IMUS:  He makes me laugh as much as anybody on the planet.  God, he's  funny.  What are you saying?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  I was saying that I'm done and we're late for Tom Friedman,  cutting into Tom Friedman's time.  It's an outrage.</p><p>IMUS:  So, get the whining comy on, 25 until the hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network,  and now, here is Diane Macedo.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS:  Good morning, everyone.  Some of the most  important economic figures in the world are gathering in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming for the fed annual conference.  A big difference this year is that  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke won't be attending due to a scheduling conflict.   European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will also miss this meeting.   The main focus of the conference, though, will be the impact of the fed's  unconventional policies at home and abroad.</p><p>Now let's get the latest on weather from meteorologist Maria Molina  in our Fox Business Weather Center.  Hi, Maria.</p><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOX BUSINESS WEATHER CENTER:  Hi.  Good morning, Diane.  Good  morning, everyone.  Today we're looking at a beautiful day across sections  of the northeast.  Yesterday, we had storms roll through, leaving behind  lower humidity and also pleasant temperatures, like in New York City, 83  degrees for a high temperature and parts of the Midwest and the plains  heating in the upper 80's and widespread 90's and feeling like August  across the center of the country.</p><p>And out west, a danger of fires, and red flags, that leaves the  hours and eventually into the west.  Much-need rain across parts of Nevada,  Utah and across parts of Southern California, several inches could fall out  here so flooding could be a concern.  Diane, back to you.</p><p>MACEDO:  All right, that's Maria Molina from the weather center.  Let's  take a quick look at futures.  Those have been searching for direction  today.  Dow futures are now up by 2 points.  IMUS IN THE MORNING continues  right now.</p><p>IMUS:  It's 20 minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  Please welcome now from the New York sometimes, Tom Friedman.   Good morning, Mr. Friedman.</p><p>TOM FRIEDMAN, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" (via telephone):  Good morning, Don.</p><p>IMUS:  Wonder how long the \"New York Times\" is going to stay in business?</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Gosh, you know, I really think, you know, we've got a strong  enough global brand, I don't worry about the times per se, but what I  worry, if you look at the numbers, our -- the newspaper ads, you know, have  been, I don't know how long it is, six, nine, 12 quarters, you know, they  continue to decline and you know, you just hope that we'll find a bottom.</p><p>We're still making a profit, thank God, but if that doesn't find a  bottom, you know, at some point, you know, it will affect obviously what we  can do, but you hope it will find a bottom.  I don't know if you realize, I  think last quarter, the quarter before, we made more money selling the  paper than we did from advertising and like that's a huge line to cross.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, and are you working on another book?</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  I'm thinking about something, Don.  You know, sort of pushing  ahead from the last book I did that used to be about just kind of the new  phase of globalization where it's going, technology, how it's all merging,  how it's affecting business, education, et cetera.  It's germinating in my  head, but I'm not quite there yet, but thinking about something on the  Middle East, too.</p><p>IMUS:  You're not kidding.  That sounds hideous.  You've got to come up  with a better idea than that.  Geez, are you kidding me?  Nobody's going to  read that.</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  You want to write a book called \"The World Is Flat\" nobody's  going to read that.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, no.</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  I'm thinking about something.</p><p>IMUS:  That was a great book, though, the olive tree and that stuff, but  this latest one.  Have you just given up?  Said the hell with it?</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  Anyway, let me ask you a couple of serious questions.  Syria, what  the hell is going on there?</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Well, we don't have the conclusive proof, but you look at those  pictures of those bodies, don, how they died, unmarked by any kind of  wounds, you know, it's pretty clear the regime used some kind of chemical  weapon and obviously Obama said that would be a red line.  They already  crossed it once.  What he will do this time once it's conclusively proved,  I don't know.</p><p>There's a big discussion at the White House yesterday, as you  reported, that three hours where they debated what to do.  One of the  problems, the problem is this so let's say we launched a cruise missile  attack in response to this to deter chemical weapons.</p><p>What targets to hit.  Do you cause more refugee outflow from Syria  and destabilize Jordan, for instance?  So there's a lot of real-- so many  moving parts with this, it's going to be a difficult one to sort out, but,  you know, I'm glad they're considering something because once you start  introducing those kind of weapons, you know, it's Katie bar the door.</p><p>IMUS:  What would you recommend that we do?</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  You know, I would be in favor of -- as I sit here right now, I'd  be in favor of some kind of military response at that simply says we're not  going to tolerate that.  The world is not going to tolerate that.</p><p>IMUS:  Would you want troops on the ground?</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  No, no, I'm talking about some kind of aerial response.  It's  sort of something I'd be ready to consider.  I want to see all the facts,  they haven't all come out, some kind of response not just by us, but by the  world, the allies, NATO that draws a red line there.  I think it's  something that it's really worth considering.</p><p>IMUS:  Talking with Tom Friedman from the \"New York Times\" who probably has  an e-mail address at the times in which you can contact him and here is  what I'd like you to do, send him some ideas for a book.  He hasn't got  any.  And every day I say to Connell, well, why should I care about Egypt?   So, let me ask you, why should I?</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  You know, there are a lot of reasons, Don.  It's a country of  85 million people.  It sits astride the Suez Canal.  It's the partner with  Israel in the Camp David peace treaty and has been traditionally the  bedrock of the geopolitics there and the leader of the Arab world, as Egypt  goes, so goes the Arab world.</p><p>You want the country to have a decent outcome of this revolutionary  process.  The problem in Egypt right now, Don, you've had two choices  historically, that is either the army or the Muslim Brotherhood.  In Egypt  if you look at its history oscillated between those two for the last 60-odd  years.</p><p>And the question, really, is can they-- can they find a third way, a  way that's actually forward-looking, inclusive, progressive that doesn't  just involve one of these narrow-minded options or the other?  You know,  one of the things that's been rattling around in my head, Don.  Princess Di  once said with Prince Charles there are three people in this marriage.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Historically we've looked at Egypt and saying there's two people  in the marriage, the Muslim Brotherhood and the army.  If that's the choice  we'll go with the army, with Mubarak, but we talked about this in earlier  conversation, I think there are three people in this story now, there's the  military, the Muslim Brotherhood and Mother Nature.</p><p>And by that, I mean there is all of these incredible water,  environmental population stresses that have built up over the last 60  years, precisely because of the incompetence of the military government and  the Muslim Brotherhood in managing the problems and stresses, if they don't  get the act together, find a third way that can sort of tilt Egypt forward  to deal with some of these problems, Don, half the women in Egypt can't  read.</p><p>After $30 billion in U.S. aid, over the last 30-odd years, half the  women still can't read and these other social stresses I think are just  going to blow the place apart.</p><p>IMUS:  What in your view would be a decent outcome in Egypt?</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  I think a decent outcome would be a government that would --  where the military says to this government that they've appointed and they  actually-- when they ousted the Muslim Brotherhood government they  appointed a new president and he appointed a new cabinet.  And you know  some of these people and they're pretty decent people, if they would assign  that government the task of writing a new constitution, one that would  guarantee minority rights, that would be -- that would guarantee women's  rights, that would be basically progressive leaning and take out some of  the bad stuff the Muslim Brotherhood had in the constitution, and begin to  organize an elective process gradually.</p><p>Giving time for not just the Muslim Brotherhood or Islamists as it  were, but the liberal and progressive parties to get organize and contest  that election, to put Egypt on that gradual transition path, not to just  stop with the military government.</p><p>IMUS:  Why did you decide to employ the Princess Di analogy?</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  I have no idea.  It popped into my head there.  There are three  different parties in this story now.</p><p>IMUS:  You're a weird dude, sometimes, so -- but you do sometimes in your  columns it works well.</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Have you gotten away this summer at all?</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  A little bit.  Just kind of on and off.  I just turned 60, Don.   So I'm going out to California next week.</p><p>IMUS:  When was your birthday?</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  July 20th.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, happy birthday.</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Thank you very much.</p><p>IMUS:  You look pretty good for 60.  I guess 60 is -- 60 is getting up  there.</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  I'm trying to take care of myself.  In this day and age, there  are a few miles on these treads so I'm trying to take care of myself, and  looking forward to getting away.</p><p>IMUS:  In spite of what you think, the times is not long for this world so  get a good idea for a book.  Tom Friedman.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo.  It's time to check the  markets now, the day after the Nasdaq flash free that halted trading for  three hours.  The U.S. futures are fairly flat this morning, but now point  to go a higher open.  Dow futures are up 3.  The S&amp;P is up about 1.  The  Nasdaq is up 3.5.</p><p>Over in Europe, we got the second quarter reading on second quarter  GDP in the U.K. and Germany, both rose 7/10 of a percent.  London is now up  about 37.  Paris is down barely and Frankfurt is up 16.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" says that federal prosecutors are turning  up the pressure in an insider trading case against a former portfolio  manager at SAC Capital.  The new indictment unsealed yesterday alleges that  Matthew Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an Alzheimer's drug  trial at the heart of the case.</p><p>Martoma is accused of using insider information about results of  that drug trial, which then allowed SAC Capital to make $275 million in  profits.   He's due to go on trial in November.  A hearing is set for this  morning, SAC Capital has been charged with encouraging insider trader, but  Steven Cohen, the hedge fund's founder has not been charged.  Cohen and his  firm deny any wrongdoing.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities now.  We're watching oil and gold for  you this morning.  Those have been also fairly flat.  Oil is now down up  13 cents.  Gold is up 20.  IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.</p><p>IMUS:  He looks like he is he doesn't have any energy, doesn't he?  Here on  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, coming up on the radio, a fascinating,  funny conversation with the great Terry Bradshaw.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.</p><p>IMUS:  And before that, it's 9:20 Eastern Time on the Fox Business Network.   The lying limey, Stuart Varney, so -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  We love Varney.</p><p>IMUS:  I do like Varney a lot.  So I don't know.</p><p>MCSHANE:  What's wrong?</p><p>IMUS:  Well, and the Godfather is going to be on to talk about -- I forget  what he's going to talk about.  What, Godfather.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Good question.</p><p>IMUS:  Down, Godfather.</p><p>BARTLETT:  The gentleman -- </p><p>IMUS:  Can barely hear the Godfather, so the Godfather decided well, mail  it in this morning.  Did he have his mic off, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE:  I think his headphones were down and he couldn't hear.</p><p>BARTLETT:  Turn it up.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Now he's better.  And solving yet another problem and working  through a lot this morning.</p><p>IMUS:  Got to project, Rob.</p><p>BARTLETT:  Yes, sir.</p><p>MCSHANE:  He couldn't hear.</p><p>IMUS:  Also, you did a -- a lousy job on the last script.  Why was that?</p><p>BARTLETT:  I'm a little under the weather today.  It affected my  performance, I apologize.</p><p>IMUS:  What's the matter with you?</p><p>BARTLETT:  Got a little bit of a -- a touch of a bug, I think.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, why didn't you tell me that instead of turning in a  performance that sucks?  Because we don't have to do it, you know?</p><p>BARTLETT:  Just, I'm going to suck it up, I didn't -- </p><p>IMUS:  No, you didn't suck it up because you gave in like a finocchio.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Finocchio.</p><p>IMUS:  To your little sniffles.</p><p>BARTLETT:  I have 135 fever.</p><p>IMUS:  OK.</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's right.</p><p>IMUS:  You gave in to your 135 degree fever and provided all of us with a  weenie performance.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Struggling, Rob, the last couple.</p><p>IMUS:  It would be better if you said to me, Don, I don't feel great and I  would say, fine.  So every time you want off, I mean, you ever -- a problem  getting off when you need it?  Of course not, neither one of you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. We are taking a look at the markets this morning after yesterday's flash freeze at the NASDAQ, it's been a fairly flat morning today. We currently got future is in the red, Dow futures are down about 15, we've got the S&amp;P down about one point, the NASDAQ is down about a quarter of a point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Looking over at oil and gold, those are in the green this morning, we've got oil up about $0.16 cents, gold is up almost $4. Looking at Asia, those markets finished today mixed and for all the details on how they got there, let's go to business reporter Jacqueline Maddock in Beijing. Hi, Jacqueline.</p><p>JACQUELINE MADDOCK, BUSINESS REPORTER: Hi, Diane. Yes. It was a bit of a mixed results here for Friday afternoon, here in the mainland and also in Hong Kong. Markets lost ground throughout the afternoon largely because of some pretty disappointing corporate results particularly from Everbright Security if you remember that, the brokerage firm responsible for last Friday's fat-finger fiasco and it was the banks did the biggest falls today, that whispers that the PBO is preparing to unleash the new regulations on China's banking sector, China merchant banks down more than three percent.</p><p>But as you say, a different story in Japan, the Nikkei climbed Diane, more than two percent, and every markets that day indeed in the green which is a -- and that was as the yen moved up to the 99 point level accept the Tepco, Diane. Obviously Tepco, the Fukushima nuclear plant operator -- Tepco, fell another five percent at it looks that though as contamination leak has -- some way to play out (INAUDIBLE). Across to Australia though there where markets climbed almost four percent still running high on China's PMI numbers from yesterday, results of stocks love to see signs that China's economy is getting back on track -- Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: All right. Jacqueline Maddock from Beijing. Thanks, Jacqueline.</p><p>And now, for a look at the European markets, let's go live to London where Jan Lambregts, global head of financial markets research at Rabobank is now joining us. Jan, we saw some positive second quarter GDP reports from the UK and Germany confirmed by the follow-up reading. Any surprise there, and why aren't markets having more reaction to that?</p><p>It looks like we just lost Jan. We will try to get him back in a second but let's take a look at the European markets. You can see London up about 16, Parris is down about 12, Frankfurt up about three. Again, those positive GDP report possibly being mitigated by a little un-eased there over the NASDAQ freeze. But let's take a look at some of the important economic news we'll be looking forward to and one of them is a big meeting coming up, some of the most important economic figures in the world are gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the Kansas City Fed's annual conference but one difference is here, is that the biggest figure of the mall, Fed Chairman Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>won't be attending due to a scheduling conflict.</p><p>The main focus of the conference will be the impact of the Fed's unconventional policies both at home and abroad and FOX Business's Peter Barnes is there. He will have reports for us throughout the morning.</p><p>And we've got Jan Lambregts back again, global head of financial markets research at Rabobank. Jan, I'm not sure if you heard my question the first-time, but we're looking at these GDP reports from the UK and Germany both coming in positive. Any big surprise here?</p><p>JAN LAMBREGTS, RABOBANK FINANCIAL MARKETS RESEARCH: Not really. And I don't think the markets really watching it too closely, second revisions, it adds to the general trend that things are a little bit better in Europe but still not great. I think a lot of people in the market can be watching more of these headlines coming out of Jackson Hole and thinking what that would mean for, for tapering than watching these GDP figures.</p><p>MACEDO: Markets still seem a little tentative today. You know, good GDP information and yet, they're fairly flat. Paris is even down. Are people tentative this morning over what happened at the NASDAQ yesterday?</p><p>LAMBREGTS: I don't think that is not necessarily overshadowing. Like I said, I think the more tentative reacting to positive GDP which is a fairly old number, second quarters after all, more worried that had lines later today as more news comes from Jackson Hole, actually shift perceptions in how likely tapering is and how much tapering is we will see in September.</p><p>MACEDO: All right. It's all about stimulus, Jan Lambregts at Rabobank. We appreciate it. Thanks.</p><p>LAMBREGTS: You're welcome.</p><p>MACEDO: And the Wall Street Journal says, federal prosecutors are turning up the pressure in an insider-trading case against the former portfolio manager at SAC Capital. A new indictment unsealed yesterday alleges that Matthew Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an Alzheimer's drug trial at the heart of the case. Martoma is accused of using insider information about results of that drug trial to allow SAC Capital to make $275 million in profits. He is due to go on trial in November and a hearing is set for this morning.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: So, Doug Chrispin (ph), he's a -- but he's a local rancher and he's doing all kinds of stuff, he won the New Mexico, may it's a national bow and arrow contest that I told you about Mike, from Texas, bans all these -- here. So he says to me, you know, it took awhile for Delbert McClinton to catch on in Austin. All right.</p><p>I said, who's -- they found that of course. So he says who is better? Name one person who is better in Austin than Delbert McClinton? He said, there are lots of people. I said what? I didn't have my gun with me, fortunately.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Thank God. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: He said Omar and the Howlers.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: Oh, those guys.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: Oh, yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: Omar and the Howlers?</p><p>IMUS: I said, Omar and the Howlers?</p><p>WOLF: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: So, we were at the horse barn, up at the horse barn. So, I got in the truck and went back to the house and go to iTunes.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And listened to Omar and the Howlers.</p><p>MCSHANE: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: And they suck.</p><p>MCSHANE: Hey, Omar.</p><p>IMUS: I thought he was kidding.</p><p>MCSHANE: He said, Omar --</p><p>IMUS: And then he is a big Joe Walsh fan. You know? I said, well, have you seen that Eagles? Didn't have any interest. Do you like the Eagles? He said they are all right. So when I first heard the Eagles, sounded like a cross between the Beach Boys and the four perhaps.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh-oh!</p><p>IMUS: Well.</p><p>MCGUIRK: You got to carry that gun at all times.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, be ready.</p><p>IMUS: The only place I don't carry it is on the ranch for some reason.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: Omar and the Howlers?</p><p>IMUS: Omar and the Howlers?</p><p>RUFINO: I'm probably the only person who knew that band that you just mentioned.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>RUFINO: Yes. I played that band in college.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you did.</p><p>RUFINO: -- Back in school and they still together barely alive.</p><p>IMUS: Well, they may not, he is going back years, so.</p><p>RUFINO: Omar and the Howlers.</p><p>GUNZELMAN: This guy is crazy.</p><p>IMUS: That is insane, didn't he?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Lunacy.</p><p>IMUS: Paul Begala is coming up this morning. We no longer need him, so.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's not right.</p><p>IMUS: One of my new best friends, one of them, is Bill Powers, the president of U.T., the University of Texas. So, I better not blow of Begala just yet. You know? And Tom Friedman. Hey, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Who won those little league world series games?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Tijuana beat Panama. So, Tijuana, they will now play Tokyo for the international championship and the Westport Washington State game was rained out. So, they will play today at 3:00.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And the winner will play Chula Vista for the title on Sunday.</p><p>IMUS: And the winner of that will play either Tijuana or Tokyo.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Probably.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Which is it? Tijuana or --</p><p>WOLF: Well, Tijuana beat Panama. So, Tijuana will play Tokyo.</p><p>IMUS: That is what I just said.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>WOLF: That's right.</p><p>MCSHANE: We got it, yes.</p><p>WOLF: Yes. We had some other stories too.</p><p>IMUS: What are they?</p><p>WOLF: Well, the umpire, they blew a call in the Yankee game which is going to fit right in with next year's videotape replay. They messed up a caught ball and called it a trap and we have got Ryan Braun, what a phony, man. Instead of --</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: You're kidding, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: He comes out --</p><p>IMUS: Hey, Tom, should we have a breaking news thing up on the <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>Channel, the business channel?</p><p>WOLF: That's right. This just in. But the way he did it, he apologize that he made a mistake, but it was issued in a statement. I mean, he didn't even have the, you know, guts to stand up and faced the press. Really weak. And the other thing, you had two exhibition football games last night. And finally we are going to hear about Jeremy Lin, cut out the whining. Remember him? Jeremy Lin.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, of course.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Today is his birthday.</p><p>WOLF: Oh, it is?</p><p>IMUS: Yes. He's 25 today.</p><p>WOLF: Well, maybe give him some slack.</p><p>IMUS: Jay Mohr, of the funnier people on the planet is 43 today. OK.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Happy Birthday.</p><p>IMUS: And Dagen McDowell is not here again.</p><p>MCSHANE: She's out again, yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: So, I said, well, she said she can't put anything on her face. How about a paper bag?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, she did. You went there. It wasn't funny.</p><p>IMUS: And there is something here we don't know. I don't know what it is. But man, there is something here. Hey, what happened to the NASDAQ yesterday?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. It was a mess with the computers, they don't know 100 percent what happened but they had to halt the number, all the stocks that trade on it and the middle of the day, it went down for hours which is odd, Wall Street has had a number of computer problems the last few years but there is a report this morning, there may have been some connectivity issues with another exchange so they continue their investigation. No panic.</p><p>IMUS: NASDAQ stocks.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, no panic on the market though. You know?</p><p>IMUS: You want to get listed on the NASDAQ, you can't get on the big one. Right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No. That's Apple and all these big tech companies if you're over on the NASDAQ, Google, Microsoft.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, they are?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, so.</p><p>IMUS: I have been to see Cavuto yesterday, he looks great. You know, that?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Sometimes he needs to take good care of himself as he should. But man, he looks terrific. He is really good. You know who else is pretty good is that Charles Payne guy.</p><p>MCSHANE: Charles Payne, yes, absolutely, good guy. Yep.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No pain, no gain.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: What is coming up with you, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Sydney Leathers.</p><p>IMUS: Oh God.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. Well, this is true. She made a porn tape.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, please.</p><p>MCGUIRK: .called Weiner and me but that is not where this stops. She very well may have exposed herself to HIV.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, wow!</p><p>IMUS: Not amusing. That is your hilarious Bernie briefing this morning?</p><p>MCGUIRK: I was not presenting that as a joke.</p><p>MCSHANE: No punch-line there.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's a story. You remember that kid that gave the rousing speech at Georgia tech?</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, he may have ripped it off from somebody. And he was interviewed by your friend Neil Cavuto yesterday. We have little piece of that.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Cavuto is -- all over him, just the -- it was great. But he may not be for real.</p><p>IMUS: Rob Bartlett and Tony Powell are both here this morning. They're both appearing places. Rob is going to be at the Leavitt Theater in Ogunquit, Maine.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Ogunquit.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. September 21st. For tickets, go to Robshow.com. And Tony Powell, Powell to the People, he will be appearing at the Belmar Theater on Saturday, September 28th. That is coming up here pretty soon and you can get tickets to that by either calling that theater there. The Belmar Theater, or go to NewYorkentertainmentclub.com. I guess, he gets stuff there. It is 13 after the hour, let's do some news. And here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Hey, good morning, I-man. The number of refugees created by the Syrian civil war has not topped one million, a million refugees and a U.N. agency adding to that says 740,000 of them are children under age 11. So, some numbers, it all comes out as we are seeing new pictures of what the rebels claim are another chemical weapons attack.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And this is the fourteenth time that the central regime uses chemical weapons against innocent civilians and each time we've asked and we've said that the international community does not move this, the regime will enlarge the scale that use these chemical weapons.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: And the U.N. secretary-general did say today, these claims of chemical weapons must be investigated immediately. We also have reports this morning coming in of Israeli airstrikes just south of Beirut said to be a response to four rockets that were fired yesterday into Israel. Back here at home, you mention the problems on Wall Street yesterday, computer problems at the NASDAQ, trading stocks listed there. The Apples and the Google of the world, a lot of big tech names were halted in the middle of the day because of problems with the system that disseminates quotes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Is it going to affect the way that they look at individual companies and want to invest in companies for 10, 15 or 20 years? No. It will just going to say that this game is not really being played.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Jonathan Kurpido (ph) works at the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Now, to get more on that, this web site All Things D is reporting this morning. NASDAQ thinks the issue may be a problem with connectivity at a rival exchange.</p><p>IMUS: What does that mean?</p><p>MCSHANE: This another digital exchange, NYSCR by the way, the New York Stock Exchange digital component that there may have been problems with the two exchanges connecting with one another. Apparently, according to this report, and they are basically saying --</p><p>IMUS: Each other by the way. But go ahead.</p><p>MCSHANE: You are right. May say, more on this later on but I don't know exactly what the --</p><p>IMUS: How do we know it wasn't deliberate?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Sabotage.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, there all these rumors going around yesterday, and it's where the NASDAQ was not really that transparent about it, didn't talk about it during the day, it's hard to get all of them, there are no comments and then the rumors, what if there was a cyber attack and all this kind of thing. That is what people were worried about.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, the Russians.</p><p>MCSHANE: But no evidence of that at all and now they're saying that could have been the exchanges, digital exchanges having trouble connecting with each other but --</p><p>IMUS: Everybody is lying.</p><p>MCSHANE: Probably.</p><p>IMUS: Don't you think?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, the thing, you know, I thought there was sort of reassuring about it is, that the markets, not like the market -- or crashed yesterday on this when people, you know, wasn't that many jitters.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: The Dow was actually up. The NASDAQ ended up. So, you know, got through it. And they've been computer problems in the past. The last big one I guess was like three years ago. Although, the NASDAQ had big time issue about Facebook IPO. You may remember.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. That was a mess. But this, we will see. The investigation continues and we will get more on it later today, exactly what happened, so.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes, great.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, from Washington --</p><p>IMUS: Sixteen after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Connell continues.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, you'll going to start hearing talk about a possible government shutdown again. I know you will be looking forward to that. More than a third of House Republicans urging the Speaker John Boehner to shut down the government rather than fund the president's health-care law. They sent him a letter on that 80 Republicans yesterday.</p><p>And then we have this U.S. soldier who killed 16 civilians in Afghanistan last year, he apologized yesterday for the first time for what he called his act of cowardice. The Staff Sergeant Robert Bales is in the middle of a sentencing hearing. Here is Marc Edwards, he's a friend of his who used to play in the NFL, this guy Marc Edwards, he spoke with reporters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARC EDWARDS, FORMER NFL PLAYER: The person I knew a long time ago has changed quite a bit, the experience that he's had over there. I am not in a position to understand. None of us are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: None of us are, he says. Well, the sentencing hearing will continue there. And there's no --</p><p>IMUS: Why are you repeating what the people are saying?</p><p>MCSHANE: I just thought it was a little fuzzy.</p><p>IMUS: Sounds like Conan O'Brien.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program sponsored by Hackensack University Medical Center, a place where medicine meets innovation. What were you saying now?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, no verdict for the Fort Hood shooter. That continues deliberations yesterday. And the final thing in the news is Bradley Manning who we talked about a lot in the show yesterday. He says, he felt that he has been a female since childhood and he wants people to refer to him as Chelsea. So, this is the convicted Wiki leaker so to speak. Back in forth, Leavenworth begin serving 35 years in a military prison.</p><p>Now, a military spokesman said, if Bradley wants to change his name to Chelsea, a name change would have to be approved in court, then a petition submitted to the army to make it official. So, that's where we are on all that.</p><p>IMUS: The Godfather will have some thoughts on Bradley Manning and his wishes coming up here in just a little bit. This moment is also sponsored by the Hackensack University Medical Center, a place where medicine meets innovation, the home of the Deirdre Imus environmental health center. So, well, any business news? Business news incidentally Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Is presented by this clown over here at the -- well, he is not a clown, that is unfortunate, Don.</p><p>MCSHANE: Clown?</p><p>IMUS: Dr. Gill Leatherman.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh!</p><p>IMUS: Hit the cancer.</p><p>MCSHANE: Hit the cancer, baby.</p><p>IMUS: Hit the cancer. Shut-up.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, it's OK.</p><p>IMUS: This radio search deal, he has got going.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: You can call Dr. Gill Leatherman at 212-scam -- no, not scam.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, no, that's not the word.</p><p>IMUS: That's unfortunate.</p><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p>IMUS: 212-choices. What is going on in business news other than the tedious NASDAQ deal?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, that's the big I guess story up. I'll give you an update on the markets on where we are. The Dow futures are down a little bit this morning. But the Dow was up yesterday, actually the first time it was up in seven sessions. Got lost a little bit in that NASDAQ story.</p><p>IMUS: I'll be darn.</p><p>MCSHANE: .of 66 to 14,963. So, not much of an effect in terms of the markets going up and down from that NASDAQ mess, the traders able to shake it off. Commerce Department today releasing some numbers on new home sales on housing numbers, Dow futures are down this morning by 18 points ahead to all that.</p><p>IMUS: Is that it?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, I mean, yes, there's --</p><p>IMUS: OK. Can't just stop talking. I thought you had a stroke.</p><p>MCSHANE: I thought --</p><p>IMUS: Well, no. But just stop talking. What's the matter with you?</p><p>RUFINO: He stopped.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I know he stopped but I mean, back to you, I-man, anything.</p><p>MCSHANE: That will be the way --</p><p>IMUS: No, no, no.</p><p>RUFINO: Connell do it every time.</p><p>(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p>I am Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: Almost 20 minutes past.</p><p>IMUS: Omar and the Howlers.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Back to you, I-man.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Doug Crispin's big band is the Beatles I guess to him. I guess they are out of AustinTexas, they're coming up here, he told me they were better than Delbert McClinton. I mean, you -- that is insanity, isn't it? Never heard anything like that.</p><p>MCSHANE: Never.</p><p>RUFINO: I can't believe my ears.</p><p>IMUS: There is nobody better than Delbert McClinton. Anyway, Warner with sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Go to Peerlessboilers.com and get one of them. Anyway, it's 20 minutes after the hour, here is Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: Yankees beat the Jays five-three, they sweep the series make it ten of 12, they cut the race for the last wild card team, the three-and- a-half, blown call by the umpire in the bottom of the fifth gave the Yankees the lead for good. Bases loaded, one-out, Michael Kay, Yes Network.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL KAY, YES NETWORK: (INAUDIBLE) To the second and it is a double play. He's tagging everybody but it is a double play to end the inning. Did he kick the catch? Now, they're saying that he didn't make the catch.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Well, if you watch your FOX Business, you can see that he did indeed make the catch. So instead of a double play to end the inning, Wells is given an RBI and the Yankees take the lead. Well, that is one of the things they will correct next year with video tape replay. Dodgers beat the Marlins six-nothing. Clayton Kershaw on the shut out, he's earned run average is now 1.72. And Brian Wilson pitched for the first time in a year and a half in the ninth inning, he struck out two batters and Wilson has been offered $1 million to shave his beard by 800razors.com.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He looks scary like that, man.</p><p>WOLF: Pirates and Cardinals win, Pirates by one. Ryan Braun --</p><p>IMUS: Maybe could have fought ahead with this and had a photograph of him that we could have put up. I guess not.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He makes the duck dynasty guys look like Park Avenue socialites.</p><p>MCSHANE: He really does.</p><p>WOLF: What we did have him after the game, Brian Wilson with this brief comment.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, no.</p><p>WOLF: Ryan Braun has issued a statement through the Brewers. They talked about a guy, he say, he said he was sorry he took the PEDs during the --</p><p>IMUS: You and Doug are going down.</p><p>WOLF: Two-11 MVP year. You know, what? Braun ought to give back the MVP trophy and give it to Matt Kemp.</p><p>IMUS: That is enough sports. I am bored now.</p><p>WOLF: OK. How come, I don't know about a Thursday night football game?</p><p>WOLF: Thursday football. I've got it. Lions beat the Patriots 40 to nine.</p><p>IMUS: How come there wasn't any.</p><p>WOLF: There were two.</p><p>IMUS: They were?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Why you didn't tell me about this?</p><p>WOLF: Well, because you said that was the end of this --</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, but the Lions beat the Patriots -- what?</p><p>WOLF: Forty to nine. Patriots turned the ball over three of the first four possessions.</p><p>IMUS: Tebow play?</p><p>WOLF: Tebow did not play.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, God!</p><p>WOLF: Not a good sign.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He got to bail out Hernandez.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty three after the hour. What is coming up in the briefing, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, Sydney Leathers may have HIV and we have that kid who may be a fraud and Ben Affleck, as Batman.</p><p>IMUS: OK. That is all. This would be Omar and the Howlers. Doug Crispin, told me with a straight face why you thought this loser was better than Delbert McClinton. I mean, how do you even say that with the --</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: Are you kidding me? Some fat hillbilly screaming his guts out? Well, that is ridiculous. If you have not ordered your MyPillow yet, you probably are missing out. You have missed out. I'm also irritated this morning because I slept completely straight through the night. When I woke up, I had to get up. I hate that.

And Moody's investor service says, it may cut the credit ratings of major U.S. banks due to the possibility of reduced government support for the institutions if they ran into financial trouble. The list of banks includes JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. Moody's also says, it may downgrade Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley bonds and it says Bank of America and Citigroup bonds may also be downgraded for the same reasons but they could also be upgraded because the bank's operations are improving.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: So, you did not know I called Bigfoot just foot?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS, WIFE OF DON IMUS: I could not stop laughing, I was crying.

You can't say the whole word anyway.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: 30 minutes after the hour. I realize on your TV around the country you do not get to hear these guys, but you could pretty much have a creep off. They just sound creepy to me.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Any distinguished gentleman who comes off to the I-man, I guess is a little eccentric.</p><p>IMUS: He eats puppies. [laughter]</p><p>IMUS: Let's hope that he doesn't. I do not have to suck up anymore.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The hell with him.</p><p>IMUS: We will get him on when we feel like it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Sydney Leathers, she recently , she was in an adult video. It was called Winter and Me. She had sex with this guy. This guy tested positive for HIV. Sydney Leathers and the dude tested negative before and after. HIV negative test results within three months of exposure could be false. It will take a couple of months for Ms. Leathers to find out whether or not she is infected.</p><p>IMUS: We already know that she is infected.</p><p>MCSHANE: She needs to be fumigated, without a doubt.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The kid at Georgia tech welcoming incoming freshman. Take a listen.</p><p>I am telling you, if you want to change the world, you are at Georgia tech. You can do that. If you want to fill the Ironman suit, you are at Georgia tech, you can do that.

If you were still advising presidents, what would you advise them to do?</p><p>BEGALA: I would advise caution. Measure twice and cut once. This country suffered previously by rushing into a war where we had no business fighting. We had no threat against our country. What are the threats to America's interest? also to our credibility. Superpowers never bluff. It is a very difficult situation. The chances of it getting worse because of our intervention is very great. Made me the chairman of the caucus. I have been to walter reed. I would be real careful.</p><p>IMUS: Video of these kids dying. That is pretty tough to take. I agree with you.</p><p>We may have to act. We can take out the Air Force.

Here in the U.S., the futures are down.</p><p>We will also get a new reading on the housing market this morning. New home sales are expected to fall 1.5 percent from june.

He is just joining an old standing tradition of rock and roll riff off jobs. Jesus, he is so fine. Vanilla Ice stole, but only because he knew he could take that dude in a fist fight. He is suing Marvin Gaye's family to prevent them from suing him. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and I wholeheartedly agree. Sometimes, it is a crime when people just cannot do their own thing. You hear me, Lady Gaga? You Madonna wannabes.

And now here is Diane Macedo.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning everyone. Yesterday's flash freeze at the NASDAQ has been traced to a connectivity issue. According to All Things Digital sources say officials at NASDAQ OMX Group which owns the exchange are pointing to a connectivity problem with NYSE Arca as the trigger for that three-hour trading halt. A NYSE spokesman declined to comment but NASDAQ officials did acknowledge that connectivity issue they just wouldn't say who the exchange participant was.</p><p>Now the trouble started at about 12:15 p.m. Eastern when NASDAQ said it was halting trading in NASDAQ listed stocks. Sources say it took the exchange another half hour to determine it had fixed the problem. But the reopening process which required regulatory approval and testing took more than two hours. All Things D says NASDAQ executives expect the normal start to trading this morning.</p><p>Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., futures have been fairly flat, but to the downside this morning Dow futures are down 16, the S&amp;P is down one point, the NASDAQ is down just a fraction of a point.</p><p>And for a recap on the Asian markets now, let's go to business reporter Jacqueline Maddock in Beijing. Hi, Jacqueline.</p><p>JACQUELINE MADDOCK, BUSINESS REPORTER: Well Diane it was certainly a mixed bag for the end of the week. Mainland markets and also Hong Kong (inaudible) around steadily throughout the afternoon as disappointing corporate earnings results rolled out particularly, from Ever Bright Securities. That of course is the brokerage firm that made all the headlines responsible in fact for last Friday's fat finger fiasco.</p><p>But we also saw banking stocks do some pretty serious polls. And that was because there are plenty of whisper and lots of speculation here that the People's Bank of China is preparing to unleash some new regulations on Chinese lenders.</p><p>A different story though across in Japan the Nikkei managed to put on more than two percent that's because the yen strengthened. And in fact all markets sectors Diane are the very end in the green.</p><p>And finally to Australia. Australia is still riding high on that Thursday's PMI data out in China. (inaudible) stocks could very well there. And the Australian market putting on almost one percent on the hope that China is getting back on track -- Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: All right that's business reporter Jacqueline Maddock in Beijing.</p><p>And now we're getting earnings in from Foot Locker. The company is reporting an adjusted profit of 46 cents a share. Almost -- almost matching the estimate there analyst were expecting 47 cents. Revenue came in at $1.45 billion. That was right in line with expectations.</p><p>For more on the European markets now, let's go to London where Jan Randolph director of Sovereign Risk at IHS Global Insight is standing by. Jan, the U.K. came out on -- out of recession and now the second reading of GDP has been revised even higher. How optimistic should investors be about this?</p><p>JAN RANDOLPH, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT: Well I think so particularly if you put it into context with Germany, which also showed good -- good revised figures. The recovery in the U.K. is more broad-based now. It includes construction as well the old traditional consumptions. And that's good news and exports were up, particularly to Europe and Germany. So combined, it looks like a better picture all around both the U.K. and from northern Europe.</p><p>MACEDO: And Jan our last guest said the traders are being kind of cautious ahead of the Jackson Hole Conference. What is it that they want to hear?</p><p>RANDOLPH: Well actually, the important people are not there. And that's Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>and Mario Draghi. I mean they are the ones that are ultimately going to stir policy going forward. But yes, I mean there have been some interesting comments. Nowotny, for example, the Austrian member of the ECB said, \"The improving news from Europe means that there will no longer be a cuff and interest rates in Europe\". There seems to be no argument for that.</p><p>So I think Jackson Hole, yes it is -- it's a bit more of a sideshow I think this year compared to previous years.</p><p>MACEDO: All right Jan Randolph at IHS Global Insight thanks Jan.</p><p>And the \"Wall Street Journal\" says federal prosecutors are turning up the pressure in an insider trading case against a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital. A new indictment unsealed yesterday alleges that Mathew Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an Alzheimer's drug trial at the heart of the case. Martoma is accused of using inside information about the results of that drug trial to allow SAC Capital to make $275 million in profit. He is due to go on trial in November and a hearing is set for this morning.</p><p>SAC Capital has been charged with encouraging insider trading but Steven Cohen the hedge fund's founder has not been charged. Cohen and his firm have denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>Here is a look at commodities now. We have been watching oil and gold for you this morning. We've got green arrows there. Oil is up eight cents it's trading around $105 a barrel. Gold is up a little more than $3 at $1,374 an ounce.</p><p>Now here is the I-Man on Fox Business giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: You know once in a while, I have my iPod Touch with me. I will check my e-mails I mean sometimes during the show not always but -- so I was going to talk about something else but I'm going to talk about this briefly.</p><p>You know we've been talking about Roxanne Roundtree. And \"Roxy's Recipe\" her book you can go to Imus.com and right there on the homepage, you can click on the video and watch the video of Roxanne Roundtree that Patrick Gottsch at RFD did and it's -- it change their live. So if you still need cook books and well you still to be buying the cookbooks. Although Esther Newberg or she got a couple of the New York publishers she's going to fighting over it, it's time to get to published it.</p><p>But I've got -- I got -- this woman is confined she has the Lou Gehrig's disease and is confined to a wheelchair and communicates by blinking her eyes. She has a three great sons and her husband's a saint, Don. And I just got an e-mail from him, a long e-mail -- too long to read. But as -- I don't know how to describe it, actually. It is wonderfully well-written. Let's start there.</p><p>But he fell in love with Roxanne who is 34 or 35 now. She -- she came down with Lou Gehrig's Disease of five, six or four, five years ago. But Don fell in love with her in the first grade. And then talked about, in this e-mail, about how long it took to persuade her to marry him. And of course, she couldn't have married a better person on the planet than this guy. Man I mean so -- so that's what I was doing well storming Norman who is yakking about whatever they were doing. Anyway --</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I got to help these people. Come on man.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's such a good story.</p><p>IMUS: And really is just --</p><p>MCSHANE: It's unbelievable.</p><p>IMUS: It really is. All right seven minutes after the hour. Hey Warner, who's -- who's the best football team in the pros?</p><p>WOLF: I would you know barring any more injury I would go with the Broncos.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>WOLF: Yes. The addition of Wes Welker makes them strong. They have a good running game.</p><p>IMUS: He hurt himself the other day didn't he?</p><p>WOLF: Yes he did.</p><p>IMUS: Is he all right now? Or --</p><p>WOLF: Hopefully he'll open the season. But they already had a good passing game.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>WOLF: And they lost at -- on that fluke play. Do you remember the Baltimore in the playoff?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: So I would think on paper --</p><p>IMUS: They threw that interception.</p><p>WOLF: Well that's true in the second overtime yes.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: You know when you -- when you pick one out of 32 teams before the season.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: It's really part luck because of the injury factor like no other sports so.</p><p>IMUS: How about the Giants going to be -- we heard this --</p><p>WOLF: Well you know they finished nine and seven but they lost their last two games of the year by a combined score 67-1. And they lost Amad Bradshaw (ph) they are leading Rusher (ph) and now they have two offensive linemen two out of the five offensive lineman don't look like they'll start the season. So I -- I would say, at best, nine and seven again maybe worst. They don't -- I don't see a running game. They said oh Wilson and --</p><p>IMUS: Ok fine. Jet's a joke.</p><p>WOLF: On Jets eight-eight at best.</p><p>IMUS: Yes at best yes. And its fat coach he'll be gone, but he's not fat anymore.</p><p>WOLF: No he's not but that might not help him.</p><p>IMUS: He'll be sucking toes someplace else so.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: Anybody else any good? Are the -- well the Patriots got to be pretty good right?</p><p>WOLF: Sure always good. Again except the year that Brady got hurt at the start of the season.</p><p>IMUS: How is Alec Smith is he any good?</p><p>WOLF: He is but not with this cast, not with Kansas City.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>WOLF: No and it's too bad because you know he was playing great for the 49ers.</p><p>IMUS: I know.</p><p>WOLF: When Kaepernick --</p><p>IMUS: Kaepernick came in yes. How about -- what else -- how about Seattle?</p><p>WOLF: Well, yes, Russell Wilson I mean he turned them around. They are very good sure.</p><p>IMUS: Speaking of Kaepernick how about the 49ers?</p><p>WOLF: 49ers are strong yes.</p><p>IMUS: Any other strong teams?</p><p>WOLF: I think you have named the best strong teams.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>WOLF: But again, you know that's what's great about the National Football League.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: You only have 16 games it's not like baseball you know.</p><p>IMUS: What happened in this Little League World Series situation?</p><p>WOLF: Well you had Taiwan eliminating Panama.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: So Taiwan -- Tijuana, excuse me, not Taiwan. Tijuana will now play Tokyo for the international title.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: And the West Port Washington State game was rained out so they'll play today.</p><p>IMUS: We got to bet full for West Port and Tijuana.</p><p>WOLF: Ok it's all right yes.</p><p>IMUS: Ok.</p><p>WOLF: Tijuana, what 23 miles from San Diego and as you pointed out even closer to -- Tiu Lavista (ph).</p><p>IMUS: I used to go to Tijuana when I was in the Marine Corps stationed at Camp Pendleton.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS IN THE MORNING: For what?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes exactly for what?</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, IMUS IN THE MORNING: The art.</p><p>IMUS: I think is -- well I forget this was 1957 so --</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS IN THE MORNING: We'll be love you time Mr. -- Private Imus.</p><p>IMUS: Eleven minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Well a lot of good stuff coming up. That dingbat, Liz Claman --</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, Oh no, no. Oh no, no. You knew what we are, you knew, what is what ding bat; we are in for it here. Let's just restart that sentence please.</p><p>RUFINO: I hate it.</p><p>IMUS: Oh man she's a wacko. But she's going to interview the guy who runs the NASDAQ.</p><p>MCSHANE: Bob Greifeld.</p><p>IMUS: And that's coming and I wasn't -- we weren't going to carry it on the radio because I don't care about it.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: But they want to carry it on the television. And that's your job and that's my job to make sure they do. That it gets done which I'm delighted to do.</p><p>MCSHANE: Of course.</p><p>IMUS: But now I've decided we're going to carry it on the radio as well.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh ok.</p><p>IMUS: And we will carry it for as long as we can stand it.</p><p>MCSHANE: Got it.</p><p>IMUS: And it's just drones on, then we'll bail. So -- I mean that's coming up the next hour. The Godfather is here, of course.</p><p>BARTLETT: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And he'll be discussing some stuff this hour and particularly the Bradley Manning situation. And then Powell to the People Tony is out in the street. Big Foot do we have any of that?</p><p>TOM BOWMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING: We're going to have some momentarily. But he was out because of the One Direction concert on the \"Today\" show. They're expecting like 15,000 people, mostly kids. Some of them have been waiting since Tuesday to get a front row.</p><p>IMUS: I like that. I like somebody who would stand (inaudible). I wonder if Doug Christie thinks One Direction is better than Delbert.</p><p>Anyway. Thirteen minutes past the hour. Let's do some news. And here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Hey good morning I-Man.</p><p>These wildfires are really a big issue out west. And the one that's burning outside of Yosemite National Park nearly has quadruples now inside, in size. So officials are going door to door -- they're urging people to get out. But the evacuations are not mandatory. So you have some people like this that are hanging in there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you sticking here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh yes. Absolutely. I will stay in place, protect what I can as long as I can.</p><p>MCSHANE: As long, yes, they stayed there. A lot of times this happens. This fire is only about one percent contained though they're saying at this point.</p><p>We have new comments coming in this morning from President Obama on Syria. CNN had him on just about an hour ago saying allegations of chemical weapons used in Syria is according to the President's quote, a big even. And then they asked him about his redline comments that he'd made about the use of those types of weapons. And the president said the latest event in Syria is something the U.S. has to look at. So that's how he phrased it.</p><p>Well, we'll see where we go from there but speaking of Syria two UN agencies say the rising number of children who are turning into refugees over there resulted in greater threats.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have recorded a million refugees, children that are found and now in camp settings with host communities and in very challenging environments.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Nearly three quarters of all of these refugees under the age of 11. You have 1 million refugees as you heard in all. Nearly three quarters under 11.</p><p>In Egypt today, security and military forces are deployed around the city of Cairo. They've closed off traffic in some of the major roadways. This comes ahead of protests by the supporters of the former President Mohamed Morsi and these rallies today kind of a test for the Morsi supporters. See if they can keep the pressure up despite the crack down that we've seen here on the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p>We mentioned President Obama on CNN; later today he visits Pennsylvania for the first time in more than a year bringing in this plan. He's been out on the road promoting for college affordability to Scranton. Joe Biden's hometown -- Scranton Pennsylvania -- Lakawana College (ph) she'll be later on in the day.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Coming up on 15 minutes after the hour. Dagen McDowell is not here today because, well, what did she tell you, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, she hit her head on a cabinet the other day and had wounds so, you know.</p><p>IMUS: On her face apparently -- not just her head or something.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right. Some kind of a wound on her face.</p><p>IMUS: Did you ever get any more information? Did you every talk to her, Carley?</p><p>MCSHANE: Hold on one second.</p><p>IMUS: What happened to Carley?</p><p>MCSHANE: There she is.</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING: I'm right here, hi. I spoke to with her, but I did not ask any questions. I want to get the real story when she comes in first thing on Monday.</p><p>MCSHANE: Wait a minute.</p><p>IMUS: Well, when you spoke to her what was the conversation about then.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I just asked her if she needed anything. If she was in Manhattan, I'd go over and see her. She said she is fine, but she needs to heal up a little bit more.</p><p>MCSHANE: Ok, good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's a good friend you are.</p><p>IMUS: So something is not -- we are not getting the story here.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I mean it is Friday. Something is fishy. Let's be honest.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>MCSHANE: Come on Carley.</p><p>IMUS: What did you say Carley?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I said it's Friday. Something's fishy. Let's be honest.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Time for a little sports now and sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Hey Warner --</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Patrick Gottsch, you know, did you ever meet him?</p><p>WOLF: Yes. Sure at your golf tournament, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Sure. So he calls me yesterday or texted me. He says we are having a big announcement on Rural Radio which is on Sirius XM. Could you listen and I was with the kids and I could not. He said well, we're going to have it on TV.</p><p>Here is what they are going to do. They will have a one day two million dollar rodeo at Cowboys Stadium.</p><p>WOLF: No kidding.</p><p>IMUS: No. So I do not know the details of that yet but it is not until March 2. But it's going to be $2 million in prize money which should be the richest rodeo ever held. And they've invited all of the -- I guess the ten best cowboys in all events. Everybody from saddle block riding to (inaudible) to calf roping team.</p><p>Then, anybody else can enter, I think. A limited number of them or just what they call qualifiers and that would be guys who no longer compete. Like Joe Beaver could come back and calf-rope if he put on knee brace and other people could as well.</p><p>WOLF: Cody Ohl.</p><p>IMUS: Cody Ohl is still -- he's still going to the national finals. He will go again this year. He is still out winning beau coup money. He's in the top 15 in the world now. So that is a huge deal at Cowboys Stadium.</p><p>WOLF: Maybe Jerry Jones will be there.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, Warner.</p><p>Anyway, it is time for sports. Sports sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Did I say that.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, here's the great Warner Wolf.</p><p>WOLF: Thank you. Good morning I-Man.</p><p>Yankees beat the Jays 5-3, they sweep the series. They've won 10 of 12. They cut the race for that second wild card spot to 3.5 games.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, every time Patrick e-mails me and asked me to watch something or listen to something, I then critique it. He does not ask me to do that. He doesn't say be sure and e-mail me or text me and tell me what you think of my people who are announcing on the radio or on RFD. The announcer that he had on RFD was so annoying and irritating. I cannot think of the guy's name. Some dope.</p><p>Randy Bernard -- he used to be the PBR and the Hyundai car deal and he's a great guy. He has terrific ideas. And this whole rodeo thing is his idea. I don't know. It's just -- I watched him for a few minutes and it irritated me.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That is so unlike you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I did hear Joe Beaver call in. He said he's in day 13 of a 15- day clinic. That is odd, he just left here eight days ago. That must be the new math or something.</p><p>WOLF: Two a day.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, maybe two a day or something.</p><p>Anyway, what were you saying now.</p><p>WOLF: Well, Yanks got a big break when the umps blew a call in the last of the fifth inning, if you want to see it on Fox Business --</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>WOLF: It was called by Buck Martinez of CTV sports network.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BUCK MARTINEZ, CTV SPORTS: -- goes after the first pitch. Davis -- no catch -- they sit on the tracks and now they have two runners at second. They tag and try to tag out each. So now, we have all sorts of confusion.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Well if you look at it again, you'll see that catch is made. Instead of an inning ending double play, it was incorrectly ruled an RBI for Wells. The Yanks took the lead and never trailed. This is exactly one of the instances that videotape replay will be used next year.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. No justice, no peace.</p><p>WOLF: Pirates and Cards win. Pirates still by one.</p><p>And Dodgers Clay Kershaw, eighth inning, shut out the Marlins. He lowers his earned run average to 1.72. Man, that's Gibson, Kofax, (inaudible) numbers. And in their playoff drive, the Mets have just signed former Red Sox right-hander, Daisuke Matsuzaka --</p><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p>WOLF: -- who has never been the same since his big 2008 season when he went 18 and 3. In fact, he'll pitch tonight.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Did you say the Mets playoff drive?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, I did.</p><p>MCSHANE: Of course.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I just wanted to make sure I was hearing properly.</p><p>WOLF: Of course, come on.</p><p>MCSHANE: There's still time.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: That's hurtful, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: That's not funny.</p><p>WOLF: Not at all. Exhibition football, the Lions beat the Patriots 40-9.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>WOLF: The Patriots turned the ball over three of the first four possessions.</p><p>Here was Patriots coach Bill Belichick.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BILL BELICHICK, COACH NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS: When you turn the ball over four times in the first quarter, that will knock you out of most any game.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: That's right. Again, you know, Reggie Bush is the new running back for the Lions. One yard in six carries. He did catch five passes, 103 yards.</p><p>IMUS: Must have had the Kardashian girl he used to be married to on his back.</p><p>Twenty-one after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING -- what's coming up in the briefing, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: President Obama, he pulled a boner in front of a bunch of college kids if I may employ some old school vernacular. And comedian Louis C.K., he finds a dead body in the river. We have the audio --</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. Yes, indeed. True story boss, true story.</p><p>IMUS: And the Godfather's coming up and Powell to the people is coming up as well. Well, I hope Doug Christine has got his TV on or his radio.</p><p>You're telling me that Omar (inaudible). Delbert McClinton. Have you lost your mind?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning everyone. I'm Diane Macedo.</p><p>And we will get a new reading on the housing market this morning. New home sales for July are expected to fall 1.5 percent from June to 490,000. That would be disappointing reading after existing home sales for last month jumped 6.5 percent to their highest level in four years.</p><p>The mood of the housing market though does seem to be improving. Home builder confidence jumped last week to its highest level in eight years despite rising interest rates.</p><p>Moody's investors service is putting the 6 U.S. Banks on review to weather the possibility of reducing support if they run into financial trouble. Of those banks, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are under review with downgrade implications while Bank of America and Citigroup are being evaluated as direction uncertain.</p><p>Moody's also says it may downgrade bonds at Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, B of A, and Citigroup though Bank of America and Citigroup bonds could also be upgraded because their operations are improving. Ratings downgrades can increase a bank's borrowing costs and force it to close more collateral and derivative trades weighing on its profitability and draining its cash.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Diane, what the hell are doing, Diane? Are you spraying your hair?</p><p>MACEDO: I was putting it in place for you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh my goodness.</p><p>IMUS: Your hair looks great Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: Thank you.</p><p>IMUS: You already have a guy who is going to marry you so you can get fat now. What do you care?</p><p>Anyway back to Lupi.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good focus.</p><p>MIKE LUPICA: You just really like talking. You're a crazy person.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I am sitting here watching the monitor and Diane is spraying her hair.</p><p>LUPICA: Don't look at the monitor. Don't look in the monitor -- focus on what you are doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: 28 after the hour. We have (inaudible) coming up. So is Tony Powell, Powell to the people. The business report, did you do it Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: I don't think I did specific business report.</p><p>IMUS: You don't have to now.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, the Nasdaq thing --</p><p>IMUS: Sponsored by Ativia for natural pain relief. Go ativia.com and send those Vicodin out here to the I-Man.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's the style.</p><p>IMUS: Although I'm leaving here to go to Texas in a few days and then about a week. The last group of kids and then I will be at the Joe Beaver junior superstar roping in Steubenville, Texas over Labor Day. And then I will be in Huntsville. Then I'll be at Wyatt's first high school rodeo September 8th and then on September 9, I'll be back in the studio at Fox.</p><p>MCSHANE: Pretty good, pretty good.</p><p>I should point out on Labor Day that's when that special on the Imus Ranch on Fox Business Networkwill premiere. And (inaudible) and editor John here doing a great job on. I saw part of it yesterday that they're putting together.</p><p>IMUS: You know, I was going to say I'm a not be able to watch it but I have satellite DirecTV in my horse trailer.</p><p>MCSHANE: Of course you do. You'll have it. I believe the times are going to noon Eastern and 4:00 Eastern and then I'm sure, it will repeat after that. But that will be when it premieres.</p><p>IMUS: I can just set my TIVO in my horse trailer. I have a plug in for Randy.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That is big pimping right there.</p><p>IMUS: I've two televisions in the living quarters of my horse trailer. Room for four horses and three people.</p><p>This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program is sponsored by BMW of Bayside -- you sick -- anyway --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Nothing.</p><p>MCSHANE: Nothing at all.</p><p>IMUS: It is time for a Bernie Briefing, the 30 minutes past the hour. That, of course, is sponsored by MyPillow, which - by the way we're in - or in horse trailers. So. Anyway, good morning, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, boss. President Obama up at SUNY, Buffalo in upstate New York yesterday, giving his speech and he made a little bit of a mistake and a recovery. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Your outstanding mayor Brian Higgins is here.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>OBAMA: Give him a big (inaudible) of applause.</p><p>AUDIENCE: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>OBAMA: What?</p><p>Byron Brown. That's - I would - I am sorry, Byron.</p><p>Let me -- what I meant was your congressman, Brian Higgins is here. Your mayor, Byron Brown is here.</p><p>This is what happens when you get to be 52 years old.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>OBAMA: When I was 51, everything was smooth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Pretty good. He can be charming.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yeah, very likable.</p><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And your friend, comedian Louis C.K. .</p><p>IMUS: I love him.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He was on with David Letterman the other night, but nobody would know it because half the country can't get CBS and the other half just doesn't watch. But .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Or doesn't try.</p><p>MCGUIRK: In any case, Mr. C.K., he was boating in the East River here in New York City and the following transpired between him and Letterman. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LOUIS C.K., COMEDIAN: I got a boat, I saw the Coast Guard comes on and they say, please be aware there's other - a report of a body in the water south of the Queensboro Bridge, which is where I was, and as soon as they said I looked down and there was the dude in the water.</p><p>DAVID LETTERMAN, LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST: Oh, my God.</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: Yeah.</p><p>LETTERMAN: So you are like right in there at the crime - well, we think crime scene. We don't know.</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: I don't know. It's just floating dead person.</p><p>LETTERMAN: Yeah.</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: And I've never seen a dead guy. Have you ever seen a dead person?</p><p>LETTERMAN: Well, I have been to various funerals .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LETTERMAN: . but not like this. This is a dead guy in the wild.</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: That is right. That is right. That is right. This is a freshly dead person.</p><p>LETTERMAN: Yeah.</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: Has he been all - you know .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: It's just .</p><p>LETTERMAN: Must have been creepy.</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: It was creepy and weird and I felt embarrassed for him a little bit. And .</p><p>LETTERMAN: You should have gotten the picture of him. You should .</p><p>LOUIS C.K.: What's that?</p><p>LETTERMAN: You should have got .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LETTERMAN: Then we would have that to look at.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Not a lot of sympathy on the .</p><p>IMUS: Not (inaudible). What's that clip about?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, the story of the dead body. You know, we listened to Letterman's monologue. He is the only guy that's on live this week, everybody is off, everybody .</p><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Not one funny thing could we use from Mr. Letterman, but that was the best and here we are bringing it to the I-Man. A dead body in the East River, just another day in New York City.</p><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And at least they didn't speculate that it was Jay Leno or something like that, some mean-spirited thing.</p><p>IMUS: Yeah. Something we'd have done .</p><p>MCGUIRK: But you know what, Jimmy Kimmel, thought, remember that kid, he was - the judge told the parents that no, you cannot name your kid Messiah, you're going to name him Martin, all right? In any case, Jimmy Kimmel has this to say about that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST: Guys. So no, you are not naming your son Messiah and forced him to change it to Martin. So, we'd better - if your first name is Messiah, you will never find little personalized license plates for your bike.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KIMMEL: Plus, there's a lot of pressure to have. Oh, great, Messiah wet his bed again.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KIMMEL: I don't think what the judge did was legal, but I'm glad she did it. In fact, I think we should bring her to Hollywood, put her in charge of celebrity baby names.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KIMMEL: Because there is - not even giving their kids names anymore, they're giving them nouns. You go to any playground in L.A., yell the word River, ten kids will come running.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: River!</p><p>IMUS: And really.</p><p>MCGUIRK: True story.</p><p>IMUS: Low on material here. It is 34 minutes past the hour.</p><p>Brutal. Here is some \"Rusty Truck.\" Man, I love this .</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I am Diane Macedo. And central bankers are in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for their annual conference. Fox Business' Peter Barnes is there too. Here is an update.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, let's just call it taper talk in the teatimes this time around in Jackson Hole. It's the Fed officials and central bankers from around the world gathering to hear the latest research on the economy and on monetary policy, but the real action takes place on the sidelines during the breaks and in the hallways where the participants can talk to each other one-on-one and share information and talk about the effectiveness of policy and the state of the recovery and of easy money policies. Of course, the big question here is when the Fed could start to wind down, to dial back its $85 billion a month in quantitative easing bond purchases designed to help keep interest rates low on mortgages and other types of loans coming in to the conference. The handicapping is that the Fed could start small at its next policy meeting in September.</p><p>The big elephant not in the room this time around at Jackson Hole is Fed Chairman Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke. </nameText></person>He is skipping the conference for the first time since he became Fed chairman back in 2005. The Fed says he has a personal scheduling conflict, but a lot of folks here are looking and talking about who may succeed Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>as the chairman, who President Obama will appoint. One of the leading contenders is the vice chairman of the Fed, Janet Yellen. She is here and will moderate a panel on Saturday on her leading rival in the contest. Larry Summers, former economic adviser to the president is not attending. Back to you in New York.</p><p>MACEDO: All right. That's Peter Barnes in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p><p>Taking a look at futures, we've got a fairly flat morning, Dow futures are down eight. \"Imus in the Morning\" continues right now.</p><p>IMUS: To my man. Freddie Toyota on Highland Boulevard in Staten Island, 19 minutes now until the hour. Please welcome to the program Don Corleone, the godfather. Good morning, godfather.</p><p>BARTLETT: Good morning, Don Imus. At first I was disappointed in this Bradley Manning leaking the classified information, but now there are some suggestions that he did so because he preferred to - I'm now a woman - literally. He may think that he is a female trapped in a man's body, as if that catzone (ph) hanging of him with some kind of padlock .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT: And all this time I assumed he wasn't that good at keeping secrets. Man, he says that he has - a feminile (ph) - and wishes to be treated as such. Well, I hope he will be relieved to know that his wish will be partially granted when serving his sentence. He will be surrounded by men who will be more than happy to treat him as the receptacle for their (speaking Italian). Trust me, you don't want that translated.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT: What bothers me is that this revelation suggests his punishment is less a penalty than a reward. He will spend his years in jail like it was some kind of Fire Island Labor Day barbecue. The only thing that won't be part of his plan is the being referred to as Chelsea. For I think the name he will be known by will be more along the lines of bitch.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTLETT: But if it were up to me he would be for his infamnia (ph) with the real punishment like being extradited to Russia where they would be more than happy to cut off the very thing that is trapping him in a man's body. He divulged classified information, but the leaking has just begun.</p><p>IMUS: Thank you, Godfather. For - that's assessment - and 17 until the hour. \"Powell to the People\" coming up next. This is an unauthorized airing of this record of (inaudible)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO: Hi, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo, and let's check the markets now, the day after the NASDAQ flash freed that halted trading for three hours. Asian markets ended the day mixed: Japan's Nikkei followed the U.S., rebounded, finished the day at more than two percent. South Korea's KOSPI gained more than one percent, but the Hang Seng and Shanghai did end with red arrows. Over in Europe, we got the second reading on second quarter GDP for the U.K. And Germany, both rose seven tenths of a percent, London's up about 35, Frankfurt is up about 18, but Paris is down almost two points.</p><p>Here, in the U.S. futures have been pointing to a lower open for most of the morning. Dow futures are still down by about a four, but the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are showing some slight gains. We will be keeping an eye on those for you. Gap raised its full year earnings outlook and annual dividend after reporting a 25 percent jump in its second quarter profit compared to last year. The retailer said it earned $0.64 a share matching the estimate. Revenue rose just over eight percent to $3.7 billion. That also tops expectations. Gap now expects to report a profit of $2.57 to $2.65 a share. That's $0.05 above its previous range. The company also raised its annual dividend to $0.80 per share up from $0.60.</p><p>We're getting earnings in now from Ann Inc, formally Ann Taylor, the company is reporting a profit of $0.76 a share, topping the estimate for $0.65. Revenue, though, was a slight miss at $638,2 million. Analysts were expecting $639 million. \"Imus in the Morning\" continues right now on Fox Business.</p><p>IMUS: Why did that commercial sound like it was under water, Lou?</p><p>RUFINO: My fault, I guess.</p><p>IMUS: Well, now, that was - comes from your studio or the other studio?</p><p>RUFINO: No, I don't know anything about it.</p><p>IMUS: But do you care about it?</p><p>RUFINO: Does it sound like I care?</p><p>IMUS: No, it doesn't. It's just like - you're parallel.</p><p>RUFINO: No, I guess so.</p><p>IMUS: Well, yeah - but I mean we charge these people all these money for this commercial, and want people to be able to hear them.</p><p>This part of the program is sponsored by Freddie Toyota on the Highland Boulevard in Staten Island.</p><p>Well, hey, Bernie, is CBS off in how much of the country?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, Time Warner, I don't know what the percentage is, my guess is, approximately half. But I think they just got back on Verizon files.</p><p>MCSHANE: I don't know if it's - but the big, the funny thing was they put them back on Channel 2 last night, just to have the debate between - what Spitzer was on.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>MCSHANE: They didn't want, you know, to be accused of keeping that off the air.</p><p>IMUS: One direction is appearing on the \"Today Show,\" which is only a couple of blocks from where the Fox Studios are.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yeah.</p><p>IMUS: They are on 6th Avenue, the Avenue of the Americas. And so, Powell to the People. Tony went out and talked to some folks. I guess, first some kids who have been waiting there for some time. Roll, Bigfoot.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TONY POWELL: How long have you been standing here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Two days.</p><p>POWELL: When did you get here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wednesday. I forgot what day is today.</p><p>POWELL: How long have you been here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Since Tuesday.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have been awake since 4:30 Thursday morning.</p><p>POWELL: Where did you go to the bathroom?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Plaza, McDonald's.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Random places.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah. Starbucks.</p><p>POWELL: So you like - it's almost like walking your dog. You mark every place in the neighborhood.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>POWELL: How long have you been here, Jay?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Three days.</p><p>POWELL: Three days. You must really love your child.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do.</p><p>POWELL: Do you know any lyrics?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't.</p><p>POWELL: So, if you hear it all the time, you can probably sing it there. Can you sing it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You mean best song ever?</p><p>POWELL: Can you sing it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not really well.</p><p>POWELL: So, you're excited to see one erection?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I don't care.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I'm very excited. My children are.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I bet you are.</p><p>POWELL: If somebody gave you $10 million or a chance to hang out with Harry Styles, which would you choose?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A chance to hang out with Harry Styles.</p><p>POWELL: Is that how you raise them?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would pay $20 million to have coffee with Neil.</p><p>POWELL: So, if you had a chance to be with Harry Styles and Neil Cavuto, who would you be with?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Cavuto.</p><p>POWELL: So, you like your men like you like your coffee.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Strong.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Smart.</p><p>POWELL: He makes the mood for you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah, in a strange way here, very strange.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Well, the kind of inappropriate. I mean - want an erection talking to kids?</p><p>MCSHANE: Where did you get that from?</p><p>IMUS: What is the matter with you?</p><p>POWELL: I don't know. It's just - I don't know. It seemed funny to me. I don't know why it means .</p><p>IMUS: It wasn't funny, not in that context, you idiot.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh-oh.</p><p>IMUS: It is eight minutes until -- what is the matter with you, Bigfoot? So, here is the new rule. Before we put any of these on the air you have got to show them to me. You understand.</p><p>POWELL: Yes, starting next week.</p><p>IMUS: Because, well, I am going to be off next week.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's a good time to start it.</p><p>IMUS: Because your judgment sucks.</p><p>POWELL: One time. I got it.</p><p>IMUS: Come on! Anyway.</p><p>MCSHANE: Back to you, I-Man.</p><p>IMUS: So, today is Friday and Tony says how many days have you been here? I say two. He said, well, when did you go here?</p><p>MCSHANE: It's just me.</p><p>IMUS: OK. We need to figure it out. But I guess - at the University of Virginia, you missed that day.</p><p>MCSHANE: Some of them say they got - some of them said they .</p><p>IMUS: No, not Tony - it's not - this is not an opportunity to debate. So, Rob Bartlett will be appearing at the Leavitt Theater in Ogunsuck (ph) Maine.</p><p>MCSHANE: Ogunquit.</p><p>IMUS: Whatever. September 21st, and Tony will be appearing at the Belmar Theater on Saturday, September 28th for an evening with Tony Powell. That ought to be good. Well, it could be good as long as he doesn't do any of this and you could get tickets to that by going to NY entrainmentclub.com or you could get a hold of that Bellmore theater, and I want to see Tony.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right.</p><p>IMUS: I am confident that he is funny. If you want to see evidence of this. Now that this dingbat Liz Claman--</p><p>MCSHANE: No, no, no.</p><p>IMUS: He is going to interview the head of the NASDAQ .</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, great.</p><p>IMUS: Because they got shutdown yesterday. And we don't know - nobody knows why. I mean there was - you know, the suspicion is that they are lying, whatever they tell her. But we just - we have Warner watch this and see if we can determine if either one of them was lying. Five minute now till the hour.</p><p>IMUS: A lot of the people out there - what did you think, Dagen, again?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just thought it was badly cast, like the comedian, why is he there and then they have this woman sitting off to the side on - reporting on what people are tweeting about, reading stuff on the Twitter, off the Internet, and just pointless.</p><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They could be a better way to integrate it. I mean if you want to have like a hot check, just have her sit there and do nothing. And just cut - OK, let's give them the hot check a few minutes, you just take a shot of her and then go back talking about some sports. It was just exhausting.</p><p>IMUS: Sounds to me like you are kind of dissing Carley in an odd way.</p><p>CARLEY: Yeah, come on, Dagen. Come on there.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Hey, Carley.</p><p>IMUS: Doesn't sound that way to you, Carley?</p><p>CARLEY: Yeah, what is going on? All that hate?</p><p>IMUS: Yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what - that chick on (inaudible) is a brunette. So, that was not .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Like we have said Carley redeemed and stuffed.</p><p>MCSHANE: And I was great when .</p><p>CARLEY: And I would be happy to read some tweets.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yeah.</p><p>MCSHANE: Do whatever you want, Carley.</p><p>CARLEY: All right.</p><p>IMUS: I thought you liked Carley.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love Carley.</p><p>CARLEY: I love Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you really want me to drive down this road? Because it will get dirty real quick.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCGUIRK: OK, put the pedal to the metal.</p><p>IMUS: I don't have a problem with it. I mean I've got nothing to do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love Carley. It was not a shot at Carley.</p><p>IMUS: But your kids were not up yet. Go for it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program on the Fox Business Network. Now here's Diane Macedo.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning everyone. Let's check the markets now the day after a NASDAQ flash freeze halted trading for three hours. U.S. futures are mixed. We have Dow futures down by one point. The S&amp;P and NASDAQ turned things around. The S&amp;P is up by almost a point, about a point exactly. There now NASDAQ is up almost four. Now, for more on what happened at the NASDAQ yesterday let's go to Nicole Petallides who joins us in the newsroom. Hi, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS: Hey, good morning, Diane, good morning everybody. Well, yesterday's flash freeze from someone who was standing right on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange felt more like an eternity freeze, right?</p><p>So, it took them about a half hour to really figure out what the problem was and then another two and a half hours to actually reopen the Nasdaq MarketSite.</p><p>So, it's very interesting as we watch what happened, it was actually due to a glitch in the processor. A securities information processor SIP which now seems to be regular wording that we use now on Wall Street today.</p><p>But basically it's a way that they give out prices to all the different exchanges, 13 exchanges, 40 dark pools. And when this had a glitch, they basically halted trading across the board.</p><p>Names like Apple, Blackberry, Costco, Cisco, Dow components as well. So, you have Google, JetBlue, just to name a few of the names.</p><p>So, what's interesting is you have different people speaking out today, Bob Greifeld, the CEO of Nasdaq seems very proud of the way that they figured out what the problem was.</p><p>And order and had an orderly reopening and didn't feel the need to address any transparency or address the press, et cetera.</p><p>He said he's working closely with other exchanges. However, when you talk to SEC chair, Mary Jo White, also Harvey Pitt, former SEC chairman, Arthur Levitt, former SEC chairman, they seem less than pleased.</p><p>Obviously noting that this was a serious issue, that's according to Mary Jo White, Harvey Pitt said this, it shouldn't have happened at all.</p><p>And so obviously and Arthur Levitt as well expressing displeasure. So, now what happens today and how do we ensure that this doesn't happen again and really leave Americans and people all over the world with their money tied up and not sure as to when they will be able to execute trades again?</p><p>Now, this is reminiscent of what we remember from Facebook, that debacle of an IPO, you know the ink is barely dry on that $10 million check that Nasdaq had to pay out in order to calm that issue.</p><p>So, this remains an issue and it's all about the complexity of trading which as I noted, 13 exchanges, more than 40 dark pools and that trillions of dollars at hand.</p><p>So, this is a very tough day yesterday on Wall Street. And of course, once again, it's a blast to investor confidence. Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Nicole Petallides from the newsroom, thanks, Nicole. And central bankers are gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the Kansas City Fed's annual conference.</p><p>Fox Business' Peter Barnes joins us live with a preview, good morning, Peter.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS: Hey, good morning, Diane. Well, the topic at this year's conference is global dimensions of unconventional monetary policy.</p><p>What does that mean? Well, basically they're here to talk about low long- term interest rates, quantitative easing, those billions and trillions of dollars that the Fed has spent to buy mortgage-backed securities and treasury securities.</p><p>All of it to try to keep interest rates low for average consumers so they can go out and buy cars and get low-cost mortgages and their businesses can get low loans.</p><p>So, that -- this stuff matters to the average consumer. The big topic here and the big buzz is, when will the Fed start to now dial back all of this quantitative easing?</p><p>It's been doing $85 billion a month since September but it appears that the Fed is now getting ready to start pull that back, to start tapering that, to start dialing that down.</p><p>And that's what's given a lot of heartburn to the markets and caused a lot of these, a lot of the roller coaster ride out in the markets.</p><p>And there will be some papers presented here that talk about quantitative easing, there's been some other recent papers that say basically, you know what?</p><p>It's really not working anymore and that kind of research could help push the Fed to get out of quantitative easing quicker, sooner rather than later.</p><p>I want to mention we got a great lineup of guests here in Jackson Hole this year and just a little bit later in this hour, we'll talk to Dennis Lockhart, he is the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.</p><p>We'll be talking later today to Jim Bullard, the President of the Saint Louis Federal Reserve, they both have been very vocal on this issue of quantitative easing.</p><p>And later this afternoon at 5:00, we'll be talking to Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund who is doing all those bailouts around the world. Diane, back to you.</p><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Peter Barnes in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

So, and we just -- I just don't think we're probably ever going to get to -- well, she claims she walked into a cabinet, right?</p><p>MCSHANE: That's what she said, yes, that's it, and we have to take her at her word, i-man?</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, I see.</p><p>IMUS: No, of course not.</p><p>MCSHANE: Just asking.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, Bigfoot, Liz Claman is coming up and talking to Greifeld, right?</p><p>TOM BOWMAN, PRODUCER, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Yes, she is sitting down right now, so, in just about four minutes.</p><p>IMUS: This is a guy who is -- what does this guy do?</p><p>BOWMAN: He is the head of Nasdaq, so --</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, OK --</p><p>BOWMAN: He is going to --</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, right though --</p><p>BOWMAN: Try and explain what happened yesterday.</p><p>IMUS: So he'll be on --</p><p>BOWMAN: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: Camera? --</p><p>BOWMAN: She'll be sitting down with him for a quick four or five minutes in interview.</p><p>IMUS: OK, I want you to get a look at him, Warner.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTS PRESENTER, IMUS IN THE MORNING: OK --</p><p>IMUS: Pay attention here --</p><p>WOLF: All right, see if his eyes wiggle around, see if --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes --</p><p>WOLF: He fidgets --</p><p>IMUS: Hey, well Bigfoot, well, how am I going to know whether she's ready --</p><p>BOWMAN: I'm going to let you know --</p><p>IMUS: You going to tell me? --</p><p>MCSHANE: That also be great --</p><p>BOWMAN: Hey, and by the way you're not --</p><p>IMUS: And then I'll listen --</p><p>BOWMAN: Tossing the people, he was talking to parents, he didn't ask that question to the minors about --</p><p>IMUS: Yes, with the kids standing around there --</p><p>BOWMAN: But he was directing it to the parents and Tony's --</p><p>MCSHANE: No children, right --</p><p>BOWMAN: No children --</p><p>MCSHANE: That's a good point, Tom.</p><p>IMUS: But it wasn't funny anyway, so, you want to discuss it --</p><p>BOWMAN: No, that's why from now on we're going to have you --</p><p>IMUS: No --</p><p>BOWMAN: Look at it first.</p><p>IMUS: Going to have to show me because I don't trust you or him.</p><p>BOWMAN: Oh, wait a minute --</p><p>IMUS: I mean I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOWMAN: Just Tony and others, the only people on the show you don't trust?</p><p>IMUS: I've been doing this a while, I know what I'm doing. And if you guys think you know better, Tony, you think you know better or Bigfoot, you guys go do it yourself somewhere.</p><p>But for the time-being, we're going to do what I think is funny.

Now, stop it! --</p><p>MCSHANE: Not --</p><p>IMUS: Playing a cut from \"Cnn\", that's just idiotic. All right, please welcome now to the program Liz Claman, good morning, Miss Claman.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right --</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Don and to all of your listeners and viewers, we are live at the Nasdaq MarketSite.</p><p>You know, there are many exchanges, but the two biggest, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, one of them went down yesterday for a full three hours.</p><p>Throwing the entire trading system for all of you who maybe have 401(k)s or trade stocks, it went down for a full three hours and of course, now, it's been attributed to a highly technical glitch.</p><p>We're joined now by the CEO of the Nasdaq, Bob Greifeld. Thank you for being here --</p><p>ROBERT GREIFELD, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NASDAQ: I'm glad to have you here, Liz.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK, this is not a great day for you, this was a nightmare yesterday, but it was also a nightmare for companies like Yahoo!, Apple, Google who list on the Nasdaq but also the individual investor.</p><p>Right off the bat, I have to ask you because so many people were questioning this. Was there any indication of any kind of computer hacking or system hacking here?</p><p>GREIFELD: No, none whatsoever. So, this had nothing to do with hacking. Hacking is a fact of life but had nothing to do with the problem yesterday.</p><p>CLAMAN: That worries some people that it was an internal system because it indicates to some people, you guys don't have your arms wrapped around your system?</p><p>GREIFELD: Well, certainly we're deeply disappointed with what happened yesterday and what we had to do is improve what I call defensive driving.</p><p>So, our system by itself was working but you have interconnections in the world we live in today and we have to handle bad actions from some of those people connected to us.</p><p>And we have to improve on that. So, we're deeply disappointed but I would highlight that one of the reasons it took three hours was, we have a first and foremost responsibility for fair and orderly markets.</p><p>So, we spent two and a half hours really making sure the entire industry, we had opened telephone lines with them, we made sure the entire industry was ready to come live and we did come live, we came live quite successfully and finished the day in normal course of business.</p><p>CLAMAN: Nobody begrudges you that moment where you have to work and make sure that once you do press go again, it's going to be fine.</p><p>What they do get very upset about, Bob, is the lack of communication. I talked to CEOs of Nasdaq-traded companies who said I got nothing.</p><p>I'm sitting in meetings, I'm checking my Blackberry, I'm checking my phone, there's nothing from the Nasdaq.</p><p>They do know that you were putting out some 20 missives to the trading community, but that's not the CEOs of all of these companies who are worried about their stocks.</p><p>What's wrong with your communication system?</p><p>GREIFELD: Well, our communication system I think worked well yesterday. It can always be improved.</p><p>First order of businesses to focus on solving the problem and then dealing with people directly involved with the problem.</p><p>Now, in one of those open lines we had people representing our issuers on the call and they were -- they are to give regular updates out.</p><p>We gave a formal update out after the close of trading which we wanted to do. So, I think we did well, we'll certainly reflect upon how we communicate, see if we can do better.</p><p>CLAMAN: Can't you just --</p><p>GREIFELD: But certainly --</p><p>CLAMAN: Hire somebody to work the phones and call the IR offices? The --</p><p>GREIFELD: Oh, they were doing that --</p><p>CLAMAN: You know --</p><p>GREIFELD: Although we had teams --</p><p>CLAMAN: Investor relations offices --</p><p>GREIFELD: No --</p><p>CLAMAN: On the stock --</p><p>GREIFELD: We had teams of people doing that. As I'm saying, we had the people responsible for the issuers on the open lines so they could hear first-hand exactly what was going on.</p><p>They were taking inbound calls, we took hundreds of inbound calls, reaching, making outbound calls. So, there was active communication going on.</p><p>In this type of situation, you probably didn't get to every single CEO or every single IRO, but we communicated quite actively to a large number of them.</p><p>Then the official communication went out after the close of trading day to everybody.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK --</p><p>GREIFELD: Right, so, it happened you know, quite rapidly.</p><p>CLAMAN: I get the explanations but we had former Securities and Exchange Commission head, Harvey Pitt on yesterday, he was very harsh.</p><p>You were probably busy working the situation, but he said the Nasdaq handled this \"terribly\". What he didn't like too was when you started the systems up.</p><p>He said you only allowed trading in certain stocks, and he said how can you be fair when you're only allowing certain stocks to get up --</p><p>GREIFELD: Well, I think it's hard for people outside direct involvement with the problem to comment and comment intelligently on it.</p><p>So we have --</p><p>CLAMAN: Well, you're taking the smack at Harvey Pitt?</p><p>GREIFELD: Well --</p><p>CLAMAN: I mean, he's not --</p><p>GREIFELD: I'm just saying for anybody who is not there, right? So, they -- you know the people who are not on the open lines, who are not in the head trader alert communication, it's hard for them to know, right?</p><p>And hard for them to comment intelligently in terms of what happened. So, everybody was directly involved, the exchanges were on what's called the UTP line.</p><p>SIP arranged a line with our members, in addition to that, we had the head trader alert. So, that happened all the way and each plan, right?</p><p>And we solved the problem within half an hour, right? And certain members made a request in terms of having a longer period of time to quote --</p><p>CLAMAN: OK --</p><p>GREIFELD: Instead of five-15 minutes, that cost a half hour of time to get ready for that. So, that communication was there and I think to the extent that anybody who wasn't involved became involved, we said OK, that was as active as you can get.</p><p>CLAMAN: You guys are considered the sexier exchange.</p><p>GREIFELD: Yes.</p><p>CLAMAN: You know, you've got the lots of the dotcoms of the world but there are some that aren't public yet. Twitter, for example, everybody is waiting for that to go public.</p><p>Do you think you've lost Twitter? Can you make a 30-second pitch to Twitter to say here is why you should still consider listing on Nasdaq?</p><p>GREIFELD: Well, I think it's important to recognize that we aspire towards perfection with respect to the operations of our systems.</p><p>And technology people, Twitter and all the companies recognize that. We will always fall short of that but we have to keep trying, right?</p><p>And we get better all the time, and the number of problems have actually declined. But probably as importantly, we have to make sure we handle problems in the proper way, right?</p><p>So, what we did yesterday, right, nobody wanted to be down for three hours and if we had been quite reckless we could have been up a lot sooner than that.</p><p>But I think the procedures we had in place, the industry had in place worked well. So, we would say to any technology-based company, we're not perfect, right?</p><p>We're 99.99 percent perfect, we're not perfect, we'll have problems but if we do, we're going to make sure we maintain a fair and orderly market.</p><p>And that's what we did yesterday. And it's important to recognize the fact we didn't trade for several hours. If you're a traditional long investor, a mom-and-pop, institutional investor, that three hours doesn't matter.</p><p>You're buying the stock for the longer period of time, right? And the fact is, every single person was in the same situation. Nobody was relatively advantaged or disadvantaged because the market was down for that --</p><p>CLAMAN: I --</p><p>GREIFELD: Period of time.</p><p>CLAMAN: Some moms and pops are a little more sophisticated these days and like to trade a lot. But either way, we appreciate you coming on Fox --</p><p>GREIFELD: Right --</p><p>CLAMAN: Business and IMUS IN THE MORNING to talk about this. Bob Greifeld is the CEO of the Nasdaq, we now rejoin IMUS IN THE MORNING on Fox Business and on radio. Back to you.</p><p>IMUS: Praise God --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: He sounds like he might have had a head injury, doesn't he?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Jesus -- well, he's been up all night --</p><p>MCSHANE: But Warner was on top of it over there, I saw --</p><p>IMUS: What do you think, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: Well, my question is if you grabbed his hands, could he talk? I mean, that guy just broke the record for gestures with hands.</p><p>IMUS: What does that mean?</p><p>WOLF: Well, it means you're not quite comfortable enough with just verbalizing and you think you have to emphasize everything --</p><p>IMUS: Well, he's on the spot here. My favorite part of the interview is when Liz breathlessly --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: Like she said, you don't have your arms wrapped around your problem. What kind of question is that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Don't have your arms wrapped around -- oh, God.</p><p>MCSHANE: That was fun.</p><p>IMUS: So we don't know anything, do we? We don't know any more now than we knew, so --</p><p>MCSHANE: It's kind of what I was thinking, there was --</p><p>IMUS: Man, at least she got him on.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, IMUS IN THE MORNING: She'll get all this press all day long, she interviewed him and it's all good.</p><p>IMUS: Yes --</p><p>MCSHANE: You need to get Warner to analyze all our business interviews from now on, on the 11:00 show with me, it would be great, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Sure, I'll be --</p><p>IMUS: Or anybody who is on --</p><p>WOLF: Right --</p><p>IMUS: Who we can see --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, could be great --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RUFINO: I was looking at Connell's --</p><p>MCSHANE: Liar --</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, before and --</p><p>MCSHANE: Look at this --</p><p>IMUS: We didn't have any answers.</p><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p>IMUS: But she asked the right questions, just --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, she did --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Damn right --</p><p>MCSHANE: She was fine, yes --</p><p>IMUS: That breathless --</p><p>MCSHANE: At least --</p><p>IMUS: I don't know, it's fine, she's fine.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: It's all fine, it's all good.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's all --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Really is --</p><p>MCSHANE: Good --</p><p>IMUS: Quote Mark Seliger and Rusty Truck, \"It's All Good\".</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: What are we supposed to do now? 17 after the hour?</p><p>MCSHANE: Some sports, you know --</p><p>IMUS: All right, let's do that, sponsored by Peerless Boilers, good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Good morning, i-man. All right, here we go, Yanks beat the Jays 5- 3, they sweep the series 10 out of 12. A blown call by the umpire in the bottom of the fifth with the bases loaded really gave the Yanks a huge break.</p><p>Here was the call by Michael Kay, \"YES Network\".</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL KAY, SPORTSCASTER: Right through the centerfield, it is caught. It's going to be -- no, he drops the ball about five seconds and it is a double play.</p><p>He's tagging everybody whether it's a double play, the ending inning. Did he make the catch?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No --</p><p>KAY: Now they're saying that he didn't make the catch?</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Well, he didn't make the catch --</p><p>IMUS: Yes --</p><p>WOLF: So, instead of a double play ending the inning, Wells was given an RBI, the Yanks took the lead and never trailed. And this is exactly what videotape replay will be used next year.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, thank God.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>RUFINO: That will help --</p><p>WOLF: Yes --</p><p>RUFINO: Everything --</p><p>MCSHANE: Amen --</p><p>RUFINO: Game will be five hours.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, fantastic --</p><p>WOLF: Clayton Kershaw --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, that's just great, Warner --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Bring the videotape delay --</p><p>RUFINO: Well, the umpires are still looking --</p><p>WOLF: Well, they're supposed to --</p><p>IMUS: Hey, what sporting activity is around today, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: Well today, you have -- if you want to watch NFL football tonight, Seahawks, Packers, Bears and Raiders.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'll watch that and I might watch the Seahawks.</p><p>WOLF: And also you can watch the little league game between Westport and Sammamish.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh --</p><p>WOLF: That will be --</p><p>IMUS: What time is that?</p><p>WOLF: That's a 3:00 game.</p><p>IMUS: Is that Eastern Time?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, Westport --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, Williamsport --</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right --</p><p>WOLF: And of course, the winner will play Chula Vista for the U.S. title.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes --</p><p>WOLF: So, that's a huge game.</p><p>IMUS: Anything else?</p><p>WOLF: Well, kind of funny, you have Brian Wilson, a pitch to the ninth inning of the Dodgers game.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They did --</p><p>WOLF: Take a look at him, if you don't know, the big beard and he's been offered a million dollars to shave his beard by 800razors.com.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes --</p><p>WOLF: That's it. In golf, Kevin Stadler has the first round lead of the Charles Barkley tournament as you have said.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right --</p><p>WOLF: And --</p><p>MCSHANE: That was unfunny joke three hours ago when --</p><p>WOLF: Oh --</p><p>MCSHANE: You just going to ride it until it's --</p><p>WOLF: Oh, yes --</p><p>MCSHANE: But yesterday was funny --</p><p>WOLF: I think it's clever, yes --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, very well --</p><p>WOLF: It's a terrible joke but it's clever.</p><p>MCSHANE: A good line --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, it is --</p><p>WOLF: Tiger Woods was three back at 67 and Rory McIlroy who Gary Player said needs a good woman, had three double-bogeys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>In football last night, the Panthers beat the Ravens, all four touchdowns came on turnovers. Two interceptions, a punt return and a fumble return.</p><p>And the Lions beat the Patriots 40 to 9. Here was Bill Belichick.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BILL BELICHICK, COACH, NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS: Certainly wasn't, it wasn't a very competitive performance.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: No, it wasn't.</p><p>IMUS: No, it wasn't --</p><p>WOLF: And cut out the whining, come on. Jeremy Lin who turned 25 today, and remember he signed a three-year deal, 25 million with the Rockets?</p><p>IMUS: Sure --</p><p>WOLF: He says \"the Rockets coaches lost faith in me. The fans were making fun of me and I experienced emptiness, confusion and misery.\" Come on --</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh --</p><p>WOLF: Suck it up.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, what's the matter with him? --</p><p>WOLF: Please --</p><p>IMUS: Are you kidding me?</p><p>WOLF: Get out.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty minutes after the hour, Bernie has a briefing coming up, what's there, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Madonna makes a fool of herself and Mike Francesa makes an ass of himself, we have the tape.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right --</p><p>MCGUIRK: So keep it where it is.</p><p>RUFINO: Cool.</p><p>MCGUIRK: On --</p><p>IMUS: Were you telling me Lou that these various Francesa-isms have become like internet fodder?</p><p>RUFINO: I think Bernard may have been telling you that.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, whatever, who cares?</p><p>RUFINO: But it is --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Me, you --</p><p>RUFINO: He's got, he's got a ton of clips on YouTube.</p><p>MCSHANE: They love him on that --</p><p>RUFINO: Though he's --</p><p>MCSHANE: \"Deadspin\" --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, he is an internet sensation. \"Deadspin\" --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Sportsgrid.com --</p><p>MCSHANE: That's a --</p><p>MCGUIRK: A lot of these big sports websites.</p><p>RUFINO: If he's yelling at a caller, if he's got something wrong, it's on YouTube.</p><p>MCSHANE: And falls asleep --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes --</p><p>RUFINO: Unfortunately --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Ever since he fell asleep --</p><p>RUFINO: Fell asleep, that's the thing --</p><p>MCGUIRK: That made him notorious.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right --</p><p>IMUS: And he didn't just own up to falling asleep, did he?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He never owned up to it, no, he did not --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, no --</p><p>RUFINO: I was thinking, I was thinking, nodding --</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, I was meditating --</p><p>RUFINO: Funny, just get past it.</p><p>WOLF: Al Albuquerque, you remember that?</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes, I remember the Al Albuquerque deal --</p><p>WOLF: Yes --</p><p>RUFINO: What do you mean?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, all right --</p><p>RUFINO: You're talking the city.

But the guy's name is Alberto Jose Albuquerque. And I'm not sure, maybe they do call him Al Albuquerque, I don't even know.</p><p>But I've never seen that kid pitch before last night.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Was that Francesa?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>WOLF: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: Why does his voice sound so funny?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Maybe he was sucking that helium.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, he's sucking helium --</p><p>IMUS: Yes --</p><p>RUFINO: Sucking helium --</p><p>IMUS: What is that? --</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, he's sucking helium --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Maybe they, maybe they have these new helium doughnuts.</p><p>WOLF: Gunz was high when he was talking, he says --</p><p>IMUS: So --</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, exactly, one more diet coke and helium --</p><p>IMUS: Twenty three after the hour, well, we'll get that in the briefing coming up.</p><p>RUFINO: You know Albuquerque is a place, so, anyway, wait --</p><p>IMUS: You're nuts --</p><p>RUFINO: Dawg, you take this one --</p><p>IMUS: Ten minutes absolutely, Greifeld down there at the Nasdaq.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes, the jingle sound like part of the record, Lou. Sleeping through the night becomes more like a dream itself as folks get older.</p><p>But it's especially aggravating if it's related to your prostate. You got your wiener backed up on you there. But you can unplug that sucker with PT9.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Joel(ph) from New York, he heard the i-man talking about it and felt compelled to write a letter. This is -- don't you wonder about people who take something like PT9, which obviously works, it's from Chamonix, it's a great company.</p><p>Then they offer a money-back guarantee on all of their products, a money- back guarantee, period. Don't you wonder about these people?</p><p>They only write a letter and tell people about their problems I was having with my penis?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: I mean, why?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: We don't want to know that. We -- just order PT9, take it, get three bottles of Heart Factors absolutely free and keep it to yourself.</p><p>Man, I don't want to know about your dick, boy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>So call them at 800 -- I mean, keep it to yourself.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: Jeez. Oh, now (INAUDIBLE) the old lady now, i-man. shut up! Call 800-754-6980. Please, ixnay on the letters. 800-754-6980.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning everyone, I'm Diane Macedo. And we'll get a new reading on the housing market this morning. New home sales for July are expected to fall 1.5 percent from June to 490,000.</p><p>That would be a disappointing reading after existing home sales for last month jumped 6.5 percent to their highest level in four years.</p><p>But the mood of the housing market does appear to be improving. Home builders confidence jumped last week to its highest level in eight years despite rising interest rates.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.</p><p>WOLF: Meanwhile, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman says the Yanks will win --</p><p>IMUS: Hello?</p><p>MCSHANE: Hello? --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOLF: Well, wait --</p><p>IMUS: Hello, Warner.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOLF: Hey, Brian.

Our last day from the ranch for this summer, so -- and Glenn and everybody out here, Glenn is great and been doing it forever. He and his crew, and Glenn and Ken, Ken's great. Glenn's great and kid over here with the camera and the woman whatever her name is.</p><p>In fact, I know these people and only worked with them 15 years, but it's a great crew here at the ranch. They really, they're here on -- they're never late and everything works.</p><p>MCSHANE: Very good.</p><p>IMUS: And they're real pros. And out of Albuquerque and do a lot of film work and they're real professionals and I greatly appreciate it, like all of them. It's 31 past the hour. Time for a Bernie Briefing and that's sponsored by My Pillow. Here with it is Bernard McGuirk. Good morning, Mr. McGuirk.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, Mr. Imus. Yesterday, as Warner Wolf pointed out, the day before yesterday, Ichiro Suzuki, 4,000 hits combined with his Japanese career and his Major League Baseball career. And this dude, JJ from Staten Island called in, as sportsgreat.com writes and so it began on Mike Francesa's dozy time sleep train as our host lambasted a startled caller on Yankees celebration of Ichiro's 4,000 hits and repeated himself. JJ stayed Suzuki had an accomplishment. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE FRANCESA, SPORTS RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: JJ in Staten Island, what's up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's very, very unbelievable accomplishment, you know?</p><p>FRANCESA: No, I don't know. I disagree completely. Disagree completely and I think it's ridiculous. He has 4,000 hits? Why? We now, the Major League and the Japanese leagues are now co-leagues? He has 2,700 major league hits. He doesn't have anything more than that. I think it's utterly ridiculous that we are now going to act like Ichiro got 4,000 hits. He didn't get 4,000 hits, he has 2,700 hits. I give you that, but only 2700 hits as far as we're concerned.</p><p>He doesn't have 3,000 hits and how the heck does he have 4,000 hits? I mean, when did that start? When did we start mingling the Japan statistics with the American statistics? He's got 2,700 Major League hits. He doesn't have 4,000 Major League hits. It doesn't make sense to me. When did we decide that? Who decided the Japanese hits are equal to the major league hits. We've got the statistics.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IMUS: Stop, stop, if I wanted to listen to him, I'd listen. I know he does that, repeats himself ad nauseam. I love Mike, but --</p><p>RUFINO: I think it's a great accomplishment.</p><p>IMUS: But it's unlistenable.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And sportscreed.com, they write, of course, Francesa's argument is fatuous, the only surprise there being that he stayed awake long enough to make it.</p><p>IMUS: What are you doing, be like if you're trying to rope, Wyatt.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, Wyatt.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Wait a second, what's going on there.</p><p>IMUS: Are you roping today?</p><p>WYATT: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: OK, I'm going to fool with you, talk to you when you're backing your horse in the box on the rope.</p><p>WYATT: You're not doing anything, you're talking.</p><p>MCSHANE: Physical.</p><p>WYATT: And having breakfast while you're talking.</p><p>IMUS: You're purposely going out of your way to annoy me.</p><p>WYATT: I'm bringing you breakfast.</p><p>IMUS: If I could, I'd whip your little ass no, no, leave my yogurt away.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And have your own kid spitting in your coffee soon.</p><p>RUFINO: Soon?</p><p>IMUS: He makes me laugh as much as anybody on the planet. God, he's funny. What are you saying?</p><p>MCGUIRK: I was saying that I'm done and we're late for Tom Friedman, cutting into Tom Friedman's time. It's an outrage.</p><p>IMUS: So, get the whining comy on, 25 until the hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network, and now, here is Diane Macedo.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, everyone. Some of the most important economic figures in the world are gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the fed annual conference. A big difference this year is that Fed Chairman Ben <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>won't be attending due to a scheduling conflict. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will also miss this meeting. The main focus of the conference, though, will be the impact of the fed's unconventional policies at home and abroad.</p><p>Now let's get the latest on weather from meteorologist Maria Molina in our Fox Business Weather Center. Hi, Maria.</p><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOX BUSINESS WEATHER CENTER: Hi. Good morning, Diane. Good morning, everyone. Today we're looking at a beautiful day across sections of the northeast. Yesterday, we had storms roll through, leaving behind lower humidity and also pleasant temperatures, like in New York City, 83 degrees for a high temperature and parts of the Midwest and the plains heating in the upper 80's and widespread 90's and feeling like August across the center of the country.</p><p>And out west, a danger of fires, and red flags, that leaves the hours and eventually into the west. Much-need rain across parts of Nevada, Utah and across parts of Southern California, several inches could fall out here so flooding could be a concern. Diane, back to you.</p><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Maria Molina from the weather center. Let's take a quick look at futures. Those have been searching for direction today. Dow futures are now up by 2 points. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.</p><p>IMUS: It's 20 minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Please welcome now from the New York sometimes, Tom Friedman. Good morning, Mr. Friedman.</p><p>TOM FRIEDMAN, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" (via telephone): Good morning, Don.</p><p>IMUS: Wonder how long the \"New York Times\" is going to stay in business?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Gosh, you know, I really think, you know, we've got a strong enough global brand, I don't worry about the times per se, but what I worry, if you look at the numbers, our -- the newspaper ads, you know, have been, I don't know how long it is, six, nine, 12 quarters, you know, they continue to decline and you know, you just hope that we'll find a bottom.</p><p>We're still making a profit, thank God, but if that doesn't find a bottom, you know, at some point, you know, it will affect obviously what we can do, but you hope it will find a bottom. I don't know if you realize, I think last quarter, the quarter before, we made more money selling the paper than we did from advertising and like that's a huge line to cross.</p><p>IMUS: Well, and are you working on another book?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I'm thinking about something, Don. You know, sort of pushing ahead from the last book I did that used to be about just kind of the new phase of globalization where it's going, technology, how it's all merging, how it's affecting business, education, et cetera. It's germinating in my head, but I'm not quite there yet, but thinking about something on the Middle East, too.</p><p>IMUS: You're not kidding. That sounds hideous. You've got to come up with a better idea than that. Geez, are you kidding me? Nobody's going to read that.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: You want to write a book called \"The World Is Flat\" nobody's going to read that.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I'm thinking about something.</p><p>IMUS: That was a great book, though, the olive tree and that stuff, but this latest one. Have you just given up? Said the hell with it?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: No.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, let me ask you a couple of serious questions. Syria, what the hell is going on there?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Well, we don't have the conclusive proof, but you look at those pictures of those bodies, don, how they died, unmarked by any kind of wounds, you know, it's pretty clear the regime used some kind of chemical weapon and obviously Obama said that would be a red line. They already crossed it once. What he will do this time once it's conclusively proved, I don't know.</p><p>There's a big discussion at the White House yesterday, as you reported, that three hours where they debated what to do. One of the problems, the problem is this so let's say we launched a cruise missile attack in response to this to deter chemical weapons.</p><p>What targets to hit. Do you cause more refugee outflow from Syria and destabilize Jordan, for instance? So there's a lot of real-- so many moving parts with this, it's going to be a difficult one to sort out, but, you know, I'm glad they're considering something because once you start introducing those kind of weapons, you know, it's Katie bar the door.</p><p>IMUS: What would you recommend that we do?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: You know, I would be in favor of -- as I sit here right now, I'd be in favor of some kind of military response at that simply says we're not going to tolerate that. The world is not going to tolerate that.</p><p>IMUS: Would you want troops on the ground?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: No, no, I'm talking about some kind of aerial response. It's sort of something I'd be ready to consider. I want to see all the facts, they haven't all come out, some kind of response not just by us, but by the world, the allies, NATO that draws a red line there. I think it's something that it's really worth considering.</p><p>IMUS: Talking with Tom Friedman from the \"New York Times\" who probably has an e-mail address at the times in which you can contact him and here is what I'd like you to do, send him some ideas for a book. He hasn't got any. And every day I say to Connell, well, why should I care about Egypt? So, let me ask you, why should I?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: You know, there are a lot of reasons, Don. It's a country of 85 million people. It sits astride the Suez Canal. It's the partner with Israel in the Camp David peace treaty and has been traditionally the bedrock of the geopolitics there and the leader of the Arab world, as Egypt goes, so goes the Arab world.</p><p>You want the country to have a decent outcome of this revolutionary process. The problem in Egypt right now, Don, you've had two choices historically, that is either the army or the Muslim Brotherhood. In Egypt if you look at its history oscillated between those two for the last 60-odd years.</p><p>And the question, really, is can they-- can they find a third way, a way that's actually forward-looking, inclusive, progressive that doesn't just involve one of these narrow-minded options or the other? You know, one of the things that's been rattling around in my head, Don. Princess Di once said with Prince Charles there are three people in this marriage.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Historically we've looked at Egypt and saying there's two people in the marriage, the Muslim Brotherhood and the army. If that's the choice we'll go with the army, with Mubarak, but we talked about this in earlier conversation, I think there are three people in this story now, there's the military, the Muslim Brotherhood and Mother Nature.</p><p>And by that, I mean there is all of these incredible water, environmental population stresses that have built up over the last 60 years, precisely because of the incompetence of the military government and the Muslim Brotherhood in managing the problems and stresses, if they don't get the act together, find a third way that can sort of tilt Egypt forward to deal with some of these problems, Don, half the women in Egypt can't read.</p><p>After $30 billion in U.S. aid, over the last 30-odd years, half the women still can't read and these other social stresses I think are just going to blow the place apart.</p><p>IMUS: What in your view would be a decent outcome in Egypt?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I think a decent outcome would be a government that would -- where the military says to this government that they've appointed and they actually-- when they ousted the Muslim Brotherhood government they appointed a new president and he appointed a new cabinet. And you know some of these people and they're pretty decent people, if they would assign that government the task of writing a new constitution, one that would guarantee minority rights, that would be -- that would guarantee women's rights, that would be basically progressive leaning and take out some of the bad stuff the Muslim Brotherhood had in the constitution, and begin to organize an elective process gradually.</p><p>Giving time for not just the Muslim Brotherhood or Islamists as it were, but the liberal and progressive parties to get organize and contest that election, to put Egypt on that gradual transition path, not to just stop with the military government.</p><p>IMUS: Why did you decide to employ the Princess Di analogy?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I have no idea. It popped into my head there. There are three different parties in this story now.</p><p>IMUS: You're a weird dude, sometimes, so -- but you do sometimes in your columns it works well.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Have you gotten away this summer at all?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: A little bit. Just kind of on and off. I just turned 60, Don. So I'm going out to California next week.</p><p>IMUS: When was your birthday?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: July 20th.</p><p>IMUS: Well, happy birthday.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Thank you very much.</p><p>IMUS: You look pretty good for 60. I guess 60 is -- 60 is getting up there.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I'm trying to take care of myself. In this day and age, there are a few miles on these treads so I'm trying to take care of myself, and looking forward to getting away.</p><p>IMUS: In spite of what you think, the times is not long for this world so get a good idea for a book. Tom Friedman.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. It's time to check the markets now, the day after the Nasdaq flash free that halted trading for three hours. The U.S. futures are fairly flat this morning, but now point to go a higher open. Dow futures are up 3. The S&amp;P is up about 1. The Nasdaq is up 3.5.</p><p>Over in Europe, we got the second quarter reading on second quarter GDP in the U.K. and Germany, both rose 7/10 of a percent. London is now up about 37. Paris is down barely and Frankfurt is up 16.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" says that federal prosecutors are turning up the pressure in an insider trading case against a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital. The new indictment unsealed yesterday alleges that Matthew Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an Alzheimer's drug trial at the heart of the case.</p><p>Martoma is accused of using insider information about results of that drug trial, which then allowed SAC Capital to make $275 million in profits. He's due to go on trial in November. A hearing is set for this morning, SAC Capital has been charged with encouraging insider trader, but Steven Cohen, the hedge fund's founder has not been charged. Cohen and his firm deny any wrongdoing.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities now. We're watching oil and gold for you this morning. Those have been also fairly flat. Oil is now down up 13 cents. Gold is up 20. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.</p><p>IMUS: He looks like he is he doesn't have any energy, doesn't he? Here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, coming up on the radio, a fascinating, funny conversation with the great Terry Bradshaw.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p>IMUS: And before that, it's 9:20 Eastern Time on the Fox Business Network. The lying limey, Stuart Varney, so --</p><p>MCSHANE: We love Varney.</p><p>IMUS: I do like Varney a lot. So I don't know.</p><p>MCSHANE: What's wrong?</p><p>IMUS: Well, and the Godfather is going to be on to talk about -- I forget what he's going to talk about. What, Godfather.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good question.</p><p>IMUS: Down, Godfather.</p><p>BARTLETT: The gentleman --</p><p>IMUS: Can barely hear the Godfather, so the Godfather decided well, mail it in this morning. Did he have his mic off, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: I think his headphones were down and he couldn't hear.</p><p>BARTLETT: Turn it up.</p><p>MCSHANE: Now he's better. And solving yet another problem and working through a lot this morning.</p><p>IMUS: Got to project, Rob.</p><p>BARTLETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>MCSHANE: He couldn't hear.</p><p>IMUS: Also, you did a -- a lousy job on the last script. Why was that?</p><p>BARTLETT: I'm a little under the weather today. It affected my performance, I apologize.</p><p>IMUS: What's the matter with you?</p><p>BARTLETT: Got a little bit of a -- a touch of a bug, I think.</p><p>IMUS: Well, why didn't you tell me that instead of turning in a performance that sucks? Because we don't have to do it, you know?</p><p>BARTLETT: Just, I'm going to suck it up, I didn't --</p><p>IMUS: No, you didn't suck it up because you gave in like a finocchio.</p><p>MCSHANE: Finocchio.</p><p>IMUS: To your little sniffles.</p><p>BARTLETT: I have 135 fever.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: You gave in to your 135 degree fever and provided all of us with a weenie performance.</p><p>MCSHANE: Struggling, Rob, the last couple.</p><p>IMUS: It would be better if you said to me, Don, I don't feel great and I would say, fine. So every time you want off, I mean, you ever -- a problem getting off when you need it? Of course not, neither one of you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm  Diane Macedo.  We are taking a look at the markets this morning after  yesterday's flash freeze at the NASDAQ, it's been a fairly flat morning  today.  We currently got future is in the red, Dow futures are down about  15, we've got the S&amp;P down about one point, the NASDAQ is down about a  quarter of a point.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       Looking over at oil and gold, those are in the green this morning,  we've got oil up about $0.16 cents, gold is up almost $4.  Looking at Asia,  those markets finished today mixed and for all the details on how they got  there, let's go to business reporter Jacqueline Maddock in Beijing.  Hi,  Jacqueline.  </p><p/><p>  JACQUELINE MADDOCK, BUSINESS REPORTER:  Hi, Diane.  Yes.  It was a bit  of a mixed results here for Friday afternoon, here in the mainland and also  in Hong Kong.  Markets lost ground throughout the afternoon largely because  of some pretty disappointing corporate results particularly from Everbright  Security if you remember that, the brokerage firm responsible for last  Friday's fat-finger fiasco and it was the banks did the biggest falls  today, that whispers that the PBO is preparing to unleash the new  regulations on China's banking sector, China merchant banks down more than  three percent.  </p><p/><p>       But as you say, a different story in Japan, the Nikkei climbed Diane,  more than two percent, and every markets that day indeed in the green which  is a -- and that was as the yen moved up to the 99 point level accept the  Tepco, Diane.  Obviously Tepco, the Fukushima nuclear plant operator --  Tepco, fell another five percent at it looks that though as contamination  leak has -- some way to play out (INAUDIBLE).  Across to Australia though  there where markets climbed almost four percent still running high on  China's PMI numbers from yesterday, results of stocks love to see signs  that China's economy is getting back on track -- Diane.  </p><p/><p>       MACEDO:  All right.  Jacqueline Maddock from Beijing.  Thanks,  Jacqueline.  </p><p/><p>       And now, for a look at the European markets, let's go live to London  where Jan Lambregts, global head of financial markets research at Rabobank  is now joining us.  Jan, we saw some positive second quarter GDP reports  from the UK and Germany confirmed by the follow-up reading.  Any surprise  there, and why aren't markets having more reaction to that?  </p><p/><p>       It looks like we just lost Jan.  We will try to get him back in a  second but let's take a look at the European markets.  You can see London  up about 16, Parris is down about 12, Frankfurt up about three.  Again,  those positive GDP report possibly being mitigated by a little un-eased  there over the NASDAQ freeze.  But let's take a look at some of the  important economic news we'll be looking forward to and one of them is a  big meeting coming up, some of the most important economic figures in the  world are gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the Kansas City Fed's  annual conference but one difference is here, is that the biggest figure of  the mall, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke won't be attending due to a scheduling  conflict.  </p><p/><p>       The main focus of the conference will be the impact of the Fed's  unconventional policies both at home and abroad and FOX Business's Peter  Barnes is there.  He will have reports for us throughout the morning.  </p><p/><p>       And we've got Jan Lambregts back again, global head of financial  markets research at Rabobank.  Jan, I'm not sure if you heard my question  the first-time, but we're looking at these GDP reports from the UK and  Germany both coming in positive.  Any big surprise here? </p><p/><p>  JAN LAMBREGTS, RABOBANK FINANCIAL MARKETS RESEARCH:  Not really.  And  I don't think the markets really watching it too closely, second revisions,  it adds to the general trend that things are a little bit better in Europe  but still not great.  I think a lot of people in the market can be watching  more of these headlines coming out of Jackson Hole and thinking what that  would mean for, for tapering than watching these GDP figures.  </p><p/><p>       MACEDO:  Markets still seem a little tentative today.  You know, good  GDP information and yet, they're fairly flat.  Paris is even down.  Are  people tentative this morning over what happened at the NASDAQ yesterday?  </p><p/><p>  LAMBREGTS:  I don't think that is not necessarily overshadowing.  Like  I said, I think the more tentative reacting to positive GDP which is a  fairly old number, second quarters after all, more worried that had lines  later today as more news comes from Jackson Hole, actually shift  perceptions in how likely tapering is and how much tapering is we will see  in September.  </p><p/><p>       MACEDO:  All right.  It's all about stimulus, Jan Lambregts at  Rabobank.  We appreciate it.  Thanks.  </p><p/><p>       LAMBREGTS:  You're welcome.  </p><p/><p>       MACEDO:  And the Wall Street Journal says, federal prosecutors are  turning up the pressure in an insider-trading case against the former  portfolio manager at SAC Capital.  A new indictment unsealed yesterday  alleges that Matthew Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an  Alzheimer's drug trial at the heart of the case.  Martoma is accused of  using insider information about results of that drug trial to allow SAC  Capital to make $275 million in profits.  He is due to go on trial in  November and a hearing is set for this morning.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business giving you  the power to prosper.    </p><p/><p>  ANNOUNCER:  Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  So, Doug Chrispin (ph), he's a -- but he's a local rancher and  he's doing all kinds of stuff, he won the New Mexico, may it's a national  bow and arrow contest that I told you about Mike, from Texas, bans all  these -- here.  So he says to me, you know, it took awhile for Delbert  McClinton to catch on in Austin.  All right.  </p><p/><p>       I said, who's -- they found that of course.  So he says who is  better?  Name one person who is better in Austin than Delbert McClinton?   He said, there are lots of people.  I said what?  I didn't have my gun with  me, fortunately.  </p><p/><p>       CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Thank God.  Yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  He said Omar and the Howlers.  </p><p/><p>       (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>       BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER:  Oh, those guys.</p><p/><p>       WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER:  Oh, yes.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Omar and the Howlers?</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  I said, Omar and the Howlers? </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Sure.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  So, we were at the horse barn, up at the horse barn.  So, I  got in the truck and went back to the house and go to iTunes.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  And listened to Omar and the Howlers.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Uh-huh.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  And they suck.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Hey, Omar.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  I thought he was kidding.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  He said, Omar --  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  And then he is a big Joe Walsh fan.  You know?  I said, well,  have you seen that Eagles?  Didn't have any interest.  Do you like the  Eagles?  He said they are all right.  So when I first heard the Eagles,  sounded like a cross between the Beach Boys and the four perhaps.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Oh-oh!</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Well.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  You got to carry that gun at all times.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes, be ready.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  The only place I don't carry it is on the ranch for some  reason.</p><p/><p>       LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER:  Omar and the Howlers?</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Omar and the Howlers?  </p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  I'm probably the only person who knew that band that you  just mentioned.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Really?  </p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  Yes.  I played that band in college.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Oh, you did.</p><p/><p>       RUFINO: -- Back in school and they still together barely alive.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Well, they may not, he is going back years, so.  </p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  Omar and the Howlers.  </p><p/><p>       GUNZELMAN:  This guy is crazy.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  That is insane, didn't he? </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Lunacy.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Paul Begala is coming up this morning.  We no longer need him,  so.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  That's not right.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  One of my new best friends, one of them, is Bill Powers, the  president of U.T., the University of Texas.  So, I better not blow of  Begala just yet.  You know?  And Tom Friedman.  Hey, Warner?</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Who won those little league world series games? </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Tijuana beat Panama.  So, Tijuana, they will now play Tokyo  for the international championship and the Westport Washington State game  was rained out.  So, they will play today at 3:00.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Right.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  And the winner will play Chula Vista for the title on  Sunday.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  And the winner of that will play either Tijuana or Tokyo.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Probably.  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Which is it?  Tijuana or --  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Well, Tijuana beat Panama.  So, Tijuana will play Tokyo.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  That is what I just said.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  That's right.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  We got it, yes.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Yes.  We had some other stories too.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  What are they?</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Well, the umpire, they blew a call in the Yankee game which is  going to fit right in with next year's videotape replay.  They messed up a  caught ball and called it a trap and we have got Ryan Braun, what a phony,  man.  Instead of --  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Really?  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  You're kidding, Warner.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  He comes out --  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Hey, Tom, should we have a breaking news thing up on the FOX  News Channel, the business channel?  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  That's right.  This just in.  But the way he did it, he  apologize that he made a mistake, but it was issued in a statement.  I  mean, he didn't even have the, you know, guts to stand up and faced the  press.  Really weak.  And the other thing, you had two exhibition football  games last night.  And finally we are going to hear about Jeremy Lin, cut  out the whining.  Remember him?  Jeremy Lin.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Yes, of course.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Today is his birthday.  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Oh, it is?</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Yes.  He's 25 today.  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Well, maybe give him some slack.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Jay Mohr, of the funnier people on the planet is 43 today.   OK.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Happy Birthday.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  And Dagen McDowell is not here again.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  She's out again, yes.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Oh, man.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  So, I said, well, she said she can't put anything on her face.   How about a paper bag? </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes, she did.  You went there.  It wasn't funny.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  And there is something here we don't know.  I don't know what  it is.  But man, there is something here.  Hey, what happened to the NASDAQ  yesterday? </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes.  It was a mess with the computers, they don't know 100  percent what happened but they had to halt the number, all the stocks that  trade on it and the middle of the day, it went down for hours which is odd,  Wall Street has had a number of computer problems the last few years but  there is a report this morning, there may have been some connectivity  issues with another exchange so they continue their investigation.  No  panic.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  NASDAQ stocks.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes, no panic on the market though.  You know?  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  You want to get listed on the NASDAQ, you can't get on the big  one.  Right?</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  No.  That's Apple and all these big tech companies if  you're over on the NASDAQ, Google, Microsoft.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Oh, they are?</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Yes, so.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  I have been to see Cavuto yesterday, he looks great.  You  know, that?</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Sometimes he needs to take good care of himself as he should.   But man, he looks terrific.  He is really good.  You know who else is  pretty good is that Charles Payne guy.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Charles Payne, yes, absolutely, good guy.  Yep.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  No pain, no gain.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  That's right.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  What is coming up with you, Bernie? </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Sydney Leathers.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Oh God.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Yes.  Well, this is true.  She made a porn tape.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Oh, please.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK: .called Weiner and me but that is not where this stops.  She  very well may have exposed herself to HIV.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Oh, wow!</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Not amusing.  That is your hilarious Bernie briefing this  morning? </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  I was not presenting that as a joke.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  No punch-line there.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  That's a story.  You remember that kid that gave the  rousing speech at Georgia tech? </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Oh, yes.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Well, he may have ripped it off from somebody.  And he was  interviewed by your friend Neil Cavuto yesterday.  We have little piece of  that.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  OK.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Cavuto is -- all over him, just the -- it was great.  But  he may not be for real.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Rob Bartlett and Tony Powell are both here this morning.   They're both appearing places.  Rob is going to be at the Leavitt Theater  in Ogunquit, Maine.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Ogunquit.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Yes.  September 21st.  For tickets, go to Robshow.com.  And  Tony Powell, Powell to the People, he will be appearing at the Belmar  Theater on Saturday, September 28th.  That is coming up here pretty soon  and you can get tickets to that by either calling that theater there.  The  Belmar Theater, or go to NewYorkentertainmentclub.com.  I guess, he gets  stuff there.  It is 13 after the hour, let's do some news.  And here with  that is Connell McShane.  Good morning, Connell.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Hey, good morning, I-man.  The number of refugees created  by the Syrian civil war has not topped one million, a million refugees and  a U.N. agency adding to that says 740,000 of them are children under age  11.  So, some numbers, it all comes out as we are seeing new pictures of  what the rebels claim are another chemical weapons attack.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  And this is the fourteenth time that the central  regime uses chemical weapons against innocent civilians and each time we've  asked and we've said that the international community does not move this,  the regime will enlarge the scale that use these chemical weapons.  </p><p/><p>       (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  And the U.N. secretary-general did say today, these claims  of chemical weapons must be investigated immediately.  We also have reports  this morning coming in of Israeli airstrikes just south of Beirut said to  be a response to four rockets that were fired yesterday into Israel.  Back  here at home, you mention the problems on Wall Street yesterday, computer  problems at the NASDAQ, trading stocks listed there.  The Apples and the  Google of the world, a lot of big tech names were halted in the middle of  the day because of problems with the system that disseminates quotes.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  Is it going to affect the way that they look at  individual companies and want to invest in companies for 10, 15 or 20  years?  No.  It will just going to say that this game is not really being  played.  </p><p/><p>       (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Jonathan Kurpido (ph) works at the floor of the New York  Stock Exchange.  Now, to get more on that, this web site All Things D is  reporting this morning.  NASDAQ thinks the issue may be a problem with  connectivity at a rival exchange.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  What does that mean? </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  This another digital exchange, NYSCR by the way, the New  York Stock Exchange digital component that there may have been problems  with the two exchanges connecting with one another.  Apparently, according  to this report, and they are basically saying --  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Each other by the way.  But go ahead.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  You are right.  May say, more on this later on but I don't  know exactly what the --   </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  How do we know it wasn't deliberate? </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Sabotage.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Well, there all these rumors going around yesterday, and  it's where the NASDAQ was not really that transparent about it, didn't talk  about it during the day, it's hard to get all of them, there are no  comments and then the rumors, what if there was a cyber attack and all this  kind of thing.  That is what people were worried about.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Yes, the Russians.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  But no evidence of that at all and now they're saying that  could have been the exchanges, digital exchanges having trouble connecting  with each other but --   </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Everybody is lying.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Probably.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Don't you think?  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Well, the thing, you know, I thought there was sort of  reassuring about it is, that the markets, not like the market -- or crashed  yesterday on this when people, you know, wasn't that many jitters.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  The Dow was actually up.  The NASDAQ ended up.  So, you  know, got through it.  And they've been computer problems in the past.  The  last big one I guess was like three years ago.  Although, the NASDAQ had  big time issue about Facebook IPO.  You may remember.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes.  That was a mess.  But this, we will see.  The  investigation continues and we will get more on it later today, exactly  what happened, so.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Oh, yes, great.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Well, from Washington --  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Sixteen after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  Connell continues.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Well, you'll going to start hearing talk about a possible  government shutdown again.  I know you will be looking forward to that.   More than a third of House Republicans urging the Speaker John Boehner to  shut down the government rather than fund the president's health-care law.   They sent him a letter on that 80 Republicans yesterday.  </p><p/><p>       And then we have this U.S. soldier who killed 16 civilians in  Afghanistan last year, he apologized yesterday for the first time for what  he called his act of cowardice.  The Staff Sergeant Robert Bales is in the  middle of a sentencing hearing.  Here is Marc Edwards, he's a friend of his  who used to play in the NFL, this guy Marc Edwards, he spoke with  reporters.  </p><p/><p>       (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       MARC EDWARDS, FORMER NFL PLAYER:  The person I knew a long time ago  has changed quite a bit, the experience that he's had over there.  I am not  in a position to understand.  None of us are.  </p><p/><p>       (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  None of us are, he says.  Well, the sentencing hearing will  continue there.  And there's no --  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Why are you repeating what the people are saying?  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  I just thought it was a little fuzzy.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Sounds like Conan O'Brien.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program sponsored by  Hackensack University Medical Center, a place where medicine meets  innovation.  What were you saying now?  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Well, no verdict for the Fort Hood shooter.  That continues  deliberations yesterday.  And the final thing in the news is Bradley  Manning who we talked about a lot in the show yesterday.  He says, he felt  that he has been a female since childhood and he wants people to refer to  him as Chelsea.  So, this is the convicted Wiki leaker so to speak.  Back  in forth, Leavenworth begin serving 35 years in a military prison.  </p><p/><p>       Now, a military spokesman said, if Bradley wants to change his name  to Chelsea, a name change would have to be approved in court, then a  petition submitted to the army to make it official.  So, that's where we  are on all that.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  The Godfather will have some thoughts on Bradley Manning and  his wishes coming up here in just a little bit.  This moment is also  sponsored by the Hackensack University Medical Center, a place where  medicine meets innovation, the home of the Deirdre Imus environmental  health center.  So, well, any business news?  Business news incidentally  Connell.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Is presented by this clown over here at the -- well, he is not  a clown, that is unfortunate, Don.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Clown?</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Dr. Gill Leatherman.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Oh!</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Hit the cancer. </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Hit the cancer, baby.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Hit the cancer.  Shut-up.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes, it's OK.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  This radio search deal, he has got going.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  You can call Dr. Gill Leatherman at 212-scam -- no, not scam.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  No, no, that's not the word.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  That's unfortunate.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  No.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  212-choices.  What is going on in business news other than the  tedious NASDAQ deal? </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Well, that's the big I guess story up.  I'll give you an  update on the markets on where we are.  The Dow futures are down a little  bit this morning.  But the Dow was up yesterday, actually the first time it  was up in seven sessions.  Got lost a little bit in that NASDAQ story.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  I'll be darn.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE: .of 66 to 14,963.  So, not much of an effect in terms of the  markets going up and down from that NASDAQ mess, the traders able to shake  it off.  Commerce Department today releasing some numbers on new home sales  on housing numbers, Dow futures are down this morning by 18 points ahead to  all that.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Is that it? </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Well, I mean, yes, there's --   </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  OK.  Can't just stop talking.  I thought you had a stroke.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  I thought --  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Well, no.  But just stop talking.  What's the matter with you?  </p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  He stopped.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Well, I know he stopped but I mean, back to you, I-man,  anything.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  That will be the way --  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  No, no, no.</p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  Connell do it every time.  </p><p/><p>       (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p/><p>       I am Connell McShane.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Almost 20 minutes past.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Omar and the Howlers.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Back to you, I-man.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Doug Crispin's big band is the Beatles I guess to him.  I  guess they are out of AustinTexas, they're coming up here, he told me they  were better than Delbert McClinton.  I mean, you -- that is insanity, isn't  it?  Never heard anything like that. </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Never.</p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  I can't believe my ears.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  There is nobody better than Delbert McClinton.

Good morning, Warner.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Good morning, I-man.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Yankees beat the Jays five-three, they sweep the series make  it ten of 12, they cut the race for the last wild card team, the three-and- a-half, blown call by the umpire in the bottom of the fifth gave the  Yankees the lead for good.  Bases loaded, one-out, Michael Kay, Yes  Network.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       MICHAEL KAY, YES NETWORK:  (INAUDIBLE) To the second and it is a  double play.  He's tagging everybody but it is a double play to end the  inning.  Did he kick the catch?  Now, they're saying that he didn't make  the catch.  </p><p/><p>       (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Well, if you watch your FOX Business, you can see that he did  indeed make the catch.  So instead of a double play to end the inning,  Wells is given an RBI and the Yankees take the lead.  Well, that is one of  the things they will correct next year with video tape replay.  Dodgers  beat the Marlins six-nothing.  Clayton Kershaw on the shut out, he's earned  run average is now 1.72.  And Brian Wilson pitched for the first time in a  year and a half in the ninth inning, he struck out two batters and Wilson  has been offered $1 million to shave his beard by 800razors.com.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  He looks scary like that, man.  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Pirates and Cardinals win, Pirates by one.  Ryan Braun --  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Maybe could have fought ahead with this and had a photograph  of him that we could have put up.  I guess not.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  He makes the duck dynasty guys look like Park Avenue  socialites.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  He really does.  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  What we did have him after the game, Brian Wilson with this  brief comment.    </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Oh, no.  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Ryan Braun has issued a statement through the Brewers.  They  talked about a guy, he say, he said he was sorry he took the PEDs during  the --  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  You and Doug are going down.  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Two-11 MVP year.  You know, what?  Braun ought to give back  the MVP trophy and give it to Matt Kemp.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  That is enough sports.  I am bored now.  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  OK.  How come, I don't know about a Thursday night football  game?  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Thursday football.  I've got it.  Lions beat the Patriots 40  to nine.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  How come there wasn't any.  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  There were two.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  They were?</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Why you didn't tell me about this?  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Well, because you said that was the end of this --   </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Well, no, but the Lions beat the Patriots -- what? </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Forty to nine.  Patriots turned the ball over three of the  first four possessions.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Tebow play?</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Tebow did not play.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Oh, God!</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Not a good sign.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  He got to bail out Hernandez.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Twenty three after the hour.  What is coming up in the  briefing, Bernie? </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Well, Sydney Leathers may have HIV and we have that kid who  may be a fraud and Ben Affleck, as Batman.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  OK.  That is all.  This would be Omar and the Howlers.  Doug  Crispin, told me with a straight face why you thought this loser was better  than Delbert McClinton.  I mean, how do you even say that with the --    </p><p/><p>       (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p/><p>       ANNOUNCER:  IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Are you kidding me?

I do not have to suck up anymore.  </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  The hell with him.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: We will get him on when we feel like it.  </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Sydney Leathers, she recently , she was in an adult video.  It  was called Winter and Me.  She had sex with this guy.  This guy tested  positive for HIV.  Sydney Leathers and the dude tested negative before and  after.  HIV negative test results within three months of exposure could be  false.  It will take a couple of months for Ms. Leathers to find out  whether or not she is infected.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: We already know that she is infected.  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  She needs to be fumigated, without a doubt.  </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  The kid at Georgia tech welcoming incoming freshman.

It turns out that this gets high school speech coach, he  actually gave a speech just like that.  Almost identical.  This is the guy,  his speech.  </p><p/><p> You can do that.  That is a lie, you can do that.  I am doing that.  </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  There you go.  We have all been had.  We will see if Neil Cavuto  ensues this date.  </p><p/><p> John Oliver was talking about legalizing marijuana.  </p><p/><p> On that note, if you want this to be taken seriously, how about dancing up  the names a little bit.

I am Diane Macedo.  Peter Barnes has a  preview.  </p><p/><p> BARNES:  Let's just call it taper talk in Jackson Hole.  Gathering to hear  the latest research on the economy and on monetary policy.  The real action  takes place on the sidelines.  Participants can talk to each other one on  one and share information.  The big question here is when the Fed could  start to wind down, to dial back.  The handicapping is that the Fed could  start small at its next policy meeting in September.  </p><p/><p> The big elephant not in the room is Fed Chairman Bernanke.  He is skipping  the conference for the first time since he became Fed chairman in 2005.  He  says he has a scheduling conflict.  A lot of folks are looking and talking  about who may succeed bernanke as the chairman.  Janet Yellen is here and  will monitor a panel on Saturday on her leading rival in the contest.   Larry Summers is not attending.  Back to you.  </p><p/><p> MACEDO:  Thank you.  Dow futures are down 17.  The S&amp;P is down about one.  </p><p/><p> Imus in the Morning continues right now on Fox business.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: Please welcome to the program our old friend, Paul Begala.  </p><p/><p> BEGALA:  Good morning.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: I was going to apologize for having you on late.  </p><p/><p> BEGALA:  It was great.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: I no longer need you.  [laughter] </p><p/><p> BEGALA:  You got a better and?  </p><p/><p> IMUS: Take a guess.  </p><p/><p> BEGALA:  The president of the university, he is a terrific guy.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: Well, I am his new best friend.  </p><p/><p> BEGALA:  He has done a great job at the university.  Rick Perry has been  trying to run him out of that job.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: I got a nice letter from him.  </p><p/><p> BEGALA:  He was a legendary psychology professor.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: How much time do you spend there?  </p><p/><p> BEGALA:  A fair amount.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  I love Omar.  Where did you see them?  </p><p/><p> BEGALA:  I have not seen them and I will not see them.  Doug christine,  that is just kind of a sideline.  He is one of the more interesting people  I have ever met in my life.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  I like Omar a lot.  I hate to side with you on anything, but I think  you are right.  [laughter] </p><p/><p> IMUS: All right.  Carolyn Wonderland, ever met her?  she is wonderful.  </p><p/><p> She came up to our nations capital.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: Carolyn Wonderland plays the guitar and that girl can sing the blues.   She is the real deal.  If you were still advising presidents, what would  you advise them to do?  </p><p/><p> BEGALA:  I would advise caution.  Measure twice and cut once.  This country  suffered previously by rushing into a war where we had no business  fighting.  We had no threat against our country.  What are the threats to  America's interest?  also to our credibility.  Superpowers never bluff.  It  is a very difficult situation.  The chances of it getting worse because of  our intervention is very great.  Made me the chairman of the caucus.  I  have been to walter reed.  I would be real careful.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: Video of these kids dying.  That is pretty tough to take.  I agree  with you.  </p><p/><p> We may have to act.  We can take out the Air Force.  We can take out the  sources of the weaponry.  He makes a pretty powerful case.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: Hillary Clinton going to be the next president?  </p><p/><p> God, I hope so.  I would have to be the cochairman.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: I have to admit, I kind of like her.  </p><p/><p> She is strong.  She is smart.  She did a great job as secretary of state.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: Back up a second.  What did she do there that was so great?  </p><p/><p> She helped and the war.  That is a pretty important thing.  She tried hard  to set the reset button.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: This is sad.  We will have to put up with for years of it.  Eleven  minutes till the hour.  </p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.  I am Diane Macedo.  Time to check the  markets.  Asian markets ended the day split.  The Nikkei ended up.  And  Europe, we got the second reading on second-quarter gdp.  Both gross.   London is up 13.  Here in the U.S., the futures are down.  </p><p/><p> We will also get a new reading on the housing market this morning.  New  home sales are expected to fall 1.5 percent from june.  That would be a  disappointing reading.  The mood of the housing market does appear to be  improving.  Homebuilder confidence jumped to the highest level last week.   Here is a look at commodities now.  We are watching oil and gold for you.  </p><p/><p> Imus in the Morning continues right now on Fox Business.  </p><p/><p> IMUS: Coming up, the Godfather.  Apparently, One Direction is the boy band,  kind of, on the today show doing something.  Power to the people.  Some of  them have been out there all night long.  Five minutes until the hour.  </p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> IMUS: Welcome to the Imus in the Morning program.  </p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Hey, hey, hey.  Maybe I am  going deaf, maybe I am going crazy, but that new Robin Thicke song sounds  like Marvin Gaye.  That boy have to give it up.  He is just joining an old  standing tradition of rock and roll riff off jobs.  Jesus, he is so fine.   Vanilla Ice stole, but only because he knew he could take that dude in a  fist fight.  He is suing Marvin Gaye's family to prevent them from suing  him.  They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and I  wholeheartedly agree.  Sometimes, it is a crime when people just cannot do  their own thing.  You hear me, Lady Gaga?  You Madonna wannabes.   [laughter] </p><p/><p> IMUS: That is not funny.  </p><p/><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>  DON IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program on the Fox Business Network.  And now here is Diane Macedo.  </p><p/><p>  DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning everyone.  Yesterday's  flash freeze at the NASDAQ has been traced to a connectivity issue.   According to All Things Digital sources say officials at NASDAQ OMX Group  which owns the exchange are pointing to a connectivity problem with NYSE  Arca as the trigger for that three-hour trading halt.  A NYSE spokesman  declined to comment but NASDAQ officials did acknowledge that connectivity  issue they just wouldn't say who the exchange participant was.  </p><p/><p>  Now the trouble started at about 12:15 p.m. Eastern when NASDAQ said  it was halting trading in NASDAQ listed stocks.  Sources say it took the  exchange another half hour to determine it had fixed the problem.  But the  reopening process which required regulatory approval and testing took more  than two hours.  All Things D says NASDAQ executives expect the normal  start to trading this morning.  </p><p/><p>  Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., futures have been fairly  flat, but to the downside this morning Dow futures are down 16, the S&amp;P is  down one point, the NASDAQ is down just a fraction of a point.  </p><p/><p>  And for a recap on the Asian markets now, let's go to business  reporter Jacqueline Maddock in Beijing.  Hi, Jacqueline.  </p><p/><p>  JACQUELINE MADDOCK, BUSINESS REPORTER:  Well Diane it was certainly a  mixed bag for the end of the week.  Mainland markets and also Hong Kong  (inaudible) around steadily throughout the afternoon as disappointing  corporate earnings results rolled out particularly, from Ever Bright  Securities.  That of course is the brokerage firm that made all the  headlines responsible in fact for last Friday's fat finger fiasco.</p><p/><p>  But we also saw banking stocks do some pretty serious polls.  And that  was because there are plenty of whisper and lots of speculation here that  the People's Bank of China is preparing to unleash some new regulations on  Chinese lenders.</p><p/><p>  A different story though across in Japan the Nikkei managed to put on  more than two percent that's because the yen strengthened.  And in fact all  markets sectors Diane are the very end in the green.  </p><p/><p>  And finally to Australia.  Australia is still riding high on that  Thursday's PMI data out in China.  (inaudible) stocks could very well  there.  And the Australian market putting on almost one percent on the hope  that China is getting back on track -- Diane.  </p><p/><p>  MACEDO:  All right that's business reporter Jacqueline Maddock in  Beijing.  </p><p/><p>  And now we're getting earnings in from Foot Locker.  The company is  reporting an adjusted profit of 46 cents a share.  Almost -- almost  matching the estimate there analyst were expecting 47 cents.  Revenue came  in at $1.45 billion.  That was right in line with expectations.  </p><p/><p>  For more on the European markets now, let's go to London where Jan  Randolph director of Sovereign Risk at IHS Global Insight is standing by.   Jan, the U.K. came out on -- out of recession and now the second reading of  GDP has been revised even higher.  How optimistic should investors be about  this?  </p><p/><p>  JAN RANDOLPH, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT:  Well I think so particularly if you  put it into context with Germany, which also showed good -- good revised  figures.  The recovery in the U.K. is more broad-based now.  It includes  construction as well the old traditional consumptions.  And that's good  news and exports were up, particularly to Europe and Germany.  So combined,  it looks like a better picture all around both the U.K. and from northern  Europe.  </p><p/><p>  MACEDO:  And Jan our last guest said the traders are being kind of  cautious ahead of the Jackson Hole Conference.  What is it that they want  to hear?  </p><p/><p>  RANDOLPH:  Well actually, the important people are not there.  And  that's Ben Bernanke and Mario Draghi.  I mean they are the ones that are  ultimately going to stir policy going forward.  But yes, I mean there have  been some interesting comments.  Nowotny, for example, the Austrian member  of the ECB said, \"The improving news from Europe means that there will no  longer be a cuff and interest rates in Europe\".  There seems to be no  argument for that.  </p><p/><p>  So I think Jackson Hole, yes it is -- it's a bit more of a sideshow I  think this year compared to previous years.  </p><p/><p>  MACEDO:  All right Jan Randolph at IHS Global Insight thanks Jan.  </p><p/><p>  And the \"Wall Street Journal\" says federal prosecutors are turning up  the pressure in an insider trading case against a former portfolio manager  at SAC Capital.  A new indictment unsealed yesterday alleges that Mathew  Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an Alzheimer's drug trial at  the heart of the case.  Martoma is accused of using inside information  about the results of that drug trial to allow SAC Capital to make $275  million in profit.  He is due to go on trial in November and a hearing is  set for this morning.</p><p/><p>  SAC Capital has been charged with encouraging insider trading but  Steven Cohen the hedge fund's founder has not been charged.  Cohen and his  firm have denied any wrongdoing.  </p><p/><p>  Here is a look at commodities now.  We have been watching oil and gold  for you this morning.  We've got green arrows there.  Oil is up eight cents  it's trading around $105 a barrel.  Gold is up a little more than $3 at  $1,374 an ounce.  </p><p/><p>  Now here is the I-Man on Fox Business giving you the power to prosper.  </p><p/><p>  CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Ladies and gentlemen.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>  MCCORD:  IMUS IN THE MORNING.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  You know once in a while, I have my iPod Touch with me.  I will  check my e-mails I mean sometimes during the show not always but -- so I  was going to talk about something else but I'm going to talk about this  briefly.</p><p/><p>  You know we've been talking about Roxanne Roundtree.  And \"Roxy's  Recipe\" her book you can go to Imus.com and right there on the homepage,  you can click on the video and watch the video of Roxanne Roundtree that  Patrick Gottsch at RFD did and it's -- it change their live.  So if you  still need cook books and well you still to be buying the cookbooks.   Although Esther Newberg or she got a couple of the New York publishers  she's going to fighting over it, it's time to get to published it.  </p><p/><p>  But I've got -- I got -- this woman is confined she has the Lou  Gehrig's disease and is confined to a wheelchair and communicates by  blinking her eyes.  She has a three great sons and her husband's a saint,  Don.  And I just got an e-mail from him, a long e-mail -- too long to read.   But as -- I don't know how to describe it, actually.  It is wonderfully  well-written.  Let's start there.</p><p/><p>  But he fell in love with Roxanne who is 34 or 35 now.  She -- she came  down with Lou Gehrig's Disease of five, six or four, five years ago.  But  Don fell in love with her in the first grade.  And then talked about, in  this e-mail, about how long it took to persuade her to marry him.  And of  course, she couldn't have married a better person on the planet than this  guy.  Man I mean so -- so that's what I was doing well storming Norman who  is yakking about whatever they were doing.  Anyway -- </p><p/><p>  CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I got to help these people.  Come on man.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  It's such a good story.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  And really is just -- </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  It's unbelievable.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  It really is.  All right seven minutes after the hour.  Hey  Warner, who's -- who's the best football team in the pros?  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  I would you know barring any more injury I would go with the  Broncos.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Really?  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Yes.  The addition of Wes Welker makes them strong.  They have  a good running game.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  He hurt himself the other day didn't he?  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Yes he did.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Is he all right now?  Or -- </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Hopefully he'll open the season.  But they already had a good  passing game.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Sure.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  And they lost at -- on that fluke play.  Do you remember the  Baltimore in the playoff?  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  So I would think on paper -- </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  They threw that interception.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Well that's true in the second overtime yes.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  You know when you -- when you pick one out of 32 teams before  the season.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  It's really part luck because of the injury factor like no  other sports so.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  How about the Giants going to be -- we heard this -- </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Well you know they finished nine and seven but they lost their  last two games of the year by a combined score 67-1.  And they lost Amad  Bradshaw (ph) they are leading Rusher (ph) and now they have two offensive  linemen two out of the five offensive lineman don't look like they'll start  the season.  So I -- I would say, at best, nine and seven again maybe  worst.  They don't -- I don't see a running game.  They said oh Wilson and  -- </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Ok fine.  Jet's a joke.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  On Jets eight-eight at best.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes at best yes.  And its fat coach he'll be gone, but he's not  fat anymore.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  No he's not but that might not help him.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  He'll be sucking toes someplace else so.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Right.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Anybody else any good?  Are the -- well the Patriots got to be  pretty good right?  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Sure always good.  Again except the year that Brady got hurt at  the start of the season.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  How is Alec Smith is he any good?  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  He is but not with this cast, not with Kansas City.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Right.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  No and it's too bad because you know he was playing great for  the 49ers.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I know.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  When Kaepernick -- </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Kaepernick came in yes.  How about -- what else -- how about  Seattle?  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Well, yes, Russell Wilson I mean he turned them around.  They  are very good sure.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Speaking of Kaepernick how about the 49ers?  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  49ers are strong yes.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Any other strong teams?  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  I think you have named the best strong teams.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Sure.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  But again, you know that's what's great about the National  Football League.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  You only have 16 games it's not like baseball you know.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  What happened in this Little League World Series situation?  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Well you had Taiwan eliminating Panama.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  So Taiwan -- Tijuana, excuse me, not Taiwan.  Tijuana will now  play Tokyo for the international title.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  And the West Port Washington State game was rained out so  they'll play today.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  We got to bet full for West Port and Tijuana.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Ok it's all right yes.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Ok.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Tijuana, what 23 miles from San Diego and as you pointed out  even closer to -- Tiu Lavista (ph).  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I used to go to Tijuana when I was in the Marine Corps  stationed at Camp Pendleton.  </p><p/><p>  LOU RUFINO, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  For what?  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes exactly for what?  </p><p/><p>  ROB BARTLETT, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  The art.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I think is -- well I forget this was 1957 so -- </p><p/><p>  BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  We'll be love you time Mr. --  Private Imus.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Eleven minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  Well a lot of good stuff coming up.  That dingbat, Liz Claman -- </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Oh, Oh no, no.  Oh no, no.  You knew what we are, you knew,  what is what ding bat; we are in for it here.  Let's just restart that  sentence please.  </p><p/><p>  RUFINO:  I hate it.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Oh man she's a wacko.  But she's going to interview the guy who  runs the NASDAQ.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Bob Greifeld.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  And that's coming and I wasn't -- we weren't going to carry it  on the radio because I don't care about it.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Right.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  But they want to carry it on the television.  And that's your  job and that's my job to make sure they do.  That it gets done which I'm  delighted to do.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Of course.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  But now I've decided we're going to carry it on the radio as  well.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Oh ok.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  And we will carry it for as long as we can stand it.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Got it.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  And it's just drones on, then we'll bail.  So -- I mean that's  coming up the next hour.  The Godfather is here, of course.  </p><p/><p>  BARTLETT:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  And he'll be discussing some stuff this hour and particularly  the Bradley Manning situation.  And then Powell to the People Tony is out  in the street.  Big Foot do we have any of that?  </p><p/><p>  TOM BOWMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  We're going to have some  momentarily.  But he was out because of the One Direction concert on the  \"Today\" show.  They're expecting like 15,000 people, mostly kids.  Some of  them have been waiting since Tuesday to get a front row.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I like that.  I like somebody who would stand (inaudible).  I  wonder if Doug Christie thinks One Direction is better than Delbert.</p><p/><p>  Anyway.  Thirteen minutes past the hour.  Let's do some news.  And  here with that is Connell McShane.  Good morning Connell.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Hey good morning I-Man.</p><p/><p>  These wildfires are really a big issue out west.  And the one that's  burning outside of Yosemite National Park nearly has quadruples now inside,  in size.  So officials are going door to door -- they're urging people to  get out.  But the evacuations are not mandatory.  So you have some people  like this that are hanging in there.</p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you sticking here.  </p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh yes.  Absolutely.  I will stay in place,  protect what I can as long as I can.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  As long, yes, they stayed there.  A lot of times this  happens.  This fire is only about one percent contained though they're  saying at this point.</p><p/><p>  We have new comments coming in this morning from President Obama on  Syria.  CNN had him on just about an hour ago saying allegations of  chemical weapons used in Syria is according to the President's quote, a big  even.  And then they asked him about his redline comments that he'd made  about the use of those types of weapons.  And the president said the latest  event in Syria is something the U.S. has to look at.  So that's how he  phrased it.</p><p/><p>  Well, we'll see where we go from there but speaking of Syria two UN  agencies say the rising number of children who are turning into refugees  over there resulted in greater threats.</p><p/><p>  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have recorded a million refugees, children  that are found and now in camp settings with host communities and in very  challenging environments.</p><p/><p>  (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Nearly three quarters of all of these refugees under the age  of 11.  You have 1 million refugees as you heard in all.  Nearly three  quarters under 11.  </p><p/><p>  In Egypt today, security and military forces are deployed around the  city of Cairo.  They've closed off traffic in some of the major roadways.   This comes ahead of protests by the supporters of the former President  Mohamed Morsi and these rallies today kind of a test for the Morsi  supporters.  See if they can keep the pressure up despite the crack down  that we've seen here on the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p/><p>  We mentioned President Obama on CNN; later today he visits  Pennsylvania for the first time in more than a year bringing in this plan.   He's been out on the road promoting for college affordability to Scranton.   Joe Biden's hometown -- Scranton Pennsylvania -- Lakawana College (ph)  she'll be later on in the day.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  All right.  Coming up on 15 minutes after the hour.  Dagen  McDowell is not here today because, well, what did she tell you, Connell?  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Well, she hit her head on a cabinet the other day and had  wounds so, you know.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  On her face apparently -- not just her head or something.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Right.  Some kind of a wound on her face.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Did you ever get any more information?  Did you every talk to  her, Carley?  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Hold on one second.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  What happened to Carley?</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  There she is.</p><p/><p>  CARLEY SHIMKUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  I'm right here, hi.  I spoke to  with her, but I did not ask any questions.  I want to get the real story  when she comes in first thing on Monday.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Wait a minute.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Well, when you spoke to her what was the conversation about  then.</p><p/><p>  SHIMKUS:  I just asked her if she needed anything.  If she was in  Manhattan, I'd go over and see her.  She said she is fine, but she needs to  heal up a little bit more.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Ok, good.</p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  That's a good friend you are.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  So something is not -- we are not getting the story here.  </p><p/><p>  SHIMKUS:  I mean it is Friday.  Something is fishy.  Let's be honest.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  What?</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Come on Carley.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  What did you say Carley?</p><p/><p>  SHIMKUS:  I said it's Friday.  Something's fishy.  Let's be honest.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  SHIMKUS:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  All right.  Time for a little sports now and sports is  sponsored by Peerless Boilers.  Hey Warner -- </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Patrick Gottsch, you know, did you ever meet him?  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Yes.  Sure at your golf tournament, yes.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Sure.  So he calls me yesterday or texted me.  He says we are  having a big announcement on Rural Radio which is on Sirius XM.  Could you  listen and I was with the kids and I could not.  He said well, we're going  to have it on TV.</p><p/><p>  Here is what they are going to do.  They will have a one day two  million dollar rodeo at Cowboys Stadium.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  No kidding.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  No.  So I do not know the details of that yet but it is not  until March 2.  But it's going to be $2 million in prize money which should  be the richest rodeo ever held.  And they've invited all of the -- I guess  the ten best cowboys in all events.  Everybody from saddle block riding to  (inaudible) to calf roping team.</p><p/><p>  Then, anybody else can enter, I think.  A limited number of them or  just what they call qualifiers and that would be guys who no longer  compete.  Like Joe Beaver could come back and calf-rope if he put on knee  brace and other people could as well.</p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Cody Ohl.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Cody Ohl is still -- he's still going to the national finals.   He will go again this year.  He is still out winning beau coup money.  He's  in the top 15 in the world now.  So that is a huge deal at Cowboys Stadium.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Maybe Jerry Jones will be there.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes, Warner.</p><p/><p>  Anyway, it is time for sports.  Sports sponsored by Peerless Boilers.   Did I say that.</p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Anyway, here's the great Warner Wolf.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Thank you.  Good morning I-Man.</p><p/><p>  Yankees beat the Jays 5-3, they sweep the series.  They've won 10 of  12.  They cut the race for that second wild card spot to 3.5 games.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  By the way, every time Patrick e-mails me and asked me to watch  something or listen to something, I then critique it.  He does not ask me  to do that.  He doesn't say be sure and e-mail me or text me and tell me  what you think of my people who are announcing on the radio or on RFD.  The  announcer that he had on RFD was so annoying and irritating.  I cannot  think of the guy's name.  Some dope.</p><p/><p>       Randy Bernard -- he used to be the PBR and the Hyundai car deal and  he's a great guy.  He has terrific ideas.  And this whole rodeo thing is  his idea.  I don't know.  It's just -- I watched him for a few minutes and  it irritated me.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  That is so unlike you.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I did hear Joe Beaver call in.  He said he's in day 13 of a 15- day clinic.  That is odd, he just left here eight days ago.  That must be  the new math or something.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Two a day.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Yes, maybe two a day or something.</p><p/><p>       Anyway, what were you saying now.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Well, Yanks got a big break when the umps blew a call in the  last of the fifth inning, if you want to see it on Fox Business -- </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Sure.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  It was called by Buck Martinez of CTV sports network.</p><p/><p>       (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  BUCK MARTINEZ, CTV SPORTS:  -- goes after the first pitch.  Davis --  no catch -- they sit on the tracks and now they have two runners at second.   They tag and try to tag out each.  So now, we have all sorts of confusion.  </p><p/><p>  (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Well if you look at it again, you'll see that catch is made.   Instead of an inning ending double play, it was incorrectly ruled an RBI  for Wells.  The Yanks took the lead and never trailed.  This is exactly one  of the instances that videotape replay will be used next year.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Yes.  No justice, no peace.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Pirates and Cards win.  Pirates still by one.</p><p/><p>       And Dodgers Clay Kershaw, eighth inning, shut out the Marlins.  He  lowers his earned run average to 1.72.  Man, that's Gibson, Kofax,  (inaudible) numbers.  And in their playoff drive, the Mets have just signed  former Red Sox right-hander, Daisuke Matsuzaka -- </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  All right.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  -- who has never been the same since his big 2008 season when  he went 18 and 3.  In fact, he'll pitch tonight.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Did you say the Mets playoff drive?  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Yes, I did.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Of course.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  I just wanted to make sure I was hearing properly.</p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Of course, come on.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  There's still time.</p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  That's hurtful, Warner.</p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  That's not funny.</p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Not at all.  Exhibition football, the Lions beat the Patriots  40-9.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  What?</p><p/><p>  WOLF:  The Patriots turned the ball over three of the first four  possessions.  </p><p/><p>  Here was Patriots coach Bill Belichick.</p><p/><p>  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  BILL BELICHICK, COACH NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS:  When you turn the ball  over four times in the first quarter, that will knock you out of most any  game.  </p><p/><p>  (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  WOLF:  That's right.  Again, you know, Reggie Bush is the new running  back for the Lions.  One yard in six carries.  He did catch five passes,  103 yards.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Must have had the Kardashian girl he used to be married to on  his back.</p><p/><p>  Twenty-one after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING -- what's  coming up in the briefing, Bernie?</p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  President Obama, he pulled a boner in front of a bunch of  college kids if I may employ some old school vernacular.  And comedian  Louis C.K., he finds a dead body in the river.  We have the audio -- </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  What?  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Yes.  Yes, indeed.  True story boss, true story.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  And the Godfather's coming up and Powell to the people is  coming up as well.  Well, I hope Doug Christine has got his TV on or his  radio.</p><p/><p>  You're telling me that Omar (inaudible).  Delbert McClinton.  Have you  lost your mind?</p><p/><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p/><p>  MACEDO:  Good morning everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo. </p><p/><p>  And we will get a new reading on the housing market this morning.  New  home sales for July are expected to fall 1.5 percent from June to 490,000.   That would be disappointing reading after existing home sales for last  month jumped 6.5 percent to their highest level in four years. </p><p/><p>  The mood of the housing market though does seem to be improving.  Home  builder confidence jumped last week to its highest level in eight years  despite rising interest rates.</p><p/><p>Moody's investors service is putting the 6 U.S. Banks on review to  weather the possibility of reducing support if they run into financial  trouble.  Of those banks, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and  Wells Fargo are under review with downgrade implications while Bank of  America and Citigroup are being evaluated as direction uncertain.</p><p/><p>Moody's also says it may downgrade bonds at Wells Fargo, Morgan  Stanley, B of A, and Citigroup though Bank of America and Citigroup bonds  could also be upgraded because their operations are improving.  Ratings  downgrades can increase a bank's borrowing costs and force it to close more  collateral and derivative trades weighing on its profitability and draining  its cash. </p><p/><p>  IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business giving you the  power to prosper.</p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Diane, what the hell are doing, Diane?  Are you spraying your  hair?</p><p/><p>  MACEDO:  I was putting it in place for you.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Oh my goodness.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Your hair looks great Diane.</p><p/><p>  MACEDO:  Thank you.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  You already have a guy who is going to marry you so you can get  fat now.  What do you care?</p><p/><p>  Anyway back to Lupi.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Good focus.</p><p/><p>  MIKE LUPICA:  You just really like talking.  You're a crazy person.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Well, I am sitting here watching the monitor and Diane is  spraying her hair.  </p><p/><p>  LUPICA:  Don't look at the monitor.  Don't look in the monitor --  focus on what you are doing.   </p><p/><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  28 after the hour.  We have (inaudible) coming up.  So is Tony  Powell, Powell to the people.  The business report, did you do it Connell?  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  I don't think I did specific business report.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  You don't have to now.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes, the Nasdaq thing -- </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Sponsored by Ativia for natural pain relief.  Go ativia.com and  send those Vicodin out here to the I-Man.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  That's the style.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Although I'm leaving here to go to Texas in a few days and then  about a week.  The last group of kids and then I will be at the Joe Beaver  junior superstar roping in Steubenville, Texas over Labor Day.  And then I  will be in Huntsville.  Then I'll be at Wyatt's first high school rodeo  September 8th and then on September 9, I'll be back in the studio at Fox.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Pretty good, pretty good.</p><p/><p>  I should point out on Labor Day that's when that special on the Imus  Ranch on Fox Business Network will premiere.  And (inaudible) and editor  John here doing a great job on.  I saw part of it yesterday that they're  putting together.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  You know, I was going to say I'm a not be able to watch it but  I have satellite DirecTV in my horse trailer.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Of course you do.  You'll have it.  I believe the times are  going to noon Eastern and 4:00 Eastern and then I'm sure, it will repeat  after that.  But that will be when it premieres.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I can just set my TIVO in my horse trailer.  I have a plug in  for Randy.</p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  That is big pimping right there.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I've two televisions in the living quarters of my horse  trailer.  Room for four horses and three people.</p><p/><p>  This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program is sponsored by BMW of  Bayside -- you sick -- anyway -- </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Nothing.</p><p/><p>        MCSHANE:  Nothing at all.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  It is time for a Bernie Briefing, the 30 minutes past the  hour.  That, of course, is sponsored by MyPillow, which - by the way we're  in - or in horse trailers.  So.  Anyway, good morning, Bernie.</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  Good morning, boss.  President Obama up at SUNY, Buffalo  in upstate New York yesterday, giving his speech and he made a little bit  of a mistake and a recovery.  Take a listen.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Your  outstanding mayor Brian Higgins is here.</p><p/><p>        (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p/><p>        OBAMA:  Give him a big (inaudible) of applause.</p><p/><p>        AUDIENCE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p/><p>        OBAMA:  What?</p><p/><p>        Byron Brown.  That's - I would - I am sorry, Byron.</p><p/><p>        Let me -- what I meant was your congressman, Brian Higgins is here.   Your mayor, Byron Brown is here.</p><p/><p>        This is what happens when you get to be 52 years old.</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        OBAMA:  When I was 51, everything was smooth.</p><p/><p>        (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Pretty good.  He can be charming.</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  Yeah, very likable.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  And your friend, comedian Louis C.K. .</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  I love him.</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  He was on with David Letterman the other night, but nobody  would know it because half the country can't get CBS and the other half  just doesn't watch.  But .</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Or doesn't try.</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  In any case, Mr. C.K., he was boating in the East River  here in New York City and the following transpired between him and  Letterman.  Listen.</p><p/><p>        (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>        LOUIS C.K., COMEDIAN:  I got a boat, I saw the Coast Guard comes on  and they say, please be aware there's other - a report of a body in the  water south of the Queensboro Bridge, which is where I was, and as soon as  they said I looked down and there was the dude in the water.  </p><p/><p>  DAVID LETTERMAN, LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST:  Oh, my God.</p><p/><p>        LOUIS C.K.:  Yeah.</p><p/><p>        LETTERMAN:  So you are like right in there at the crime - well, we  think crime scene.   We don't know.</p><p/><p>        LOUIS C.K.:  I don't know.  It's just floating dead person.  </p><p/><p>  LETTERMAN:  Yeah.</p><p/><p>  LOUIS C.K.:  And I've never seen a dead guy.  Have you ever seen a  dead person?</p><p/><p>  LETTERMAN:  Well, I have been to various funerals .</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        LETTERMAN:  . but not like this.  This is a dead guy in the wild.  </p><p/><p>  LOUIS C.K.:  That is right.  That is right.  That is right.  This is a  freshly dead person.  </p><p/><p>  LETTERMAN:  Yeah.</p><p/><p>        LOUIS C.K.:  Has he been all - you know .</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        LOUIS C.K.:  It's just .</p><p/><p>        LETTERMAN:  Must have been creepy.  </p><p/><p>  LOUIS C.K.:  It was creepy and weird and I felt embarrassed for him a  little bit.  And .</p><p/><p>  LETTERMAN:  You should have gotten the picture of him.  You should .</p><p/><p>  LOUIS C.K.:  What's that?</p><p/><p>  LETTERMAN:  You should have got .</p><p/><p>        (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>        LETTERMAN:  Then we would have that to look at.</p><p/><p>        (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  Not a lot of sympathy on the .</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Not (inaudible).  What's that clip about?</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  Well, the story of the dead body.  You know, we listened  to Letterman's monologue.  He is the only guy that's on live this week,  everybody is off, everybody .</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  Not one funny thing could we use from Mr. Letterman, but  that was the best and here we are bringing it to the I-Man.  A dead body in  the East River, just another day in New York City.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  And at least they didn't speculate that it was Jay Leno or  something like that, some mean-spirited thing.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Yeah.  Something we'd have done .</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  But you know what, Jimmy Kimmel, thought, remember that  kid, he was - the judge told the parents that no, you cannot name your kid  Messiah, you're going to name him Martin, all right?  In any case, Jimmy  Kimmel has this to say about that.</p><p/><p>        (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>        JIMMY KIMMEL, LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST:  Guys.  So no, you are not  naming your son Messiah and forced him to change it to Martin.  So, we'd  better - if your first name is Messiah, you will never find little  personalized license plates for your bike.</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        KIMMEL:  Plus, there's a lot of pressure to have.  Oh, great,  Messiah wet his bed again.</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        KIMMEL:  I don't think what the judge did was legal, but I'm glad  she did it.  In fact, I think we should bring her to Hollywood, put her in  charge of celebrity baby names.</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        KIMMEL:  Because there is - not even giving their kids names  anymore, they're giving them nouns.  You go to any playground in L.A., yell  the word River, ten kids will come running.</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>        MCSHANE:  River!</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  And really.</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  True story.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Low on material here.  It is 34 minutes past the hour.</p><p/><p>        Brutal.  Here is some \"Rusty Truck.\"  Man, I love this .</p><p/><p>        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>        MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  I am Diane Macedo.  And central  bankers are in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for their annual conference.  Fox  Business' Peter Barnes is there too.  Here is an update.</p><p/><p>        PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, let's just call it  taper talk in the teatimes this time around in Jackson Hole.  It's the Fed  officials and central bankers from around the world gathering to hear the  latest research on the economy and on monetary policy, but the real action  takes place on the sidelines during the breaks and in the hallways where  the participants can talk to each other one-on-one and share information  and talk about the effectiveness of policy and the state of the recovery  and of easy money policies.  Of course, the big question here is when the  Fed could start to wind down, to dial back its $85 billion a month in  quantitative easing bond purchases designed to help keep interest rates low  on mortgages and other types of loans coming in to the conference.  The  handicapping is that the Fed could start small at its next policy meeting  in September.</p><p/><p>        The big elephant not in the room this time around at Jackson Hole is  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.  He is skipping the conference for the first  time since he became Fed chairman back in 2005.  The Fed says he has a  personal scheduling conflict, but a lot of folks here are looking and  talking about who may succeed Ben Bernanke as the chairman, who President  Obama will appoint.  One of the leading contenders is the vice chairman of  the Fed, Janet Yellen.  She is here and will moderate a panel on Saturday  on her leading rival in the contest.  Larry Summers, former economic  adviser to the president is not attending.  Back to you in New York.</p><p/><p>        MACEDO:  All right.  That's Peter Barnes in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p><p/><p>        Taking a look at futures, we've got a fairly flat morning, Dow  futures are down eight.  \"Imus in the Morning\" continues right now.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  To my man.  Freddie Toyota on Highland Boulevard in Staten  Island, 19 minutes now until the hour.  Please welcome to the program Don  Corleone, the godfather.  Good morning, godfather.</p><p/><p>        BARTLETT:  Good morning, Don Imus.  At first I was disappointed in  this Bradley Manning leaking the classified information, but now there are  some suggestions that he did so because he preferred to - I'm now a woman -  literally.  He may think that he is a female trapped in a man's body, as if  that catzone (ph) hanging of him with some kind of padlock .</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        BARTLETT:  And all this time I assumed he wasn't that good at  keeping secrets.  Man, he says that he has - a feminile (ph) - and wishes  to be treated as such.  Well, I hope he will be relieved to know that his  wish will be partially granted when serving his sentence.  He will be  surrounded by men who will be more than happy to treat him as the  receptacle for their (speaking Italian).  Trust me, you don't want that  translated.</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        BARTLETT:  What bothers me is that this revelation suggests his  punishment is less a penalty than a reward.  He will spend his years in  jail like it was some kind of Fire Island Labor Day barbecue.  The only  thing that won't be part of his plan is the being referred to as Chelsea.   For I think the name he will be known by will be more along the lines of  bitch.</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        BARTLETT:  But if it were up to me he would be for his infamnia (ph)  with the real punishment like being extradited to Russia where they would  be more than happy to cut off the very thing that is trapping him in a  man's body.  He divulged classified information, but the leaking has just  begun.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Thank you, Godfather.  For - that's assessment - and 17 until  the hour.  \"Powell to the People\" coming up next.  This is an unauthorized  airing of this record of (inaudible)</p><p/><p>        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>        MACEDO:  Hi, everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo, and let's check the  markets now, the day after the NASDAQ flash freed that halted trading for  three hours.  Asian markets ended the day mixed:  Japan's Nikkei followed  the U.S., rebounded, finished the day at more than two percent.  South  Korea's KOSPI gained more than one percent, but the Hang Seng and Shanghai  did end with red arrows.  Over in Europe, we got the second reading on  second quarter GDP for the U.K.  And Germany, both rose seven tenths of a  percent, London's up about 35, Frankfurt is up about 18, but Paris is down  almost two points.</p><p/><p>        Here, in the U.S. futures have been pointing to a lower open for  most of the morning.  Dow futures are still down by about a four, but the  S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are showing some slight gains.  We will be keeping an  eye on those for you.  Gap raised its full year earnings outlook and annual  dividend after reporting a 25 percent jump in its second quarter profit  compared to last year.  The retailer said it earned $0.64 a share matching  the estimate.  Revenue rose just over eight percent to $3.7 billion.  That  also tops expectations.  Gap now expects to report a profit of $2.57 to  $2.65 a share.  That's $0.05 above its previous range.  The company also  raised its annual dividend to $0.80 per share up from $0.60.</p><p/><p>        We're getting earnings in now from Ann Inc, formally Ann Taylor, the  company is reporting a profit of $0.76 a share, topping the estimate for  $0.65.  Revenue, though, was a slight miss at $638,2 million.  Analysts  were expecting $639 million.  \"Imus in the Morning\" continues right now on  Fox Business.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Why did that commercial sound like it was under water, Lou?</p><p/><p>        RUFINO:  My fault, I guess.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Well, now, that was - comes from your studio or the other  studio?</p><p/><p>        RUFINO:  No, I don't know anything about it.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  But do you care about it?</p><p/><p>        RUFINO:  Does it sound like I care?</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  No, it doesn't.  It's just like - you're parallel.</p><p/><p>        RUFINO:  No, I guess so.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Well, yeah - but I mean we charge these people all these  money for this commercial, and want people to be able to hear them.</p><p/><p>        This part of the program is sponsored by Freddie Toyota on the  Highland Boulevard in Staten Island.</p><p/><p>        Well, hey, Bernie, is CBS off in how much of the country?</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  Well, Time Warner, I don't know what the percentage is, my  guess is, approximately half.  But I think they just got back on Verizon  files.</p><p/><p>        MCSHANE:  I don't know if it's - but the big, the funny thing was  they put them back on Channel 2 last night, just to have the debate between  - what Spitzer was on.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Sure.</p><p/><p>        MCSHANE:  They didn't want, you know, to be accused of keeping that  off the air.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  One direction is appearing on the \"Today Show,\" which is only  a couple of blocks from where the Fox Studios are.</p><p/><p>        MCSHANE:  Yeah.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  They are on 6th Avenue, the Avenue of the Americas.  And so,  Powell to the People.  Tony went out and talked to some folks.  I guess,  first some kids who have been waiting there for some time.  Roll, Bigfoot.</p><p/><p>        (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>        TONY POWELL:  How long have you been standing here?</p><p/><p>        UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Two days.  </p><p/><p>  POWELL:  When did you get here? </p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wednesday.  I forgot what day is today.</p><p/><p>  POWELL:  How long have you been here?</p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Since Tuesday.</p><p/><p>        UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have been awake since 4:30 Thursday  morning.</p><p/><p>        POWELL:  Where did you go to the bathroom? </p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Plaza, McDonald's.  </p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Random places.</p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah.  Starbucks.</p><p/><p>        POWELL:  So you like - it's almost like walking your dog.  You mark  every place in the neighborhood.</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        POWELL:  How long have you been here, Jay?</p><p/><p>        UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Three days.</p><p/><p>        POWELL:  Three days.  You must really love your child.</p><p/><p>        UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do.  </p><p/><p>  POWELL:  Do you know any lyrics? </p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't.  </p><p/><p>  POWELL:  So, if you hear it all the time, you can probably sing it  there.  Can you sing it?</p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You mean best song ever?</p><p/><p>  POWELL:  Can you sing it?</p><p/><p>        UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Not really well.  </p><p/><p>  POWELL:  So, you're excited to see one erection?</p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, I don't care.</p><p/><p>        UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I am.</p><p/><p>        UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, I'm very excited.  My children are.  </p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I bet you are.  </p><p/><p>  POWELL:  If somebody gave you $10 million or a chance to hang out with  Harry Styles, which would you choose?</p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A chance to hang out with Harry Styles.</p><p/><p>  POWELL:  Is that how you raise them? </p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I would pay $20 million to have coffee with  Neil.</p><p/><p>  POWELL:  So, if you had a chance to be with Harry Styles and Neil  Cavuto, who would you be with?</p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Cavuto.</p><p/><p>  POWELL:  So, you like your men like you like your coffee.</p><p/><p>        UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Strong.</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Smart.</p><p/><p>        POWELL:  He makes the mood for you.  </p><p/><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah, in a strange way here, very strange.</p><p/><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Well, the kind of inappropriate.  I mean - want an erection  talking to kids?</p><p/><p>        MCSHANE:  Where did you get that from?</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  What is the matter with you? </p><p/><p>  POWELL:  I don't know.  It's just - I don't know.  It seemed funny to  me.  I don't know why it means .</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  It wasn't funny, not in that context, you idiot.</p><p/><p>        MCSHANE:  Oh-oh.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  It is eight minutes until -- what is the matter with you,  Bigfoot?  So, here is the new rule.  Before we put any of these on the air  you have got to show them to me.  You understand.</p><p/><p>  POWELL:  Yes, starting next week.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Because, well, I am going to be off next week.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  That's a good time to start it.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Because your judgment sucks.</p><p/><p>        POWELL:  One time.  I got it.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Come on!  Anyway.</p><p/><p>        MCSHANE:  Back to you, I-Man.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  So, today is Friday and Tony says how many days have you been  here?  I say two.  He said, well, when did you go here? </p><p/><p>        MCSHANE:  It's just me.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  OK.  We need to figure it out.  But I guess - at the  University of Virginia, you missed that day.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Some of them say they got - some of them said they .</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  No, not Tony - it's not - this is not an opportunity to  debate.  So, Rob Bartlett will be appearing at the Leavitt Theater in  Ogunsuck (ph) Maine.</p><p/><p>        MCSHANE:  Ogunquit.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Whatever.  September 21st, and Tony will be appearing at the  Belmar Theater on Saturday, September 28th for an evening with Tony Powell.   That ought to be good.  Well, it could be good as long as he doesn't do any  of this and you could get tickets to that by going to NY  entrainmentclub.com or you could get a hold of that Bellmore theater, and I  want to see Tony.</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  Right.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  I am confident that he is funny.  If you want to see evidence  of this.  Now that this dingbat Liz Claman--</p><p/><p>        MCSHANE:  No, no, no.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  He is going to interview the head of the NASDAQ .</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  Oh, great.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Because they got shutdown yesterday.  And we don't know -  nobody knows why.  I mean there was - you know, the suspicion is that they  are lying, whatever they tell her.  But we just - we have Warner watch this  and see if we can determine if either one of them was lying.  Five minute  now till the hour.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  A lot of the people out there - what did you think, Dagen,  again?</p><p/><p>        MCDOWELL:  I just thought it was badly cast, like the comedian, why  is he there and then they have this woman sitting off to the side on -  reporting on what people are tweeting about, reading stuff on the Twitter,  off the Internet, and just pointless.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p>        MCDOWELL:  They could be a better way to integrate it.  I mean if  you want to have like a hot check, just have her sit there and do nothing.   And just cut - OK, let's give them the hot check a few minutes, you just  take a shot of her and then go back talking about some sports.  It was just  exhausting.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Sounds to me like you are kind of dissing Carley in an odd  way.</p><p/><p>        CARLEY:  Yeah, come on, Dagen.  Come on there.</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  Hey, Carley.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Doesn't sound that way to you, Carley?</p><p/><p>        CARLEY:  Yeah, what is going on?  All that hate?</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p>        MCDOWELL:  You know what - that chick on (inaudible) is a brunette.   So, that was not .</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Like we have said Carley redeemed and stuffed.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  And I was great when .</p><p/><p>        CARLEY:  And I would be happy to read some tweets.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  Hey, so.</p><p/><p>        MCDOWELL:  Yeah.</p><p/><p>        MCSHANE:  Do whatever you want, Carley.</p><p/><p>        CARLEY:  All right.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  I thought you liked Carley.</p><p/><p>        MCDOWELL:  I love Carley.</p><p/><p>        CARLEY:  I love Dagen.</p><p/><p>        MCDOWELL:  Do you really want me to drive down this road?  Because  it will get dirty real quick.</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        MCGUIRK:  OK, put the pedal to the metal.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  I don't have a problem with it.  I mean I've got nothing to  do.</p><p/><p>        MCDOWELL:  I love Carley.  It was not a shot at Carley.</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  But your kids were not up yet.  Go for it.</p><p/><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>        IMUS:  This is the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program on the Fox Business  Network.  Now here's Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>        MACEDO:  Good morning everyone.  Let's check the markets now the day  after a NASDAQ flash freeze halted trading for three hours.  U.S. futures  are mixed.  We have Dow futures down by one point.  The S&amp;P and NASDAQ  turned things around.  The S&amp;P is up by almost a point, about a point  exactly.  There now NASDAQ is up almost four.  Now, for more on what  happened at the NASDAQ yesterday let's go to Nicole Petallides who joins us  in the newsroom.  Hi, Nicole.</p><p/><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS:  Hey, good morning, Diane, good morning  everybody.  Well, yesterday's flash freeze from someone who was standing  right on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange felt more like an  eternity freeze, right? </p><p/><p> So, it took them about a half hour to really figure out what the problem  was and then another two and a half hours to actually reopen the Nasdaq  MarketSite. </p><p/><p> So, it's very interesting as we watch what happened, it was actually due to  a glitch in the processor.  A securities information processor SIP which  now seems to be regular wording that we use now on Wall Street today.</p><p/><p> But basically it's a way that they give out prices to all the different  exchanges, 13 exchanges, 40 dark pools.  And when this had a glitch, they  basically halted trading across the board.  </p><p/><p> Names like Apple, Blackberry, Costco, Cisco, Dow components as well.  So,  you have Google, JetBlue, just to name a few of the names.</p><p/><p> So, what's interesting is you have different people speaking out today, Bob  Greifeld, the CEO of Nasdaq seems very proud of the way that they figured  out what the problem was. </p><p/><p> And order and had an orderly reopening and didn't feel the need to address  any transparency or address the press, et cetera. </p><p/><p> He said he's working closely with other exchanges.  However, when you talk  to SEC chair, Mary Jo White, also Harvey Pitt, former SEC chairman, Arthur  Levitt, former SEC chairman, they seem less than pleased. </p><p/><p> Obviously noting that this was a serious issue, that's according to Mary Jo  White, Harvey Pitt said this, it shouldn't have happened at all. </p><p/><p> And so obviously and Arthur Levitt as well expressing displeasure.  So, now  what happens today and how do we ensure that this doesn't happen again and  really leave Americans and people all over the world with their money tied  up and not sure as to when they will be able to execute trades again? </p><p/><p> Now, this is reminiscent of what we remember from Facebook, that debacle of  an IPO, you know the ink is barely dry on that $10 million check that  Nasdaq had to pay out in order to calm that issue. </p><p/><p> So, this remains an issue and it's all about the complexity of trading  which as I noted, 13 exchanges, more than 40 dark pools and that trillions  of dollars at hand. </p><p/><p> So, this is a very tough day yesterday on Wall Street.  And of course, once  again, it's a blast to investor confidence.  Diane. </p><p/><p> MACEDO:  All right, that's Nicole Petallides from the newsroom, thanks,  Nicole.  And central bankers are gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the  Kansas City Fed's annual conference. </p><p/><p> Fox Business' Peter Barnes joins us live with a preview, good morning,  Peter. </p><p/><p> PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS:  Hey, good morning, Diane.  Well, the topic at  this year's conference is global dimensions of unconventional monetary  policy. </p><p/><p> What does that mean? Well, basically they're here to talk about low long- term interest rates, quantitative easing, those billions and trillions of  dollars that the Fed has spent to buy mortgage-backed securities and  treasury securities. </p><p/><p> All of it to try to keep interest rates low for average consumers so they  can go out and buy cars and get low-cost mortgages and their businesses can  get low loans. </p><p/><p> So, that -- this stuff matters to the average consumer.  The big topic here  and the big buzz is, when will the Fed start to now dial back all of this  quantitative easing? </p><p/><p> It's been doing $85 billion a month since September but it appears that the  Fed is now getting ready to start pull that back, to start tapering that,  to start dialing that down. </p><p/><p> And that's what's given a lot of heartburn to the markets and caused a lot  of these, a lot of the roller coaster ride out in the markets. </p><p/><p> And there will be some papers presented here that talk about quantitative  easing, there's been some other recent papers that say basically, you know  what? </p><p/><p> It's really not working anymore and that kind of research could help push  the Fed to get out of quantitative easing quicker, sooner rather than  later. </p><p/><p> I want to mention we got a great lineup of guests here in Jackson Hole this  year and just a little bit later in this hour, we'll talk to Dennis  Lockhart, he is the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. </p><p/><p> We'll be talking later today to Jim Bullard, the President of the Saint  Louis Federal Reserve, they both have been very vocal on this issue of  quantitative easing. </p><p/><p> And later this afternoon at 5:00, we'll be talking to Christine Lagarde,  the head of the International Monetary Fund who is doing all those bailouts  around the world.  Diane, back to you. </p><p/><p> MACEDO:  All right, that's Peter Barnes in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  Here is  a quick look at commodities, oil and gold are up, IMUS IN THE MORNING  continues right now.  </p><p/><p> DON IMUS, HOST, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Oh, well, Tom Friedman from the \"New  York Times\" is coming up, we'll talk to him at the bottom of the hour. </p><p/><p> And Warner has got sports, Bernie's briefing stuff, Dagen is not here today  because she still has -- man, I don't know. </p><p/><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Injuries. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  The girl got some bruises that she -- so this makeup -- they can't  put any makeup on it. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Right. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  And it seems odd.  So, and we just -- I just don't think we're  probably ever going to get to -- well, she claims she walked into a  cabinet, right? </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  That's what she said, yes, that's it, and we have to take her at  her word, i-man? </p><p/><p> IMUS:  No.  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Oh, I see. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  No, of course not. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Just asking. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Hey, Bigfoot, Liz Claman is coming up and talking to Greifeld,  right? </p><p/><p> TOM BOWMAN, PRODUCER, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Yes, she is sitting down right  now, so, in just about four minutes. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  This is a guy who is -- what does this guy do? </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  He is the head of Nasdaq, so -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Oh, OK -- </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  He is going to -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Well, right though -- </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  Try and explain what happened yesterday. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  So he'll be on -- </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Camera? --  </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  She'll be sitting down with him for a quick four or five minutes  in interview. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  OK, I want you to get a look at him, Warner. </p><p/><p> WARNER WOLF, SPORTS PRESENTER, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  OK -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Pay attention here -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  All right, see if his eyes wiggle around, see if -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh, yes -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  He fidgets -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Hey, well Bigfoot, well, how am I going to know whether she's ready  -- </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  I'm going to let you know -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  You going to tell me? -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  That also be great -- </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  Hey, and by the way you're not -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  And then I'll listen -- </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  Tossing the people, he was talking to parents, he didn't ask that  question to the minors about -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes, with the kids standing around there --  </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  But he was directing it to the parents and Tony's -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  No children, right -- </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  No children -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  That's a good point, Tom. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  But it wasn't funny anyway, so, you want to discuss it --  </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  No, that's why from now on we're going to have you -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  No -- </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  Look at it first. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Going to have to show me because I don't trust you or him. </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  Oh, wait a minute -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  I mean I -- </p><p/><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  Just Tony and others, the only people on the show you don't trust? </p><p/><p> IMUS:  I've been doing this a while, I know what I'm doing.  And if you  guys think you know better, Tony, you think you know better or Bigfoot, you  guys go do it yourself somewhere. </p><p/><p> But for the time-being, we're going to do what I think is funny.  See how  that works out -- God -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  All right --  </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  Right you are, I'm good -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  It's not really -- </p><p/><p> BOWMAN:  I'm all good -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Sounds really like a jerk, don't they? </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  We're going to have a great day -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  What a creep. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  That's it, let's move.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Anyway -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Keep it moving, everything is all right, nothing to see here -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  I need to get away from you bastards for a couple of weeks -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Oh, well, whether you know, that's -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Jeez, I'm just sick of you -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Perfect timing -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  I really am -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Holy God, what are the odds? </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> You're off for two weeks, oh, this is the best news all morning.  </p><p/><p> LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  You got to get away  from all of these bastards -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Was that funny, Lou? </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  That is pretty damn funny, actually.  </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  No, stop, Lou.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Why don't you do some news -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Sure, I'll be honored to -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  While I think about firing Tony and Rob -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  No, that's not -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  And fantasize -- </p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I know -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  It -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Fantasize -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Why don't you tell us what's going on then when Foot notifies me  that Liz is ready, we'll go to her.  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Wait until you hear this first story, this will get you worked up  anyway.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  About Syria.  Is the United States planning for airstrikes in  Syria?  The \"Wall Street Journal\" actually has a report on this -- in this  morning's paper that officials began,  \"refining their options\" for  possible airstrikes. </p><p/><p> You know, supposedly updating target lists and the like for the possibility  of striking Syria. </p><p/><p>U.S. airstrikes but we'll see.  Here is President Obama making an  appearance, talking about some of these things on \"Cnn\", he was on with  Chris Cuomo earlier this morning.  Here's a little bit of the interview. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Where is it? </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Where are we on that Tom? Remember that Cuomo -- </p><p/><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) </p><p/><p> CHRIS CUOMO, CNN:  Do you believe at this point you need to investigate -- </p><p/><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)   </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Here we go -- </p><p/><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p/><p> CUOMO:  In order to say what seems obvious, which is that the U.S. needs to  do more. </p><p/><p> BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, we are right now  gathering information about this particular event but -- </p><p/><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Chemical weapons -- </p><p/><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p/><p> OBAMA:  I can say that unlike some of the evidence -- </p><p/><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  We have to interrupt this, that's enough.  Now, stop it! -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Not -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Playing a cut from \"Cnn\", that's just idiotic.  All right, please  welcome now to the program Liz Claman, good morning, Miss Claman. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  All right -- </p><p/><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Good morning, Don and to all of your listeners  and viewers, we are live at the Nasdaq MarketSite. </p><p/><p> You know, there are many exchanges, but the two biggest, the New York Stock  Exchange and the Nasdaq, one of them went down yesterday for a full three  hours. </p><p/><p> Throwing the entire trading system for all of you who maybe have 401(k)s or  trade stocks, it went down for a full three hours and of course, now, it's  been attributed to a highly technical glitch. </p><p/><p> We're joined now by the CEO of the Nasdaq, Bob Greifeld.  Thank you for  being here --  </p><p/><p> ROBERT GREIFELD, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NASDAQ:  I'm glad to have you  here, Liz. </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  OK, this is not a great day for you, this was a nightmare  yesterday, but it was also a nightmare for companies like Yahoo!, Apple,  Google who list on the Nasdaq but also the individual investor. </p><p/><p> Right off the bat, I have to ask you because so many people were  questioning this.  Was there any indication of any kind of computer hacking  or system hacking here? </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  No, none whatsoever.  So, this had nothing to do with hacking.   Hacking is a fact of life but had nothing to do with the problem yesterday. </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  That worries some people that it was an internal system because it  indicates to some people, you guys don't have your arms wrapped around your  system? </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  Well, certainly we're deeply disappointed with what happened  yesterday and what we had to do is improve what I call defensive driving. </p><p/><p> So, our system by itself was working but you have interconnections in the  world we live in today and we have to handle bad actions from some of those  people connected to us.  </p><p/><p> And we have to improve on that.  So, we're deeply disappointed but I would  highlight that one of the reasons it took three hours was, we have a first  and foremost responsibility for fair and orderly markets. </p><p/><p> So, we spent two and a half hours really making sure the entire industry,  we had opened telephone lines with them, we made sure the entire industry  was ready to come live and we did come live, we came live quite  successfully and finished the day in normal course of business. </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  Nobody begrudges you that moment where you have to work and make  sure that once you do press go again, it's going to be fine. </p><p/><p> What they do get very upset about, Bob, is the lack of communication.  I  talked to CEOs of Nasdaq-traded companies who said I got nothing. </p><p/><p> I'm sitting in meetings, I'm checking my Blackberry, I'm checking my phone,  there's nothing from the Nasdaq.  </p><p/><p> They do know that you were putting out some 20 missives to the trading  community, but that's not the CEOs of all of these companies who are  worried about their stocks. </p><p/><p> What's wrong with your communication system? </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  Well, our communication system I think worked well yesterday.   It can always be improved.  </p><p/><p> First order of businesses to focus on solving the problem and then dealing  with people directly involved with the problem. </p><p/><p> Now, in one of those open lines we had people representing our issuers on  the call and they were -- they are to give regular updates out. </p><p/><p> We gave a formal update out after the close of trading which we wanted to  do.  So, I think we did well, we'll certainly reflect upon how we  communicate, see if we can do better. </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  Can't you just -- </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  But certainly -- </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  Hire somebody to work the phones and call the IR offices? The --  </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  Oh, they were doing that -- </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  You know -- </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  Although we had teams --  </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  Investor relations offices -- </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  No -- </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  On the stock --   </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  We had teams of people doing that.  As I'm saying, we had the  people responsible for the issuers on the open lines so they could hear  first-hand exactly what was going on. </p><p/><p> They were taking inbound calls, we took hundreds of inbound calls,  reaching, making outbound calls.  So, there was active communication going  on. </p><p/><p> In this type of situation, you probably didn't get to every single CEO or  every single IRO, but we communicated quite actively to a large number of  them. </p><p/><p> Then the official communication went out after the close of trading day to  everybody. </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  OK -- </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  Right, so, it happened you know, quite rapidly. </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  I get the explanations but we had former Securities and Exchange  Commission head, Harvey Pitt on yesterday, he was very harsh. </p><p/><p> You were probably busy working the situation, but he said the Nasdaq  handled this \"terribly\".  What he didn't like too was when you started the  systems up.  </p><p/><p> He said you only allowed trading in certain stocks, and he said how can you  be fair when you're only allowing certain stocks to get up -- </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  Well, I think it's hard for people outside direct involvement  with the problem to comment and comment intelligently on it. </p><p/><p> So we have -- </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  Well, you're taking the smack at Harvey Pitt? </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  Well -- </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  I mean, he's not -- </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  I'm just saying for anybody who is not there, right? So, they --  you know the people who are not on the open lines, who are not in the head  trader alert communication, it's hard for them to know, right? </p><p/><p> And hard for them to comment intelligently in terms of what happened.  So,  everybody was directly involved, the exchanges were on what's called the  UTP line. </p><p/><p> SIP arranged a line with our members, in addition to that, we had the head  trader alert.  So, that happened all the way and each plan, right?</p><p/><p> And we solved the problem within half an hour, right? And certain members  made a request in terms of having a longer period of time to quote -- </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  OK -- </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  Instead of five-15 minutes, that cost a half hour of time to get  ready for that.  So, that communication was there and I think to the extent  that anybody who wasn't involved became involved, we said OK, that was as  active as you can get. </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  You guys are considered the sexier exchange. </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  Yes.   </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  You know, you've got the lots of the dotcoms of the world but  there are some that aren't public yet.  Twitter, for example, everybody is  waiting for that to go public. </p><p/><p> Do you think you've lost Twitter? Can you make a 30-second pitch to Twitter  to say here is why you should still consider listing on Nasdaq? </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  Well, I think it's important to recognize that we aspire towards  perfection with respect to the operations of our systems. </p><p/><p> And technology people, Twitter and all the companies recognize that.  We  will always fall short of that but we have to keep trying, right? </p><p/><p> And we get better all the time, and the number of problems have actually  declined.  But probably as importantly, we have to make sure we handle  problems in the proper way, right? </p><p/><p> So, what we did yesterday, right, nobody wanted to be down for three hours  and if we had been quite reckless we could have been up a lot sooner than  that. </p><p/><p> But I think the procedures we had in place, the industry had in place  worked well.  So, we would say to any technology-based company, we're not  perfect, right? </p><p/><p> We're 99.99 percent perfect, we're not perfect, we'll have problems but if  we do, we're going to make sure we maintain a fair and orderly market. </p><p/><p> And that's what we did yesterday.  And it's important to recognize the fact  we didn't trade for several hours.  If you're a traditional long investor,  a mom-and-pop, institutional investor, that three hours doesn't matter. </p><p/><p> You're buying the stock for the longer period of time, right? And the fact  is, every single person was in the same situation.  Nobody was relatively  advantaged or disadvantaged because the market was down for that -- </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  I -- </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  Period of time. </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  Some moms and pops are a little more sophisticated these days and  like to trade a lot.  But either way, we appreciate you coming on Fox -- </p><p/><p> GREIFELD:  Right -- </p><p/><p> CLAMAN:  Business and IMUS IN THE MORNING to talk about this.  Bob Greifeld  is the CEO of the Nasdaq, we now rejoin IMUS IN THE MORNING on Fox Business  and on radio.  Back to you. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Praise God -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  He sounds like he might have had a head injury, doesn't he? </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> Jesus -- well, he's been up all night -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  But Warner was on top of it over there, I saw -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  What do you think, Warner? </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Well, my question is if you grabbed his hands, could he talk? I  mean, that guy just broke the record for gestures with hands. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  What does that mean? </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Well, it means you're not quite comfortable enough with just  verbalizing and you think you have to emphasize everything -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, he's on the spot here.  My favorite part of the interview is  when Liz breathlessly -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Like she said, you don't have your arms wrapped around your problem.   What kind of question is that? </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> Don't have your arms wrapped around -- oh, God. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  That was fun. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  So we don't know anything, do we? We don't know any more now than we  knew, so -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  It's kind of what I was thinking, there was -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Man, at least she got him on. </p><p/><p> BERNARD MCGUIRK, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  She'll get all  this press all day long, she interviewed him and it's all good.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  You need to get Warner to analyze all our business interviews  from now on, on the 11:00 show with me, it would be great, Warner.  </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Sure, I'll be -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Or anybody who is on -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Right -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Who we can see -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes, could be great -- </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> RUFINO:  I was looking at Connell's -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Liar -- </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  Yes, before and -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Look at this -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  We didn't have any answers. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  No. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  But she asked the right questions, just -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes, she did -- </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Damn right -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  She was fine, yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  That breathless -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  At least -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  I don't know, it's fine, she's fine. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  It's all fine, it's all good. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  It's all -- </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Really is -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Good --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Quote Mark Seliger and Rusty Truck, \"It's All Good\".  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  What are we supposed to do now? 17 after the hour?</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Some sports, you know -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  All right, let's do that, sponsored by Peerless Boilers, good  morning, Warner. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Good morning, i-man.  All right, here we go, Yanks beat the Jays 5- 3, they sweep the series 10 out of 12.  A blown call by the umpire in the  bottom of the fifth with the bases loaded really gave the Yanks a huge  break. </p><p/><p> Here was the call by Michael Kay, \"YES Network\". </p><p/><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p/><p> MICHAEL KAY, SPORTSCASTER:  Right through the centerfield, it is caught.   It's going to be -- no, he drops the ball about five seconds and it is a  double play. </p><p/><p> He's tagging everybody whether it's a double play, the ending inning.  Did  he make the catch? </p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No -- </p><p/><p> KAY:  Now they're saying that he didn't make the catch? </p><p/><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Well, he didn't make the catch -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  So, instead of a double play ending the inning, Wells was given an  RBI, the Yanks took the lead and never trailed.  And this is exactly what  videotape replay will be used next year. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh, thank God. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  That will help -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  Everything -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Amen -- </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  Game will be five hours. </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Yes, fantastic -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Clayton Kershaw -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh, that's just great, Warner -- </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Bring the videotape delay -- </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  Well, the umpires are still looking -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Well, they're supposed to -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Hey, what sporting activity is around today, Warner? </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Well today, you have -- if you want to watch NFL football tonight,  Seahawks, Packers, Bears and Raiders. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, I'll watch that and I might watch the Seahawks. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  And also you can watch the little league game between Westport and  Sammamish. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Oh -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  That will be -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  What time is that? </p><p/><p> WOLF:  That's a 3:00 game. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Is that Eastern Time? </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Yes, Westport -- </p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, Williamsport -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  And of course, the winner will play Chula Vista for the U.S. title.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh, yes -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  So, that's a huge game. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Anything else? </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Well, kind of funny, you have Brian Wilson, a pitch to the ninth  inning of the Dodgers game.</p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They did -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Take a look at him, if you don't know, the big beard and he's been  offered a million dollars to shave his beard by 800razors.com. </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  That's it.  In golf, Kevin Stadler has the first round lead of the  Charles Barkley tournament as you have said. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Right -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  And -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  That was unfunny joke three hours ago when -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Oh -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  You just going to ride it until it's -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Oh, yes -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  But yesterday was funny -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  I think it's clever, yes -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes, very well -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  It's a terrible joke but it's clever. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  A good line -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh, it is -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Tiger Woods was three back at 67 and Rory McIlroy who Gary Player  said needs a good woman, had three double-bogeys.</p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> In football last night, the Panthers beat the Ravens, all four touchdowns  came on turnovers.  Two interceptions, a punt return and a fumble return. </p><p/><p> And the Lions beat the Patriots 40 to 9.

But the guy's  name is Alberto Jose Albuquerque.  And I'm not sure, maybe they do call him  Al Albuquerque, I don't even know. </p><p/><p> But I've never seen that kid pitch before last night.  </p><p/><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)   </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Was that Francesa? </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Why does his voice sound so funny?</p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Maybe he was sucking that helium. </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  Yes, he's sucking helium -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  Sucking helium -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  What is that? --  </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  Yes, he's sucking helium -- </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Maybe they, maybe they have these new helium doughnuts. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Gunz was high when he was talking, he says -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  So -- </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  Yes, exactly, one more diet coke and helium -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Twenty three after the hour, well, we'll get that in the briefing  coming up. </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  You know Albuquerque is a place, so, anyway, wait -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  You're nuts -- </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  Dawg, you take this one -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Ten minutes absolutely, Greifeld down there at the Nasdaq.   </p><p/><p> (MUSIC) </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh, yes, the jingle sound like part of the record, Lou.  Sleeping  through the night becomes more like a dream itself as folks get older. </p><p/><p> But it's especially aggravating if it's related to your prostate.  You got  your wiener backed up on you there.  But you can unplug that sucker with  PT9. </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> Joel(ph) from New York, he heard the i-man talking about it and felt  compelled to write a letter.  This is -- don't you wonder about people who  take something like PT9, which obviously works, it's from Chamonix, it's a  great company.  </p><p/><p> Then they offer a money-back guarantee on all of their products, a money- back guarantee, period.  Don't you wonder about these people?</p><p/><p> They only write a letter and tell people about their problems I was having  with my penis? </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  I mean, why?</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  We don't want to know that.  We -- just order PT9, take it, get  three bottles of Heart Factors absolutely free and keep it to yourself. </p><p/><p> Man, I don't want to know about your dick, boy. </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> So call them at 800 -- I mean, keep it to yourself.</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Jeez.  Oh, now (INAUDIBLE) the old lady now, i-man. shut up! Call  800-754-6980.  Please, ixnay on the letters.  800-754-6980. </p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p/><p> MACEDO:  Good morning everyone, I'm Diane Macedo.  And we'll get a new  reading on the housing market this morning.  New home sales for July are  expected to fall 1.5 percent from June to 490,000.  </p><p/><p> That would be a disappointing reading after existing home sales for last  month jumped 6.5 percent to their highest level in four years. </p><p/><p> But the mood of the housing market does appear to be improving.  Home  builders confidence jumped last week to its highest level in eight years  despite rising interest rates.  </p><p/><p> IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.  </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Meanwhile, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman says the Yanks will  win -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Hello? </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Hello? -- </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Well, wait -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Hello, Warner. </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Hey, Brian.  Now major league baseball -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Hello -- </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  No Warner, don't say it back -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Don't respond -- </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Now, this is Jerry Jones -- </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> This is Jerry Jones.   </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  Do Cashman again. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Warner. </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  I want to take a shower right now. </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> IMUS:  This is Jerry Jones. </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  Man, I've never get on with you, man -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Hey, Jerry -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  You guys should do your medical talk in these, in these voices -- </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  We'll see for steroids -- </p><p/><p> (IMUS EXTRA SEGMENTS)</p><p/><p> IMUS:  All right, we're going to talk with Tom Friedman, the \"New York  Times\" coming up here on the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program.  Our last day  from the ranch for this summer, so -- and Glenn and everybody out here,  Glenn is great and been doing it forever.  He and his crew, and Glenn and  Ken, Ken's great.  Glenn's great and kid over here with the camera and the  woman whatever her name is.</p><p/><p>        In fact, I know these people and only worked with them 15 years, but  it's a great crew here at the ranch.  They really, they're here on --  they're never late and everything works.</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Very good.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  And they're real pros.  And out of Albuquerque and do a lot of film  work and they're real professionals and I greatly appreciate it, like all  of them.  It's 31 past the hour.  Time for a Bernie Briefing and that's  sponsored by My Pillow.  Here with it is Bernard McGuirk.  Good morning,  Mr. McGuirk.</p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Good morning, Mr. Imus.  Yesterday, as Warner Wolf pointed out,  the day before yesterday, Ichiro Suzuki, 4,000 hits combined with his  Japanese career and his Major League Baseball career.  And this dude, JJ  from Staten Island called in, as sportsgreat.com writes and so it began on  Mike Francesa's dozy time sleep train as our host lambasted a startled  caller on Yankees celebration of Ichiro's 4,000 hits and repeated himself.   JJ stayed Suzuki had an accomplishment.  Take a listen.</p><p/><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p> MIKE FRANCESA, SPORTS RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  JJ in Staten Island, what's  up. </p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it's very, very unbelievable accomplishment,  you know?</p><p/><p> FRANCESA:  No, I don't know.  I disagree completely.  Disagree completely  and I think it's ridiculous.  He has 4,000 hits?  Why?  We now, the Major  League and the Japanese leagues are now co-leagues?  He has 2,700 major  league hits.  He doesn't have anything more than that.  I think it's  utterly ridiculous that we are now going to act like Ichiro got 4,000 hits.   He didn't get 4,000 hits, he has 2,700 hits.  I give you that, but only  2700 hits as far as we're concerned.</p><p/><p>        He doesn't have 3,000 hits and how the heck does he have 4,000 hits?   I mean, when did that start?  When did we start mingling the Japan  statistics with the American statistics?  He's got 2,700 Major League hits.  He doesn't have 4,000 Major League hits.  It doesn't make sense to me.   When did we decide that?  Who decided the Japanese hits are equal to the  major league hits.  We've got the statistics.</p><p/><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Stop, stop, if I wanted to listen to him, I'd listen.  I know he  does that, repeats himself ad nauseam.  I love Mike, but -- </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  I think it's a great accomplishment.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  But it's unlistenable.</p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  And sportscreed.com, they write, of course, Francesa's argument  is fatuous, the only surprise there being that he stayed awake long enough  to make it.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  What are you doing, be like if you're trying to rope, Wyatt.</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Good morning, Wyatt.</p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Wait a second, what's going on there.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Are you roping today?</p><p/><p> WYATT:  Yes.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  OK, I'm going to fool with you, talk to you when you're backing your  horse in the box on the rope.</p><p/><p> WYATT:  You're not doing anything, you're talking.</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Physical.</p><p/><p> WYATT:  And having breakfast while you're talking.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  You're purposely going out of your way to annoy me.</p><p/><p> WYATT:  I'm bringing you breakfast.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  If I could, I'd whip your little ass no, no, leave my yogurt away.</p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  And have your own kid spitting in your coffee soon.</p><p/><p> RUFINO:  Soon?</p><p/><p> IMUS:  He makes me laugh as much as anybody on the planet.  God, he's  funny.  What are you saying?</p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  I was saying that I'm done and we're late for Tom Friedman,  cutting into Tom Friedman's time.  It's an outrage.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  So, get the whining comy on, 25 until the hour.</p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network,  and now, here is Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p> DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS:  Good morning, everyone.  Some of the most  important economic figures in the world are gathering in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming for the fed annual conference.  A big difference this year is that  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke won't be attending due to a scheduling conflict.   European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will also miss this meeting.   The main focus of the conference, though, will be the impact of the fed's  unconventional policies at home and abroad.</p><p/><p>        Now let's get the latest on weather from meteorologist Maria Molina  in our Fox Business Weather Center.  Hi, Maria.</p><p/><p> MARIA MOLINA, FOX BUSINESS WEATHER CENTER:  Hi.  Good morning, Diane.  Good  morning, everyone.  Today we're looking at a beautiful day across sections  of the northeast.  Yesterday, we had storms roll through, leaving behind  lower humidity and also pleasant temperatures, like in New York City, 83  degrees for a high temperature and parts of the Midwest and the plains  heating in the upper 80's and widespread 90's and feeling like August  across the center of the country.</p><p/><p>        And out west, a danger of fires, and red flags, that leaves the  hours and eventually into the west.  Much-need rain across parts of Nevada,  Utah and across parts of Southern California, several inches could fall out  here so flooding could be a concern.  Diane, back to you.</p><p/><p> MACEDO:  All right, that's Maria Molina from the weather center.  Let's  take a quick look at futures.  Those have been searching for direction  today.  Dow futures are now up by 2 points.  IMUS IN THE MORNING continues  right now.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  It's 20 minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  Please welcome now from the New York sometimes, Tom Friedman.   Good morning, Mr. Friedman.</p><p/><p> TOM FRIEDMAN, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" (via telephone):  Good morning, Don.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Wonder how long the \"New York Times\" is going to stay in business?</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  Gosh, you know, I really think, you know, we've got a strong  enough global brand, I don't worry about the times per se, but what I  worry, if you look at the numbers, our -- the newspaper ads, you know, have  been, I don't know how long it is, six, nine, 12 quarters, you know, they  continue to decline and you know, you just hope that we'll find a bottom.</p><p/><p>        We're still making a profit, thank God, but if that doesn't find a  bottom, you know, at some point, you know, it will affect obviously what we  can do, but you hope it will find a bottom.  I don't know if you realize, I  think last quarter, the quarter before, we made more money selling the  paper than we did from advertising and like that's a huge line to cross.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, and are you working on another book?</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  I'm thinking about something, Don.  You know, sort of pushing  ahead from the last book I did that used to be about just kind of the new  phase of globalization where it's going, technology, how it's all merging,  how it's affecting business, education, et cetera.  It's germinating in my  head, but I'm not quite there yet, but thinking about something on the  Middle East, too.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  You're not kidding.  That sounds hideous.  You've got to come up  with a better idea than that.  Geez, are you kidding me?  Nobody's going to  read that.</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  You want to write a book called \"The World Is Flat\" nobody's  going to read that.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, no.</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  I'm thinking about something.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  That was a great book, though, the olive tree and that stuff, but  this latest one.  Have you just given up?  Said the hell with it?</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  No.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Anyway, let me ask you a couple of serious questions.  Syria, what  the hell is going on there?</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  Well, we don't have the conclusive proof, but you look at those  pictures of those bodies, don, how they died, unmarked by any kind of  wounds, you know, it's pretty clear the regime used some kind of chemical  weapon and obviously Obama said that would be a red line.  They already  crossed it once.  What he will do this time once it's conclusively proved,  I don't know.</p><p/><p>        There's a big discussion at the White House yesterday, as you  reported, that three hours where they debated what to do.  One of the  problems, the problem is this so let's say we launched a cruise missile  attack in response to this to deter chemical weapons.</p><p/><p>        What targets to hit.  Do you cause more refugee outflow from Syria  and destabilize Jordan, for instance?  So there's a lot of real-- so many  moving parts with this, it's going to be a difficult one to sort out, but,  you know, I'm glad they're considering something because once you start  introducing those kind of weapons, you know, it's Katie bar the door.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  What would you recommend that we do?</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  You know, I would be in favor of -- as I sit here right now, I'd  be in favor of some kind of military response at that simply says we're not  going to tolerate that.  The world is not going to tolerate that.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Would you want troops on the ground?</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  No, no, I'm talking about some kind of aerial response.  It's  sort of something I'd be ready to consider.  I want to see all the facts,  they haven't all come out, some kind of response not just by us, but by the  world, the allies, NATO that draws a red line there.  I think it's  something that it's really worth considering.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Talking with Tom Friedman from the \"New York Times\" who probably has  an e-mail address at the times in which you can contact him and here is  what I'd like you to do, send him some ideas for a book.  He hasn't got  any.  And every day I say to Connell, well, why should I care about Egypt?   So, let me ask you, why should I?</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  You know, there are a lot of reasons, Don.  It's a country of  85 million people.  It sits astride the Suez Canal.  It's the partner with  Israel in the Camp David peace treaty and has been traditionally the  bedrock of the geopolitics there and the leader of the Arab world, as Egypt  goes, so goes the Arab world.</p><p/><p>        You want the country to have a decent outcome of this revolutionary  process.  The problem in Egypt right now, Don, you've had two choices  historically, that is either the army or the Muslim Brotherhood.  In Egypt  if you look at its history oscillated between those two for the last 60-odd  years.</p><p/><p>        And the question, really, is can they-- can they find a third way, a  way that's actually forward-looking, inclusive, progressive that doesn't  just involve one of these narrow-minded options or the other?  You know,  one of the things that's been rattling around in my head, Don.  Princess Di  once said with Prince Charles there are three people in this marriage.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  Historically we've looked at Egypt and saying there's two people  in the marriage, the Muslim Brotherhood and the army.  If that's the choice  we'll go with the army, with Mubarak, but we talked about this in earlier  conversation, I think there are three people in this story now, there's the  military, the Muslim Brotherhood and Mother Nature.</p><p/><p>        And by that, I mean there is all of these incredible water,  environmental population stresses that have built up over the last 60  years, precisely because of the incompetence of the military government and  the Muslim Brotherhood in managing the problems and stresses, if they don't  get the act together, find a third way that can sort of tilt Egypt forward  to deal with some of these problems, Don, half the women in Egypt can't  read.</p><p/><p>        After $30 billion in U.S. aid, over the last 30-odd years, half the  women still can't read and these other social stresses I think are just  going to blow the place apart.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  What in your view would be a decent outcome in Egypt?</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  I think a decent outcome would be a government that would --  where the military says to this government that they've appointed and they  actually-- when they ousted the Muslim Brotherhood government they  appointed a new president and he appointed a new cabinet.  And you know  some of these people and they're pretty decent people, if they would assign  that government the task of writing a new constitution, one that would  guarantee minority rights, that would be -- that would guarantee women's  rights, that would be basically progressive leaning and take out some of  the bad stuff the Muslim Brotherhood had in the constitution, and begin to  organize an elective process gradually.</p><p/><p>        Giving time for not just the Muslim Brotherhood or Islamists as it  were, but the liberal and progressive parties to get organize and contest  that election, to put Egypt on that gradual transition path, not to just  stop with the military government.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Why did you decide to employ the Princess Di analogy?</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  I have no idea.  It popped into my head there.  There are three  different parties in this story now.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  You're a weird dude, sometimes, so -- but you do sometimes in your  columns it works well.</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  Yes.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Have you gotten away this summer at all?</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  A little bit.  Just kind of on and off.  I just turned 60, Don.   So I'm going out to California next week.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  When was your birthday?</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  July 20th.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, happy birthday.</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  Thank you very much.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  You look pretty good for 60.  I guess 60 is -- 60 is getting up  there.</p><p/><p> FRIEDMAN:  I'm trying to take care of myself.  In this day and age, there  are a few miles on these treads so I'm trying to take care of myself, and  looking forward to getting away.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  In spite of what you think, the times is not long for this world so  get a good idea for a book.  Tom Friedman.</p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo.  It's time to check the  markets now, the day after the Nasdaq flash free that halted trading for  three hours.  The U.S. futures are fairly flat this morning, but now point  to go a higher open.  Dow futures are up 3.  The S&amp;P is up about 1.  The  Nasdaq is up 3.5.</p><p/><p>        Over in Europe, we got the second quarter reading on second quarter  GDP in the U.K. and Germany, both rose 7/10 of a percent.  London is now up  about 37.  Paris is down barely and Frankfurt is up 16.</p><p/><p>        The \"Wall Street Journal\" says that federal prosecutors are turning  up the pressure in an insider trading case against a former portfolio  manager at SAC Capital.  The new indictment unsealed yesterday alleges that  Matthew Martoma spoke to a second doctor involved in an Alzheimer's drug  trial at the heart of the case.</p><p/><p>        Martoma is accused of using insider information about results of  that drug trial, which then allowed SAC Capital to make $275 million in  profits.   He's due to go on trial in November.  A hearing is set for this  morning, SAC Capital has been charged with encouraging insider trader, but  Steven Cohen, the hedge fund's founder has not been charged.  Cohen and his  firm deny any wrongdoing.</p><p/><p>        Here's a look at commodities now.  We're watching oil and gold for  you this morning.  Those have been also fairly flat.  Oil is now down up  13 cents.  Gold is up 20.  IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  He looks like he is he doesn't have any energy, doesn't he?  Here on  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, coming up on the radio, a fascinating,  funny conversation with the great Terry Bradshaw.</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  All right.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  And before that, it's 9:20 Eastern Time on the Fox Business Network.   The lying limey, Stuart Varney, so -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  We love Varney.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  I do like Varney a lot.  So I don't know.</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  What's wrong?</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, and the Godfather is going to be on to talk about -- I forget  what he's going to talk about.  What, Godfather.</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Good question.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Down, Godfather.</p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  The gentleman -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Can barely hear the Godfather, so the Godfather decided well, mail  it in this morning.  Did he have his mic off, Connell?</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  I think his headphones were down and he couldn't hear.</p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  Turn it up.</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Now he's better.  And solving yet another problem and working  through a lot this morning.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Got to project, Rob.</p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  Yes, sir.</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  He couldn't hear.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Also, you did a -- a lousy job on the last script.  Why was that?</p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  I'm a little under the weather today.  It affected my  performance, I apologize.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  What's the matter with you?</p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  Got a little bit of a -- a touch of a bug, I think.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, why didn't you tell me that instead of turning in a  performance that sucks?  Because we don't have to do it, you know?</p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  Just, I'm going to suck it up, I didn't -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  No, you didn't suck it up because you gave in like a finocchio.</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Finocchio.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  To your little sniffles.</p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  I have 135 fever.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  OK.</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  That's right.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  You gave in to your 135 degree fever and provided all of us with a  weenie performance.</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Struggling, Rob, the last couple.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  It would be better if you said to me, Don, I don't feel great and I  would say, fine.  So every time you want off, I mean, you ever -- a problem  getting off when you need it?  Of course not, neither one of you.</p><p/><p> END</p><p/><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 85 to 11,140 and the S&amp;P 500 was off 9 to 1415, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was up a point and a half to just under 3548.\u00a0</p><p>Net stocks and small-caps were in the red. The Russell 2000 was down 2 to 464, while TheStreet.com Internet Sector was 4 lower to 1041.\u00a0</p><p>\"Based on all the normal measures -- and even the extreme measures -- of valuation and momentum and all these things, it's just off the charts in every way,\" said Robert Dickey, managing director of technical analysis at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. \"So we should be looking for a return to average soon.\"\u00a0</p><p>The traditional contrarian measures have been foretelling a pullback for some time now. One place technicians often look for signs of market tops is the options market. In particular, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index effectively tracks the level of fear in the market. In general, throughout 1999, the closer the VIX has gotten to 20, the better a selling point it's proven. But except for a brief stretch two weeks ago, the VIX has been tucked smugly in the low 20s since early November.\u00a0</p><p>Today's selling was making investors a bit more nervous, with the VIX lately sitting at up 0.97 to 22.03. But that's still far from fearful, and it would be very shortsighted to mistake today's action for a \"return to average.\" The losses on Wall Street toward midday are hardly denting the huge gains the market's seen recently, especially in the technology sector. Before today, the Nasdaq had gained 29.8% since mid-October. And the broader S&amp;P 500 had risen 14.1%, and the Dow 12%\u00a0</p><p>\"Measures are averages of extremes,\" Dickey said. \"Right now, we're at the extreme of extremes, and it's just bigger than what we've all seen in the past. I remember smaller, isolated incidents in the past, but not as broad as this. It's narrowly based, but narrowly based in a lot of stocks.\"\u00a0</p><p>Dickey's talking about tech, of course: \"If you look at something that doesn't have any tech in it, it stinks. The utilities, transports and many, many other groups and sectors just aren't participating. It's tech alone.\"\u00a0</p><p>Today, tech was taking a bit of a breather, especially chip stocks. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index was down 2.7%, while the Morgan Stanley High-Tech 35 had fallen a more modest 0.3%. But that contraction wasn't too much rotation into nontech sectors.\u00a0</p><p>U.S. Bancorp's (USB:NYSE) earnings warning yesterday is making the banking sector an unpopular place to be long, with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange/KBW Bank Index off 1.5% in an extension of its pullback from its mid-November highs.\u00a0</p><p>Transports were looking better, especially the airlines. The American Stock Exchange Airline Index was up 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Transportation Average was 0.2% higher. But drug stocks were continuing their recent downtrend, with the American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical Index 1.9% lower.\u00a0</p><p>\"Tech is the one area where the fundamentals seem intact,\" said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. \"So it continues to be the place to hide.\" And even with the mixed performance in the broader tech sector today, investors were piling into stocks like Cisco (CSCO:Nasdaq) and Yahoo! (YHOO:Nasdaq). Yahoo! will be joining the S&amp;P 500 after today's close. Cisco was lately up 2.9%, while Yahoo! had picked up a further 6.9% to crack 300 for the first time.\u00a0</p><p>Ultimately, in heady times like these, retail investors might do better to just mind their own business. Timing market tops is a delicate and difficult task. \"You get a watched-clock syndrome,\" Dickey said. \"And it doesn't matter anyway, because people don't buy 'the market.' The whole point is that people should be careful, and notice if their individual stocks start to turn. And individually, they're all over the place. That's what you've got to focus on.\"\u00a0</p><p>The bond market was moving higher after a Fed coupon pass and a benign speech by Fed boss Alan Greenspan. The 30-year Treasury was up 12/32 to 98 27/32, putting the yield at 6.21%.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed once again compared with its other key U.S. peers after suffering its worst week since March[1]. Along with big tech names, chip stocks were crushed too as tensions between the United States and China flared up.SPDR S&amp;#38;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) lost 2.7%, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) retreated 2.3%, small-cap iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) lost about 1.9% while the Nasdaq-100 fund Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) was off about 4.8% on Sep 8. Nasdaq is 10.03% below its closing record of 12,056.44 from Sep 2. The Nasdaq has now entered into the correction territory (see all technology ETFs[2] here).Apart from the overvaluation concerns, reports that U.S. sanctions could spread to businesses[3] like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China's largest chip fabricator, hurt the semis space on Sep 8. Over the weekend, talks were doing rounds that SMIC could join the U.S. 'entity list' like telecom equipment maker Huawei back in May.Stock-wise, Tesla lost 21.1% on Sep 8, in a sign to record its worst-day[4] ever. </p><p>The sharp crash came on the heels of the electric car maker's failure to make it to the S&amp;#38;P Dow Jones Indices. Shares of Apple recorded its worst three-day stretch since October 2008, according to Bespoke Investment Group, as quoted on CNBC. Is This a Chance to Dip the Toe in Tech Stocks? While President Donald Trump and some others see a vaccine as early as this year[5], nine biopharma CEOs are seeking a joint safety and efficacy pledge. On Sep 8, the CEOs of AstraZeneca, BioNTech, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson &amp;#38; Johnson, Merck, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer and Sanofi pledged to not seek approvals or emergency use authorizations for their vaccine candidates without conclusive positive data, per a source[6].The drugmakers will \"onlysubmit for approval or emergency use authorization after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities such as FDA,\" they said, per the abovesaid source. AstraZeneca plc said it has stopped a late-stage trial[7] of one of the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates after an unexplained illness in a volunteer.This means further uncertainty in the health emergency and the related economic recovery. This also ensures a prolonged period of social distancing norms and continued surge of digitization. No doubt, the Nasdaq had been a high-flying index this year, but the latest correction will help investors to dip their toe in the index and its tech components.Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few ETFs that could be bought right now. Nasdaq &amp;#38; Tech ETFs Nasdaq ETFs likeInvesco QQQQQQ[8], First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund QQEW[9] and Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index Tracking StockONEQ[10] can be bought on the correction.As long as tech ETFs are concerned, investors can buy low P/E or undervalued tech ETFs like Invesco S&amp;#38;P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF (RYT[11]) (P/E 19.92X),iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (IHAK[12]) (P/E 20.19X), First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund TDIV[13] (P/E 20.56X) and First Trust ISE Cloud Computing Index Fund SKYY[14] (P/E 21.98X). These funds have the lowest P/Es in the tech space. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index, however, showed some resilience to the virus attack and has managed to gain around 10% so far. However, other major stock market indices like Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;#38;P 500 index have lost around 10.3% and 6.6%, respectively, in the same period.Even since Mar 23, when the coronavirus worries had peaked, ravaging the stock market, the Nasdaq has recouped losses and gained more than 43% against Dow Jones Industrial Average index's recovery of around 37% and the broader S&amp;#38;P 500 index's 36% rise. Going by Dow Jones Market Data, for the second time since its foundation in 1971, Nasdaq has been able to outperform peers in the middle of the year (per a MarketWatch article[1]). The same phenomenon was last observed in 1977.It is being widely believed that the major technology companies' resilience to the coronavirus crisis must have supported the tech-heavy index. </p><p>Major technology stocks like FacebookFB[2], MicrosoftMSFT[3], AppleAAPL[4], NetflixNFLX[5] and AlphabetGOOGL[6] are all positive in 2020 so far. Moreover, Amazon AMZN[7] has supported the Nasdaq by gaining more than 45% in the year.In this regard, Ed Yardeni,president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, had once said that 'while we have all become even more dependent on the products and services provided by the FAANGMs during the Great Virus Crisis, they might have become more immune to government regulation. They have great balance sheets and generate lots of cash flow,' according toa CNBC article[8].Looking ForwardThe second half of 2020 is expected to keep facing the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic as the second wave of the outbreak is gathering steam. In the current scenario, the rising work-from-home and online shopping trend, increasing digital payments, growing video streaming and soaring video game sales are slowly becoming the 'new normal.' With the new trends making way, these major technology stocks are expected to continue to gain on rising demand for their products and services.Going on, even as the U.S. economy is reopening in phases and social-distancing restrictions are being eased, people are trying to minimize human-to-human contact. It's largely because the pandemic has resulted in some changes in the lifestyle and preferences of Americans. Most of the surveys have found that people are more interested in online shopping rather than visiting a brick-and-mortar store for their purchases of essential food items and supplies now. However, considering the surging number of coronavirus cases, some states have started to pause the reopening process in the United States. Notably, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has announced holding back of reopening plans.ETFs to GainInvestors seeking to ride the Nasdaq bulls could consider the following ETFs. These funds might see massive trading volumes in the days ahead if the afore-mentioned trends stay.Invesco QQQQQQ[9] \u2014 up 14.2% year-to-dateThis ETF provides exposure to 104 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq by tracking the Nasdaq-100 Index.

But the company paid a cost in terms of supply disruptions that led to demand for the phone outstripping supply on its launch debut. In-cell screens are tougher to produce, resulting in Sharp Corp., one of the suppliers, falling behind on delivery schedules and quality concerns.</p><p><br/> Don't Miss: Another Troll Attacks These Big Tech Companies. <br/> In an effort to create a cheaper route to regulatory compliance, Nasdaq\u00a0(NASDAQ:NDAQ)\u00a0launched a platform of the cloud created by Amazon Web Services\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) and dubbedFinQloud that allows the exchanges trading clients to store financial and regulatory data securely. According to NASDAQ, the data can now be stored and retrieved inexpensively and with ease.<br/> According to a regulatory filing with the SEC by Oracle\u00a0(NASDAQ:ORCL), Larry Ellison, who holds a 23.5% stake in the company, increased the number of shares of the company pledged as collateral from 40 million shares in 2011 to 139 million shares in 2012. The stock was pledged as \"collateral to secure certain personal indebtedness, including various lines of credit.\"<br/> A joint statement by UK-based liquor giant Diageo\u00a0(NYSE:DEO)\u00a0and Indian spirits group United Spirits Ltd confirms the two companies are in talks regarding the sale of a stake in the latter. No information was offered on the size of the stake, and there is no certainty that the discussions could lead to a conclusive deal. A transaction could lead to Diageo plcenhancing its presence in a major emerging market, and help the Indian group sort out the financial difficulties at its Kingfisher airline.<br/> Catalysts are critical to discovering winning stocks.

The Nasdaq tanked almost 18% from its all-time intraday high set in July, to settle at 4,268.76. It needs to fall to 4,185.55 to be in the bear zone, which will indicate a persistent drop of 20% or more from previous highs. Plunge in high flying tech stocks along with sell-off in biotech stocks continued to drag the tech-laden index into negative territory.A series of headwinds including the relentless slump in oil prices, slide in bank stocks, global growth worries and uncertainty about the timing of a Fed rate hike also weighed on investors' sentiment. They found solace in taking money out of equity markets and parking them in safe-haven assets like treasuries and gold.However, these fears that have resulted in selling and down-sizing stocks listed on the Nasdaq should work well for bargain-hunting investors. </p><p>They can now buy high-quality stocks at a discounted price. Investors should keep an eye on stocks that are positioned to grow in the near term, despite the initial hiccup. Analysts are also expected to be bullish on such stocks, with earnings estimates being revised on the upside.Tech Stocks Crash The Nasdaq is now dangerously close to the bear market level mostly due to the decline in FANG stocks. These stocks that helped the index to end in the green last year, failed to repeat their feat. Instead, shares of Facebook, Inc. FB[1], Amazon.com, Inc.AMZN[2], Netflix, Inc.NFLX[3] and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL[4] dropped 4.9%, 28.7%, 24.7% and 9.9%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.Their sky-high valuations were also a reason for putting off investors. In fact, carnage in these momentum names was led by LinkedIn Corp. LNKD[5]. Shares of this Internet stock were down 8.8% on Tuesday, a day after the company missed on earnings and issued a downwardly revised guidance.Amazon and Netflixare already in bear territory, while the other big tech bellwethers including Apple Inc.AAPL[6], Tesla Motors, Inc. TSLA[7] and Cisco Systems, Inc.CSCO[8] are succumbing to a bear market. Moreover, behind Nasdaq's atrocious performance this year was GoPro, Inc. GPRO[9]. Shares of this company engaged in producing wearable HD camcorders have plummeted 36.8% year to date. Overall, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) is down 9.5% on a year-to-date basis.Biotech's Sell-offSell-offs among biotech stocks is also taking a toll on the Nasdaq. Some biotech stocks such as Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD[10] and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. REGN[11] nosedived 13.8% and 32.6%, respectively, year to date. The broader iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (IBB) has decreased 26.6%.Analysts are continuing to speculate about the reasons behind this biotech crash. Fundamental issues such as drug price regulation, lackluster earnings results and a few merger deals may be having an adverse effect on biotech companies. Some also fear that presidential candidates might be presenting ways to curtail drug price increases while others believe that demand for medications in China might get hampered due to its slow economic growth.Macroeconomic HeadwindsChina plunged into a bear market territory last month, while it had surprised investors last year by devaluing its currency, which eventually led to a rout of $5 trillion in the nation's equity markets. Moreover, on Tuesday, the yield on 10-year government bonds in Japan slipped into negative territory for the first time ever. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 declined 5.4% yesterday.Global economic growth seems to be highly uncertain against the backdrop of falling oil prices. Global oil prices continue to move south as investors remain concerned about the persistent supply glut. The oil industry's woes escalate as storage levels turn into 'critical levels.' Moreover, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned on Tuesday that the global supply glut will grow further this year. Meanwhile, Iran had ramped up production levels after its ban got lifted.Additionally, bank stocks declined due to uncertainty over the rate hike and widening credit spreads. Investors worry that a Fed rate hike now will perpetuate more turbulence, slowing down the domestic economy further.5 Growth Stocks to Cash In on Downward TrendA plethora of risks including slowdown in the global economy, rate hike hysteria and broad-based sell-off in tech and biotech stocks has not only kept the Nasdaq firmly in correction territory but is also threatening to drag the index into a bear market.However, whether the Nasdaq will continue to plunge further depends on the pace of domestic economic growth. If the U.S. economy sinks into recession, then the tech-heavy index might fall deeper into the negative zone.But Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said that the probability of a recession this year is a meager 10%. Moreover, when it comes to tech and biotech stocks, they mostly have solid fundamentals and a strong profit trajectory. Since the long-term trends bode well for stocks listed on the Nasdaq, it would be wise to invest in such stocks that are poised to grow in the near term but are currently trading at a cheaper price. By purchasing stocks following a dip, investors are essentially buying shares at a discounted price.With the help of our new style score system[12], we have short listed Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks with a Growth Style Score of 'A' that hold immense growth potential despite declining in recent weeks.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WILLOW BAY, CNN ANCHOR: Tonight on MONEYLINE: the Nasdaq, swamped by a sea of red.  The index plunges nearly 200 points, re- testing recent lows.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STUART VARNEY, CNN ANCHOR: The biggest Nasdaq disaster: MicroStrategy.  In just 6 1/2 hours, the stock collapses, losing more than half its value: $13 billion wiped out.</p><p>BAY: Real pain also in the biotech sector.  Investor confusion drives the sector down sharply.  We begin our special series on a new frontier in medical science: genomics.  What is it and how does it work?</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is the MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR.  Reporting tonight from New York, Stuart Varney and Willow Bay.</p><p>BAY: Good evening.  Tech turbulence.</p><p>VARNEY: Good word.  The composite index posting its third-worst point drop ever today.  Weakness from new economy leaders like biotech and Internet stocks pushed the Nasdaq down more than 180 points. That's a loss of very close to 4 percent.  And that comes on top of last week's 5 percent sell-off as the index trims this year's tremendous gains nearly in half.</p><p>The composite index now up just 13 percent year to date.  That's sharply below its March high, when the index closed above 5,000 and was up more than 24 percent on the year.</p><p>But that's just half the story for tech stocks.  Over on the big board today, tech companies were among the biggest leaders: the winners, that is.</p><p>Rhonda Schaffler has more from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Wall Street's story of divergence took another twist today.  Now there's even a split within the technology sector.</p><p>In the midst of a Nasdaq route, which saw dozens of biotech and Internet stocks take double- and even triple-digit dive, investors bought brand-name techs, helping the Dow industrials extend last week's 6 3/4 percent gain.</p><p>The Dow rose 85 points to end at 10,680.  AT&amp;T, IBM, Hewlett- Packard, Intel and Nasdaq big-cap Dell all reached significant gains.</p><p>LARRY RICE, JOSEPHTHAL &amp; COMPANY: It's rotation.  It's almost typical end-of-the-quarter window dressing.  You know, people forget that we're at the end of the first quarter, and we're seeing a lot of the stronger stocks in Nasdaq, the quality stocks, if that's -- if that's possible, are being bought here, where a lot of the more speculative stocks in Nasdaq are being sold.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: The Nasdaq closed sharply lower, down 188 points. One major reason for the selling: a mind-boggling 140-point loss in shares of MicroStrategy after the business software maker said it would have to restate operating results for the past two years, turning previously announced profits into losses.</p><p>Biotech stocks such as Amgen, Biogen, Genome Therapies and Human Genome Sciences also suffered sever losses.</p><p>JOSEPH BATTIPAGLIA, GRUNTAL &amp; COMPANY: Investors are demanding from the real economy performance in terms of earnings and executing of business strategy.  And whenever there is a challenge to what your thinking is, these stocks pull back.</p><p>So we had a big challenge about Internet companies and cash flow. The stocks pulled back.  Last week, we had concerns about who really owns the human genome.  The stocks pull back.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: Some traders also blame today's pull-back and lighter than normal volume on interest rate jitters.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(on camera): Federal Reserve policy makers meet tomorrow, and a quarter point rate hike is widely expected.</p><p>What Wall Street has to wrestle with now is whether earnings will be strong enough to weather a rise in rates -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Rhonda Schaffler, reporting from the big board.</p><p>BAY: Taking a closer look at the market action.  It wasn't just the Nasdaq that fell deep in the red today.  The Dow transports, the Dow utilities and the AMEX all moved lower.  The S&amp;P 500 also in negative territory, down more than seven points to 1,456.</p><p>The sour mood carried over to the big board where decliners led advancers by a slight margin: 50 stocks hit new 52-week highs today; 37 fell to new lows.</p><p>The biggest loser of all on a percentage basis: the Russell 2000. The index of small-cap stocks fell more than 4 percent to close at 549.  The trigger for today's Russell 2000 sell-off, the same one behind the Nasdaq slide: a meltdown in shares of MicroStrategy.</p><p>Susan Lisovicz has more from the Nasdaq marketsite -- Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Willow.</p><p>Even on the Nasdaq, it's a rare session when a stock plummets 140 points in a single day.  But that's exactly what happened to MicroStrategy, losing nearly two-thirds of its value in a single day. Before the bell, the company announced that it had to restate '98 and '99 revenues to conform to SEC requirements.  That means a loss instead of a profit in '99.  Investors sold off big time.</p><p>But that's only one reason why the Nasdaq took such a big dive today.  Some analysts say the momentum is continuing from last week, a week in which the Nasdaq shed 5 percent while the Dow came back with a vengeance.  And that momentum hit its best-performing sector hardest: biotechs losing nearly 11 percent today.  And here's a good example.</p><p>Abgenix plunging 36 percent, 112-point decline today alone.  An article in \"Barron's\" questioned the long-term survival of some well- known Internet companies.  \"Barron's\" said they were burning cash: VerticalNet plunging today, down 17 percent, 37 points today alone. \"Barron's\" say it will face a major cash crunch if it doesn't raise additional capital by May.  Merrill Lynch disagrees with the assessment, saying it's on a clear path to profitability.</p><p>Bucking the trend today, Intel, which introduced its new Pentium III processor designed to power the delivery of audio, video, 3-D over the Internet.  It was up 5 1/8, but that was one of the aberrations today.</p><p>Decliners swamped advancers by about a 2-to-1 margin in a session that started out with positive breadth by the same margin -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Susan Lisovicz at the Nasdaq marketsite, thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, those Nasdaq losses have simply created another buying opportunity, so says our next guest.  Joining us now is Thomas Galvin.  He's the chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.</p><p>Tom, welcome back to MONEYLINE.</p><p>THOMAS GALVIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, DONALDSON, LUFKIN &amp; JENRETTE: Thanks.</p><p>VARNEY: Let's get this clear, shall we.  You are the chief investment officer of a major brokerage house and you are telling people go out there and buy tech stocks, correct?</p><p>GALVIN: I think that's right.  It's difficult to find the growth any place else in any other industry that you can find within technology right now, and people want to pay up for growth.</p><p>I think as far as the sell-off that we've seen, you have to keep in mind what time of the month and quarter it is.  I mean, we've got about one week left of trading.  You had the index, if you had annualized the recent gains, it would have almost been a double for the market this year.  So We covered a lot of ground in too short a period.  I think people want to take profits and savor the quarter gains while they can.</p><p>BAY: Tom, is it more than that?  I mean, are we seeing signs now that all is not well with techs?  For example, what we're calling the disaster du jour, MicroStrategy: Is that the tip of the iceberg?  Do other companies, new high-flyers, use those kinds of accounting methods?</p><p>GALVIN: Well, I think there's going to be continuing a lot of scrutiny.  We've seen a lot of transformation within the Nasdaq.  I mean, Dell and Microsoft are hot stocks two years ago.  They've gone cool.  The electronic broker stocks were hot.  Now, I think people are moving and filtering out and looking for the right business models and credibility, and they're going to get rid of the ones, obviously, that they have question marks on.  There's enough out there right now that they can stick with hopefully the good quality ones.</p><p>VARNEY: Negative No. 2: the burn rate at some of these newer, especially Internet companies.  They're burning through the money they've got available.  \"Barron's\" says a lot of them will be out of money relatively quickly, and we're talking a couple of hundred companies.</p><p>Surely, that's another negative for the tech sector?</p><p>GALVIN: Well, I would tell you this: I do think the \"Barron's\" article certainly played into some of the uncertainly in the marketplace and the worries.  Keep in mind that a lot of the burn rate is a result of capital spending going up to build out their infrastructures.  But of course, the capacity utilization of those build-outs right now are very low.</p><p>So if they really had to cut their capital spending, they still could grow into some of the infrastructure they're building.</p><p>I'm not disregarding that fact.  I do think overall ultimately probably a third of the Internet stocks will perish.  Probably a third will get consolidated and sell out, and I think a third will dominate their space.</p><p>I think right now on the NYSE year to date, a lot of the old economy stocks are also being filtered out in a similar proportion right now.  Some will not actively, I think, invest in technology, probably fall behind and die.  Some will consolidate, as we've seen in the paper industry, and I think the rest will dominate their space in the old economy.</p><p>BAY: There's more.  Still, you're putting your money in techs with all these negatives floating around right now?</p><p>GALVIN: I don't think it's that negative.  I, frankly, just came from a technology meeting.  Right now, components are in short supply. Demand from the software companies and the equipment companies is strong.  On the big board today, some of the hardware stocks were strong risers: Intel was up $4 today.</p><p>So again I think there's a sorting-out of technology, but certainly I think again you've got to filter out.  I think you're still getting strong growth, and I think people will pay up for that throughout this year.</p><p>VARNEY: We hear you, and Willow and I are not particularly skeptical.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But Thomas Galvin, thank you very much for being with us.</p><p>GALVIN: Thank you very much.</p><p>VARNEY: Good luck.  Our thanks.</p><p>BAY: Coming up on MONEYLINE, when you spend in cyberspace, should anyone collect a sales tax?</p><p>VARNEY: Plus Taiwan challenges Beijing with a vote for change. We'll look at the implications for business and for trade too.</p><p>BAY: And the new face of 3Com.  We will outline the makeover investors can't wait to see.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: There is word tonight that one of America's most famous businessman may also be somewhat cash-strapped.  According to the latest issue of \"Fortune\" magazine, sources say Donald Trump is trying to mortgage his Palm Beach palace, Mar-a-lago, I believe it's called, in order to repay a $26 million loan he took out from his casino company, Trump Hotels and Resorts.</p><p>The article also says that the company is saddled with so much debt and its stock is performing so poorly that insiders are talking about taking the company private.  The stock closed unchanged today at 3 1/4.</p><p>BAY: Donald Trump is not the only entrepreneur with possible cash-flow problems.  As we've been telling you, several Internet stocks took a huge hit today after a \"Barron's\" article questioned their long-term viability.  The report suggested that many Net companies are running out of cash and could soon go out of business or be forced to merge.</p><p>Among the companies \"Barron's\" points to: Kana Communications, PurchasePro.com, Pilot Network Services, MarketWatch.com and Secure Computing, all of which ended sharply lower today.</p><p>Merrill Lynch Internet analyst Henry Blodget said he has argued for nearly a year that up to 75 percent of Internet firms will never make money and will eventually disappear.  But Blodget still says there were flaws in the \"Barron's\" study.  He also disagrees with its choice of Net losers, including VeritcalNet, Amazon.com, Mypoint.com and EarthWeb.  Blodget said these companies have already found additional financing and now have enough cash to reach profitability. Despite his comments, the stocks still ended lower today.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, all right, here's another Web debate with billions at stake, and this one's about taxes.  A federal advisory panel meeting in Dallas appears to be deadlocked over recommendations for the future of Internet taxes.  But the e-commerce committee does agree on one item, which could score a big win for Internet service providers.</p><p>Bob Beard has more from Washington in tonight's \"Tech Watch.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB BEARD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The 19-member commission set up to advise Congress on Internet taxation is stuck on whether to tax online sales.  The chairman wants to extend the current tax breaks to 2006.</p><p>GOV. JIM GILMORE (R), VIRGINIA: I think there's a strong push to extend the moratorium.  Let's just make sure that it's not a fake moratorium, that it's a real one.</p><p>BEARD: But there's plenty of dissension.  Several committee members favor taxing online sales.</p><p>GOV. MIKE LEAVITT (R), UTAH: There needs to be a level playing field where those who shop in a retail store are treated in exactly the same way as those who shop over the Internet.</p><p>BEARD: The commission does appear to agree on simplifying state and local sales taxes and banning taxes on Internet access, a boon to the major Internet service providers, or ISPs.</p><p>BILL WHYMAN, LEGG MASON PRECURSOR GROUP: The big winners on this commission are AOL and Time Warner, as well as the other ISPs.</p><p>BEARD: Online sales are usually taxed only if the seller has a store or warehouse in the buyer's state.  Supporters of e-commerce taxes point to a study showing states will lose $2.7 billion in sales taxes this year from online sales, $10.8 billion in 2003.</p><p>BILL FOX, UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE: It's about 4 percent of the sales tax revenues in that year.  And so it's real money in terms of the funding of government.</p><p>BEARD (on camera): The commission wraps up tomorrow, when its expected to vote on recommendations to Congress for a final report due out April 21st.</p><p>Bob Beard, CNN Financial News, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Coming up, oil prices tumble in the trading pits\u2026</p><p>VARNEY: \u2026 as investors bet that OPEC will ease the global supply crunch.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: With a crucial OPEC meeting just a week away, oil prices took a nose dive today.  Light sweet crude sank $1.53 to $27.55 a barrel on hopes of a supply boost at next Monday's meeting in Vienna. U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, now on a second tour of OPEC states, says he's confident of an increase.</p><p>But will it be large enough or arrive fast enough?</p><p>For more on that, we are joined from Houston by former Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.  He now heads the Mosbacher EnergyCompany, an oil and gas production company.</p><p>Secretary Mosbacher, welcome.</p><p>ROBERT MOSBACHER, FORMER COMMERCE SECRETARY: Good to be here with you, Willow.</p><p>BAY: It seems as if there is consensus that there will be increase in production as a result of next week's meeting.</p><p>MOSBACHER: Yes.</p><p>BAY: Do you have any sense as to how much of an increase and to the timing of the increase?</p><p>MOSBACHER: Well, I think since the meeting starts March 27th, which is just a week away, that if the increase goes through, as we all anticipate -- and obviously that's what brought the price down -- that it will start right away.  So call it April 1st.  And it will start working its way into the system certainly in the next six weeks, perhaps two months.</p><p>BAY: Will even a small increase in supply help here?</p><p>MOSBACHER: Well, I think a small one doesn't help as much as a large one, but it will help some.  And, you know, they have to balance -- what they want to do is not lose all their additional income from this horrendous low price they had a year ago, but they also don't want to drive the economies of the consuming countries down.</p><p>So my guess is that the increase will be somewhere between what the consuming countries would like and what the producing countries would like to produce.  And so we're going to see somewhere around a million and a half, close to two million a day, I'd guess.</p><p>BAY: There's been a great deal of talk, as you know, about using the strategic petroleum reserves.  Do you think that's a good idea? And if you were in office, is that something you would be recommending?</p><p>MOSBACHER: No, it isn't.  I'll tell you why.  That was put there for an emergency, and it was put there for an interruption of supply. We haven't got anything close to that now.  What we've got is unusually high prices -- not as high relatively as they were tremendously low a year and a month ago, but we don't have any emergency now.  No, I wouldn't.</p><p>BAY: If you were facing, as they are now in Washington, a lot of heat from consumers who are paying a whole lot more at the pumps, what would you recommend?</p><p>MOSBACHER: I'd say that I'd empathize with those who are paying a lot more, but for them to look at it on a longer-term basis, I would guess that every indication is within the next two to four months, that prices will be down right about in the middle between the aberration of horrendously low prices and these high prices.</p><p>My guess is we'll see $20 to $25 oil over the next six months to a year, and gasoline prices halfway between their low of 90 some odd cents and the high of about $1.60.  So I would guess we'd be talking about probably something in the $1.30, which is really close to the norm.</p><p>BAY: Secretary Mosbacher, thank you for joining us tonight.</p><p>MOSBACHER: Nice to be with you.</p><p>VARNEY: And here's what we have for you still to come on MONEYLINE: Taiwan breaks with the past, and it's a dramatic vote.</p><p>BAY: We'll look at what that means for trade and for relations with China after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Washington is working overtime to ease tensions following Saturday's landmark election in Taiwan.  Chen Shui-bian, whose democratic progressive party supports independence from mainland China, won the presidency after five decades of nationalist party rule.</p><p>Protesters stormed the nationalist headquarters for a second day today, demanding the resignation of retiring president Lee Teng-hui. And Taiwan's fell: 2.6 percent, on fears of a confrontation with Beijing.  That, as Congress considers a proposed free-trade deal with China.</p><p>Tonight, top U.S. officials are in Beijing, which last week threatened a tough response.  And a White House emissary heads for Taipei this week.  For more now, we turn to Winston Lord, he's the former U.S. Ambassador to China and he joins us tonight on MONEYLINE.</p><p>Mr. Ambassador, welcome.</p><p>WINSTON LORD, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CHINA: Nice to be here.</p><p>VARNEY: Sir, if China were to respond to the Taiwan elections with any kind of military maneuvers, then the U.S. financial markets would probably take a hit.  In your opinion, Mr. Ambassador, will China make any kind of military response at all? LORD: Quick answer is no, not in the near future.  They don't have the capability to invade Taiwan.  Harassment of shipping or other military maneuvers is more likely, but even that's unlikely.  They don't want to jeopardize the vote in WTO and the U.S. Congress.</p><p>They don't want to hurt their own economy.  They would face a confrontation with the U.S.  They would unnerve their Asian neighbors. So, they're going to wait and see and so far, they've been moderate in response to the outcome of the election as has Mr. Chen himself.</p><p>VARNEY: But why did they fire those rockets across the Taiwan Strait -- those missiles -- as they did some time ago, when the current president of Taiwan first even talked about independence or the sovereignty of Taiwan?</p><p>LORD: Because they don't understand democracy.  They don't understand that the way to influence Taiwan or try to draw the people closer to China, is to have a smiling, to reform their own repressive political system, and not threaten Taiwan.  It backfired in '96.  I participated in the decision to send aircraft carriers there.  It backfired this time.  It probably helped Mr. Chen get elected.</p><p>VARNEY: So China's first priority here is getting into the World Trade Organization.</p><p>LORD: Well, Taiwan is it's overwhelming priority, but it's going to have to live with Mr. Chen for either four or eight years.  Chen has muted his rhetoric; called for a summit meeting; called for direct economic links with the mainland, which even its predecessor, who the Chinese didn't like, wasn't in favor of; and is willing to forego rhetorical formulations on independence that would upset Beijing.  So, so far, he's been moderate and Beijing has adopted a wait-and-see attitude after its very poor rhetoric during the election campaign.</p><p>VARNEY: What do you think America's long-term interest is? Should we be helping Taiwan as a democracy or helping the Communist government in Beijing to remain in control?</p><p>LORD: Well, obviously, we helped Taiwan as a democracy, even as we engaged holding our nose sometimes, the Chinese in Beijing, it's in our national interest.  So it's a delicate balancing act.  Six administrations of both political parties have followed it fairly successfully.  And we should continue to do that; make sure this thing is resolved peacefully; but not get in the middle; encourage the two sides to talk together.</p><p>VARNEY: Former ambassador, Mr. Winston Lord, we thank you very much for joining us tonight.</p><p>LORD: My pleasure.</p><p>VARNEY: Thank you, sir.</p><p>LORD: Thank you.</p><p>BAY: Time now for a look at the day's top stories outside the world of business.  Jim Moret has that in our \"MONEYLINE News Digest\" -- Jim.</p><p>JIM MORET, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you, Willow.</p><p>President Clinton today announced a crucial meeting on Middle- East peace scheduled to take place at the end of his visit to South Asia this week.</p><p>The president is back in India tonight after a one-day trip to Bangladesh.  On his way home Sunday, Mr. Clinton says he'll meet with Syrian president Hafez Assad in Switzerland to discuss the stalled Israel-Syria peace talks.</p><p>In Jordan, Pope John Paul II is on another landmark trip: the first papal visit to the Holy Land in 36 years.  He also heads for Israel and the Palestinian territories.</p><p>Also today, Hillary Rodham Clinton outlined a national review of behavior-altering drugs, like Ritalin, and their effects on children. The first lady says she is not attacking the drugs but warns that their booming popularity calls for a closer look.</p><p>In Baltimore, police reported gunshots in an apartment where a man has allegedly held three hostages since Friday.  Police say Joseph Palczynski shot at an armored personnel carrier outside and fired once inside the building.</p><p>Finally, in Los Angeles, a man looking for junk to salvage has unearthed Hollywood's lost treasure: 55 stolen Academy Awards.  Police say they have charged two shipping company workers with taking the Oscars.</p><p>We'll have more on those stories coming up on \"THE WORLD TODAY,\" 8:00 p.m. Eastern, and 5:00 p.m. Pacific -- Stuart, Willow.</p><p>VARNEY: Thanks, Jim, see you then.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, we'll have more MONEYLINE for you in just one minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: In tonight's headlines, a mighty sell-off for MicroStrategy, a stock that increased 45 fold in the past year crumbles on just one company announcement.</p><p>Life after Palm for 3Com.  The company unveils a makeover, but will Wall Street like what it sees?</p><p>And the business of mapping the human gene, tonight our special series on the new frontier in medical science, \"Genomics: From Code to Cash.\"</p><p>BAY: First, more on our top story: another Nasdaq wipeout.  It's as if the last two trading sessions never happened.  The Nasdaq's heady gains all but erased by today's near-200 point drop.  Investors slammed dot.coms and biotechs, pushing the index back down near correction territory.</p><p>The Nasdaq slid 188 points, its third biggest point drop ever, a loss of nearly 4 percent.  Crumbling biotechs also hurt the Russell 2000 small-cap index.  It fell nearly 4 1/2 percent.  But investors were looking for somewhere to put their money and again that meant the blue chips.  The Dow industrials jumped 85 points to close at 10,680.</p><p>The division between the Dow and the Nasdaq has become a common theme this year, but as Susan Lisovicz reports, that gap is closing quickly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Investors dumped Nasdaq stocks within an hour of the open and never looked up.  The sell-off accelerated into a nearly 4 percent rout and the composite's third worst one-day point loss ever.</p><p>KEITH MULLINS, SALOMONSMITH BARNEY: It was bloody.  As soon as the markets started to roll, the last week's losers just continued to accelerate their losses and the biotechs really led the way down, but they were followed by a lot of the technology stocks as well.</p><p>LISOVICZ: Triggering the fall, bad news from business software maker MicroStrategy, the biggest loser on the Nasdaq shed more than 140 points on word it will restate two years of operating results and report a loss instead of a profit.  Other victims included: Rambus down nearly 77 points, JDS Uniphase losing more than $8, and big tech names like Microsoft and Oracle also fell.</p><p>Adding to the down mood, a bearish article in \"Barron's\" predicting the burnout of more than 200 Internet companies, including CDNow, Drugstore.com and iVillage, all Nasdaq stocks.  But the session wasn't a total wash.  Intel gained 5 1/8 and Dell added more than a buck, and some observers think others will soon return to favor.</p><p>AL GOLDMAN, A.G. EDWARDS: The tech stocks will not drop down to levels where everybody would like them to go so they can buy them comfortably.  This is a group that everybody wants to own.  A lot of money has missed it and therefore I think the low in the Nasdaq will be sooner rather than later.</p><p>LISOVICZ: Another sector that's pulling the Nasdaq to its lows, biotechs, still reeling from last week's massive sell-off, especially companies working on genetic research.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISOVICZ: It was just two weeks ago when the Nasdaq closed above 5,000 for the first time, and to giddy investors there was even talk about the Nasdaq catching up to the Dow -- not anytime soon with this kind of selling.  The Nasdaq is down nearly 7 percent from that high set just 10 sessions ago.</p><p>I am Susan Lisovicz reporting live from the Nasdaq market site. VARNEY: Well, that drop in MicroStrategy stock was more like a meltdown really.  The company lost $13 billion in market value and it was a decline of about 60 percent, a swift and severe judgment by investors after the company said it would restate earnings to comply with SEC regulations.</p><p>Bruce Francis reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): MicroStrategy's CEO Michael Saylor grabbed headlines just five days ago with his plans to donate $100 million to establish an online university.  But now it's Saylor who is getting a lesson in accounting.</p><p>MicroStrategy is restating its revenues and results to conform with SEC rules.  The company will also postpone a secondary offering of shares.  The result, a take-no-prisoners sell-off.  More than 60 percent of the company's recently gained market value vanished in a single session.</p><p>BERT HOCHFELD, JOSEPHTHAL &amp; CO.: In order to produce the financial results that the investment community demanded to sustain the share price valuation, the company engaged in what I can only describe as highly questionable practices .</p><p>FRANCIS: Instead of the more than $200 million in revenues and 15 cents a share profit initially reported for last year, now MicroStrategy says it took in about $150 million and actually lost as much as 51 cents a share.  MicroStrategy's problem: prematurely counting revenue and profits on long-term contracts.</p><p>JAY STRUM, KAY, SCHOLER: The goods would be provided over time, the services would be provided over time.  But they're recognizing all the revenue today even though they're going to incur a substantial amount of the costs later on.  That violates the basic principle of accrual accounting.</p><p>FRANCIS: Those contracts are with a range of companies from Eddie Bauer to MCIWorldCom.  MicroStrategy's software helps its clients sift through customer data to develop better marketing programs.</p><p>CEO Michael Saylor blamed his company's accounting problems on a fast-growing business.  In a statement he said, \"As MicroStrategy has entered new markets, our business model has evolved very rapidly.  As a result, the business relationships we have entered into have become more financially complex.\" No one feels the pain more than Saylor, his one-day paper loss is greater than $6 billion.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: But Saylor's stake at MicroStrategy is still worth $3.8 billion.  So there still may be room for that pledge of $100 million for that online university -- Willow and Stuart. VARNEY: Yes, but look, the accounting practices that they employed, are they employed in a similar way by other high-tech start- up companies in which case it would be the tip of the iceberg?</p><p>FRANCIS: I think you're exactly right, Stuart, that we are going to see a lot of more scrutiny at accounting practices.  There are companies that are under lots of pressure to show they have got real revenues, real profits, and there is a lot of aggressive accounting going on out there.</p><p>VARNEY: Bruce Francis, thanks very much.</p><p>Well, there were in fact some haves and have not's in the tech sector today.  As smaller-cap stocks did indeed tumble, big-cap names performed rather well and they included: Intel, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Motorola, Micron Technology, all of them went up.</p><p>BAY: Coming up, 3Com beats the street and sets out a major restructuring.</p><p>VARNEY: A look at 3Com's latest plans as it gets used to life without Palm.  Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: A new face for 3Com on top of strong profit results, the stock is up a point and a half in after-hours trading after the networking company beat third quarter profit estimates by two cents a share, but the company announced even bigger news at a late meeting with analysts.</p><p>Greg Clarkin joins us now with more.  He's outside the Plaza Hotel here in New York City.  Greg, what do you have?</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Stuart, I'll tell you, a few weeks ago 3Com spun off its Palm division and since then Wall Street analysts have been wondering just what is next for this company?  Well, 3Com executives are in New York today.  They have been meeting with analysts here at the Plaza for the last three hours, where they're going over details of a dramatic restructuring.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARKIN (voice-over): 3Com is launching a vast restructuring, exiting some businesses, taking big charges and cutting thousands of jobs.  3Com is selling its dial-up modem business and it will simply stop making networking equipment for large corporations, a battle it had been losing to Cisco Systems.</p><p>DAVID POWERS, EDWARD JONES: Ultimately, I think a more focused strategy is more appropriate, and 3Com's strengths really lie in low- cost, high volume manufacturing, which is more suitable toward the consumer and small to medium-sized business markets.</p><p>CLARKIN: There will be big charges, $200 million to $300 million spread over the next two quarters to coverage the changes, and big job cuts, up to 3,000 jobs could be cut, close to 25 percent of 3Com's work force, but many workers will shift to the companies buying 3Com units.</p><p>In the wake of the recent spin-off of 3Com's Palm unit, analysts say 3Com was left with low growth, low-margin businesses.</p><p>PATRICK HOUGHTON, SUTRO CORP.: They do need to show some kind of pretty significant changes within the company to show where the growth story is going to be going forward.</p><p>CLARKIN: 3Com believes the growth is in the small and medium- sized business market, an area Cisco does not dominate.  3Com also announce a number of other moves, including a push into providing consumers with equipment for high-speed Web access.</p><p>All the moves are designed to convince investors 3Com is a growth story.  The stock has been choppy in recent sessions on speculation of a restructuring, and Wall street was waiting to see just what the company's next move would be.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARKIN: Now selling the modem business is a major retreat for 3Com.  This was a business that was bought from U.S. Robotics amid much fanfare back in 1997 for $9 billion.  Unfortunately, the speed at which those modems connect to the Internet topped out shortly after that, and this unit has been a drag on the company's bottom line -- Stuart, Willow.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, Greg, there has been some criticism of 3Com, that it lacked focus.  Do you think that this restructuring plan is designed to address that concern about focus?</p><p>CLARKIN: It definitely is, Stuart.  All day long today, analysts were saying they wanted to see this company really stop trying to be all things to all people in the networking business and focus on one area, and it looks like they've chosen the area that analysts were really very enthusiastic about.  That is the middle- and small-sized businesses, as well as consumers.</p><p>VARNEY: Greg Clarkin covering 3Com from the Plaza Hotel in New York.  Thanks, Greg.</p><p>BAY: In other corporate headlines tonight, Lehman's Brothers' quarterly profits more than doubled to a record.  Lehman earned $541 million on revenue of $2.2 billion.  Despite the blowout quarter, Lehman's stock fell more than 3 1/2.  But it has run up sharply over the past few weeks.</p><p>The consolidation continues in the regional banking business. National Commerce Bank Corp. is buying CCB Financial for $1.9 billion in stock.  The combined company will have more than 300 branches in the Southeast.  National Commerce stock fell more than 3.  The company is paying a 25 percent premium for CCB based on Friday's close.  CCB's stock rose almost one. And the 40-day strike by Boeing's engineers is officially over. The workers returned to their jobs today, after the union's rank and file approved a new three-year contract.  Now Boeing must get back up to speed.  The company missed at least 15 plane deliveries during the strike.  Boeing's stock fell fractionally.</p><p>VARNEY: And checking some of tonight's other stock price movers, Walt Disney up more than 2 1/2 points to a 52-week high.  Schroeder &amp; Co. upgraded the entertainment giant to its recommended list.  It also raised its price target to $47 a share, citing a turnaround in earnings growth.</p><p>Hewlett-Packard soared more than six.  Xerox and HP have settled all six patent infringement lawsuits against each other.  The company said they reach an amicable settlement but would not disclose the details.</p><p>Priceline.com sank more than 12 1/4 on a report that several hotels may launch a Web site to compete with Priceline by centralizing their offerings to consumers.  \"Barron's\" said the major airlines are also talking about a site, which could spell trouble for the name- your-own-price e-tailer.  But Priceline said the story is not new, and that the Web sites only effect online travel agencies.</p><p>BAY: Positive comments from one analysts helped push chips higher today.  Merrill Lynch repeated its buy rating on Cyprus Semiconductor.  It cited strength in the cell phone market and raised its 2000 profit estimates by 18 cents a share.  Shares of Cypress Semiconductor gained 3 1/2.</p><p>Intel soared more than five, the most active stock on the Nasdaq. Today, Intel introduced a new Pentium III chip to help boost audio, video and 3-D graphics over the Internet.</p><p>Motorola, Analog Devices and STMicroelectronics moved higher as well.</p><p>VARNEY: Just ahead on MONEYLINE, he's been credited with nothing less than saving the global economy from collapse.</p><p>BAY: But if Alan Greenspan hikes interest rates tomorrow, will it earn him more foes than friends on Wall Street?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's \"MONEYLINE Focus,: Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, the man so often praised by Wall Street and main street for protecting this record economic expansion.  But that praise lately has given way to criticism and second-guessing.  Tomorrow he and Fed policymakers are expected to raise interest rates for the fifth time in less than a year.</p><p>And as Peter Viles reports, Greenspan faces lots of questions about his latest war on inflation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): When he was cutting interest rates 16 months ago, investors loved him.  He was even credited with saving the world from financial ruin.  But now Alan Greenspan's war on inflation is growing messy and increasingly unpopular, partly because no one really knows what, if anything, Greenspan is trying to do to the stock market.</p><p>ROBERT SHILLER, AUTHOR, IRRATIONAL EXUBERANCE: He seems to be a little contradictory.  He says at times things that make you think he thinks the market is overpriced.  But when asked explicitly about it, he backs down and says, my opinion is no better than anyone else's. So it's hard to understand how he views the stock market as a feed into monetary policy.</p><p>VILES: Greenspan has said he believes the wealth effect from the stock market is contributing to the economy's strength.  Even after Monday's loss the Nasdaq is up 71 percent since Greenspan started raising rates last June.  But the Doe is down slightly in the same period, and some blame Greenspan fro the unusual split in the markets.</p><p>\"Business Week\" writes, quote, \"The bubble that the Fed has repeatedly warned against is being nurtured by the Fed's own policy of targeting stocks and wealth.\"</p><p>And \"The Wall Street Journal\" says confusion over exactly what Greenspan is trying to do is, quote, \"injecting fear, uncertainty and nervousness into the market.\"</p><p>But Merrill Lynch economist Bruce Steinberg argues Greenspan may be succeeding in slowing the market.  He points out the overall market, as measured by the Wilshire 5000, while up 12 percent since the Fed started tightening, has leveled off recently, while the economy continues to sprint ahead.</p><p>BRUCE STEINBERG, MERRILL LYNCH: What they're really concerned about ultimately is that from their point of view growth is just too fast right now.  First quarter growth is probably going to be around 6 percent, and the Fed thinks that the speed limit on the economy is probably around 3 3/4 percent.</p><p>VILES: In 12 years as Fed chairman, Greenspan has raised rates 23 times and has weathered plenty of criticism.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES: In 1994, for example, when the Fed raised rates six times, Greenspan was accused of, quote, \"taking away the punch bowl before the party had even started.\" Now clearly that criticism was wrong, because the \"party,\" the longest expansion in U.S. history, is still going strong -- Willow, Stuart.</p><p>BAY: Peter, I would gather the party sure is growing strong -- six percent growth?</p><p>VILES: That's what Merrill Lynch said today, and that is very strong growth. BAY: And very unusual at this time in the cycle.</p><p>VILES: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: It's unheard of, isn't it?</p><p>VILES: This early in the year, this late an expansion, very unusual.</p><p>VARNEY: Got it -- Peter Viles.</p><p>BAY: Peter Viles, thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, still to come: biotech burnout?  As investors begin to hit the sector hard we begin our series on the newest wave in medicine.</p><p>BAY: It's called genomics, and it's being used to fight everything from cancer to arthritis -- but should you be investing in it?</p><p>Our report, up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: A brutal sell-off today in the very sector that has led the Nasdaq to record highs this year: biotechs.  The Nasdaq biotech index sank 12 percent, although it is still up 23 percent in 2000.</p><p>It was a week ago today that air was first let out of the sector following an agreement between the U.S. and Britain to make genetic sequencing information public.</p><p>Here's today's damage: Amgen and Biogen both tumbled more than five points.  Abgenix got slammed.  It was down 112 1/2.  I'm reading that correctly, yes: 112 1/2.</p><p>Also down sharply, genomic stocks like InCyte Pharmaceuticals and Celera.  These stocks have tumbled from their 52-week highs, some of them down more than 50 percent.</p><p>BAY: Since that international agreement, the debate about the promise of genomics has grown louder.  Just what is it and why are investors rushing to cash in on this new frontier in science?</p><p>Tonight, we begin our special four-part series \"The Promise of Genomics: From Code to Cash.\" Our first report is from Steve Young on the business of mapping the human gene and how it works.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ground zero of the genomics revolution: It doesn't look very different from many other biology labs, but this is Curagen, one of about two dozen publicly traded biotech companies contributing to something that would have been considered science fiction just five or 10 years ago: nothing less than cataloging the 3 to 4 billion bits that make up DNA, the genetic blueprint.  It contains 23 pairs of chromosomes in the double helix found in all of us, and on those chromosomes, 100,000 to 150,000 human genes that make disease-fighting proteins.</p><p>MATT GELLER, CIBC OPPENHEIMER: Genomics is really the study of what the underlying building blocks that make up life is.  What are the underlying building blocks that make up life?  What is the secret code that evolution has figured out over billions of years to encode life?</p><p>YOUNG: Armed with that information, pharmaceutical companies believe they'll be able to expand the number of ways medical drugs can work in the body from 450 mechanisms to 2,500 and possibly as many as 10,000 potential candidates.</p><p>(on camera): The question is which are the good targets, the meaningful targets, the targets that will make drugs.  That's the key question, the question that will take time.</p><p>JONATHAN ROTHBERG, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, CURAGEN: Scientists who work in the field of genomics will be able to make drugs based on that knowledge against diseases such as cancer, auto-immunity, arthritis: diseases that account for the majority of suffering and diseases which we couldn't solve before.</p><p>YOUNG (voice-over): The genomics companies like to say genes make drugs and drugs make money.  But biotech has fallen short of its dreams before, and even those bullish on genomics urge caution.</p><p>GELLER: Usually your first draft is not a drug.  It isn't necessarily deliverable, either in a pill or an injectable form.  It may not last long enough.  It may have terrible side effects.</p><p>RICHARD VAN DEN BROECK, CHASE HAMBRECHT &amp; QUIST: I think before you start seeing a real wave of these drugs coming, I think we're probably about two years away from that, but it will be a steadily building trickle that turns into something more of a torment.</p><p>YOUNG: In some ways, Curagen looks like a 19th century textile mill or a 20th century auto assembly plant.  But in this 21s century information factory, computerized robots analyze, or sequence, samples to reveal their four most basic DNA components labeled A, C, G and T.</p><p>The deluge of data would seem like gibberish produced by a monkey on a typewriter if it weren't for a new speciality, bioinformatics. It uses computer science and information technology to mine the information in the genome.</p><p>ROTHBERG: We're actually formed at the intersection of information technology and biotechnology.  Our first adviser, it surprises people, was actually from Intel Corporation.</p><p>YOUNG: After cataloging the gene, scientists have to understand the protein associated with it.</p><p>TODD NELSON, DAIN RAUSCHER WESSELS: Think of genes as sentences but sentences that are only constituted by four letters.  And it's the order of those letters that go together -- that go together, excuse me, that allow you to describe what the protein does.</p><p>YOUNG: The true believers say genomics will be able to pick drugs that minimize side effects based on a person's own genetic makeup.  They say researchers will be able to weed out drugs that are going to fail earlier, focus on winners and move them along faster.</p><p>The private companies cataloging the human genome are racing with each other and a $3 billion federally funded project.  The first draft of the human genome is expected to be completed by this summer.  Then comes the harder job of functional gene analysis.</p><p>(on camera): The decoding of the human genome isn't the end, but it is the beginning of a whole new era.</p><p>Steve Young, CNN Financial News, New Haven, Connecticut.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Beginning of an era and certainly extremely complex, not just the science but the business of it as well.  So don't miss the second part of our genomics series.</p><p>VARNEY: Which is called \"Mapping the Future.\"</p><p>We're going to look at the companies at the forefront of this state-of-the-art science and what their research could mean for the future of medicine.</p><p>BAY: That is tomorrow right here on MONEYLINE.  But up next, \"Ahead of the Curve\": some of what you need to know tonight before the markets open tomorrow.</p><p>VARNEY: You're watching MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: You can probably sum up the action on Wall Street tomorrow in just two words, interest rates.  Federal Reserve policy- makers meet in Washington and they are widely expected to raise short- term rates by a quarter percentage point.  Look for that decision to come around 2:00 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>Also, the government releases the latest trade numbers for January, and look for profit reports tomorrow from Goldman Sachs, National Discount Brokers and Micron Technology.</p><p>BAY: That is MONEYLINE for this Monday.

The Dow Jones industrial average shed 632.42 points, or 2.3%, to close at 27,500.89. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped 95.12 points, or 2.8%, to settle at 3,331.84, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 465.44 points, or 4.1%, to end at 10,847.69. After an uptick that analysts say is atypical of September, U.S. markets plummeted Thursday and Friday, dragged down by the tech giants ahead of the long holiday weekend. The markets were closed on Labor Day. Big Tech lost big on Tuesday: Amazon gave up 4.4%, Facebook shed 4.1% and Google parent Alphabet fell 3.6%. Biotechnological firm Moderna, which is working on a coronavirus vaccine candidate, lost nearly 13.2%.\u00c2\u00a0 (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\u00c2\u00a0 Investors also are grappling with questions about U.S.-China trade, stymied coronavirus relief talks and growing worries about the November election, said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller &amp; Washington. </p><p>\"Each of these factors could imperil the narrative that has been baked into stock prices, which is a relatively quick economic rebound.\"\u00c2\u00a0 Tesla shares plunged 21.1% Tuesday after the S&amp;P 500, in a surprise move, passed on the carmaker. Investors in the high-flying electric car company had been banking on Tesla joining the benchmark index - its share price has been rising all summer. And the company's stock has rocketed more than 350% from the beginning of the year. In Tesla, which has garnered a passionate fan base, akin to a consumer electronics company or a comic book media property, many longtime investors see an industry-defining pioneer, whose vision for an all-electric future has forced larger, more established automakers to play catch up. The company boosted its prospects on Wall Street further by posting earnings of more than $100 million in July, its fourth consecutive quarter of profitability, a first for Tesla. Optimistic investors continued to pour money into the company, sending its market capitalization above corporate giants such as Home Depot and Intel. And in another summer milestone, Tesla surpassed the market value of Toyota, seizing the crown of the most valuable carmaker in the world, despite selling fewer than 400,000 vehicles last year, compared with Toyota's 10.74 million. But investors' hopes were dashed when S&amp;PDow JonesIndices, the company that oversees the S&amp;P 500, announced late Friday that it would not add Tesla to its widely tracked index. Instead, the e-commerce site Etsy, tech maker Teradyne and pharmaceutical company Catalent, will join the S&amp;P 500 effective Sept. 21. The index will delete tax preparation company H&amp;R Block, department store chain Kohl's and beauty brand Coty. The planned reorganization comes eight days after a major shake-up with the Dow, which dumped Exxon, Pfizer and Raytheon for Amgen, Honeywell and Salesforce. Adding Tesla had been \"viewed as almost a consensus move based on all the metrics that Tesla was likely to get into the S&amp;P 500 club this time around,\" Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities said in a note to clients after the S&amp;P's decision. Its omission \"thus will have a negative knee jerk investor reaction.\"\u00c2\u00a0 Ives said Tesla's profitability and earnings forecast were likely the deciding factors for excluding the company. But the snub for Tesla boosters was confounding. \"In a nutshell Tesla not getting into the S&amp;P 500 will be a head scratcher to the bulls that viewed this as virtually a lock given all the parameters met,\" he said. \"The market was undoubtedly surprised by the S&amp;P 500 Index Committee's decision not to include Tesla this quarter, despite announcing its fourth quarter of profitability and solidifying its eligibility for inclusion,\" said Nicole Tanenbaum of Chequers Financial Management. But the committee that makes the selections may have been focused on more than simply meeting the bottom line criteria, she said. Tesla's reliance on selling regulatory pollution credits to boost its profits and the uncertainty around its earnings stream may have weighed on the decision to leave the company out of the index, she added. In 2019, more than $11.2 trillion in assets were benchmarked to the S&amp;P 500, according to an estimate from S&amp;PDow JonesIndices. A special S&amp;P committee determines which companies populate the index based on a variety of factors, but meeting the necessary criteria does not guarantee inclusion. S&amp;P said in a news release Friday that it was also changing the lineup to its mid- and small-cap indexes. As for the three companies that did make the list, Tanenbaum said there's an arguable logic behind their additions. \"Despite the companies smaller sizes, each has delivered a consistent track record of profitability,\" she said. The three companies that were deleted from the S&amp;P 500 will drop down into the lower capitalization index, the S&amp;P MidCap 400. \u00c2\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NTION-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NTION2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X0-Y2H1-JCBN-014J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nation News Network Co., Ltd.

The Dow Jones industrial average shed 632.42 points, or 2.3%, to close at 27,500.89. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped 95.12 points, or 2.8%, to settle at 3,331.84, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 465.44 points, or 4.1%, to end at 10,847.69. After an uptick that analysts say is atypical of September, U.S. markets plummeted Thursday and Friday, dragged down by the tech giants ahead of the long holiday weekend. The markets were closed on Labor Day. Big Tech lost big on Tuesday: Amazon gave up 4.4%, Facebook shed 4.1% and Google parent Alphabet fell 3.6%. Biotechnological firm Moderna, which is working on a coronavirus vaccine candidate, lost nearly 13.2%.\u00c2\u00a0 (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\u00c2\u00a0 Investors also are grappling with questions about U.S.-China trade, stymied coronavirus relief talks and growing worries about the November election, said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller &amp; Washington. </p><p>\"Each of these factors could imperil the narrative that has been baked into stock prices, which is a relatively quick economic rebound.\"\u00c2\u00a0 Tesla shares plunged 21.1% Tuesday after the S&amp;P 500, in a surprise move, passed on the carmaker. Investors in the high-flying electric car company had been banking on Tesla joining the benchmark index - its share price has been rising all summer. And the company's stock has rocketed more than 350% from the beginning of the year. In Tesla, which has garnered a passionate fan base, akin to a consumer electronics company or a comic book media property, many longtime investors see an industry-defining pioneer, whose vision for an all-electric future has forced larger, more established automakers to play catch up. The company boosted its prospects on Wall Street further by posting earnings of more than $100 million in July, its fourth consecutive quarter of profitability, a first for Tesla. Optimistic investors continued to pour money into the company, sending its market capitalization above corporate giants such as Home Depot and Intel. And in another summer milestone, Tesla surpassed the market value of Toyota, seizing the crown of the most valuable carmaker in the world, despite selling fewer than 400,000 vehicles last year, compared with Toyota's 10.74 million. But investors' hopes were dashed when S&amp;PDow JonesIndices, the company that oversees the S&amp;P 500, announced late Friday that it would not add Tesla to its widely tracked index. Instead, the e-commerce site Etsy, tech maker Teradyne and pharmaceutical company Catalent, will join the S&amp;P 500 effective Sept. 21. The index will delete tax preparation company H&amp;R Block, department store chain Kohl's and beauty brand Coty. The planned reorganization comes eight days after a major shake-up with the Dow, which dumped Exxon, Pfizer and Raytheon for Amgen, Honeywell and Salesforce. Adding Tesla had been \"viewed as almost a consensus move based on all the metrics that Tesla was likely to get into the S&amp;P 500 club this time around,\" Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities said in a note to clients after the S&amp;P's decision. Its omission \"thus will have a negative knee jerk investor reaction.\"\u00c2\u00a0 Ives said Tesla's profitability and earnings forecast were likely the deciding factors for excluding the company. But the snub for Tesla boosters was confounding. \"In a nutshell Tesla not getting into the S&amp;P 500 will be a head scratcher to the bulls that viewed this as virtually a lock given all the parameters met,\" he said. \"The market was undoubtedly surprised by the S&amp;P 500 Index Committee's decision not to include Tesla this quarter, despite announcing its fourth quarter of profitability and solidifying its eligibility for inclusion,\" said Nicole Tanenbaum of Chequers Financial Management. But the committee that makes the selections may have been focused on more than simply meeting the bottom line criteria, she said. Tesla's reliance on selling regulatory pollution credits to boost its profits and the uncertainty around its earnings stream may have weighed on the decision to leave the company out of the index, she added. In 2019, more than $11.2 trillion in assets were benchmarked to the S&amp;P 500, according to an estimate from S&amp;PDow JonesIndices. A special S&amp;P committee determines which companies populate the index based on a variety of factors, but meeting the necessary criteria does not guarantee inclusion. S&amp;P said in a news release Friday that it was also changing the lineup to its mid- and small-cap indexes. As for the three companies that did make the list, Tanenbaum said there's an arguable logic behind their additions. \"Despite the companies smaller sizes, each has delivered a consistent track record of profitability,\" she said. The three companies that were deleted from the S&amp;P 500 will drop down into the lower capitalization index, the S&amp;P MidCap 400. \u00c2\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NTION-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NTION2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WY-M9K1-DYTP-P3P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nation News Network Co., Ltd.

The Dow Jones industrial average shed 632.42 points, or 2.3%, to close at 27,500.89. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped 95.12 points, or 2.8%, to settle at 3,331.84, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 465.44 points, or 4.1%, to end at 10,847.69. After an uptick that analysts say is atypical of September, U.S. markets plummeted Thursday and Friday, dragged down by the tech giants ahead of the long holiday weekend. The markets were closed on Labor Day. Big Tech lost big on Tuesday: Amazon gave up 4.4%, Facebook shed 4.1% and Google parent Alphabet fell 3.6%. Biotechnological firm Moderna, which is working on a coronavirus vaccine candidate, lost nearly 13.2%.\u00c2\u00a0 (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\u00c2\u00a0 Investors also are grappling with questions about U.S.-China trade, stymied coronavirus relief talks and growing worries about the November election, said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller &amp; Washington. </p><p>\"Each of these factors could imperil the narrative that has been baked into stock prices, which is a relatively quick economic rebound.\"\u00c2\u00a0 Tesla shares plunged 21.1% Tuesday after the S&amp;P 500, in a surprise move, passed on the carmaker. Investors in the high-flying electric car company had been banking on Tesla joining the benchmark index - its share price has been rising all summer. And the company's stock has rocketed more than 350% from the beginning of the year. In Tesla, which has garnered a passionate fan base, akin to a consumer electronics company or a comic book media property, many longtime investors see an industry-defining pioneer, whose vision for an all-electric future has forced larger, more established automakers to play catch up. The company boosted its prospects on Wall Street further by posting earnings of more than $100 million in July, its fourth consecutive quarter of profitability, a first for Tesla. Optimistic investors continued to pour money into the company, sending its market capitalization above corporate giants such as Home Depot and Intel. And in another summer milestone, Tesla surpassed the market value of Toyota, seizing the crown of the most valuable carmaker in the world, despite selling fewer than 400,000 vehicles last year, compared with Toyota's 10.74 million. But investors' hopes were dashed when S&amp;PDow JonesIndices, the company that oversees the S&amp;P 500, announced late Friday that it would not add Tesla to its widely tracked index. Instead, the e-commerce site Etsy, tech maker Teradyne and pharmaceutical company Catalent, will join the S&amp;P 500 effective Sept. 21. The index will delete tax preparation company H&amp;R Block, department store chain Kohl's and beauty brand Coty. The planned reorganization comes eight days after a major shake-up with the Dow, which dumped Exxon, Pfizer and Raytheon for Amgen, Honeywell and Salesforce. Adding Tesla had been \"viewed as almost a consensus move based on all the metrics that Tesla was likely to get into the S&amp;P 500 club this time around,\" Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities said in a note to clients after the S&amp;P's decision. Its omission \"thus will have a negative knee jerk investor reaction.\"\u00c2\u00a0 Ives said Tesla's profitability and earnings forecast were likely the deciding factors for excluding the company. But the snub for Tesla boosters was confounding. \"In a nutshell Tesla not getting into the S&amp;P 500 will be a head scratcher to the bulls that viewed this as virtually a lock given all the parameters met,\" he said. \"The market was undoubtedly surprised by the S&amp;P 500 Index Committee's decision not to include Tesla this quarter, despite announcing its fourth quarter of profitability and solidifying its eligibility for inclusion,\" said Nicole Tanenbaum of Chequers Financial Management. But the committee that makes the selections may have been focused on more than simply meeting the bottom line criteria, she said. Tesla's reliance on selling regulatory pollution credits to boost its profits and the uncertainty around its earnings stream may have weighed on the decision to leave the company out of the index, she added. In 2019, more than $11.2 trillion in assets were benchmarked to the S&amp;P 500, according to an estimate from S&amp;PDow JonesIndices. A special S&amp;P committee determines which companies populate the index based on a variety of factors, but meeting the necessary criteria does not guarantee inclusion. S&amp;P said in a news release Friday that it was also changing the lineup to its mid- and small-cap indexes. As for the three companies that did make the list, Tanenbaum said there's an arguable logic behind their additions. \"Despite the companies smaller sizes, each has delivered a consistent track record of profitability,\" she said. The three companies that were deleted from the S&amp;P 500 will drop down into the lower capitalization index, the S&amp;P MidCap 400. \u00c2\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NTION-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NTION2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T0-1SD1-JCBN-018C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nation News Network Co., Ltd.

The Dow Jones industrial average shed 632.42 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 27,500.89. The Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 index dropped 95.12 points, or 2.8 percent, to settle at 3,331.84, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 465.44 points, or 4.1 percent, to end at 10,847.69.   After an uptick that analysts say is atypical of September, U.S. markets plummeted Thursday and Friday, dragged down by the tech giants ahead of the long holiday weekend. The markets were closed on Labor Day.   Big Tech lost big on Tuesday: Amazon gave up 4.4 percent, Facebook shed 4.1 percent and Alphabet fell 3.6 percent. And biotechnological firm Moderna, which is working on a coronavirus vaccine candidate, lost nearly 13.2 percent. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)   Investors also are grappling with questions about U.S.-China trade, stymied coronavirus relief talks and growing worries about the November election, said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller &amp; Washington. \u201cEach of these factors could imperil the narrative that has been baked into stock prices, which is a relatively quick economic rebound.\u201d   Tesla shares plunged 21.1 percent Tuesday after the S&amp;P 500, in a surprise move, passed on the carmaker . Investors in the high-flying electric car company had been banking on Tesla joining the benchmark index \u2014 its share price has been rising all summer. And the company\u2019s stock has rocketed more than 350 percent from the beginning of the year.   In Tesla, which has garnered a passionate fan base, akin to a consumer electronics company or a comic book media property, many longtime investors see an industry-defining pioneer, whose vision for an all-electric future has forced larger, more established automakers to play catch up. The company boosted its prospects on Wall Street further by posting earnings of more than $100 million in July, its fourth consecutive quarter of profitability, a first for Tesla.   Optimistic investors continued to pour money into the company, sending its market capitalization above corporate giants like Home Depot and Intel. And in another summer milestone, Tesla surpassed the market value of Toyota, seizing the crown of the most valuable carmaker in the world, despite selling fewer than 400,000 vehicles last year, compared to Toyota\u2019s 10.74 million.   But investors\u2019 hopes were dashed when S&amp;PDow JonesIndices, the company that oversees the S&amp;P 500, announced late Friday it would not add Tesla to its widely tracked index. Instead, the e-commerce site Etsy, tech maker Teradyne and pharmaceutical company Catalent, will join the S&amp;P 500 effective Sept. 21. The index will delete tax preparation company H &amp; R Block, department store chain Kohl\u2019s and beauty brand Coty. The planned reorganization comes just eight days after a major shake-up with the Dow , which dumped Exxon, Pfizer and Raytheon for Salesforce, Amgen and Honeywell.   Adding Tesla had been \u201cviewed as almost a consensus move based on all the metrics that Tesla was likely to get into the S&amp;P 500 club this time around,\u201d Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities said in a note to clients after the S&amp;P\u2019s decision. Its omission \u201cthus will have a negative knee jerk investor reaction.\u201d   Ives said Tesla\u2019s profitability and earnings forecast were likely the deciding factors for excluding the company. But the snub for Tesla boosters was confounding. \u201cIn a nutshell Tesla not getting into the S&amp;P 500 will be a head scratcher to the bulls that viewed this as virtually a lock given all the parameters met,\u201d he said.   \u201cThe market was undoubtedly surprised by the S&amp;P 500 Index Committee\u2019s decision not to include Tesla this quarter, despite announcing its fourth quarter of profitability and solidifying its eligibility for inclusion,\u201d said Nicole Tanenbaum of Chequers Financial Management. But the committee that makes the selections may have been focused on more than simply meeting the bottom line criteria, she said. Tesla\u2019s reliance on selling regulatory pollution credits to boost its profits and the uncertainty around its earnings stream may have weighed on the decision to leave the company out of the index, she added.   In 2019, more than $11.2 trillion in assets were benchmarked to the S&amp;P 500, according to an estimate from S&amp;PDow JonesIndices. A special S&amp;P committee determines which companies populate the index based on a variety of factors, but meeting the necessary criteria does not guarantee inclusion. S&amp;P said in a news release Friday it was also changing the lineup to its mid- and small-cap indexes.   As for the three companies that did make the list, Tanenbaum said there\u2019s an arguable logic behind their additions. \u201cDespite the companies smaller sizes, each has delivered a consistent track record of profitability,\u201d she said. The three companies that were deleted from the S&amp;P 500 will drop down into the lower capitalization index, the S&amp;P MidCap 400.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43029775077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SY-T571-JCSC-J1Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC000CME0</classCode><className>ELECTRIC CAR CO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

Reporting tonight from New York, Stuart Varney.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome to MONEYLINE.  Willow is off tonight.</p><p>A year ago, just a few tech insiders knew much about a company called JDS Uniphase.  A year later, it is one of the Nasdaq's most important stocks.  And today, the company pulled off the biggest deal the high-tech world has ever seen.  JDS, which makes gear for optical networks, said it would buy its rival SDL for $41 billion at a hefty premium.  That may be one reason investors sent JDS shares down more than 15 points to 101 1/8, a loss of 13 percent.  It was the Nasdaq's most active issue.</p><p>SDL surged 25 1/2, to just under 320 3/4.</p><p>Bruce Francis looks at whether the companies can really seal this deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The companies that help move information at the speed of light are consolidating almost as fast.</p><p>Just a year after JDS Uniphase started trading as a unified company and just a week after it closed a $15 billion deal for E-TEK, JDS Uniphase announced it is buying SDL for $41 billion in stock, in what would be the highest price for a technology merger ever.</p><p>The $41 billion price tag represents more than a 50 percent premium over Friday's closing price of SDL.</p><p>JOZEF STRAUS, CEO, JDS UNIPHASE: We thought the price reflects the opportunities in front of us, opportunities which we're going to provide to our customers, our shareholders, as well as all the stakeholders in the company.</p><p>FRANCIS: The deal unites two tech high-fliers at a time when investors have been bullish about the worldwide build-out of high- speed optical networks for voice, video and data.</p><p>DREW PECK, S.G. COWEN: In the case of JDS Uniphase, you're using one inflated stock to buy another.  So in that regard, it probably does make sense.</p><p>FRANCIS: Both companies make light amplifiers, devices that boost the light impulses that carry digital data speeding through fiber-optic lines.  Combined, the companies would have approximately 80 percent of that market, something that could send up a red flag with regulators.</p><p>They're going to take a rather jaundiced view of these two companies getting together because it is such an important part of the market.  It may be arcane and complex, but you can't have fiber optic networks proliferate without these amplifiers, and these two companies together would pretty much monopolize that market.</p><p>FRANCIS: But not all analyst agree.</p><p>DAVID WONG, PAINEWEBBER: There a good argument to believe that it will be passed by regulators.  We've seen a recent example of this, the JDS Uniphase acquisition of E-TEK.  The combined company will be able to produce more material that customers need than the two customers separately.  I think it's a similar situation with SDL and JDS Uniphase.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: On a conference call this morning, the company said that they expect the deal to be approved by the end of September, and they declined to speculate about possible concessions to regulators. But this one is controversial from the start.</p><p>VARNEY: It is indeed.  Bruce Francis, thank you.</p><p>While both JDS Uniphase and SDL are up strongly in what's been a tumultuous year for Nasdaq stocks, their returns over the past 52 weeks are nothing short of astounding.  Listen to this.  Since last July, JDS shares are up nearly 400 percent, even when you count in today;s double-digit point loss.  And SDL has rocketed more than 1,000 percent.  Compare that to the broader Nasdaq, up just 42 percent over the past year.</p><p>Those scorching rallies in JDS and SDL are testament to the recent craze over the fiber-optics business.  The technology is complicated enough to make your eyes glaze over.  But the reason companies are anxious to set up these systems is not: They are desperate to speed up traffic on the Net.</p><p>Fred Katayama reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Undersea and underground, telecom companies are racing to deploy fiber optics.  The pulses of light that run through these cables carry data, voice and video at speeds 1,000 times faster than through the copper wires used for cable TV.  Driving demand: the Internet.</p><p>MARABEL LOPEZ, FORRESTER RESEARCH: Clearly the growth of the Internet is requiring service providers to build a lot more bandwidth, and that's why they want optical products.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Fiber optics expands a bandwidth capacity anywhere from 40 to 160 times.  More bandwidth enables consumers to get high- speed delivery of Internet services called broadband.  The hot fiber technology spurring the industry now is DWDM: short for Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing.  It packs more information into a single strand of fiber, adding capacity by using different colors of light.</p><p>Analysts say deployment takes place in three stages.  Long distance carriers began laying down optical fiber to build the Internet backbone in the late 1990s.  But that build-out is soon expected to slow.  Taking up the slack, wiring the metropolitan areas, mostly to connect business from one city to another.  The industry has only begun that, spurred by cascading costs for optical gear.</p><p>The final goal: fiber to the home.  But analysts say that's not expected to happen in the United States for another five to 10 years.</p><p>CHARLES WILLHIOT, J.P. MORGAN: I think we're actually in the very early innings of the fiber-optics game.  If it's a baseball game, we're talking about the first or second inning.  We've really only penetrated some of the long-distance networks to the U.S.  We haven't penetrated the metropolitan areas, we're just beginning to penetrate Europe, and we haven't really touched Asia.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) KATAYAMA: That global demand for bandwidth is expected to nearly double each year for the next five years.  As one analyst put it in his report, bandwidth is a lot like money: one can never have enough.</p><p>It's no wonder, Stuart, that investors are aglow over fiber optics.</p><p>VARNEY: I'm with you there, lad.</p><p>Fred Katayama, thanks very much.</p><p>Well today's tech merger did little to energize the overall markets today.  In fact, it was an old-economy stock that helped lift the Dow industrials: ALCOA, one of the best-performing Dow stocks today, after it beat second-quarter profit estimates.</p><p>The Dow industrials gained 10 points to close at 10647, this after gaining more than 150 points on Friday.</p><p>Over on the Nasdaq, weakness in JDS Uniphase weighed on other tech stocks, and that pushed the Nasdaq down nearly 43 points.  It closed at 3980.  But today's better-than-expected report from ALCOA could set the tone for what many expect will be a strong earnings season and perhaps a strong summer rally.</p><p>Greg Clarkin reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): \"This bull run has just a few more days to go.\" \"This one could last a lot longer.\" That's the sentiment of some of Wall Street's most vocal bulls who say they see nothing to derail stocks in the near term.</p><p>TOM GALVIN, DONALDSON, LUFKIN &amp; JENRETTE: I don't think bull markets end because of old age.  I don't think they end because of high P/Es.  They end because of a major resurgence in inflation.  And 2 to 3 percent inflation is not adequate enough to deride this bull market, particularly when you've got earnings growth in the strong double-digit areas and a Fed that continues to be vigilant.</p><p>CLARKIN: And others say strip away the holding pattern the Dow and the Nasdaq have been in, and the market have been strong.</p><p>LARRY WACHTEL, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: Its base decline line right now is the highest level since February.  So while people are talking about the sideways movement in the Dow or the recalcitrant movement in the Nasdaq, the market representing all the stocks has been doing quite well.</p><p>CLARKIN: And while it was a lackluster day for the indices -- the Dow gained 10 points, the Nasdaq lost 42 -- there were stand outs.</p><p>Shares of brokerage houses rose on hopes of a summer rally. Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers reflected that.</p><p>ALCOA, the first Dow component to release its quarterly report card, set a positive tone by beating earnings estimates.</p><p>Home Depot opened store No. 1,000 and its stock rose.</p><p>And semiconductor maker Advanced Microdevices rose on upbeat analysts' comments, something the entire tech sector could be seeing in the coming weeks.</p><p>AL GOLDMAN, A.G. EDWARDS: The No. 1 sector has been and will again be technology.  This is the sector best positioned to grow their earnings.  Most shares are down substantially because of the tech wreck experienced this spring.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARKIN: And the catalyst for the tech sector is expected to be a string of solid earnings reports over the next few weeks.  Hundreds of companies will reveal their latest results.  One of the most closely watched will come tomorrow, when Yahoo! reports after the closing bell -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, that's a key one, isn't it.</p><p>CLARKIN: It is.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, we'll watch it.  Thanks very much, Greg Clarkin.</p><p>We have late word tonight of more wheeling and dealing in the telecom business.  The \"Financial Times\" is reporting that Deutsche Telekom has made an offer for Voicestream Wireless worth more than $30 billion.  The paper says this does not prevent the German telecom company from also going after Sprint, just weeks after U.S. regulators sought to block WorldCom's buy-out of Sprint, the U.S. long-distance giant.</p><p>France Telecom and SBC Communications are also said to be interested in Voicestream, but the \"FT\" says Deutsche Telekom is holding the most advanced talks.</p><p>Still to come on MONEYLINE, Applied Materials says it has a way to boost the power of chips.  We'll talk to the CEO about the prospects for the product and his company.</p><p>Plus, the FTC files suit against Toysmart.com.  Did the Web retailer break a promise and sell personal information about its customers?</p><p>And closing arguments in a landmark case against the tobacco industry: how much the plaintiffs are asking for and how much the tobacco industry can afford to lose.</p><p>We'll be back.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: From CNN's New York headquarters, this is THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: In tonight's \"Tech Watch,\" it is being billed as the world's largest trade show ever for the chip equipment industry, and today at Semicon-West, Applied Materials unveiled new chip-making systems that will help create more powerful semiconductors.  But the future strength of the chip industry is a matter of intense debate on Wall Street.  Just last week, analysts clashed over the prospects for the sector.  Despite last week's volatility, shares of chip bellwether Applied Materials have more than doubled, but they are still trading below their 52-week high.</p><p>Well, joining us now from San Francisco: the company's chairman and chief executive, James Morgan.</p><p>Mr. Morgan, welcome back to MONEYLINE.</p><p>JAMES C. MORGAN, CEO, APPLIED MATERIALS: Thank you, Stuart. Great to be here.</p><p>VARNEY: Now there is this intense debate about whether or not the semiconductor industry is beginning a slowdown phase.  As we said there, one analyst came out strongly last week saying, yes, it's slowing down.  You're in the middle of it.  Is the growth rate of this industry truly slowing now?</p><p>MORGAN: Well, I think you have to look at the overall perspective for the industry.  I mean, you just had the discussion in the -- earlier in the show about the impact that fiber's going to have.  What we see is that the Internet and the information age is just beginning.  Think about the fact that only 2 percent of the people in the world have a PC, and only about 7 percent a cell phone. So just with those two statistics, we have a great growth opportunity over the next several decades.</p><p>VARNEY: Well let me press the point, because we're not really referring to several decades, we're referring to the next six to nine months.  I mean, do you see a cyclical change, a cyclical slowdown in that time frame?</p><p>MORGAN: Well, I just talked to most of our customers today at our trade show here and also in traveling around the world the last month.  And they see the next couple years as being good opportunities for them because of the broadening demand for semiconductors for all applications.  And for our particular segment of the industry, our announcement today about the equipment to make semiconductors that are the 300-millimeter, which is moving from a kind of a salad plate size to a dinner plate size wafer on which the chips are made, means that our customers will -- should be investing for the next several years to upgrade their technology, because this in effect obsoletes a lot of the older technology that they have in place to make chips.</p><p>VARNEY: Now you're going from the 200-millimeter size chip to the 300-millimeter size.  Can you explain to me, a complete layman, why this is such a big deal?</p><p>MORGAN: Well, it enables you to get a little over twice as many chips off of a wafer, and so as a result you can substantially reduce the cost.  And so that enables us to continue to make chips more powerful and more portable and, of course, a lot more affordable.  And so it will continue to expand the market for semiconductor chips and make growth of our industry, the equipment and materials industry, enable it to grow over the years ahead.</p><p>VARNEY: Who is at the cutting edge of manufacturing technology in your industry now?  It used to be the Japanese, is it now America?</p><p>MORGAN: Well, I -- what's happening is that people like us are providing the cutting-edge technology for wafer processing to build semiconductors.  So our customers, like Intel, TSMC and Samsung, Micron, ST in Europe, all these companies buy our equipment because we make every chip every day everywhere in the world.  And so as a result, we have developed a lot of the technology for the industry, working in partnership with our customers.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, James Morgan, Applied Materials, thanks for being with us, sir.</p><p>MORGAN: Thank you, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: OK.</p><p>From the high-tech chips of the new economy, to an old-economy giant: Later on MONEYLINE, we'll talk to the CEO of Honeywell, Michael Bonsignore, about his company's latest profit warning and Honeywell's meeting today with the analysts.</p><p>MONEYLINE will be right back for you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: The Federal Trade Commission today said it is not OK for a company to break its promise to customers, even if it is bankrupt. The FTC today filed a complaint against Toysmart.com to prevent the failed Internet retailer from selling the names, addresses and buying habits of its customers.</p><p>Susan Lisovicz reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Toysmart.com is no longer placing new orders for its merchandise, but the recently bankrupt Internet retailer is placing adds, which offer its inventory and Web site address and just about everything else for sale, as well as its customer list.</p><p>Toysmart.com had promised those customers it would never share those lists, which include detailed information about children, so the Federal Trade Commission has filed suit.</p><p>DAVID MEDINE, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: Privacy promises on Web sites are critical to giving consumers the confidence they need in electronic commerce so that it can continue to expand. And secondly, it doesn't matter whether a company continues in business or goes out of business, if the consumer has expectations that their privacy will be protected, it doesn't matter if the company is liquidating its assets.</p><p>LISOVICZ: And information lists are among any e-tailer's most valuable assets.  Direct marketers say untargeted mailings have a less than 1 percent likelihood of a response.  Internet customer lists, such as Toysmart's, are highly targeted because of the extensive information they collect.</p><p>ANDREW SHEN, ELECTRONIC PRIVACY INFORMATION CENTER: They contain profiles of your family, what your family's made up of, how many kids you have, what their birthdates are.  I'm sure Toys 'R' Us in the real world can't keep track of all that information and no desire to.  On the Internet, that's become the norm.</p><p>LISOVICZ: And critics say selling information lists will also become the norm as more dot.coms go belly up.</p><p>RUSSELL SMITH, CONSUMER.NET: Oh, yes, I think it's going to increase, not only bankruptcies, but mergers and so forth, the information that's collected is going to be transferred.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISOVICZ: Toysmart.com, which is majority-owned by Walt Disney, did not return \"MONEYLINE\"'s repeated calls.  However, FTC spokesman Madine (ph) told me that Toysmart is in settlement talks with the commission.  He said the FTC filed suit as a precaution in case those talks fall through before the sale of assets begin later this month.</p><p>One last point: It's not illegal to sell lists of customer information.  The problem here appears to be breaking an explicit promise to consumers.</p><p>VARNEY: And therein lies the rub, yes.</p><p>LUSOVICZ: You got it.</p><p>VARNEY: But they did not actually do it then, did they?  They didn't go out and say: ten bucks for this name and address.  They didn't do that?</p><p>LUSOVICZ: No.  They're hoping to.  And that's why the FTC stepped in.  The assets sale is July 26th.</p><p>VARNEY: You'll hear a lot more of this, I suspect.</p><p>LUSOVICZ: You got it.</p><p>VARNEY: Susan, thanks very much.</p><p>Well, checking tonight's \"MONEYLINE Movers,\" we have Best Buy, which gained more than three points.  Prudential Securities upgraded it to a strong buy, citing the electronic retailer's aggressive expansion plans.</p><p>TenFold plunged nearly seven points.  That's 39 percent.  The e- business software-maker warned it will report a second-quarter loss. Analysts were looking for it to earn -- make a profit of -- nine cents a share.</p><p>Krispy Kreme lost more than 6 1/4, after a \"Barron's\" article questioned whether the doughnut-maker is overpriced.  Since debuting at $21 a share, that stock has surged 248 percent.</p><p>And then we have Diageo.  It's hoping that its famous Doughboy can create such an appetite.  It is reportedly seeking -- or trying to sell or merge its Pillsbury division, which could be worth as much as $12 billion.  General Mills, H.J. Heinz, and Sara Lee are all potential buyers.</p><p>And in a different kind of take-over attempt, H.J. Heinz today introduced its new ketchup.  It is green, believe it or not -- there it is -- designed to appeal to children.  It tastes the same as the red kind and will hit the stores in October.  Heinz hopes the new EZ Squirt ketchup, as it is called, will raise sales.</p><p>Still ahead on MONEYLINE, is Chrysler coming back to the New York landmark that bears it name?  We'll tell you what DaimlerChrysler is saying about that.  And a crucial vote for Israel's prime minister on the eve of an historic summit.  We'll have more on that in our \"News Digest.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: DaimlerChrysler may be coming home to an icon of Chrysler's glory days.  The German-American automaker told MONEYLINE it is in talks to lease offices in the Chrysler Building, a well-known cathedral of modern architecture completed in 1930 by Walter Chrysler and renowned for its stainless steel spire.  The company would only have a symbolic presence, with 10 offices and about a dozen employees focused in corporate communications and investor relations.  But the move could help defray DaimlerChrysler's image of being overly focused on its operations in Germany.</p><p>It's been a rough ride for the combined company.  The stock is down nearly 35 percent since the merger, which took place in November of 1998.</p><p>A U.S. summit on Middle East peace on track tonight after a dramatic showdown -- showdown I should say -- today in Israel's parliament.</p><p>Jim Moret is in Washington with more on that story and the MONEYLINE \"News Digest\" -- Jim.</p><p>JIM MORET, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you, Stuart.</p><p>The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, is tonight heading for a make-or-break peace summit with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat; that after he narrowly survived a confidence vote in parliament amid opposition concern about concessions to the Palestinians.

That, and a great deal more, coming up for you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: MONEYLINE continues.  Here again, Stuart Varney.</p><p>VARNEY: In tonight's headlines, closing arguments in the Florida case that could rock the tobacco industry as plaintiff lawyers now put the price tag on the damages.  Web stocks still stuck in the red this year, but some on Wall Street still say the sector is overvalued. We'll put that question to market watcher Gregg Hymowitz.  Plus, Honeywell faces Wall Street with lowered profit forecasts and unveils a big restructuring.  We'll talk to the chief executive Michael Bonsignore about why the company failed to live up to expectations.</p><p>But first, more on tonight's top story.  It is the largest technology deal in history.  JDS Uniphase engineering a blockbuster fiber-optics deal, snapping up its rival SDL.  Just a week after it closed a $15 billion acquisition of E-Tek, JDS Uniphase said today that it will buy SDL for $41 billion in stock.</p><p>Under terms of the deal, JDS will swap 3.8 of its shares for each SDL share.  The price tag represents nearly a 50 percent premium over SDL's closing price on Friday, and if SDL decides to abandon this merger, it will have to pay JDS Uniphase a $1 billion breakup fee.</p><p>Earlier on CNNfn, the chief executives of both companies talked about the merits of the deal, and the chief executive of SDL explained why the two companies started talking in the first place.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON SCIFRES, CEO, SDL: SDL initiated the conversations.  I won't speculate on who else we were talking with at the time.  But as soon as JDS Uniphase finished their discussion with E-Tek, I called Joseph -- we had known each other for a long time -- and said, would you like to talk to us about also being a suitor here?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VARNEY: Check Wall Street's reaction to this: shares of JDS Uniphase dropped more than 15 points, and that stock was the most active on the Nasdaq.  SDL, though, skyrocketed nearly 25 1/2.</p><p>There was not much other excitement on Wall Street today as the big tech deal failed to inspire investor enthusiasm across the broader market.  The Nasdaq slipped from its perch above 4,000, putting an end to a two session winning streak.  The index ended down nearly 43 points.</p><p>Blue chip shares clawed their way back into the black, but found little inspiration for any sustained push.  The Dow closed nearly 11 points higher at 10,647.</p><p>Check some of the day's big movers, start with Alcoa, the first Dow stock to report earnings.  It gained nearly two points.  And General Motors moved up more than two.  Home Deport rose almost 2 1/2. Ah, but Microsoft slipped more than 2 1/2 and Intel was down a point and a half.</p><p>Brokerage stocks, they were big winners today.  Lehman jumped five, and Goldman Sachs, DLJ, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, all of them gained more than two points.</p><p>Now check some Nasdaq movers: Yahoo! slumped 6 1/2.  Inktomi down more than 9 1/2.  And DoubleClick lost 4 1/4.  Cisco was down 2 1/4, but Sun Microsystems gained nearly 1 3/4 on the day's trading.</p><p>Today's losses in Yahoo! stock point to a troubling trend in the Internet sector.  Allan Chernoff explains how Wall Street is changing its views on some Web companies and turning back to some traditional valuation measures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On Main Street, maturity is a quality to admire.  Not so on Wall Street.  It means a company is no longer high growth.  And now Wall Street is placing some Internet blue chips into that category.</p><p>JONATHAN COHEN, WIT CAPITAL: We're seeing individual companies, though, across the Internet space begin to get a lot bigger and as a result see some slowing growth rates.</p><p>CHERNOFF: It's having devastating consequences for Net stocks. Once viewed as firms that could generate explosive growth, the glory days are fading fast.</p><p>At Yahoo! revenue growth has been in the triple digits but it's rapidly slowing down.  Part of the problem for Yahoo!, it's highly dependent on revenue from other Internet companies that had been advertising heavily on Yahoo! but can no longer afford to do so.  So revenue growth is slowing down into double-digit territory.  Earnings growth this year is still forecast for the triple digits, but it's expected to plunge next year.</p><p>Consider what that means for Yahoo's stock market valuation.  The most common measurement is the ratio of price to earnings per share. Professional investors like to compare that to the earnings growth rate.  On that basis, Yahoo! appears reasonable looking at this year's numbers.  Its price/earnings ratio is below its growth rate.  But the steep decline in Yahoo!'s expected growth rate next year makes the stock appear way overvalued, a P/E nine times the company's growth rate.</p><p>JIM AWAD, AWAD ASSOCIATES: The market's going to be groping with this -- with this, I believe, for the next several quarters at least and maybe for the next few years as we emerge from the free-for-all where everybody was attracting capital and worrying about profits later to the more disciplined rational environment of having to produce profits in the foreseeable future.</p><p>CHERNOFF: This is why quality Internet companies like Yahoo! continue to see their shares sinking.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: As you know, the majority of Internet companies don't even have earnings to speak of and their stock price declines reflect that reality.  The glamour is gone for one high-flying Internet names, and without glamour, companies trade on hard numbers.  Hard for many shareholders to digest -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: We get hard numbers on Yahoo!, is it -- tomorrow, after the bell, I think.</p><p>CHERNOFF: It is tomorrow.  In fact, the expectation is for 10 cents a share, although the whisper number now is 11 cents a share.</p><p>VARNEY: Work that one out.  Allan Chernoff, thanks very much. Let's get more perspective on the stock market now, where are we going as the summer moves along.  We've joined now by Gregg Hymowitz. He's with Entrust Capital.  He joins us again on MONEYLINE.</p><p>Welcome back, Gregg.</p><p>GREGG HYMOWITZ, ENTRUST CAPITAL: Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: In the broadest possible sense, where is this market going?</p><p>HYMOWITZ: It's tough.  We'll probably tread water here.  I mean, clearly, I think the focus will be on Friday's numbers.  Unless we see a real acceleration in the economy, I think pretty much most people will feel the Fed is on hold until at least the election or after the election, and therefore it's going to be very company-specific. Earnings will dictate.</p><p>And the problem is, the negative is, if you miss your number, you're going to be taken out behind the barn and whacked pretty hard.</p><p>VARNEY: It's serious, isn't it?</p><p>HYMOWITZ: Very serious.</p><p>VARNEY: There are some big-name companies which have missed by -- what? -- one or two cents a share and down they go 30 percent.</p><p>HYMOWITZ: You know, it's interesting.  It seems that on the face of it the earnings season so far, the preannouncements have been worse than normal.  But the numbers actually show that it's pretty much inline.</p><p>What I think is happening is a lot of these names that we all talk about constantly are these relatively high-flying stocks, which tend to be very new companies.  The problem with new companies is it's very difficult to forecast quarter by quarter.</p><p>So I expect more disappointments from some of the big names that everyone constantly talks about.  They're bound to mess up when it comes to forecasting.</p><p>The other thing I'll just mention quickly is these acquisitions, these acquisitions that we were talking about a few minutes ago with JDS Uniphase.  Constantly doing acquisitions also makes the forecasting much more difficult integrating these acquisitions.</p><p>VARNEY: Why?</p><p>HYMOWITZ: Oh, I mean, it's effectively taking two, three companies, putting sales teams together, lowering, cutting expenses. And then you have to give the Street an earnings forecast down to the penny.  And if you miss by a couple of pennies -- I just had a company miss this evening by three pennies -- and the stock's off in the Instinet market 25, 30 percent.  It can be very painful.</p><p>It's a game we play on Wall Street.  You have to make the quarterly numbers.</p><p>VARNEY: You're talking Aspect Communications.</p><p>HYMOWITZ: Right.  Aspect Communications reported after the close, a disappointment.  We spoke to the company.  It's a relatively small and isolated disappointment, but yet the company's been absolutely taken to task in the Instinet market.</p><p>VARNEY: Taken out and whacked.</p><p>HYMOWITZ: Right.  Now, we've been buying the stock because that also demonstrate, in the Instinet market, because clearly the Instinet market, you can -- it's a very risky game.  The liquidity is very, very tight.  And therefore people are selling the stock down 30, 40 percent.  And we believe, after speaking with the company, everything remains intact, we'll buy the stock.  But it's a tough game.</p><p>VARNEY: Good luck, Gregg Hymowitz.  You always say that.  Thanks very much, Gregg.</p><p>HYMOWITZ: Thanks.</p><p>VARNEY: Still to come, Honeywell on the defensive.  The company holds its first meeting with analysts since its second-quarter profit warning.  We're going to talk to the chief executive Michael Bonsingore about his turnaround plans and a good deal more.  That's when MONEYLINE returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: In tonight's \"MONEYLINE Focus\": Honeywell.  The Dow component today answered tough questions indeed from the analysts. The stock plunged last month after it surprised Wall Street with a second-quarter profit warning.  And today it tried to calm investor fears about its plans for the future.</p><p>The outlook so far, somewhat weak.  Honeywell lowered its profit estimates for this year and next.  It also plans to cut 6,000 jobs, about 5 percent of its work force.  That's on top of a previously announced 10 percent reduction.</p><p>Honeywell also plans to close or sell several units, an effort aimed at saving $100 million a quarter.</p><p>Chief executive Michael Bonsignore said he will soon announce a stock buy-back program.  He called the stock cheap.  Honeywell shares are down 47 percent over the past year.</p><p>Joining us now: the chairman and CEO of Honeywell, Michael Bonsignore.</p><p>Michael, welcome back.</p><p>MICHAEL BONSIGNORE, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, HONEYWELL: Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: OK.  Now you've revised down your profit outlook for 2000 and 2001.  Is all the bad news out there?  Have you seen the bottom and gone past?</p><p>BONSIGNORE: Absolutely.  That's we took the three weeks from the profit warning to today to make sure that whatever we told the investment community today was something they could count on.</p><p>VARNEY: Your strategy then is sell those underperforming parts of the business, fix others, and move ahead?  No matter what, move ahead?</p><p>BONSIGNORE: 15 percent of the portfolio is non-core.  We took a very exhaustive look at the portfolio over the last two or three months.  We couldn't buy our shares back.  We couldn't make material divestitures under the pooling rules.</p><p>We used that time to look at the portfolio, and about 15 percent of the portfolio, non-core.  We want to look at those businesses: fix them, sell them or close them.</p><p>VARNEY: OK.  Now you're just six months on the job.  You're the chairman of the combined Allied Signal-Honeywell, and you took over from a business legend, Larry Bossidy (ph).</p><p>Do you think when you came into the job just a few short months ago you made too high of yours goals, tour targets&gt;?  Set them too high up.  Did you?</p><p>BONSIGNORE: I think the goals for 2000, 20 percent EPS growth, were clearly ambitious but achievable when we put the plants together. And I think what's happened is that in the midst of integrating the two companies, taking out 11,000 people, getting the company directed back to growth, and doing that under the confluence of a number of very unusual factors operating on the company all simultaneously -- weak euro, very high raw material prices, interest rates, supplier problems -- nor margin for error.</p><p>VARNEY: The weak euro hurt you?</p><p>BONSIGNORE: Very much so.  We have -- most of our turbocharger business is in Europe.  That's about four points from the growth from euro.  We've had the euro affect a number -- 25 percent of our business is in Europe.  So, that affects the revenue line and some of the income line as well.</p><p>VARNEY: Can you stick to your current profit forecast if the Fed continues to raise rates?</p><p>BONSIGNORE: Yes.  We -- when we looked at the outlook for the rest of the year, 10 to 15 percent for the second half, 12 to 14 for the total year, we clearly did that making some assumptions, that they're not going to be material changes in raw material prices.  And obviously, we tried to build in some realism into those forecasts going forward.</p><p>VARNEY: What it's like being the chairman of a company, a huge $25 billion company, that sees its stock chopped off at the knees very, very suddenly.  I'm asking you a personal question. BONSIGNORE: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: How do you feel when you wake up in the morning and you see this happening?</p><p>BONSIGNORE: Well, I don't feel good at all, because first and foremost I try not to confuse value with valuation.  And here we have a tremendously powerful franchise -- nothing about Honeywell's fundamental franchise has changed from a month ago -- we have leading market shares, technologies other companies would kill for, wonderful brand, great businesses, a lot of growth potential.  We just have to fight our way back in a market which is very unforgiving in terms of missing expectations.</p><p>VARNEY: You're over the hump?</p><p>BONSIGNORE: Over the hump.</p><p>VARNEY: Guaranteed?</p><p>BONSIGNORE: Read to go.</p><p>VARNEY: Michael Bonsignore, chief executive, chairman of Honeywell, thanks very much for being with us.</p><p>BONSIGNORE: Thank you, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: OK, sir.</p><p>Coming up, the pressure may be mounting on cigarette makers. We'll tell you how much a Florida class-action suit could cost the tobacco industry.  We'll be back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: It's the beginning of the end for the greatest legal challenge the tobacco industry has ever faced.  Two years after jury selection and 56,000 pages of testimony later, attorneys for the plaintiffs started their closing arguments today in the final punitive stage of this landmark trial.  And those attorneys finally detailed just much they think the industry should pay to sick Florida smokers.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank reports from Miami.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After two years of silence about how much money he wants tobacco companies to pay, class-action lawyer Stanley Rosenblatt revealed the magic number he hopes will become the largest jury award ever.</p><p>Rosenblatt set a range of punitive damages for the jury to consider from $123 billion to $196 billion before settling on his idea number.</p><p>STANLEY ROSENBLATT, PLAINTIFFS' ATTORNEY: \u2026 the total figure -- the total figure of punitive damages for all the companies, for all the companies collectively, that an appropriate, just number would be $154 billion.</p><p>FRANK: He said he arrived at that figure because the companies, when negotiating a potential agreement with Congress, had indicated they could pay about $120 billion.  That was on top of the $246 billion the industry agreed to pay the states to settle tobacco litigation.  And Rosenblatt argued the companies' cash flow could support a judgment of $150 billion or more.</p><p>In the two-year trial, Rosenblatt has already won two verdicts. Last year, the jury found cigarette makers liable for making defective and dangerous products.  And earlier this year, the jury awarded compensatory damages to three smokers.  Rosenblatt urged the jurors not to be overwhelmed by the size of his latest request.</p><p>ROSENBLATT: And hopefully you're going to show them that regular people not engaged in high finances, not intimidated by these numbers\u2026</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK: Throughout his closing argument, Rosenblatt hammered at the theme that the tobacco companies deserved to be punished for manufacturing dangerous and defective products, and denying that they caused cancer.  He also blasted several tobacco companies who were in court for being unapologetic and not -- for being unapologetic and not taking the stand during the first year of the trial.</p><p>Rosenblatt will close his argument tomorrow, leaving time for the tobacco industry lawyers to begin their defense that the industry does need deserve to be punished further because it has changed its ways. They also of course are trying to avoid what could be the largest jury verdict in history by more than 30 times -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Allan, exactly who decides how much: Is it the jury alone or does the judge have some input here?</p><p>FRANK: The jury makes the decision, Stuart, but the judge has power to reduce the jury verdict if he so chooses.  And he's indicated he might even consider that.</p><p>VARNEY: Now does the tobacco industry, the tobacco companies, if they are -- they do have to pay out a good deal of money, do they have to post a bond?</p><p>FRANK: They do have to post a bond, and what earlier had scared Wall Street about this case was a Florida law requirement that a 125 percent of the award be posted as a bond.  This year the legislature changed that and limited the bond to $125 million, which the companies could easily post.  Other states in tobacco country followed suit, so that their assets couldn't -- tobacco company assets could not be attached in those states.</p><p>So Wall Street is not worried whether this would immediately force the companies into bankruptcy, and undoubtedly, any payment would be spread over a number of years -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Allan Dodds Frank reporting from Miami.  Thank you, Allan.</p><p>Well, tobacco stocks barely budged today, but they have rebounded sharply from their 52-week lows.  Philip Morris, for example, is up 44 percent from its low.  British American Tobacco has gained just over 74 percent.  R.J. Reynolds has surged 87 percent.  Loews trading 66 percent higher than its 52-week low.</p><p>Topping tonight's \"MONEYLINE Movers\": Advanced Micro Devices up two points after tech analyst, Dan Niles, upped his price target on the chip-maker to $110 and repeated his outperform rating.</p><p>Premier National Bank jumped more than 6 1/2 on news that M&amp;T Bank will purchase it in a $340 million stock deal.  That's a 57 percent premium to Friday's closing price.</p><p>Biogen down nearly 4 3/4.  Prudential Securities downgraded it on concerns of slowing sales of its flagship drug, Avonex, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis.  The first half of 2000 has been tough on the biotech firm.  It has fallen 46 percent since hitting its high of $129 a share.</p><p>And still to come, \"Harry Potter\" casts his magic over the publishing world, drumming up record sales.</p><p>This story and more when MONEYLINE returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: A big flop from \"Big Brother\"?  Well, the second reality show of the season from CBS seems to be one too many for viewers. After a tremendously successful 13.5 rating debut last Wednesday, \"Big Brother\" lost more than 40 percent of its viewers on its second night out.  And ratings have continued to sink nightly.  The network argues that \"Big Brother\" is still pulling in higher numbers than CBS programs aired in the same time slot last summer, and that the show took time to catch on in Europe, as well.  CBS spent an estimated $20 million for the rights to \"Big Brother\" and has committed to run the show for 89 nights this summer.</p><p>But Americans couldn't get enough of a very different kind of European import, the fourth book in the \"Harry Potter\" series by British author J.K. Rowling.  This past weekend saw history made in the publishing business, a rush of book-buying unlike anything ever seen in this country.</p><p>Peter Viles reports on whether \"Potter\" really spells big profits for retailers and its U.S. publisher.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Kids lined up to read it, parents to pay for it, and critics to praise it.  The \"New York Times\" called it, quote, \"big, clever, vibrant, and tremendously assured\u2026  everything it promised to be\"; and more, causing the biggest burst of book-buying in modern history.  Barnes &amp; Noble sold 114,000 copies in one hour.  Over the weekend, in sales on- and off- line, it reported 502,000 copies sold.  Amazon's tally stood at 392,000.  And Borders said it sold 300,000 copies.</p><p>Publisher Scholastic plans to print another two million copies in the next two months, adding to the initial U.S. print-run of 3.8 million copies.  The only world \"Harry\" didn't conquer was Wall Street.  Shares in those book retailing and e-tailing stocks were mixed.  Amazon fell more than one dollar.  And shares of Scholastic gained only fractionally.</p><p>PETER APPERT, DEUTSCHE BANC ALEX BROW: Scholastic's stock has moved from the low 40s to the low 60s over the course of the last couple of months, largely in anticipation of the release of \"Harry Potter\" four.  So I do think that much of the good news with regard to \"Harry Potter\" is perhaps already reflected in the stock.</p><p>VILES: E-tailers like Amazon probably lost money on weekend sales, because in addition to selling the book at 40 percent off, they were subsidizing rush delivery.</p><p>LAUREN LEVITAN, ROBERTSON STEPHENS: It's possible that the company did experience a slightly negative margin on that first dose of items.  At the same time, I think, if you look at this in the context of their total cost and the total benefit of the event, we actually think it's a huge positive.</p><p>VILES (on camera): The only negative in all of this is that some stores haven't been able to keep the book in stock.  This Barnes &amp; Noble in Manhattan had 900 books Friday night and none on Saturday night.  Reinforcements finally came today.</p><p>Peter Viles, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: Up next: \"Ahead of the Curve,\" some of what you need to know tonight before those markets open up again tomorrow.</p><p>You are watching MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Here's what could move the markets tomorrow.  The profit parade marches on, beginning with Dow component, International Paper; investors expecting second-quarter earnings of 74 cents a share.  That would be more than triple last years' results; Biogen expected to report earnings of 42 cents.</p><p>And after tomorrow's closing bell, Internet giant Yahoo! due to report profits of around 10 cents a share.</p><p>Keep an eye on the shares of Aspect communications.  After today's closing bell, the company announced it will miss second- quarter earnings estimates.  And it's stock plummeted 21 points in active late trading.</p><p>Also tomorrow, Fed chairman Greenspan will address the National Governors' Association on the structural change of the new economy.</p><p>And to stay a step ahead of the markets, tune in to AHEAD OF THE CURVE at 5:00 a.m. Eastern on CNN.</p><p>That's MONEYLINE for this Monday.

STAFF WRITER</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This Thursday will bring back unhappy memories for Margaret and Dennis Christy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like many other investors, shortly before the Nasdaq Composite Index reached its all-time high of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000, the couple sold some investments that were doing well and invested the profits in mutual funds full of the technology and other growth stocks that dominate the Nasdaq.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then they watched helplessly as the Nasdaq nose-dived, losing about 57 percent of its value before it bottomed out in the fall of 2002. Altogether, the Christys figure their investment portfolio lost about one third due to the overall market slump.</p><p>But although they haven't put new money into the losing funds, the Huntington residents haven't closed the funds out, either. \"I always felt like it [the Nasdaq] was going to come back,\" Margaret Christy said.</p><p>Yesterday gave some grounds for optimism to investors such as the Christys. Buoyed by the expectation of good second-quarter profit forecasts for some large technology companies, the Nasdaq rose nearly 1 percent.</p><p>But unlike the other two major market indexes, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Composite Index, the Nasdaq is still staggeringly short of its former high. At its closing level Monday of 2,090.21, it must rise more than 140 percent to regain its pre-crash level, compared with 7 percent and 25 percent for the Dow and the S&amp;P 500, respectively. And unlike those two averages, which have rallied in recent weeks to show year-to-date gains, it is still down nearly 4 percent for the year.</p><p>Mutual-fund flows show that most individual investors aren't hopeful about the outlook for technology. In 2004, $7 billion was pulled out of technology-oriented mutual funds, according to Don Cassidy, senior research analyst for Lipper Inc.</p><p>That sum surpassed the $6.5 billion outflow in 2001, the year Nasdaq's troubles began to sink in with investors. Cassidy said that \"people are still very skittish\" after the immense hit they took in the market crash, which wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars in savings, much of it in retirement nest eggs.</p><p>\"Individuals want to play it safe\" by buying dividend-producing stocks, said Hugh Johnson, chief economist investment officer for First Albany Corp. Although Microsoft Corp. recently began paying a dividend, such payouts are rare among technology companies and many firms in the Nasdaq that emphasize rising earnings as a way to attract investors.</p><p>Asked how long it may take for the Nasdaq to regain its March 2000 high, Johnson referred to the 25 years it took for the Dow to recoup what it lost in the great crash of 1929. \"When a bubble breaks, it stays broken for a long time,\" he said.</p><p>Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis was optimistic. \"Although we went through that terrible experience with the [technology] sector, it didn't kill off the story of that sector,\" Paulsen said. \"If there's innovation, it's most likely [to be] there, and it's still one of the fastest-growing sectors there is.\"</p><p>It's impossible to predict when, but another \"big tech breakthrough\" like the Internet or the personal computer, is bound to occur, Paulsen said. \"I wouldn't put high odds on it this year or next year, but if you're truly an investor, you've got to still like tech.\"</p><p>Sandy Lincoln, chief executive for Wayne Hummer Asset Management in Chicago, said that investors forget that technology is one of the most up-and-down, or \"cyclical,\" industries, because it is tied to how much money corporations can or are willing to spend on new equipment and software. It has been five years since many firms spent heavily on technology. Computers and programs are getting old, and Wayne Hummer has just recently recommended to its customers that they increase their exposure to tech, Lincoln said.</p><p>Cynthia Heinze of Flushing said that even though her investments in technology companies lost money after the Nasdaq crash, she still buys tech stocks.

Of the three, only Meeker kept her job as an analyst. She still works for Morgan Stanley covering companies including dot-com survivor Amazon. In 2001, she won dismissal of shareholder lawsuits that accused her of offering biased research about Internet companies as a way to obtain more business for her employer.</p><p>Henry Blodget. In the 2003 settlement, Blodget agreed to pay $4 million. As with Grubman, he neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, but is subject to a lifetime ban from the securities industry.

In a 2003 settlement with regulators, Grubman agreed to pay $15 million in fines, and be barred from the securities industry for life. He did not admit or deny any wrongdoing.

As it turns out, Son\u2019s conglomerate, SoftBank Group Corp., may be behind the rip-roaring ride in large-cap U.S. technology stocks in recent weeks that lifted the broader market and, in effect, made investors nearly forget the Covid-19 crisis for a moment. The \u201c Nasdaq whale,\u201d the Financial Times calls him, referring to a monstrous options trade that the paper\u2019s unidentified sources say was made by SoftBank. Here\u2019s how the Wall Street Journal describes the curious move:      Investors watching the vertigo-inducing rise \u2014 and Thursday\u2019s fall \u2014 of technology stocks are buzzing about a single trade, a giant but shadowy bet on Silicon Valley big enough to pull the market up with it. The investor behind that trade, according to people familiar with the matter, is Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp., which bought options tied to around $50 billion worth of individual tech stocks.    It\u2019s a lot to take in. We\u2019re talking about a period during which Apple Inc. became a $2 trillion company; Amazon. com Inc. added more to its market value in a month than it did in all of last year; and Telsa Inc. founder Elon Musk vaulted past Buffett in the ranking of the world\u2019s wealthiest people. While all the tech giants have benefited in some way from societal shifts brought on by the pandemic \u2014 a surge in demand for everything from online shopping and streaming-video, to work-from-home software solutions \u2014 market observers have struggled to explain exactly why their share prices took an extra leg up over the summer. Bloomberg Opinion\u2019s Nir Kaissar wrote this week about the conundrum that this has created for money managers: whether to stick with a responsibly diversified portfolio that\u2019s destined to underperform, or chase the fad.    It\u2019s unusual for options-buying tied to individual stocks to be so explosive that it could move markets in this way, but that\u2019s now the prevailing theory. Equity derivatives have become a favorite trading toy for presumably bored retail investors \u2014 those who don\u2019t manage money professionally \u2014 who have taken a liking to platforms such as Robinhood while being shut in during the Covid-19 crisis. It\u2019s hard to know Son\u2019s specific motivations for joining that camp, but it\u2019s certainly not boredom.    Investors have gone back and forth on whether Son, 63, is a true visionary or more of a gambler. He once spoke of a 300-year plan for SoftBank, but it soon became evident that he needed to concentrate on the present. Fraught investments in U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp. and office-rental company WeWork Cos. bruised his reputation. And after writing down the values of investments in WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc., SoftBank suffered a loss for the Japanese record books. Son was finally able to sell Sprint to T-Mobile US Inc. this year, ironically leaving the Japanese businessman as the biggest beneficiary of a deal pitched to regulators on American patriotism. As SoftBank laid plans to dump more than $40 billion of assets to shore up its balance sheet, Son was apparently left with funds to spend.    SoftBank, best known for its Vision Fund, also said last month that it will no longer report operating income. My Opinion colleague Tim Culpan wrote that the change makes sense given that SoftBank hasn\u2019t \u201coperated\u201d anything for a long time; it functions more as a stock picker, investing in startups and publicly traded companies.        A bet on Big Tech is a risky one, though. Some have compared the industry\u2019s outsize gains to the dot-com bubble that famously burst 20 years ago. Fellow Opinion columnist John Authers got it right when he wrote Friday: \u201cIf there is a bubble in the biggest tech companies, it is arguably in their profits, and how they have been allowed to build up monopolistic market power, rather than in their valuations.\u201d A monopoly bubble is a lot harder to pop, but Democrats are trying. What stands in their way are 100-year-old antitrust laws that don\u2019t make a single mention of the word at the root of Big Tech\u2019s power and overreach \u2014 its exclusive hold on reams and reams of valuable data.    Still, the bubble began to seep this week, and news of Son\u2019s almost single-handed influence won\u2019t help matters. But the only thing that will truly rein in Big Tech is an administration that wants to.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Naspers, SA's biggest locally listed company and tech leader, delivered a positive set of results for the year to end-March, with its operating loss halving, and the share price promptly went down.</p><p>A lot.</p><p>Naspers's share price is down about 19% over the past three months and is trading at levels it reached this time last year. It's miles off its high of R3,800 last year, and the company is now such a dominant force on the JSE that investors of all types are taking a hit.</p><p>It's almost as though shareholders, who have been happy to see Naspers racking up losses for years, have suddenly got a fright at the prospect of the company making an actual profit (outside of its investment in Tencent).</p><p>Such are the vagaries of tech investing.</p><p>As it happens, Naspers is in good company, with Facebook, Tencent and Alibaba all trailing each other downwards by similar proportions over the past few months. Of the big tech stocks, the only exception is Alphabet, holders of Google, but even the sector monster is down almost 10%.</p><p>What is happening here?</p><p>Apparently, several things simultaneously.</p><p>First, according to Philip Short of Old Mutual Equities, a little apprehension is creeping in about the state of the global economy, and particularly about the US economy. US bond yields are rising and the Vix, the volatility index, is higher too.</p><p>In combination, these two numbers suggest investors are becoming just a smidgen more cautious. The consequence for tech stocks is large, says Short, because they are typically the most highly leveraged in terms of valuations, and hence even small changes in expectations are felt profoundly.</p><p>Second, says Vestact fund manager Byron Lotter, is that the Chinese economy is slowing - though it is still enormous relative to most of the rest of the world - and this affects Naspers particularly.</p><p>It still closely tracks its biggest and most successful investment, Hong Kong-based Chinese company Tencent, in which it now has a slightly reduced 31% stake.</p><p>The third and perhaps most significant reason is that Chinese regulators have put some of Tencent's games on hold. It seems trivial, but gaming is a huge earner for Tencent and constitutes about 60% of its revenue.</p><p>Tencent's share price, and Naspers's with it, got thumped when Tencent missed analyst expectations in its results in August, and the extent of the approval hold-up became apparent.</p><p>Short says he recently returned from China and his sense is that the hold-up is temporary.</p><p>There was a ministry rotation and new people were appointed, so they froze the process of approving games, which the Chinese government monitors for excessive violence and negative messaging.</p><p>Short says the process will probably resume early next year, and until then Tencent will not be able to release in China a game called Fortnite, for example, which has been a huge success around the world with 125-million players joining it in its first year. Tencent is also restricted by unofficial Chinese sanctions against Seoul - it has distribution rights for another enormously popular game, PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds, but because the game was developed by a South Korean company, Tencent can't make money from it in its home market.</p><p>&amp; I think they [the Chinese regulators] are just finding their feet,&amp; Short says.</p><p>Yet behind this trail of digital destruction, there is also some good news: the discount between the value of Naspers and the implicit value of Naspers's share of Tencent has narrowed substantially.</p><p>&amp; We are starting to see good traction in the businesses outside of Tencent,&amp; Short says.</p><p>Naspers investments are difficult to track. They span a wide range of countries, some small, some very big. The businesses themselves don't have a single brand name that spans all geographies; they are in various sectors; some are minority equity holdings and others are wholly owned; some are listed, some are not.

Naspers, SA's biggest locally listed company and tech leader, delivered a positive set of results for the year to end-March, with its operating loss halving, and the share price promptly went down.</p><p>A lot.</p><p>Naspers's share price is down about 19% over the past three months and is trading at levels it reached this time last year. It's miles off its high of R3,800 last year, and the company is now such a dominant force on the JSE that investors of all types are taking a hit.</p><p>It's almost as though shareholders, who have been happy to see Naspers racking up losses for years, have suddenly got a fright at the prospect of the company making an actual profit (outside of its investment in Tencent).</p><p>Such are the vagaries of tech investing.</p><p>As it happens, Naspers is in good company, with Facebook, Tencent and Alibaba all trailing each other downwards by similar proportions over the past few months. Of the big tech stocks, the only exception is Alphabet, holders of Google, but even the sector monster is down almost 10%.</p><p>What is happening here?</p><p>Apparently, several things simultaneously.</p><p>First, according to Philip Short of Old Mutual Equities, a little apprehension is creeping in about the state of the global economy, and particularly about the US economy. US bond yields are rising and the Vix, the volatility index, is higher too.</p><p>In combination, these two numbers suggest investors are becoming just a smidgen more cautious. The consequence for tech stocks is large, says Short, because they are typically the most highly leveraged in terms of valuations, and hence even small changes in expectations are felt profoundly.</p><p>Second, says Vestact fund manager Byron Lotter, is that the Chinese economy is slowing - though it is still enormous relative to most of the rest of the world - and this affects Naspers particularly.</p><p>It still closely tracks its biggest and most successful investment, Hong Kong-based Chinese company Tencent, in which it now has a slightly reduced 31% stake.</p><p>The third and perhaps most significant reason is that Chinese regulators have put some of Tencent's games on hold. It seems trivial, but gaming is a huge earner for Tencent and constitutes about 60% of its revenue.</p><p>Tencent's share price, and Naspers's with it, got thumped when Tencent missed analyst expectations in its results in August, and the extent of the approval hold-up became apparent.</p><p>Short says he recently returned from China and his sense is that the hold-up is temporary.</p><p>There was a ministry rotation and new people were appointed, so they froze the process of approving games, which the Chinese government monitors for excessive violence and negative messaging.</p><p>Short says the process will probably resume early next year, and until then Tencent will not be able to release in China a game called Fortnite, for example, which has been a huge success around the world with 125-million players joining it in its first year. Tencent is also restricted by unofficial Chinese sanctions against Seoul - it has distribution rights for another enormously popular game, PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds, but because the game was developed by a South Korean company, Tencent can't make money from it in its home market.</p><p>&amp; I think they [the Chinese regulators] are just finding their feet,&amp; Short says.</p><p>Yet behind this trail of digital destruction, there is also some good news: the discount between the value of Naspers and the implicit value of Naspers's share of Tencent has narrowed substantially.</p><p>&amp; We are starting to see good traction in the businesses outside of Tencent,&amp; Short says.</p><p>Naspers investments are difficult to track. They span a wide range of countries, some small, some very big. The businesses themselves don't have a single brand name that spans all geographies; they are in various sectors; some are minority equity holdings and others are wholly owned; some are listed, some are not. It's a real mixed bag.</p><p>In its most recent results, announced in June, revenue in its e-commerce sectors jumped 25%. This was totally dwarfed by the 60% revenue jump achieved by Tencent, which delivered a profit of $3.7bn to Naspers.</p><p>The dominance of Tencent has served to obscure the gains other investments are making, with revenue in the e-commerce sectors, food delivery and travel really jumping.</p><p>The food-delivery business, similar to UberEats in SA, serves as a good example.
