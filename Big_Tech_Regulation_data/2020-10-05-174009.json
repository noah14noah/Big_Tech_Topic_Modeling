When it comes to wrangling Big Tech, Australia appears to be doing the opposite: yelling loudly and wielding a twig.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was a lot of strong rhetoric yesterday from Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Communications Minister Paul Fletcher and competition tsar Rod Sims about the unrivalled power of tech giants, which remain largely unregulated and unaccountable.</p><p>But there was also not a huge amount in terms of new measures to deal with this problem.</p><p>Sure, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's final, 623-page report from its long-running digital platforms inquiry diagnoses the problem - Google and Facebook's market power - and recommends measures that will upset the two digital giants.</p><p>These include the strengthening of privacy laws, tightening merger rules to prevent the giants from gobbling up emerging competitors, and the establishment of a new division within the ACCC to scrutinise the algorithms that power Google searches and Facebook news feeds. But these measures, broadly speaking, were already flagged in the ACCC's interim report in December. And the global push to regulate Big Tech has intensified significantly since then.</p><p>One new recommendation that did pique observers' interest yesterday is a requirement for the companies to set up codes of conduct for their interactions with media businesses.</p><p>It's difficult to get terribly excited about the phrase \"code of conduct\" - such requirements have proved woefully ineffective in other industries, most notably financial services.</p><p>But media executives were legitimately encouraged by this announcement. The codes of conduct would be governed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, which oversees similar regimes in television and radio. They could finally give publishers and broadcasters the ability to bargain with Google and Facebook over fair use of content.</p><p>At the same time, the ACCC's final report backed away from some other measures that the media industry was hoping for. For example, an earlier suggestion that subscriptions to newspapers producing public interest journalism be tax deductible is now off the table.</p><p>The unmistakable vibe from yesterday's proceedings is that the government is genuinely concerned about the power of big technology companies, and the impact that is having on consumers and parts of the economy.</p><p>From a media perspective, that is pleasing. Yet given recent events - raids on the home of a journalist and the offices of the public broadcaster among them - scepticism is still warranted.</p><p>Since the ACCC interim report was released in December, antagonism towards Big Tech has ratcheted up globally, particularly in the US.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, a candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, has been the chief protagonist on the political left, earlier this year unveiling a formal policy for Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon to be broken apart on competition grounds. Meanwhile, the powerful Department of Justice, which is under the purview of President Donald Trump, this week started its own investigation into internet platforms. It has the potential to be much more damaging to these companies than anything happening in Australia.</p><p>The US actually has a long history of splitting up its biggest companies, stretching back more than a century. We might well see history repeat itself. The notion that Facebook could be forced to divest its secondary platforms Instagram and/or WhatsApp no longer seems out of the question. Likewise, that the US tries to force Google to separate its search engine from its display advertising business, or that Apple or Amazon's wings are clipped also cannot be ruled out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc76dxk7vcs77x0e9pbix</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WND-33N1-JD34-V02K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Most recently, the EU's digital chief Margrethe Vestager <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/vestager-calls-for-eu-us-common-vision-on-platform-competition-policy/\">said</url> that the EU and the US should formulate \"common visions\" on how best to regulate competition in the platform economy.</p><p>Certain remedies are being mulled over by the executive, including continued competition law enforcement, ex-ante regulation of digital platforms, and a possible new competition tool.</p><p>As for potential ex-ante regulation of digital gatekeeper platforms, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/vestager-calls-for-eu-us-common-vision-on-platform-competition-policy/\">Vestager has shed</url> some light on a series of options, including one possible rule that \"prohibits platforms from displaying their own downstream services more prominently than those of rivals.\"</p><p>On regulation of the use of data, Vestager suggests establishing a 'data silo' rule, \"where a conglomerate platform is prohibited from using specific data sets for certain business purposes in order to prevent it leveraging from one market to another.\"</p><p>Earlier this year,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/commission-charts-new-competition-tool-fit-for-the-digital-age/\">the Commission announced</url>\u00a0it would unveil a new competition tool before the close of 2020. The tool will be designed to mitigate structural risks in markets as well as intervene in situations whereby a market is close to tipping. Consultations on the measures are ongoing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online terrorist content &amp; Hate Speech</emphasis></p><p>Talks between the EU institutions on the online terrorist content regulation have stalled since the coronavirus hit Europe. The plans could potentially see online platforms being forced to remove flagged terrorist content within a one-hour timeframe, in addition to introducing 'proactive measures' such as upload filters.</p><p>While the Parliament is against the idea of upload filters being included in the text, the Council and Commission both support their inclusion. For their part, the Commission is eager to progress quickly. An official recently told <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/eu-under-pressure-to-broker-online-terrorist-content-agreement/\">EURACTIV</url> that \"from our point of view it's important to make progress quickly because terrorist content online is precisely the sort of activity that doesn't at all stop in the current situation.\"</p><p>The German Presidency wants negotiations to resume as soon as possible. Nevertheless, with a host of outstanding issues including cross-border removal orders and the role of platforms in flagging and removing content, it is unlikely that talks will conclude anytime soon.</p><p>Elsewhere, the European Commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/platforms-clamp-down-on-hate-speech-in-run-up-to-digital-services-act/\">has applauded</url> efforts by some of the world's largest tech platforms in stifling the spread of illegal content, in the last evaluation of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/eu-code-conduct-countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en\">EU's code on countering illegal hate speech online</url> before the Digital Services Act is presented later this year.</p><p>Results of the evaluation of the code show that 90% of flagged content was 'assessed' within 24 hours, while 71% of such content was eventually removed.</p><p>There have been recent developments in the area of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/frances-top-court-rejects-core-of-law-targeting-online-hate-speech/\">online hate speech in France</url>, where the Constitutional Council rejected large parts of a draft law against online hate speech which would have obliged social media giants to remove hateful content within 24 hours.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online abuse</emphasis></p><p>The European Commission will propose legislation later this year and in 2021 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/commission-to-present-mandatory-rules-for-platforms-to-detect-report-and-remove-online-abuse/\">that will force</url> online platforms to undertake measures to stop the spread of online child abuse.</p><p>As part of rules under the EU's Electronic Communications Code that come into force in December, the scope of the 2000 e-Commerce Directive will be broadened, having the effect of preventing certain companies from continuing their own measures on the voluntary detection, removal and reporting of child sexual abuse online.</p><p>Following this initiative, the Commission will put forward further legislation in the second quarter of 2021, to oblige online service providers to \"detect known child sexual abuse material and require them to report that material to public authorities.\"</p><p>Presenting the future plans in July, the EU's home affairs chief Ylva Johansson also floated the idea of creating a new European centre to prevent and counter child sexual abuse, with a number of responsibilities including proactively searching online content and notifying companies of potential illegalities at play.</p><p>/////</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data strategy</emphasis></p><p>The Commission's data strategy, presented in February 2020, aims to establish a single European market for data, allowing public and private actors \"easy access\" to huge reserves of industrial information. The strategy features work produced under four pillars covering the governance model for the access, use and reuse of such data, capacity building for Europe's data ecosystem, empowering businesses and individuals in their knowledge of how data can benefit them, and also the specific establishment of data spaces across a range of sectors.</p><p>Plans that the Commission has thus far put forward include the creation of nine common EU data spaces across sectors including healthcare, agriculture and energy, as well as the establishment of a Data Act in 2021, that could \"foster business-to-government data sharing for the public interest.\"</p><p>Feedback on a public consultation that concluded earlier this year has recently been published by the Commission and can be found <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/summary-report-public-consultation-european-strategy-data\">here</url>.</p><p>S&amp;D MEP Miapetra Kumpula-Natri, rapporteur in the European Parliament for the Industry Committee's report on the EU Data Strategy, recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/digital-brief-to-gdpr-or-not/\">noted her general thoughts</url> on the plans, highlighting the importance of common guidelines for cross-sectoral data flows, and also pitching the establishment of a data governance body.</p><p>Later in the year, a legislative framework on common European data spaces will be presented by the Commission, and an implementing act on a list of high-value datasets will come forth in 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gaia-X</emphasis></p><p>Meanwhile, honing in on Europe's cloud dataspace, in June, France and Germany's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/data-protection/news/altmaier-charts-gaia-x-as-the-beginning-of-a-european-data-ecosystem/\">launched their ambitious bid</url> to create a European cloud data infrastructure to stave off US and Chinese competitors.</p><p>The Gaia-X initiative will set European standards for data storage and also function as a platform for businesses to search for data storage providers, in addition to offering a secure environment for the cross-business sharing of data in Europe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ePrivacy </emphasis></p><p>Nearly four years on, negotiations in the Council on the EU's bid to protect data transmitted over electronic communications as part of the e-Privacy regulation continues. In mid-July national delegations were consulted as part of a Council Telecoms working party on how best to move forward with the plans, particularly in the context of the German Presidency's hopes of reaching an agreement before the end of the year.</p><p>The German Presidency <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/EU/XXVII/EU/02/60/EU_26063/imfname_10991219.pdf\">stated that agreement</url> on Articles 6 to 6d and Article 8 is necessary to move forward. Article 6 of the plans covers the accessing of metadata without the users' consent while Article 8 hones in on the protection of end-users' terminal equipment information.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Privacy Shield</emphasis></p><p>The EU-US Privacy Shield agreement that attempts to guarantee the secure transmission of EU data to the United States, was declared invalid by the European Court of Justice, in a ruling that will provoke major disruption to transatlantic data flows.</p><p>The ruling by Europe's highest court found that the scope and pervasiveness of the US surveillance framework does not allow for a sufficient degree of protection for European data, putting it at risk of violating rights afforded to citizens under the EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR). <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/eu-us-data-transfers-at-critical-risk-as-ecj-invalidates-privacy-shield/\">Read more here</url>.</p><p>Since the strike down was made, it has transpired that the US Commerce Department and the European Commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy-eu-usa/u-s-european-commission-begin-discussions-enhanced-privacy-shield-framework-statement-idUSKCN2561QP\">have commenced</url> talks on building a new privacy shield agreement. However, there are those that feel that the reach of the US's surveillance regime will never allow for a truly safe transmission of EU data to the country. For his part, Austrian Privacy activist Max Schrems, a defendant in the recent privacy shield case, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/schrems-charts-us-surveillance-pushback-after-ecj-ruling/\">hopes</url> that there could be a push for surveillance law reform in the US, subsequent to the ECJ's ruling.</p><p>/////</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Artificial Intelligence</emphasis></p><p>In February 2020, the Commission published its Artificial Intelligence White Paper, in which a series of 'high-risk' technologies were earmarked for future oversight, including those in 'critical sectors' and those deemed to be of '<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/high-risk-artificial-intelligence-to-be-certified-tested-and-controlled-commission-says/\">critical use</url>.'</p><p>Subsequent to the presentation of the paper, a consultation was launched which closed on 14 June. Concerns submitted in response to the consultation included the use of biometric technology in AI tech, to the operation of Automated Decision Making (ADM) software. However, stakeholders supporting a softer-regulatory approach have hit out at the Commission's intentions to produce conformity assessments for high-risk Artificial Intelligence applications.</p><p>The Commission will present a follow-up to the White Paper, including on safety, liability, fundamental rights and data in Q1 2021. Commissioner Vestager has, for her part, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/vestager-warns-against-predictive-policing-in-artificial-intelligence/\">recently spoken</url> of her opposition to certain Artificial Intelligence applications, including forms of predictive policing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cybersecurity</emphasis></p><p>In late July, the European Union\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/eu-sanctions-russian-intelligence-north-korean-chinese-firms-over-alleged-cyberattacks\">imposed</url> travel and financial sanctions on a department of Russia's military intelligence service and on firms from North Korea and China over their suspected participation in major cyberattacks across the world. This came as the European Commission presented its new <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/commission-presents-security-strategy-to-tackle-europes-evolving-threat-landscape/\">Security Union strategy</url>, which included measures to bolster cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure as well as preparing the bloc for emerging threats in \"real and digital\" environments.</p><p>Moreover, a new cybersecurity strategy is foreseen in light of the various cyberattacks that hit hospitals across the EU. You may recall that Commission President von der Leyen suggested that China <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/von-der-leyen-chinese-cyberattacks-on-eu-hospitals-cant-be-tolerated/\">may have been behind</url> the offensive.</p><p>The new cybersecurity strategy was included in the Commission's recovery plans presented earlier this year. The EU executive <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-europe-moment-repair-prepare-next-generation.pdf\">says</url> it \"will look at how to boost EU-level cooperation, knowledge and capacity. It will also help Europe strengthen its industrial capabilities and partnerships, and encourage the emergence of SMEs in the field.\" The Commission has also stated that a proposal for \"additional measures on Critical Infrastructure Protection\" will be put forward later this year.</p><p>Moreover, a review of the Directive on security of network and information systems will also come in Q4 this year, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/digital-brief-trump-vs-twitter/\">EURACTIV was recently informed</url> that there is likely to be a potential widening in the scope of operators of essential services.</p><p>/////</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Telecoms</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5G</emphasis></p><p>Current goals in the field include a launch of 5G services in all EU member states by the end of 2020 at the latest, as well as a 'rapid build-up' that will ensure \"uninterrupted 5G coverage in urban areas and along main transport paths by 2025,\" as outlined in the 2016 5G Action Plan for Europe.</p><p>In May, Vestager urged EU telecoms ministers to \"limit as much as possible\" any delays to their 5G spectrum assignments.</p><p>As part of a series of measures unveiled by the Commission in January's 5G Toolbox, member states were tasked with assessing the risk profile of telecom providers, with a view to applying restrictions for those vendors considered to be high-risk.</p><p>A progress report on the plans, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/5g/news/commission-presses-member-states-on-high-risk-5g-vendors/\">presented by the Commission</url> towards the end of July, found that EU nations must make urgent progress on mitigating the risks to 5G telecommunications networks posed by certain high-risk suppliers.</p><p>The call comes at a time when Washington continues to ramp up pressure on the EU to ban Chinese telecoms provider Huawei, following recent moves in the UK and France to limit the company's involvement in their 5G infrastructure.</p><p>The Commission, alongside the member states and the EU's cyber agency, ENISA, will continue to monitor compliance with the 5G toolbox, with a view to potentially analysing the need for stricter security baselines to be recommended at EU level in the future.</p><p>/////</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Money</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Budget and Recovery Fund</emphasis></p><p>In July, EU leaders reached a 'historic agreement' on the new multi-annual financial framework and the recovery and resilience fund. However, in order to achieve these new agreements, substantial cuts have been made to the bloc's various funding programs, including in digital fields. As things stand, below you will find a short breakdown of what is on offer in the digital arena. Bear in mind, however, that Parliament is still to sign off on the long-term budget, and the house still <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/parliament-threatens-to-withhold-consent-on-budget-cuts-potentially-delaying-recovery-plans/\">has a number of concerns</url>. Should Parliament not approve the plans, the recovery fund could also be impacted.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Horizon Europe</emphasis> is the bloc's research and innovation funding framework and while there has been an increase from the previous MFF, some will question whether it is sufficient in a radically new global context. However, the plan is in line for a (EURO)5bn increase under the recovery fund.</p><p>The\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Connecting Europe facility</emphasis>\u00a0is designed to foster an \"up-to-date, high-performance infrastructure to help connect and integrate the Union and all its regions, in the transport, energy and digital sectors.\"</p><p>In terms of the digital branch of the programme, the recovery fund will not contribute anything, but the MFF allocation is doubled from the previous long-term budget. The figures are, however, very small when analysed in the context of other comprehensive infrastructure programmes, including China's Belt and Road initiative, which has plans to enter the EU through Italy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Digital Europe</emphasis> will invest in key strategic digital capacities such as the EU's high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Despite being reduced from the Commission's 27 May proposal of (EURO)8.2bn, the new figures are still considerably higher than the previous MFF, with the programme receiving (EURO)6.76bn.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Digital Tax</emphasis></p><p>Meanwhile, in terms of funding the post-Covid-19 recovery, the European Council has put forward several 'own resources' proposals, which include a levy on digital giants - an option very amenable to European Parliamentarians. In the Council conclusions, EU heads of state tasked the Commission with coming up with a\u00a0 proposal on the Digital Tax in Q1 2021, should there be no international agreement by that date.</p><p>However, EU efforts could be stymied by the fact that agreements on tax policy require unanimity in the Council, which thwarted progress last year on the digital tax plans previously presented by the Commission.</p><p>Attempts to introduce a bloc-wide digital services tax faltered following opposition led by Ireland, Finland and Sweden to a planned 3% levy on companies earning (EURO)750 million in revenue,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>(EURO)50 million of which would need to be EU taxable revenue. For its part, Parliament has long supported the idea of a digital services tax.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron told French TV that he envisages an EU-wide levy on big tech multinationals, along the lines of a digital tax, which France plans to impose this year.</p><p>Macron's comments, made on 21 July, came after he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/macron-backs-down-on-digital-tax-following-trumps-tariff-threats/\">backed down earlier this year on levying hefty taxes on some of Silicon Valley's biggest names in January</url>, following US President Donald Trump's tariff threats.</p><p>/////</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Democracy / Media</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Democracy Action Plan </emphasis></p><p>In mid-July, the Commission launched public consultations on its 'Democracy Action Plan, which the executive is due to put forth before the close of 2020. The plans aim to safeguard against external interference and manipulation in elections, media freedom and pluralism and the fight against disinformation. The public consultation closes on 15 September.</p><p>As part of the feedback period, the Commission placed a particular focus on areas covering the transparency of political ads online, tackling disinformation, and protecting media freedom, independence and pluralism.</p><p>In this context, a July report backed by the Commission found that it is of the '<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/uptmost-importance-for-transparency-rules-on-political-ads-eu-report-says/\">utmost importance</url>' for the EU to do more to rein in the unregulated environment of online political advertising by establishing more stringent transparency obligations.</p><p>In addition, announcing a raft of new funding plans to promote media freedom and pluralism in Europe in March, the Commission's Vice-President for Values and Transparency, Vera Jourova, said that the '<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/media-freedom-and-pluralism-key-to-democracy-action-plan/\">key objective'</url> of the European Democracy Action Plan is to \"strengthen media freedom and pluralism.\"</p><p>The precise scope and content of the Action Plan is also dependent on the Digital Service Act proposal.</p><p>/////</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Skills</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Digital Education Action Plan </emphasis></p><p>In late July, the EU's Innovation and Research Commissioner Mariya Gabriel <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/gabriel-outlines-key-areas-for-eu-digital-education-action-plan/\">said</url> that developing digital competencies across the EU as well as promoting gender equality in the bloc's digital economy are two key areas that the Commission will seek to foster as part of the forthcoming revamped Digital Education Action Plan.</p><p>\"The overall objective will be to close the digital skills gap and make digital literacy a reality for all,\" Gabriel said on the plans, which are expected to be published late September. A public consultation is open until 4 September.</p><p>At the beginning of July, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/commission-in-bid-to-ensure-70-of-eu-adults-have-digital-skills/\">EU executive laid out</url> ambitious new goals for upskilling and reskilling the bloc by 2025, including the objective of ensuring that 70% of the EU adult population has basic digital skills.</p><p>The benchmark is part of the Commission's revised European Skills Agenda published on Wednesday (7 July), along with the Youth Employment Support Package. The 70% target is a 24% mark-up from 2019 figures.</p><p>The announcement followed the recent publication of the Commission's Digital Economy and Society Index, which found that a large part of the EU population \"lacks basic digital skills, even though most jobs require such skills.\"</p><p>More broadly, there has been no shortage of lawmakers in Brussels highlighting the fact that the economic struggle brought on by the coronavirus only serves to underline the importance of boosting the bloc's digital skills.

As a first step, U.S government officials need to understand how authoritarian regimes are using these tools to control their populations and disrupt democratic societies around the world. To this end, Bridging the Gap and the Center for a New American Security brought together a community of researchers and policymakers to address these questions. Participants included experts from Congress, the State Department, the National Security Council, and elsewhere in the U.S government and the broader policy community, as well as outside scholars who prepared research-based memoranda for discussion. This introductory article kicks off a short series on this important topic that includes articles adapted from a selection of these memos.</p><p>While democrats once believed that innovations in information and communications technology and data analysis would promote more open societies, the actual effects of these tools have been mixed. Authoritarians are using technology to deepen their grip internally, spread propaganda, undermine basic human rights, promote illiberal practices beyond their borders, and erode public trust in open societies. Today, Russia continues its campaign of cyber and information attacks against democratic institutions and social cohesion in the United States and Europe. Iran and North Korea are following suit. The Chinese Communist Party is forging a future of mass surveillance and \u201csocial credit\u201d scores, and rapidly exporting those tools to other parts of the world. Autocratic governments seem to be outpacing free societies in harnessing new technologies to advance their political goals.</p><p>Become a Member</p><p>The United States and like-minded countries must develop a new strategic framework to combat the rise of high-tech illiberalism. Building the right policy toolkit will require a deeper understanding of the strategic goals being pursued by authoritarian governments in the digital era \u2014 both within their borders and internationally \u2014 and of the methods these governments are employing in pursuit of these goals.</p><p>So far, U.S policy responses to digital authoritarianism have been limited by several factors.</p><p>First, the U.S government doesn\u2019t understand technology very well. Yes, many foundations of the information economy were created through government initiatives, and advanced digital tools are employed throughout the government, especially in the national security community. But in the places where policy is made \u2014 Congress, the White House, and the political strata of cabinet agencies \u2014 politicians continue to apply old rules to new tools, hindering effective planning and responses.</p><p>Congress in particular has taken a \u201cdo-no-harm\u201d approach to regulating technology companies \u2014 meaning no harm to corporate interests and innovation. The current model has led to a tech ecosystem in Silicon Valley and beyond that remains committed to Facebook\u2019s old informal motto, \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d As a result, today\u2019s digital marketplace generates new tools and platforms more rapidly than even industry experts can process.</p><p>Consider facial recognition technology, which has broad implications for how governments and others can surveil citizens. The unregulated nature of facial recognition tools has led technologists such as Microsoft president Brad Smith to practically beg for the government to step in. So far, such calls have been in vain. And if Congress can\u2019t decide how to treat new technologies at home, it has little standing to call out wavering democracies or autocrats using these same tools overseas. Moreover, if the United States hopes to shape the future use of these technologies, it must have a political and legal framework in place that other countries want to replicate. Without congressional action, this is unlikely to happen.</p><p>It\u2019s a similar story with efforts to stop the manipulation of social media for political purposes. In the United States, policy on digital media content is governed largely by section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which says that \u201cinteractive computer services\u201d are in most cases to be treated as distributors of content, rather than as publishers. This has allowed platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to adopt a minimalist approach to moderating user content. (Like Microsoft\u2019s Smith, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also called for more government regulation, but critics doubt the seriousness of his proposals.) Lax moderation has contributed to the well-publicized political exploitation of Facebook by Russian agents \u2014 which has continued in earnest since the 2016 election \u2014 and to the spread of hateful rhetoric that has led to riots and other violence in India and other countries around the world. New advances in \u201cdeepfakes,\u201d facial recognition, and artificial intelligence, paired with rapid global technology adoption, will only intensify and accelerate these practices.</p><p>Second, evaluating the impact of even ostensibly benign technology depends on one\u2019s perspective. While American corporations use data harvesting and analytics to micro-target consumer preferences, these algorithmic tools are equally being deployed to tailor disinformation for susceptible audiences in ways that pollute democratic discourse and threaten national security. New digital technologies that improve service delivery and public goods provision around the world can also be used in the service of public bads like targeted censorship and repression, which are often more effective at the subnational level. Steven Feldstein explores this dynamic in a subsequent article in this series. For example, policing tools such as China\u2019s widely exported surveillance technology can promote not only necessary security but also authoritarianism in adopting countries.</p><p>Third, a surprising lack of U.S competitiveness in the information and communications technology marketplace has ceded advantage to China and others. This stems in part from the ongoing wariness in the relationship between Big Tech and the U.S government, and the lack of strategic alignment in American corporate and national interests abroad. Meanwhile, as Jessica Chen Weiss outlines in her forthcoming contribution to the series, Beijing has encouraged and paved the way for enormous Chinese corporate buildout overseas, with the spread of technology enabled by public\u2013private partnerships to finance and build the supporting groundwork. The resulting digital infrastructure has embedded Chinese influence in key countries and regions for the foreseeable future. Huawei\u2019s aggressive push to dominate global 5G wireless networks is a case in point. Whether or not this constitutes a sustained strategic campaign on China\u2019s part, the cumulative effects of the diffusion of Chinese technology will have serious consequences for U.S influence around the world.</p><p>The United States should take several steps to counter digital authoritarianism. First, it should improve regulatory practices to forestall the worst effects of digital technologies both at home and abroad. For Congress, this includes revisiting section 230 to promote more responsible approaches to moderating content, and encouraging platforms to shut down the authoritarian social media tactics, such as flooding and filtering, that Seva Gunitsky discusses in his forthcoming article in the series. . Policymakers should also consider additional export controls on made-in-America tools that can be used for surveillance and political disruption, such as the restrictions recently imposed on China for its treatment of the Uyghur minority.</p><p>Externally, the United States should address the demand for illiberal surveillance technologies. In many cases, surveillance technologies are adopted to meet genuine local needs, such as reducing high crime rates. The U.S government should identify those countries and localities most likely to import these technologies, and work to shape the policy landscape and legal frameworks that guide the use of technology in these settings. This approach would leverage diplomacy and foreign aid to promote responsible adoption of digital technologies, including advising governments on how to protect privacy and civil rights as these tools are deployed, and developing alternative tools to compete with those currently in the marketplace.</p><p>Over the longer term, the United States will need to work with allies and partners to develop global standards for the use of surveillance and other potentially illiberal technologies. Establishing an overarching framework \u2014 akin to the arms control regime \u2014 that creates restrictions on the proliferation and use of new technologies would further enhance the resilience of democracy in the face of technological change. Such an agreement might also include provisions to sanction those who attempt to use digital technologies to disrupt democratic processes abroad, as the United States did following Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential and 2018 midterm elections. Recent research shows that such sanctions can be effective at signaling U.S resolve and deterring future behavior, but are less useful for ending current practices. This highlights the need for a proactive rather than reactive sanctions approach, to make bad actors think twice before engaging in future illiberal practices.</p><p>Finally, policymakers and scholars concerned about digital authoritarianism ought to commit to further research and dialogue on the topic. This might include tripartite working groups convening policymakers, academics, and corporate actors to share information about the sources and types of technologies used by autocratic governments for surveillance, control, economic development, and public service provision. New research should also address how these tools are spreading across borders \u2014 in particular, how exporting countries such as China and Russia are helping other autocracies build internal digital infrastructures, what factors influence the ability and willingness of other countries to effectively use these technologies, and how societies across the world respond to authoritarian surveillance measures. We also need a clearer idea of how U.S -based companies are contributing to the abuses of digital autocracies around the world. The United States is losing ground in the race to leverage digital technologies to promote its national interests and values around the world. To meet this challenge, we need to understand it better.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2958271</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6F-P9W1-F0YC-N0K9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1799\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

People with experience at Netflix, Alibaba, Amazon and Tencent are in strong demand, especially those who can code. I always remember the comment from a former senior member of Deutsche Bank's leadership team, Marcus Schenk, that the ability to code is now becoming as important as the ability to speak English in business, and that statement becomes more and more true all the time. </p><p>Interestingly, many of the banks that are committed to digital are getting their bankers on training courses in Python, and they are advertising new jobs with titles of data engineer and data scientist. Meantime, in a reverse play, the Big Tech firms that are trying to get into the low hanging fruit of financial services are hiring bankers. They don't want them to code, but to explain the dynamics of how credit and payments markets operate, how the profit is made and to assist in designing new hybrid products that allow Big Tech firms to operate financial products with light regulation. What this tells me is that technology - digital - and finance - banking - is merging. I foretold this would happen in the 1990s, but was way too early off the mark. Some twenty-five years later, it is now coming true. I wonder what will happen in another twenty-five years? If I was a betting man, which I am sometimes, then I would put a marker firmly down today to say that it will be very difficult to tell the difference between a Big Tech firm and a bank in 2045. Structurally and operationally they will look very similar. Their human resources and management will look the same. Their buildings and offices will be identical. The only difference will be their product and services. Now that is no wild statement, but a result of the fundamentals of the digital revolution and I could just as easily have said the above about a retailer, entertainments business or any other services focused company. They will all look the same as Big Tech firms, apart from their products and services. And banks will still be around in twenty-five years. Bear in mind that banking is a heavily regulated industry and you can see why. However, the way in which banks make money, store money and manage money will be completely different. There won't be any trading desks or branches, there will be far fewer relationship managers and private bankers; and there will be almost no masters of the universe or big swinging dicks*. Instead, there will be a loosely coupled operation of 1000s of people working in small teams to develop cutting-edge technologies to save, spend and invest. You might say that's what the whole FinTech bubble has been all about but, as Fin and Tech merges, we will think very differently. Equally, the follow-on is that management theories and structures have to change substantially to keep up. Just-in-time processing, hierarchical structures, command-control and all the things that worked for the industrial revolution will fail in the digital revolution. What we now need is real-time processing, flattened organisations and coach-counsel management. Again, a tough ask for a company grounded in the industrial era, but some banks really get this and are getting on with it.

Perhaps it is Amazon's Alexa - revealed earlier this year to be forever listening to its users' conversations - that provides the emblem of the age.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, while such devices can certainly make our lives easier in some respects, their development has caused understandable concern on the part of many consumers and regulators that we are sliding - almost inexorably - into a surveillance society.</p><p>The creation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was a reaction to the rapid development of always-on tech and the drive to turn big data into big bucks.</p><p>But almost 18 months on from the birth of GDPR, the battle between businesses and regulators still rages, throwing up some important questions. Are regulations doomed to failure against the seeminglyunstoppable development of technology? And just how safe is your data in the hands of big tech? SCOUTING THE BATTLEFIELD So who are the participants in this battle? Apart from the tech giants themselves, we have the regulators, whose teeth have been set on edge by the perceived domination of the market by a handful of companies - which have access to vast oceans of data - combined with the rapid development of always-on technology.</p><p>And it's not just regulators - politicians are worried as well. US senator Elizabeth Warren has made breaking up big tech a centrepiece of her big for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential race, placing a billboard in Silicon Valley threatening just this.</p><p>Indeed, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton stated last week that \"Google's enormous economic power, fuelled by advertising, gives it unprecedented influence over Americans' lives\", as 50 US states announced antitrust investigations into the big tech giants.</p><p>Amazon, meanwhile, was thrust into a battle with its shareholders over the development of facial recognition technology - which presents \"unique privacy considerations, but also clear security benefits\", according to a Congressional hearing in July. Amazon won that battle, but the war continues.</p><p>ONLINE WARFARE This war is being fuelled by rising consumer awareness that their data is increasingly being used in \"creepy\" ways. This is evident from the 160 per cent rise in consumer complaints to the Information Commissioner's Office following the introduction of the GDPR.</p><p>EU regulators and policymakers have picked up on these concerns, particularly around always-on technology - marketed as being something that consumers should quickly adopt - as it arguably represents an encroachment into EUprotected human rights, not least the basic right to privacy and respect for family life.</p><p>Against such a backdrop, regulators have said that they are prepared to flex their new data law muscles, and we have seen the first wave of larger fines: for example, Google was fined (EURO)50m in January, while British Airways and the Marriott hotel chain were handed fines totalling almost \u00a3300m in July. Under GDPR, businesses can potentially be fined up to (EURO)20m or four per cent of global revenue or turnover per breach.</p><p>Importantly, GDPR has been carefully drafted to have extraterritorial reach in order to catch companies even if they are not based in the EU. It also empowers consumers with a quiver of new rights, including the right of erasure, to see how data is used, and to instruct data to be moved.</p><p>As people become more aware of their rights, we will doubtless see an increase in complaints to the regulators. Businesses which do not prepare now to properly respond to this will be those most likely to be fined, and also risk brand and reputation damage as a result.</p><p>FUTURE WEAPONS It is worth noting that 2019 and 2020 will not only see a greater number of enforcement rulings and significant fines, but will likely see regulators offered further new powers.</p><p>One such weapon coming down the tracks is the ePrivacy Regulation, which has passed largely unnoticed to date, but will have just as heavy-hitting fines, and arguably impact more day-to-day aspects of doing business, such as marketing, selling, customer profiling, and website tracking.</p><p>Businesses are aware that the tide is turning. And they are starting to respond. Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, has been keen to talk publicly about his company's respect for its users' data, while the head of Microsoft went further by saying that GDPR should serve as the new global standard.</p><p>Whatever one's views on whether the tech companies are getting it right or wrong - or whether these are just Google and Microsoft's reactions to antitrust and competition law fines which have been imposed so far - what is clear is that status quo practices will no longer be acceptable. Businesses - and not just those in tech - need to act now to update and change how they operate.</p><p>Regulators and consumers have been handed powerful new weapons, and will no doubt look to use them as the battle for the age of the internet of things rages on.</p><p>\u00a3 Rafi Azim-Khan is partner and head of data privacy, Europe, at Pillsbury Law.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-152999448</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2N-0R81-JCBW-N037-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 City A.M.

On a bright Friday morning, Frank O'Brien is giving me a tour through Times Square in New York City. Thousands of strangers are milling around us on the sidewalk, and in the crowd, it's easy to feel anonymous. But according to O'Brien, many of the billboards and screens towering over our heads in every direction know a lot about who we are. </p><p>'As we stand here, there are devices behind that screen that are picking ID numbers from our cell phones,' O'Brien tells me, gesturing towards a billboard at 42nd Street and 7th Avenue. Using those devices and other technology, he says, 'We know who is in Times Square at a given moment.\" O'Brien, the CEO of a high-tech advertising platform called Five Tier, launches an app on his phone. He taps a few buttons and in an instant, the billboard changes to display a picture of me I'd sent him the day before. Suddenly, I'm famous, with a 20-foot-high photo of me gazing out over the tourists. 'It still amazes me sometimes,' he says. Five Tier doesn't typically change the content manually. In practice, automated systems update the ads in real time based on a stream of data from nearby cell phones, which is combined with personal information on those passersby from data brokers who trade in the details of consumers' lives. When we go out into public, we are often surrounded by screens showing ads. They can be on the side of the road, at the gym, in store windows, in doctors' offices, and in elevators. You might assume that the marketing messages are playing on a loop, but sometimes these ads are changing because people like you are nearby. Data including your gender, age, race, income, interests, and purchasing habits can be used by a company such as Five Tier to trigger an advertisement right away. Or, more often, it will be used for planning where and when to show ads in the future\u2014maybe parents of school-age children tend to pass a particular screen at 3 p.m. on weekdays, while 20-something singles usually congregate nearby on Saturday nights. Then the tracking continues. Once your phone is detected near a screen showing a particular ad, an advertising company may follow up by showing you related ads in your social media feed, and in some cases these ads may be timed to coordinate with the commercials you see on your smart TV at night. It doesn't stop there. Advertisers are keenly interested in 'attribution,' judging how well a marketing campaign influences consumer behavior. For instance, is it better to target people like you with online ads for fast food right after you see a restaurant's new TV commercial, or to wait until after you drive by a new billboard the next day? The advertising industry looks for the answers by watching where you go in person, what you do online, and what you buy with your credit card. These aren't futuristic scenarios. They are a recent but growing trend, according to executives in the advertising business. 'The industry has really started to wake up to this within the last year,' says Ian Dallimore, the director of digital growth for Lamar Advertising, a leader in out-of-home advertising. 'If you're not using data to better plan and buy ads, then you're probably not doing out-of-home the right way.' Researchers say that as tracking and ad targeting spill over from the web into the real world, our collective privacy and sense of control are eroding.If you don't want to see ads at home, you can close your browser or turn off your phone, but you can't avoid the ads you see in public. And there's no practical way to completely block the location tracking used to place those ads. 'Advertising has been increasingly interested in using behavioral psychology to nudge people in particular ways,' says Matthew Crain, assistant professor of media and culture at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. 'The ability to gather data on what we do and how we move through the world makes that more effective. It raises new questions about the lines between persuasive advertising and manipulation.' The out-of-home market provides a fresh window into how consumer data is being used by advertisers. Soon, it seems, almost every part of your life may be just another data point for marketing clients to consider and another opportunity to monetize your attention by showing you an ad. Hey, I Spotted You at Kohl's. Wanna See a DSW Billboard? Out-of-home advertising covers everything from old-fashioned billboards to the little TV screens on the sides of gas pumps. Until recently, the companies that handled these ads only thought about competing with each other, says Franois-Xavier Pierrel, chief data officer at JCDecaux, a global leader in the industry. But as targeted advertising took over the web, that changed\u2014clients started to expect more data, and more personalization. 'We had to step up,'Pierrel says. Today, the out-of-home advertising business is adopting the model that runs ads on the web, with more ads being sold based on granular details about the audiences that will be exposed to them. Last summer, Lamar Advertising helped the shoe retailer DSW use out-of-home screens to promote the grand opening of a new store at a mall in Mount Prospect, Ill., a suburb northwest of Chicago. The company found consumers to target through 'geofencing,' using location-tracking technology to sniff out cell phones that entered competing stores, such as Kohl's, Macy's, Marshalls, and Nordstrom Rack. The owners of those phones would be good prospects, so Lamar used geofencing at screens around town, waiting until enough of those phones were detected nearby, and then automatically triggering ads for the DSW store. 'It's happening everywhere,' says Lamar's Dallimore. 'As the data changes, we're changing the creative in real time.' Later, the company wanted to measure how many people who were exposed to the DSW advertisements went to the new store. Using location tracking, Lamar estimated that 442 people walked into the DSW as a result of the ads. Out-of-home ad networks typically don't learn the names or email addresses of individuals, but the data they receive can feel highly personal. Back at Five Tier's office in midtown Manhattan, O'Brien shows me the system that runs the company's advertising platform. One tab he pulls up displays a list of mobile devices that are currently in Times Square. Another shows the number of 18- to 24-year-old women in range of a particular set of screens in Germany. A third loads metrics from an ad campaign for a car dealership in Oklahoma, laying out the genders, ages, races, credit scores, income levels, and lifestyles of people seen in the area at different times of the day. 'We want data as fast as it's available,' O'Brien says. 'We have some that's coming in every second.' Out-of-home advertising networks operated by companies such as Five Tier allow clients to use online dashboards to (clockwise from upper left) set up ad campaigns; look for digital billboards where their ads can be shown; and learn details about frequent passersby, such as their race, credit scores, income, and interests. Would-be clients can bid on out-of-home advertising slots by using automated platforms operated by Five Tier, JCDecaux, Lamar, and other companies. And more big tech companies are moving into this business\u2014Google confirmed to Consumer Reports that it is starting to experiment with out-of-home advertising. You can glimpse the potential scale of the out-of-home advertising industry courtesy of a firm called Adomni, headquartered in Las Vegas. Type your city into the company's website, and alist appears with all the screens where Adomni can serve an ad. There are tens of thousands of them in the U.S. On a recent day, you could play 15-second ads in Times Square for just over $10 a pop, while 42-and-a-half cents bought the same screen time on a highway billboard near Citi Field, home of the New York Mets. In Mount Prospect, Ill., ad time on a network of screens in doctors' office waiting rooms cost about a quarter. Out-of-home ad companies don't need to own the screens they use, and often they don't. Any display connected to the internet can be hooked up to an advertising network. 'Think of us as the pipes,' says Jonathan Gudai, Adomni's CEO. 'Screens are popping up everywhere around us. As long as it's in a high enough traffic area, then it's a good candidate to be listed on our platform and monetized.' Tag\u2014You're a Prospect Out-of-home advertising relies on a tangled web of companies that collect, analyze, and trade information about consumers. 'We do not produce any mobile data ourselves,'JCDecaux's Pierrel says. 'We buy it from third parties.' One location data broker that specializes in out-of-home advertising is PlaceIQ. The company pairs location data collected from software embedded in all kinds of mobile apps, with additional details sourced from other data brokers to create a detailed picture of the people passing through an area. Location data brokers can generate some details based on physical tracking alone\u2014where you shop, work, or attend church can say a lot that's of interest to advertisers. PlaceIQ says it also uses outside sources to gather information such as your recent purchases, driving habits, and what you watch on TV. The company's list of data partners includes companies such as Experian, Mastercard, and Nielsen Catalina. (PlaceIQ did not respond to Consumer Reports' request for comment.) Bluetooth beacons (left) and WiFi sniffers are placed in many public areas, including shopping centers and malls, to determine which smartphones\u2014and their owners\u2014are nearby. A number of marketing companies use these devices to plan advertising, while others rely on data collected and shared by mobile apps. Here's how it works. A location data broker may gather data streaming off mobile apps on your phone, and record the fact that you go to the gym twice a week. Other companies may know thatyou frequently use your credit card at natural-foods grocery stores and that you subscribe to a running magazine. Later, when a food manufacturer wants to promote its new organic protein bar, the advertising firm it hires can target you for a marketing campaign, along with lots of others consumers\u2014who have all been tagged as health fanatics. The location-tracking part of that process depends on one piece of technology not owned by the data companies: your smartphone. 'I would expect that almost everyone has at least one app on their phones that sends location data to third parties,' says Serge Egelman, a digital security and privacy researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies how apps gather consumer data. 'Your device is constantly broadcasting unique identifiers,' Egelman says. For instance, your phone transmits Bluetooth and WiFi MAC addresses to help it discover and communicate with wireless networks and other devices. Some location brokers make use of small, inconspicuous devices that can pick those numbers out of the air to identify the phones that wander by.These devices are scattered across public spaces. (You may be sitting near one right now.) However, Apple and Google, the maker of the Android operating system, have recently taken steps to make it harder for phones to be tracked this way. Targeted Ad, or Just a Billboard? In the advertising industry, some people are concerned about a privacy backlash, even as personalization is making ads more relevant and useful to consumers. 'We are moving towards a world in which advertising will essentially follow us around based on data from our phones or other devices,' says Jeremy Katz, worldwide editorial director for Ogilvy, one of the world's leading advertising agencies. 'But I don't think we've decided as a society whether or not that's how we want our world to look.' Several out-of-home advertising insiders echoed those concerns. It would be easy for companies to target ads in public directly at individuals, several executives told me, but for now, that isn't happening. That's partly because it's not cost-effective, but also because it might feel creepy. 'For us it's about transparency,' Lamar's Ian Dallimore says. 'Our biggest thing is making sure we're not being too specific to an individual.' Companies such as Adomni, Five Tier, JCDecaux, and Lamar emphasize that they don't learn identifying details such as the names, email addresses, or phone numbers of the people whose data flows across their screens. And most of the information is aggregated\u2014they want to know how many people of a certain target audience are present at a particular time, not who each individual is. They don't need that information to plan ad placements, and to keep the revenue flowing. Still, the data that fuels advertising systems, online and offline, is highly personal. 'I guess I'm glad they're not specifically interested in me as an individual, but the privacy violation is the same,' says Justin Brookman, who directs privacy and security policy at Consumer Reports. 'The data collection and sharing is still happening.' Lawmakers and regulatory agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission are paying more attention to data privacy, but it's not clear how the measures being put in place will affect the way individuals are tracked through their phones, and how the data is used by data brokers and their clients. Several out-of-home advertising companies I spoke with said they already comply with GDPR, Europe's sweeping privacy regulation that was implemented in 2018. The companies also say they are prepared for the most stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act, which is supported by Consumer Reports and goes into effect in January 2020. Five Tier's Frank O'Brien says that, just like every other industry, the out-of-home advertising business should be regulated. But for now, if you're not comfortable with how out-of-home advertising uses your information, you don't have much recourse. 'I don't think there's anything you can do about it,' he says. In the meantime, out-of-home advertising is charging ahead. Last summer, Adomni ran a campaign for the Ultimate Fighting Championship based on the daily travel patterns of consumers singled out as potential fans. Over the past year in Buffalo, N.Y., Lamar targeted consumers exposed to out-of-home advertising for Tim Hortons restaurants with additional ads on their mobile devices. And in Times Square, Five Tier helped promote an event by a Sikh religious organization by playing ads when the target demographic was nearby. If this kind of geofencing and ad targeting bothers you, you can adjust the location permissions on your phone to limit which apps have access to your GPS data, and delete as many apps as possible. You can put your device on airplane mode, or even leave it at home. That will all make a difference, but you can't opt out entirely if you like using 21st century technology. Recently, I was heading home after meeting a friend for dinner. I'd been thinking about selling my old Samsung Galaxy phone, and as I approached a screen on the side of a bus stop, a new ad popped up, promoting used cell phones on eBay. Was the ad triggered because I was there and I'd been researching how much I could get for my used phone in recent weeks? Had some advertising company noticed that eBay shoppers tended to pass by this corner around 8 p.m. on Thursdays? Or was the ad just playing on a loop? The internet has long since changed the way we access information and communicate with each other, and today it's altering the way we experience the physical world. As companies fight for your attention, you can probably feel it all happening, but for most people, the details are just out of reach.

Utilising data from these wearable sensors provides a measure of symptoms and identification of real-time digital biomarkers which are identified and reported through analytics, often powered by AI. This method of data collection provides rapid, scalable, and objective measurements. Outcomes measures: from 20th to 21st CenturyClinical trials require a movement from relying on the episodic, insensitive, subjective assessments of the 20th century to a 21st century approach that uses sensitive, frequent or continuous, objective assessments that can be carried out remotely. Tools to do this include smartphones, wearables, and mobile apps. </p><p>New endpointsCompanies have been working towards integrating digital measurements across the continuum of research and clinical care, ensuring connected devices can provide a holistic view of patient health. Companies that develop digital biomarkers validate these tools through clinical research as a first step towards what may eventually become a validated digital diagnostic or a digital therapeutic. Digitised virtual clinical researchFor biopharmaceutical companies, wearables are improving internal processes through understanding patient biometrics and functionality from fitness tracking, heart rate, heart rate variability, and sleep, to more disease-specific biometrics including glucose monitoring, sweat analysis, electro-stimulation, and pressure sensors. To date, wearables are being used to support clinical trials across therapeutic areas from CV, neuroscience, respiratory, sleep, and stress to metabolic disorders, rheumatology, and pain. These digitised trials are conducted virtually outside the clinic to capture data on study participants as they go about their everyday life. Remote patient monitoringRPM refers to the measurement and analysis of a patient's health metrics, including vital signs, outside of a traditional clinical setting. This can include heart rate, blood glucose, temperature, and medication adherence. Health and tech are currently moving toward wearables that are continuously monitoring health in a non-invasive, discreet, and seamless manner, being both convenient and comfortable. As patients and caregivers are given the option to provide care at home, unnecessary visits to healthcare establishments will be reduced, substantiating a decentralised healthcare model, optimising the allocation of resources in hospitals and clinics. Culture of digital healthHealthcare is notoriously slow to adapt to change, owing to its risk-averse nature and regulatory complications. It is expected that as the pace of innovation increases, a change in the culture of how digital health is viewed across all involvedpublic, policymakers, providers, and payersand importantly HCPs, will follow. While this is happening in some marketsthe US, distinct areas of Europemany regions are falling behind. At present, there is little to no incentivisation in place to motivate physicians and patients to use and understand newer technology in practice. GlobalData predicts that, to build a system of trust, digital change will require an adaptive approach that is reflexive to the changing needs of staff and the projects undertaken by a healthcare system as a whole. Consumer-led healthcareHealthcare is in the midst of a transformation into a patient-centric, consumer-led mode. The industry is moving away from traditional medicine to inform patient carean inefficient and costly method of care seeking and delivery. Additionally, digital tools are accessible for consumers, which drive their uptake. In turn, this generates easily accessible health data tracking and monitoring by users' clinicians, driving a culture of awareness of one's own health. Big tech and healthcareWith the recognition that the world is becoming more digitally savvy and that digital tools will be an essential component in the future of healthcare, tech players are becoming ever more embedded within healthcare, either through services, products, or combination ventures. Combined with leaps forward in AI and ML, the market for digital tools is becoming more personalised and disease-specific. Big dataDigital tools such as wearables are a key tool in collecting large amounts of data and can easily be paired with software systems for analysis. Google (Alphabet) is developing algorithms that interpret large collections of data from connected devices, and these interpretations can be used to develop AI programs to automate many healthcare functions. Value-based healthcare modelConnected digital devices have the ability to distribute insights across the value chain with a huge potential to address chronic conditions, which require long-term management with more complex care pathways. As the distribution of data changes over the next 510 years, and digital biomarkers are defined and more widely adopted to inform patient care pathways, healthcare will become value-based. Precision medicineDigital biomarkers are particularly valuable for areas such as neurology and psychiatry, which rely on subjective measures, and can provide objective measurements to support diagnosis, prognosis, and measure therapeutic outcomes. On a wider scale, connected digital devices enabling the collection of health data and identification of digital biomarkers has largely been driven by the sports and fitness segment. The popularity of wearable devices has surged, (for example, Fitbits) provides a more holistic profile of an individual's health. The ageing population and rise of chronic diseasesThe proportion of the elderly is growing in almost every country, owing to increased life expectancy, better living conditions, and access to healthcare. Chronic conditions that are associated with later life, such as diabetes, CVD, AD, and PD, are a challenge to healthcare systems. Connected devices and big data analytics with the development of digital biomarkers will play a large role in the tech-assisted transformation currently underway in healthcare. Insurance, data rights, and governanceDigital biomarkers can capture information about users, including detailed behavioural and physiological parameters. This is a particular concern in the US, where health insurers and data brokers are increasingly utilising personal data to create predictions on health costs based on marital status, whether people pay bills on time, smoking status, race, activity (trackers such as Fitbit or Apple Watch), and even whether people buy plus sized clothing. There is an ongoing debate over regulatory interventions or punishments for the misuse of personal health data. Regulations hindering innovationRegulatory control of digital biomarkers is a complex and evolving process. Due to a lack in standardisation and their broad applications across drugs, biological, and medical devices, there is no consistent regulatory framework. In a bid to encourage innovation and ensure delivery of more novel, safe, and effective medical devices to patients, local authorities are encouraged to provide clear and appropriate guidance Post-market surveillance/monitoringThere is a lot of excitement in the healthcare community to use connected devices that track digital biomarkers as tools in post-market monitoring or surveillance. These tools enable the tracking of metrics like safety and efficacy during clinical trials, or at any point in patient care pathways.

The company vehemently denies the accusations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AVMSD.</emphasis> This week, Parliamentarians have been sitting in Brussels, with a number of key hearings in the tech field. Yesterday, DG Connect's Director-General Roberto Viola spoke to the Culture Committee and highlighted issues related to the Audio Visual Media Services Directive, in which he said that the Commission is \"very worried\" about the ever-approaching transposition deadline of September 2020.</p><p>Viola added that to make the process smoother, implementation guidelines would be issued by the Commission on the essential functionality criteria for platforms but that the directive should be used to tackle online hate speech and that any platform which offers a video sharing service comes under the scope.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENTAL HEALTH ONLINE.</emphasis> Meanwhile, British Liberal MEP Judith Bunting pressed Viola on the issue of mental health online. Hers was a timely question, as yesterday the advocacy group Privacy International published a report that <url normalizedValue=\"https://privacyinternational.org/campaigns/your-mental-health-sale\">\"shows that many mental health websites don't take the privacy of their visitors as seriously as they should.\"</url>\u00a0Viola informed her that this is a situation the Commission is taking more seriously and he revealed that Giuseppe Abbamonte, Director of the Media and Data Directorate has been tasked with consulting experts on the negative impacts of social media overuse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DIGITAL SERVICES ACT.</emphasis> In addition, S&amp;D's Petra Kammerevert said that the recently leaked details of the Commission's plans to regulate the online ecosystem - known as the Digital Services Act, may obscure how the EU deals with rights such as \"freedom of expression and diversity of opinions,\" to which Viola said that this is a \"delicate issue\" but MEPs can \"rest assured that all the steps of better regulation will be followed...[including] public consultation, debate, impact assessment.\" He added however that the eCommerce Directive, which the Digital Services Act will essentially replace, needs to be overhauled.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Internal Market Committee (IMCO) is also vying for influence in the run-up to the Commission's presentation of the Digital Services Act, set to come in the second half of 2020, as they plan to submit an initiative report to the Conference of Committee Chairs on the measures. The Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) are also expected to jockey for influence.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOOGLE DATA BREACH.</emphasis> Yesterday, it transpired that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/data-protection/news/google-siphoning-personal-data-to-advertisers-new-evidence-suggests/\">Google is using a \"surreptitious mechanism\" to leak personal data to advertisers</url>, according to new evidence presented to the Irish Data Protection Commission as part of an ongoing investigation. Google is accused of using hidden web pages that scrape personal data, which is then traded on Google's advertising exchange business 'Authorized Buyers', previously known as DoubleClick.</p><p>In Brussels, Carmen Avram, a Romanian lawmaker from the Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) group, has issued a series of questions to the Commission, asking the executive to confirm whether it was aware that Google is using the sensitive data of its users in this manner.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENISA.</emphasis> Elsewhere in Parliament, ENISA's new chief, Juhan Lepassaar, appeared before the Industry committee (ITRE), earlier this week. He addressed concerns related to the scope and the voluntary nature of cybersecurity certification as part of the recently adopted cybersecurity act, but also said that he hopes the new rules \"can become what the General Data Protection Regulation has become for privacy: the new global standard for trust.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GAIA-X.</emphasis> Big news for Europe's cloud infrastructure, as news surfaced this week that in October, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier is set to reveal more detailed plans for the establishment of a European Cloud initiative known as 'Gaia-X.' Up to now, the European cloud marketplace has been dominated by US firms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SPACE WASTE.</emphasis> In other news, EURACTIV's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/europes-aims-to-clean-up-the-space-graveyard/\">Alexandra Brzozowski</url> writes this week that according to the European Space Agency's (ESA) latest Annual Space Environment Report, the quantity of space junk around Earth has hit a critical point.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIBRA.</emphasis> EURACTIV's Jorge Valero <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/eu-member-states-to-look-into-facebooks-controversial-libra/\">reveals</url>\u00a0that the EU's\u00a0Economic and Financial Committee has\u00a0requested an analysis note from the European Commission to probe the risks posed by Facebook's digital currency Libra and to explore the ways to regulate it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FACEBOOK FACIAL RECOGNITION.</emphasis> Staying with Facebook, in a blow to privacy advocates, judges in Wales have ruled the use of facial recognition by local police is lawful. The ruling came as Facebook tried to appease concerns by <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/09/update-face-recognition/\">making technical changes</url>\u00a0to ensure that\u00a0its facial recognition technology will no longer identify users.</p><p>***</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">On My Radar</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Next week, the <url

However, in order to achieve these new agreements, substantial cuts have been made to the bloc's various funding programs, including in the digital fields.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week, we crunch the numbers in detail and also look at the other big stories in EU politics and policy, in the tech patch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">*Also this week*</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Digital Tax latest, Huawei in France, Slack Vs Microsoft, Hungary media crackdown, Russian UK election interference, Apple's vein matching technology, and more....</emphasis></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Horizon Europe</emphasis> is the bloc's research and innovation funding framework and while there has been an increase from the previous MFF, some will question whether it is sufficient in a radically new global context. However, the plan also comes in for a (EURO)5bn increase under the recovery fund.</p><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Connecting Europe facility</emphasis> is designed to foster an \"up-to-date, high-performance infrastructure to help connect and integrate the Union and all its regions, in the transport, energy and digital sectors.\"</p><p>In terms of the digital branch of the programme, the recovery fund will not contribute anything, but the MFF allocation is doubled from the previous long-term budget. The figures are, however, very small when analysed in the context of other comprehensive infrastructure programmes, including China's Belt and Road initiative, which has plans to enter the EU through Italy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Digital Europe</emphasis> will invest in key strategic digital capacities such as the EU's high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.

The sentiment among EU officials is that should a vote take place on Breton's appointment for the Internal Market portfolio today, which is scheduled to take place directly after the hearing, he could well be turned down by an alliance of GUE, S&amp;D and Green coordinators. Breton requires the support of coordinators representing at least two-thirds of committee members. Should he be turned down once again, Macron would be left feeling very, very embarrassed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the time of reporting, Breton has been keen to appeal to the Germans sitting in Parliament\u00a0 - speaking of his family roots in the country. But there are political battles that need to be won before he can reach out across country borders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One EPP source told EURACTIV that some Socialists could be won round by von der Leyen's concessions yesterday to rename Margaritis Schinas' portfolio to the \"promotion of the European way of life\" and the fact that 'social rights' have been added to the title of Commissioner-designate Nicolas Schmit. The president of the S&amp;D Group in the Parliament, Iratxe Garcia, heralded the changes as a success for the Socialists, calling the revisions \"very positive.\"</p><p>On the tech front, Breton's appointment matters - should he receive Parliament's approval, he will oversee the Commission's DG Connect, responsible for building digital policy.</p><p>Early into his hearing today, he spoke about the importance of the forthcoming Digital Services Act\u00a0 - which the Commission is due to present in 2020. Breton said that the plans will help to improve the \"fluidity and flow of digital services in the EU.\" Renew's Dita Charanzov\u00e1 pressed him on whether the limited liability clause of the eCommerce directive will be negatively impacted by the DSA. Breton said that is wouldn't be.</p><p>The hearing continues. Follow is live with EURACTIV reporters <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/news/commissioner-hearings-live-thierry-breton/\">here</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UK CYBERATTACKS</emphasis>. Both the UK's Conservative and Labour parties have been subject to several \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/cybersecurity/news/suspicious-cyber-attacks-hit-uk-labours-election-campaign/\">sophisticated and large-scale</url>\" cyber-attacks across its digital platforms emanating from an unknown source this week. The news comes as UK political groups jockey for influence in the run-up to the general election on 12 December.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUNGARIAN CYBERATTACKS.\u00a0</emphasis>It's also happening in Hungary. EURACTIV's Vlagyiszlav Makszimov reports this week that the\u00a0website of Erzs\u00e9betv\u00e1ros's (Budapest 7th district) municipal government has been subjected to multiple cyberattacks, with hackers posting obscenities about the newly elected opposition mayor. The attacks come after Budapest held its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/hungarys-opposition-wins-budapest-election-makes-gains-in-other-cities/\">municipal elections in October</url> and the governing Fidesz party lost its majority.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PARIS CYBERSECURITY CALL. </emphasis>President Macron took advantage of this week's Paris Peace forum to speak about the importance of bolstering cybersecurity amongst global partners. The Paris call for trust and security in cyberspace, Macron's attempt to forge a series of norms in cyberspace, includes signatories from 74 states.</p><p>However, there are some notable absentees from the list - such as the US, Russia and China. John Frank, Vice President for EU Affairs at Microsoft, took part in a discussion alongside French government officials during this year's forum and implored the US to sign up, following commitments from various US local and state representatives to the measures. \"The Paris Call builds on international norms that the U.S. has endorsed previously, with the addition of one new commitment that the U.S. should find easy to support: the protection of elections,\" he <url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/11/12/paris-call-consensus-cyberspace/\">wrote</url>following the meeting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDPS. </emphasis>Yesterday, I caught up with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/CV-Yann-Padova-2019-EDPS-EN-08112019.pdf\">Yann Padova</url> - one of the candidates to become the next European Data Protection Supervisor. Those on the shortlist also include       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://naih.hu/files/CV_Endre_-Gyozo_SZABO_ENG.pdf\">Endre Szab\u00f3</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/wwiewiorowski_cv2014_en.pdf\">Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski</url>, the acting head of EU's institutional data protection watchdog following the passing of Giovanni Butarelli. A hearing of all candidates will take place on 25 November in Strasbourg.</p><p>Padova told me he is pitching himself as a 'bridge builder' for the role, using his experience both in the public and private sphere to ensure that institutional staff members are more clued up on the importance of data protection issues. Padova isn't someone who believes that innovation is hindered by data protection regulation, but that the two can be comfortable bedfellows. However, he believes that the Commission's plans to introduce a coordinated AI strategy within the first 100 days will be \"very challenging,\" and, from a legal perspective, rather risky - bearing in mind the importance of data protection in any future Artificial Intelligence strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SLOVENIA SPYING CONCERNS</emphasis>. EURACTIV's Zeljko Trkanjec reports this week that the Parliamentary Committees for the Control of Intelligence and Security Services has concluded that the Slovenian diplomat, Simona Drenik, should be blamed for the interception of her conversation with a former Slovenian judge during the arbitrage process at the Permanent Court of Arbitration regarding the border with Croatia by Croatian intelligence. \"Every schoolgirl who saw any of James Bond movies knows that it is not safe to communicate on fixed lines,\" said Minister of Defence Karl Erjavec. Simona Drenik said she did not break secrecy rules and attacked the committee for politicising the process.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUAWEI in HUNGARY.</emphasis> Devices provided by the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei play a core role in the operation of Hungarian state infrastructure, including in the country's emergency services, an in-depth\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.direkt36.hu/en/csendben-csinalja-de-mar-nyakig-benne-van-a-magyar-kormany-a-huawei-haboruban/\">investigative report by Direkt36</url>\u00a0shows. The US responded to the news by reaffirming the fact that they have \"strong concerns\" about the company.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bloomberg reports this week that Angela Merkel is looking at the possibility of tightening cybersecurity rules aimed at sidelining the Huawei, after increased US pressure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEB REGULATION. </emphasis>Mathias Vermeulen, who previously worked in the office of former MEP Marietke Schaake and is now with the Mozilla Foundation in Brussels, published a paper on the initiatives to regulate the internet, earlier this week. The report, commissioned by the Association for Progressive Communications (APC), recommends the regulation of \"platform-specific architectural amplifiers of illegal or harmful content.\" Vermeulen adds that these \"are active design choices over which platforms have direct control, and for which they could ultimately be held liable.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TERREG.\u00a0</emphasis>Elsewhere, the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) put on an event in the European Parliament earlier this week, hosted by MEP Marina Kaljurand and MEP Patrick Breyer, Shadow Rapporteurs for the Terrorist Content Online Regulation. CISPE continue to rally against the inclusion of cloud services providers in the scope of regulation. \"Europe's cloud infrastructure service providers are being asked to do the impossible. Unlike platforms, they cannot access the data and content controlled by our customer and have no general control or access to what specific content is placed online,\" read a statement from Alban Schmutz, chair of CISPE.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIBRA. </emphasis>EU finance ministers agreed on Friday (8 November) on a draft statement calling for an EU approach to \"appropriately tackle the challenges\" raised by 'stablecoins', digital tokens backed by sovereign currencies.</p><p>The European Commission has called for a \"proportionate\" and differentiated approach to regulating digital currencies including Facebook's Libra, as the EU needs to preserve is developing Fintech environment. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/commission-wary-of-side-effects-of-libra-regulation/\">Read more</url> from our very own Jorge Valero.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DIGITAL EDUCATION. </emphasis>A report from the Centre for European Policy Studies published earlier this week found that Estonia, the Netherlands and Finland excel in the digitalisation of education, while Italy and Germany finished last.

Von der Leyen said that the plans would allow the EU to exploit the \"untapped potential\" of vast troves of industrial data, allowing public and private actors easy access to huge reserves of information. Many elements of the Commission's Data Strategy are informed by the Commission's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/B2GDataSharingExpertGroupReport-1.pdf\">B2G Data Sharing Expert Group Report</url> which notes the importance of enabling an \"environment for privately held data to be shared with public authorities\".</p><p>Proposals put forward on Wednesday include the creation of nine common EU data spaces across sectors including heathcare, agriculture and energy, as well as the establishment of a Data Act in 2021, that could \"foster business-to-government data sharing for the public interest.\"</p><p>The document also notes that Article 20 of the GDPR, the right to data portability, could be \"enhanced\" so as to give individuals \"more control over who can access and use machine-generated data.\" Read more <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/von-der-leyen-opens-the-doors-for-an-eu-data-revolution/\">here</url>.</p><p>French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire and his German counterpart, Peter Altmaier, issued a joint statement welcoming the Commission's data strategy yesterday. \"Germany and France are supporting the European data process through joint initiatives on industrial policy and a European data infrastructure,\" said Altmaier, while Le Maire said he expected the new strategy would enable the EU to develop an AI sector that can compete globally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Artificial Intelligence:\u00a0</emphasis>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/high-risk-artificial-intelligence-to-be-certified-tested-and-controlled-commission-says/\">AI White Paper notes</url> that\u00a0Artificial Intelligence technologies carrying a high-risk of abuse that could potentially lead to an erosion of fundamental rights will be subjected to a series of new requirements.</p><p>A series of 'high-risk' technologies have been earmarked for future oversight, including those in 'critical sectors' and those deemed to be of 'critical use.' Those under the critical sectors remit include healthcare, transport, police, recruitment, and the legal system, while technologies of critical use include technologies with a risk of death, damage or injury, or with legal ramifications.</p><p>There will be\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">no temporary ban\u00a0</emphasis>on facial recognition technologies for now, but the Commission will launch an EU-wide debate on the use of remote biometric identification, of which facial recognition technologies are a part. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/high-risk-artificial-intelligence-to-be-certified-tested-and-controlled-commission-says/\">Read more here</url>.</p><p>In response to the plans, EURACTIV heard from several EU ministers. Dutch Minister for the Interior, Raymond Knops, welcomed the plans for Artificial Intelligence. \"AI gives us a lot of opportunities to innovate, to develop our society and to be competitive, but also deliver services to people from a government perspective,\" he told EURACTIV, adding, however, that regulators shouldn't overlook the potential pitfalls of the technology. \"That means that a certain kind of transparency is essential in order to understand what's happening behind these technologies. This has to do with trust,\" he said.</p><p>The Estonians were keen to get their point across, too. Minister of Foreign Trade and Information Technology Kaimar Karu informed EURACTIV that his government is fully behind investing in the future of AI. \"Data utilisation, machine learning initiatives, and pragmatic AI applications have the potential to significantly increase the productivity of our economy, and to take our public services to the next level,\" he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Digital Strategy:\u00a0</emphasis>In the far-reaching Digital Strategy paper, the EU executive committed itself to fostering 'Technology that works for the people' by increasing the digital prowess of European citizens and companies, doubling down on curbing the market power of tech giants and tapping into ICT's potential for sustainability, EURACTIV's Philipp Gr\u00fcll <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/the-commissions-digital-strategy-more-competition-less-emissions/\">writes</url>.</p><p>The document states that \"businesses need a framework that allows them to start up, scale up, pool and use data, to innovate and compete or cooperate on fair terms\". The Slovenian Perm Rep to the EU got in touch with EURACTIV with their response to the plans, saying that \"the digital transformation of SMEs through the use of data and the artificial intelligence will significantly help to improve business processes and the decarbonation of products and services.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reactions</emphasis>.

EURACTIV's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/leak-these-are-the-five-priorities-for-the-next-finance-commissioner/\">Jorge Valero revealed that a legislative framework for crypto assets\u00a0</url></emphasis>could be introduced in the next executive, and DG FISMA also wants a European financial sector cybersecurity act.</p><p>Jumping over to the theme of cybersecurity now, on Tuesday EURACTIV Germany's Alicia Prager\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/cybersecurity/news/germanys-cyber-defence-strategy-discussed-behind-closed-doors/\">drew our attention to the fact that\u00a0</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/cybersecurity/news/germanys-cyber-defence-strategy-discussed-behind-closed-doors/\">the country is preparing a new cyber defence strategy</url></emphasis>, after a leaked internal concept paper from the government foresees the use of so-called hack-backs and changes to the German Basic Law. But experts have criticised the exclusion of the general public from discussions about a new cyber defence strategy.</p><p>What cybersecurity discussion would be complete without a nod to Huawei? Well, US President Trump's lobbying in the UK seemed to fall on deaf ears this week, with the American leader saying that the two parties will\u00a0\"have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else,\" during a joint press conference in London.</p><p>No agreement has thus far been reached, but the UK's position on the firm - that it will allow Huawei to be involved in 'non-core' aspects of the country's 5G infrastructure, has been perceived\u00a0as a balanced approach by many in Europe.\u00a0 Potentially the next UK Prime Minister, Matt Hancock, told the Telegraph on Wednesday <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/06/04/huawei-must-beaten-british-technology-champion-matt-hancock/\">that Huawei must be beaten by a British champion, rather than being banned in the country.</url></emphasis></p><p>Further afield, on Friday, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Singapore Prime Minister\u00a0Lee Hsien Loong highlighted concerns with the US's blacklisting of Huawei</emphasis>, saying that \"the US and China need to work together, and with other countries too, to bring the global system up to date, and to not upend the system.\"</p><p>\"To succeed in this, each must understand the other's point of view, and reconcile each other's interests,\" he added.</p><p>Reconciling different\u00a0interests is also becoming a priority, it seems, in the context of the future of the EU's media sector, as freedom and plurality in the industry face growing\u00a0challenges\u00a0across some EU member states, notably Hungary and Bulgaria. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Last week,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/freedom-of-press-in-europe-no-longer-self-evident/\">EURACTIV Germany's

It is likely that the UK will eventually be rubber-stamped as adequate, meeting the minimum standards required for an agreement. However, the country will also look to pursue a more pro-innovation, liberalised personal data economy, as much as it can do within the framework of the adequacy agreement.</p><p>More broadly, as part of the GDPR review, the Commission reiterated the importance of EU data protection authorities being adequately resourced to deal with vast quantities of data protection complaints.</p><p>\"Given that the largest big tech multinationals are established in Ireland and Luxembourg, the data protection authorities of these countries act as lead authorities in many important cross- border cases and may need larger resources than their population would otherwise suggest,\" the document states.</p><p>However, between 2016 and 2019, Ireland saw the largest upturn of all EU member states, with a 169% increase in staff during this period, with Luxembourg on 126%.</p><p>After the publication of the review, EURACTIV heard from a number of stakeholders on the issue.</p><p>The European Data Protection Supervisor said that \"resources available for the national data protection authorities (DPAs) are sometimes insufficient and there are some discrepancies caused by the different legal frameworks and national procedural laws.\"</p><p>Eva Simon, senior advocacy officer at the Civil Liberties Union for Europe (Liberties), added: \"In the two years since the law's entry into force, enforcement has been the weak link. There are still far too many governments, organisations and businesses flouting the rules.\"</p><p>Tom De Cordier, a partner at Brussels-based global law firm CMS, said: \"As the impact of COVID-19 continues to be felt, governments struggling with public debt may look to reduce resources further, which will impact the enforcement landscape. I would therefore not be surprised if, in the short to medium term, the number of GDPR-investigations decreases and that turnaround times of the ongoing investigations increase.\"</p><p>Read more on a leaked identical copy of the GDPR Review EURACTIV obtained ahead of the presentation <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/leak-commission-pushes-uk-for-high-degree-of-convergence-in-gdpr-review/\">here</url>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cybersecurity</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU-China spat.</emphasis> EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/von-der-leyen-chinese-cyberattacks-on-eu-hospitals-cant-be-tolerated/\">has suggested that China</url></emphasis> may have been behind a spate of cyberattacks against hospitals in Europe during the coronavirus outbreak, stressing that the EU will not \"tolerate\" such malicious activity.</p><p>The accusations were levelled at the conclusion of a virtual EU-China summit on Monday (22 June), which brought together von der Leyen and Council President Charles Michel with Chinese counterparts, Premier Li Keqiang and President Xi Jinping.</p><p>\"We have seen cyber attacks on hospitals and dedicated computing centres,\" von der Leyen said, adding that she had \"pointed out\" to Premier Li and President Xi that such attacks along with China's disinformation campaign in Europe \"cannot be tolerated.\"</p><p>China quickly countered, with a statement sent from the Chinese mission to EURACTIV saying that the country itself feels victim to cybersecurity threats.</p><p>\"Even during the COVID-19 outbreak, cyber attacks targeted at China do not stop.\u00a0 China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity.

Breton, meanwhile, said that a Data Governance Act will be presented after the summer and that the 2021 Data Act will aim to accelerate access to industrial data in the EU.</p><p>One of the more contentious issues that arose during the event was how as part of the EU data strategy, non-personal data (which the EU wants to liberalise) and personal data (ring-fenced by high data protection laws) can be distinguished from one another. While Agustin Reyna of the European Consumer Organisation, BEUC, said that this was an impossible distinction to make, Facebook's Director of Social and Economic Policy, EU Affairs, Phillip Malloch, said the lines between personal and non-personal data should be straightforward to draw.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Platforms</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook data sharing Germany.</emphasis> With immediate effect, the Facebook company must stop merging and sharing user data from its Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram platforms in Germany, according to a ruling by the country's highest court. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/data-protection/news/germanys-highest-court-orders-facebook-to-stop-cross-platform-data-sharing/\">EURACTIV Germany reports</url>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Crypto</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Libra clampdown.</emphasis> The European Commission will present later this year new rules to develop a \"sound\" crypto-asset market in the EU, including for stablecoins such as Facebook's digital currency Libra, Financial Services Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday.

The oversight body, which also regulates campaign spending, has spent the past year examining how digital campaigning was used in the UK\u2019s 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election \u2014 as well as researching public opinion to get voters\u2019 views on digital campaigning issues. Among the changes the Commission wants to see is greater clarity around election spending to try to prevent foreign entities pouring money into domestic campaigns, and beefed up financial regulations including bigger penalties for breaking election spending rules. It also has an ongoing investigation into whether pro-Brexit campaigns \u2014 including the official Vote Leave campaign \u2014 broke spending rules. And last week the BBC reported on a leaked draft of the report suggesting the Commission will find the campaigns broke the law. </p><p>Last month the Leave.EU Brexit campaign was also fined 163;70,000 after a Commission investigation found it had breached multiple counts of electoral law during the referendum. Given the far larger sums now routinely being spent on elections \u2014 another pro-Brexit group, Vote Leave, had a 163;7M spending limit (though it has also been accused of exceeding that) \u2014 it\u2019s clear the Commission needs far larger teeth if it\u2019s to have any hope of enforcing the law. Digital tools have lowered the barrier of entry for election fiddling, while also helping to ramp up democratic participation. \u201cOn digital campaigning, our starting point is that elections depend on participation, which is why we welcome the positive value of online communications. New ways of reaching voters are good for everyone, and we must be careful not to undermine free speech in our search to protect voters. But we also fully recognise the worries of many, the atmosphere of mistrust which is being created, and the urgent need for action to tackle this,\u201d writes commission chair John Holmes. \u201cFunding of online campaigning is already covered by the laws on election spending and donations. But the laws need to ensure more clarity about who is spending what, and where and how, and bigger sanctions for those who break the rules. \u201cThis report is therefore a call to action for the UK\u2019s governments and parliaments to change the rules to make it easier for voters to know who is targeting them online, and to make unacceptable behaviour harder. The public opinion research we publish alongside this report demonstrates the level of concern and confusion amongst voters and the will for new action.\u201d The Commission\u2019s key recommendations are:  Each of the UK\u2019s governments and legislatures should change the law so that digital material must have an imprint saying who is behind the campaign and who created it  Each of the UK\u2019s governments and legislatures should amend the rules for reporting spending. They should make campaigners sub-divide their spending returns into different types of spending. These categories should give more information about the money spent on digital campaigns  Campaigners should be required to provide more detailed and meaningful invoices from their digital suppliers to improve transparency  Social media companies should work with us to improve their policies on campaign material and advertising for elections and referendums in the UK  UK election and referendum adverts on social media platforms should be labelled to make the source clear. Their online databases of political adverts should follow the UK\u2019s rules for elections and referendums  Each of the UK\u2019s governments and legislatures should clarify that spending on election or referendum campaigns by foreign organisations or individuals is not allowed. They would need to consider how it could be enforced and the impact on free speech  We will make proposals to campaigners and each of the UK\u2019s governments about how to improve the rules and deadlines for reporting spending. We want information to be available to voters and us more quickly after a campaign, or during  Each of the UK\u2019s governments and legislatures should increase the maximum fine we can sanction campaigners for breaking the rules, and strengthen our powers to obtain information outside of an investigation The recommendations follow revelations by Chris Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower (pictured at the top of this post) \u2014 who has detailed to journalists and regulators how Facebook users\u2019 personal data was obtained and passed to the now defunct political consultancy for political campaigning activity without people\u2019s knowledge or consent. In addition to the Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal, Facebook has also been rocked by earlier revelations of how extensively Kremlin-backed agents used its ad targeting tools to try to sew social division at scale \u2014 including targeting the 2016 US presidential election. The Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has since been called before US and EU lawmakers to answer questions about how his platform operates and the risks it\u2019s posing to democratic processes. The company has announced a series of changes intended to make it more difficult for third parties to obtain user data, and to increase transparency around political advertising \u2014 adding a requirement for such ads to continue details of how has paid for them, for example, and also offering a searchable archive. Although critics question whether the company is going far enough \u2014 asking, for example, how it intends to determine what is and is not a political advert. Facebook is not offering a searchable archive for all ads on its platform, for example. Zuckerberg has also been accused of equivocating in the face of lawmakers\u2019 concerns, with politicians on both sides of the Atlantic calling him out for providing evasive, misleading or intentionally obfuscating responses to concerns and questions around how his platform operates. The Electoral Commission makes a direct call for social media firms to do more to increase transparency around digital political advertising and remove messages which \u201cdo not meet the right standards\u201d. \u201cIf this turns out to be insufficient, the UK\u2019s governments and parliaments should be ready to consider direct regulation,\u201d it also warns. We\u2019ve reached out to Facebook comment and will update this post with any response. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman told us it would send the government response to the Electoral Commission report shortly \u2014 so we\u2019ll also update this post when we have that. Update: A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe government is committed to increasing transparency in digital campaigning, in order to maintain a fair and proportionate democratic process, and we will be consulting on proposals for new imprint requirements on electronic campaigning in due course.\u201d The UK\u2019s data protection watchdog, the ICO, has an ongoing investigating into the use of social media data for political campaigning \u2014 and commissioner Elizabeth Denham recently made a call for stronger disclosure rules around political ads and a code of conduct for social media firms. The body is expected to publish the results of its long-running investigation shortly. At the same time, a DCMS committee has been running an inquiry into the impact of fake news and disinformation online, including examining the impact on the political process. Though Zuckerberg has declined its requests for him to personally testify \u2014 sending a number of minions in his place, including CTO Mike Schroepfer who was grilled for around five hours by irate MPs and his answers still left them dissatisfied. The committee will set out the results of this inquiry in another report touching on the impact of big tech on democratic processes \u2014 likely in the coming months. Committee chair Damian Collins tweeted today to say the inquiry has \u201calso highlighted how out of date our election laws are in a world increasingly dominated by big tech media\u201d. On its forthcoming Brexit campaign spending report, an Electoral Commission spokesperson told us: \u201cIn accordance with its Enforcement Policy, the Electoral Commission has written to Vote Leave, Mr Darren Grimes and Veterans for Britain to advise each campaigner of the outcome of the investigation announced on 20 November 2017. The campaigners have 28 days to make representations before final decisions are taken.

In just five days, hundreds of contributors signed up for a piece of what they hope will be the next Silicon Valley unicorn. But there's a catch -- unlike traditional venture capital investments, the tokens don't confer a claim on Storj's equity or future profits.</p><p>Instead, the tokens' value derives from their utility in the firm's app, by providing access to data storage on a distributed network. They are the latest entry in the growing ledger of cryptocurrencies, digital coins that unlock myriad apps across the computing world. The coins are tradable on dozens of online exchanges and demand for all sorts of them has exploded as people speculate on the next big tech startup.</p><p>\"The average investor is missing out on the Ubers and AirBnbs of the world,\" said Bart Stephens, a managing partner at Blockchain Capital, a VC firm that's invested in blockchain-related startups since 2012. \"If the next Uber decides to issue tokens, that would be an opportunity for more investors to get access to the most exciting technologies out there.\"</p><p>The Storj sale is known as an initial coin offering, a model of finance spreading across the tech sector. Investors spent $332 million on tokens in the past year, more than double what VCs handed over in seed rounds, according to data compiled by coin-focused blog The Control. The haul is slated to hit $600 million in 2017, it says, adding to a market for tokens that's nearly tripled in the past year.</p><p>ICOs are possible thanks to blockchain, the catchall term for a digital ledger that promises incorruptible storage of financial transactions. Banks and stock exchanges have spent millions on it, looking for ways to cut the costs for transferring money or recording equity sales. One of the latest to back the technology was the chief executive officer of Fidelity Investments, Abigail Johnson. Most famously, it's the technology that underpins bitcoin -- just as it does for every token offered in an ICO.</p><p>Their massive increase in popularity has more than a few detractors warning of a bubble, worried that the allure of finding the next tech lottery ticket is fueling rampant speculation. The concern is particularly acute at a time when investors are fretting about stretched valuations for tech startups, with the likes of Uber commanding multibillion-dollar price tags even as they burn through cash.</p><p>Take Gnosis, a prediction market application based on the Ethereum blockchain that raised $12.5 million in 12 minutes on April 24, resulting in a market cap of almost $300 million. It's generated no revenue and has little more than a white paper describing what it intends to do. Yet its tokens, which would allow users to bet on things such as election outcomes, soared eightfold in the three weeks since May 2, giving it a valuation of over $2 billion -- more than the average Russell 2000 Index stock.</p><p>Gnosis's runup is just part of the craze that's gripped the cryptocurrency market in the last month, with the price of a bitcoin surging over 30 percent in the past week alone to more than $2,500. That's pushed the market capitalization of digital currencies over 50 percent higher to more than $90 billion.</p><p>Even after that surge, the market is still relatively small, though it's taking steps toward maturity as the ICO boom spreads. There are platforms to track historical prices and volume, and reports on individual issuances to help prospective buyers assess a firm's prospects.</p><p>The offerings happen outside the purview of regulators -- quite by design -- as technically, the coins are part of the app and not securities. ICOs don't have disclosure requirements, and the issuer can accept an unlimited number of U.S. investors, instead of the 99 vetted investors limited to traditional VC funding rounds.</p><p>The space has also been a breeding ground for scams, and some coins have turned out to be vulnerable to attacks. Hackers were able to steal $50 million from a fund called Decentralized Autonomous Organization after it raised $150 million in the biggest issuance ever in April 2016.</p><p>For entrepreneurs, the appeal is obvious. A white paper published online replaces weeks of pitches to VC firms, followed by an online auction that can take minutes. The technology can be poked and prodded by geeks around the world, providing a depth of expertise often missing at even the best Silicon Valley firms.</p><p>\"You don't have to limit yourself,\" said Jae Kwon, who raised $16.8 million in a coin sale for Cosmos, which aims to provide custodian-like service for transactions across different blockchains. \"There are just not that many VCs and they're not experts. People who contributed to our fundraiser are the experts.\"</p><p>--With assistance from Lily Katz</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IFMNGT-0000015c-3fef-dedf-a15e-7fef440a0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IFMNGT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NMR-27H1-JCRW-54KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436967</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"837\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 SourceMedia, Inc.

Developing the latest app is a lot cleaner than natural resource extraction - aka mining and drilling.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Or is it? Or is our technology-based economy just extracting natural resources in different ways?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For many years, the dirty little secret of the digital world has been that it takes a massive amount of energy to run our digital world.</p><p>Silicon Valley likes to project a clean and green image, but the server farms that keep our digital world running consume vast amounts of electricity to process and store information of dubious value. What's the energy cost of millions of people looking at a cute cat video?</p><p>The electricity needed to operate servers is just the first step. The servers also generate heat and more electricity is needed to air condition the server farms.\u00a0</p><p>Silicon Valley has managed to hide its energy dependence for a long time, but blockchain and coin mining operations are blowing Silicon Valley's cover.</p><p>Blockchain and coins and tokens utilize a worldwide network of computers organized into \"nodes.\" In an ordinary data network, data is stored on one server, but that opens the network to hacking. Blockchain networks protect data integrity by storing and processing the same data on thousands of computer nodes. Someone would have to hack thousands of nodes to change the data.</p><p>That solves Silicon Valley's vulnerability to hacking, but the massive duplication is an electricity hog.\u00a0</p><p>Of course, what is stored on the blocks of a blockchain isn't necessarily raw data. The blocks usually contain hashes that represent the data. Hashes can turn very large amounts of data into much shorter strings of data. The common 256-character hash may represent millions bits of information.</p><p>The purpose of a hash isn't to give you instant access to all the information. The purpose is to allow you to verify the information by comparing hashes. If all 256 characters of two hashes match perfectly, you know they represent exactly the same data.</p><p>The two biggest expenses of the people who operate the blockchain nodes are buying the computer hardware and paying the electric bills to operate them.</p><p>This has substantially increased the demand for certain types of computers and for cheap electricity. Generally, electricity generated by dams is the cheapest source of electricity. This has set off a gold rush of miners who are building large coin mining operations close to hydroelectric power sources. That makes the Pacific Northwest America's coin mining capital.</p><p>Of course, increased demand for electric power competes with other industries and homes that also use electricity and the water that generates electric power. Droughts decrease electricity supply.</p><p>In some places, local towns have banned additional coin mining operations. There are running battles between locals, power companies and miners. Allegedly, miners have been making threats to power companies.</p><p>This reminds us of the range wars in old western movies where farmers, cattlemen and sheepherders battled over access to water and grasslands.</p><p>Will we have similar range wars between coin miners and everyone else?\u00a0</p><p>Will greens begin protesting big tech the way they oppose big oil and big coal?</p><p>Stranger things have happened.

These same protections, however, do not exist uniformly in the resource-rich, infrastructure-poor African countries, where Western tech seeks to establish its presence. These conditions provide an ideal landscape for digital colonialism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital colonialism refers to a modern-day \"Scramble for Africa\" where largescale tech companies extract, analyze, and own user data for profit and market influence with nominal benefit to the data source. Under the guise of altruism, large scale tech companies can use their power and resources to access untapped data on the continent. Scant data protection laws and infrastructure ownership by western tech companies open the door for exploitation of data as a resource for profit and a myriad of uses including predictive analytics.</p><p>One may believe that strengthening data protection laws will be a barrier to digital colonialism. However, regardless of their relative strength or weakness, data protection laws have limits. An analysis of Kenya's 2018 data protection bill, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and documented actions of largescale tech companies exemplifies how those limits create several loopholes for continued digital colonialism including, historical violations of data privacy laws; limitations of sanctions; unchecked mass concentration of data, lack of competition enforcement, uninformed consent, and limits to defined nation-state privacy laws.</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>To discuss the extraction, synthesis, and control of user data is to discuss the pulse of commerce, the ever-looming power of large tech companies, and the shift of human emotional interaction to everything in our daily lives. However, to discuss the extraction, synthesis, and control over user data and critical connectivity infrastructure by Western tech companies in African countries with limited infrastructure, limited data protection laws, and limited competition-combined with social, political and economic power imbalances and decades of resource pillaging-is to discuss digital colonialism.</p><p>This Note argues that digital colonialism is part of the modern day \"Scramble for Africa\" that takes place through the extraction and control of user data by large scale tech companies. Part I will establish the background of colonization and the role of corporations so as to enable the comparison between nineteenth century colonialism and twenty-first century colonialism. Part II will explain the definition of digital colonialism, why data is a rich resource comparable to natural resources, and how large tech companies exploit this resource for profit and for use in predictive analytics. Part III will explain the limits to the purported solution to digital colonialism-data protection laws-using examples from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Kenya's 2018 Data Protection Bill.</p><p>I. COLONIZATION AND THE ROLE OF CORPORATIONS</p><p>In the nineteenth century, many African countries faced imperialist aggression through military invasions, land conquests, economic exploitation, genocide, and violent resource extraction at the behest of European world powers. This colonialist rise began after the end of the Transatlantic slave trade and was formalized at the Berlin Colonial Conference, where soon to be colonial powers gathered to develop a plan that would upset and disrupt the social, economic, and political landscape of Africa forever.1 Between 1884 and 1885, under the guise of White supremacy, deeply ingrained anti-Black sentiment, and unchecked power, European powers carved up the continent in what has become known as the \"Scramble for Africa\"-the creation of arbitrary lines equating to colonies, and the forced subjugation of African peoples.2 At the end of the conference, the powers present signed the General Act of the Conference of Berlin, giving purported legal effect to their new territories under the baseless premise that African nations had no sovereignty and no legal claim over their state, land, or resources.3 This, coupled with the beliefs inherent within the White imagination that African peoples were \"evolutionar[il]y backward and undeveloped\" and that \"[i]t was a European responsibility to act as trustees of Africa until Africans were mature enough to govern themselves,\"4 set the ideological tone for ruthless colonization.</p><p>European powers' proliferation of claims in Africa were characteristically expeditious such that, by 1900, European states including Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Italy, and Spain had claimed nearly 90 percent of African territory.5 Due to the rise of industrial capitalism, there was a staunch belief that the economic, and thus political, future of an industrial country hinged on exclusive control of its markets and raw materials.6 Therefore, colonial powers stole from the lands of Africa, violently extracting raw materials such as copper, cotton, rubber, tea, gold, diamonds, and tin.7</p><p>At the center of this pillaging was a simple colonialist economic agenda, to provide maximum economic benefit at a minimal price.8 Accordingly, investing in industrialization, improving the production processes, or strengthening the overall economy of the colonies was not a priority.9 Oftentimes, the colonial powers refused to process the raw materials in-country, sending the raw materials to Europe to be processed, obliterating the role of Africans in the export business and robbing them of any economic profit and potential resource flow that could have derived from processing raw materials in country.10 Although some colonial powers did invest in transportation infrastructure such as railways, such investments were strictly for the benefit of facilitating the efficient transport of raw materials and not for the enrichment of the countries themselves.11 Simply put, \"the infrastructure that was developed was designed to exploit the natural resources of the colonies.\"12</p><p>Corporations, aiding in this colonialist economic agenda, also played a dominant role in colonial expansion. As early as the seventeenth century, dozens of companies were granted trading monopolies by their respective governments throughout the world.13 Their monopoly over trade in specified territories allowed these corporations the power to safeguard this monopoly and the power to exert rights over their countrymen who lived and worked within the territory.14 The granting of monopoly status by colonialist governments made these highly risky ventures safer for investors with profit as the primary motive.15 Investing in trading companies emerged as one of the earliest forms of venture capital as, \"money could be raised in return for shares, profits could be divided among shareholders, and shares could be transferred among members and outsiders.\"16</p><p>After a brief hiatus, the nineteenth century saw the resurgence of trading companies as weapons wielded for colonial expansion and as additional revenue streams for the emerging economic system of industrial capitalism.17 By then, the experience of companies from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries such as the British East India Company had helped establish the corporate form as a dominant force for settlement and colonization.18 This second wave of colonization by trading companies proved to be robust, as \"more than 75 percent of British acquisitions south of the Sahara were acquired by chartered companies\"-not by equitable trading practices, but by monopolized consent, violence, and a virtual absence of competition in extracting raw materials and resources.19</p><p>The four major trading companies of the nineteenth century consisted of the British South African Company, the Germany East African Company, the Imperial British East African Company, and the Royal Niger Company.20 Over the span of decades, trading companies expanded indirect colonial rule through possessing new \"protectorates or spheres of influence\",21 exploited local faction rivalries, arming them in exchange for better trading deals, and established para military forces to facilitate trading goals and increase profit,23 laying the foundation for the eventual mass exploitation of mineral resources and agricultural opportunities across Africa including Niger, Nigeria, South Africa, Central Africa, and East Africa.24 The control of territories by companies established for the \"explicit purpose of making money, meant, inevitably, that the territories were administered simply for profit,\" and that the companies took no in- terest in developing local industrialization outside of its benefits for administering the movement of natural resources and raw materials.25</p><p>Although these companies were principally chartered to facilitate \"trade,\" they were also legal extensions of the crown, a fact that afforded them the right to assert sovereign powers over the non-European peoples within the colony-a power they frequently exerted.26 Trading companies gradually became more intrusive in the governance of the colonies to further their economic interests and those of the colonial powers.27 As the intrusion grew, more demands were made on non-European states, through threat of military action, to concede to the interests of the trading companies.28 Eventually, chartered companies, as extensions of the crown, were an authoritative force in territories, playing an imperative role in territorial annexations and profiting from raw materials and valuable minerals-their primary reason for existing.29</p><p>Steeped in desperation to serve the industrial capitalist structure built upon the backs of African people and lands-the foundation for neo-mercantilism-colonial powers violently took over nations and exploited resource-rich African lands for their own economic benefit and global economic prowess, both directly and via chartered companies.</p><p>II. DIGITAL COLONIALISM</p><p>A. Defining Digital Colonialism</p><p>Earlier colonialists arrived on African shores to expand their empires by exploiting local labor to extract valuable natural resources and raw materials, building critical infrastructure like railroads in the process to facilitate the import and export of these often dispossessed goods.30 Today's colonialists, however, are digital. They build communication infrastructures such as social media platforms and network connectivity for the express purpose of harvesting data, churning a profit, and/or storing the data as raw material for predictive analytics.31</p><p>\"Digital colonialism\" is the decentralized extraction and control of data from citizens with or without their explicit consent \"through com- munication networks developed and owned by Western tech companies.\"32 As professors Hendricks, Marker, and Vestergaard from the University of Copenhagen posit, this structure has four fundamental actors:</p><p>(1) The Western tech companies who create and provide the technology and infrastructure that harvest the data for ad targeting and ad distribution;33</p><p>(2) The advertising and consulting firms who use the technology provided by (1) to target various groups with highly personalized ads and messages aimed at increasing profits;34</p><p>(3) The \"local companies, parties, and organizations who pay (2) to help them impose their different agendas for the respective countries\";35 and</p><p>(4) The citizens who knowingly and unknowingly act as data sources for (1) and as target groups for (2) and (3).36</p><p>Scholar Michael Kwet further explains:</p><p>Under digital colonialism, foreign powers, led by the United States, are planting infrastructure in the Global South engineered for its own needs, enabling economic and culture domination while imposing privatized forms of governance. To accomplish this task, major corporations design digital technology to ensure their own dominance over critical functions in the tech ecosystem. This allows them to accumulate profits from revenues derived from rent (in the form of intellectual property or access to infrastructure) and surveillance (in the form of Big Data). It also empowers them to exercise control over the flow of information (such as the distribution of news and streaming services), social activities (like social networking and cultural exchange) and a plethora of other politi- cal, social and economic and military functions mediated by their technologies.37</p><p>Laying critical connectivity infrastructure owned by Western tech companies, to extract and control untapped user data, however, is the vanguard for this cultural and economic dominance. The extraction, analysis, and control of data in African countries with limited infrastructure, limited data protection laws, and limited competition, combined with social, political, and economic power imbalances and decades of resource pillaging is what gives the above consequences true power.</p><p>B. Data as a Resource</p><p>According to the Oxford New English Dictionary, currency is defined as a system of assets, property, and resources owned by someone or something in general use in a particular country.38 Data is the new currency, and access to data-rather than money, natural resources, or advanced weaponry-is now the most valuable asset available to nationstates and corporations.39 This development lays the foundation for large Western tech companies' movement into African markets.</p><p>Data is collected by corporations of all sizes through online behavioral tracking technology which \"refers to the practice of tracking web users (and mobile apps users) on the Internet. . . .\"40 This technology records a large variety of data including, but not limited to, ad clicks, device specific information, face scan, ISP, ad name, phone numbers, search queries, time, date, browser history, email addresses, IP addresses, location, operating system, and profile information.41 The method of tracking this data includes, but is not limited to, cookies, doubleclick and Adsense, profile information, device tracking technology, facial recognition software, and search queries.42 Collectively, this data creates an \"anonymous\" digital profile of millions of users that is ultimately used to integrate multiple accounts to produce personalized content for location services and notification, and, most importantly, to be sold to data brokers, used as a means for selling access to users for targeted advertising by third party corporations, or collected and stored for future predictive analytic use.43 With over 1.25 billion people living in Africa,44 this market represents a treasure trove of data, much of which is as yet untapped by Western tech companies.45</p><p>Due to this robust and efficient online behavioral tracking technology, consumerism has now shifted from a story of mass consumption to a \"story of one.\"46 Because of the rapid development of portable technological devices like iPhones, smart watches and tablets, coupled with the constant and ever-increasing use of social media across generations,47 the potential for consumer engagement can now operate twenty-four hours a day, making the transition from mass advertising to targeted advertising a lucrative pursuit. Now, advertisers no longer must make assumptions about consumers' behavior48 and can instead target consumers with extreme precision based on hyper-personalized data.49</p><p>This helps corporations attract new business and \"maximize engagement among target audiences,\" resulting in a higher return on investment,50 and creating a more efficient and cost-effective process for promotion, price point decision making, and distribution of products and/or services.51 Within the modern capitalist society, this is the most valuable information any company can possess.</p><p>However, the value of this data is based on the ability to \"make sense of the avalanche of data,\"52 and companies like Alphabet and Facebook have a leading edge due to their size, access to data, resources, and data science infrastructure.53 For less robust companies and marketers, harnessing data effectively can be challenging,54 as \"the abundance of data produced by disparate sources has made the task of identifying and unifying relevant insight seem colossal.\"55 The inherent technical challenges in turning large stores of data into valuable currency means that behemoths like Alphabet and Facebook are well-positioned to dominate new large markets with their highly-equipped platforms and resources by synthesizing the data into usable information, effectively controlling the market.</p><p>Artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning and natural language processing, gives companies the capability to better synthesize billions of data points and make inferences about users.56 This data can be used to infer personal information such as a person's background, religion and beliefs, political views, sexual orientation and gender identity, social connections, health, ethnicity, income levels, educational attainment, marital status, family composition, financial stability, and creditworthiness, all without the user directly giving this information.57 \"The result is the creation and amalgamation of digital footprints that provide in-depth knowledge about [one's] life.\"58 This data is eventually synthesized, used, and sold for immense profit.59</p><p>What is more alarming is that a handful of tech companies, like Alphabet and Facebook, are able to use artificial intelligence for predictive analytics, which is \"the use of data, statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data.\"60 The goal is to go beyond knowing what is happening and what has happened to provide a best assessment of how users will behave in the future.61 Although predictive analytics can have positive effects in many sectors, such as the healthcare industry, they can also distort the lines of privacy when dealing with individualized human behavior, particularly when only a handful of companies have this information.</p><p>These possible intrusions into basic concepts of privacy can be seen in Facebook's uncanny ability to predict when a person is motivated to do something,62 when a person is feeling a range of emotions, such as feeling down,63 and when a couple's relationship will end64-all before the users even know it themselves. Predictive analytics allows a handful of companies to understand even the innermost emotions, and to predict how this will affect future behavior. This information is extremely useful to millions of corporations across the globe. It can affect the global economy, workforce development, small and large scale investments, resource allocation, advertising, presidential elections, and every single segment of global capitalism.</p><p>Furthermore, since machines are not humans and cannot \"think,\" artificial intelligence needs gargantuan sets of data to \"learn\" from and derive its predictive accuracy-to which only a handful of corporations have access. Facebook itself has access to over two billion people's sensitive information, including what they \"like\" and \"dislike,\" who their friends are, to whom they talk the most, and where they physically travel65-a level of intimate personal data that no other company in the world has. Google dominates search engines with the ability to collect data on over 1.17 billion global users.66 Companies like Facebook and Google then use these highly personal inferences and sensitive data as a means of selling access to individuals to third-party corporations67- making 40 billion dollars in 2017 alone.68 Additionally, when only a select few companies have access to the largest sets of valuable data, they have a supreme advantage over competitors, ultimately controlling that market and deciding who gets access, both presently and in the future, while making the most profit.69</p><p>For tech companies, the treasure trove of citizens' data that lies in Africa is a natural resource. The data may be extracted and sold as a commodity to corporations and political interests who base their revenue model on knowing their target groups so that they are able to push political messages and agendas or sell targeted products to citizens, thereby increasing their bottom-line.70 The essence of this business model is already established in the West. Tech companies \"provide seemingly free communication services and search engines\" and track users across platforms, apps and the internet, all to enable advertisers to target consumers and voters with hyper-personalized ads based on behavioral patterns, making an enormous profit. However, when this business strategy is pursued in countries with limited infrastructure, limited data protection laws, and limited competition-while rooted in neoliberal notions of human rights-it transitions from a business model into a form of digital colonialism.</p><p>Facebook's Free Basics and Project Aires, and Google's Project Csquared and Project Loon, are just a few projects deployed by Western tech companies in Africa as they expand their global reach for profit.71 Much like the colonialists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, who built critical infrastructure like railroads for the sole purpose of continuing to economically exploit the natural resources of Africa, giant tech companies like Facebook and Alphabet are building network connectivity infrastructure for the benefit of profiting from the use of their online services, rather than building local infrastructure for sustained economic development in African countries.</p><p>In 2017, Google and its partners committed $100 million to Csquared, a broadband project in Africa aimed at providing high-speed, affordable, and reliable connectivity infrastructure to further grow internet access in Africa.72 This is a laudable goal; however, by \"doubling down on its efforts to support the underlying internet infrastructure, which, in turn, opens up new markets for the internet giant's own online services,\" it increases their access to data.73 In 2012, the idea for Project Loon was born in order to get billions of people online where cell towers do not exist via helium balloons.74 This type of technological advancement could be revolutionary for rural communities and other places in which millions of people are in desperate need for internet access yet physical hardware connectivity is not always possible, particularly after natural disasters. However, as scholar Tom Simonite in the MIT Technology Review notes:</p><p>It is odd for a large public company to build out infrastructure aimed at helping the world's poorest people. But in addition to Google's professed desires to help the world, the economics of ad-supported Web businesses give the company other reasons to think big. It's hard to find new customers in Internet markets such as the United States. Getting billions more people online would provide a valuable new supply of eyeballs and personal data for ad targeting.75</p><p>Although software is not technically infrastructure, it is also central to the overall development of technological connectivity being used to harvest data for economic profit. Free Basics, Facebook's mobile application, gives users in developing nations access to limited online services and content for free. \"Fundamentally, Free Basics is a data-lite mobile application that allows users to browse a narrowed down version of the internet\"76 as an \"on ramp\" to introduce internet to those who otherwise would not have access.77 By using neoliberal code words like \"democra- cy,\" \"equality,\" and \"internet as a basic human right,\" Facebook masks its true long-term goal of collecting data on \"the next billion.\"78 Free Basics harvests an enormous amount of metadata on users.79 When a user clicks on a website in Free Basics, \"that click sends packets of data to Facebook's servers.\"80 Furthermore, \"[s\u013cince all of the data exchanged on Free Basics goes through Facebook's Proxy servers, Facebook now has a way to access users [sic] data outside of Facebook.\"81 Research by Citizen Media and activist group Global Voices found that the Free Basics program has enabled Facebook to gather data about the habits, interests, and behaviors of users in the developing world, where Facebook aspires to have a strong presence as more users come online.82 In sum, \"Free Basics is a closed space where Facebook picks the content-and profits from users' data along the way-creating what some people call a 'poor internet for poor people.' \"83</p><p>Only 31 percent of people on the continent of Africa have access to the internet,84 making it clear that Africa faces connectivity, access, and infrastructure issues. However, it is by no means certain that this is a problem for foreign tech companies.85 Due to this lack of infrastructure and connectivity, giant tech companies are acting as the \"White savior,\" much like colonial powers who disguised the Scramble for Africa as liberalization intended to help the \"noble savage.\" These companies claim that they want to bridge the digital divide and give internet access to the millions of people who otherwise would not have it, but their true purpose is simply to extract data for profit and predictive analytics.</p><p>Furthermore, by capitalizing on \" 'first mover' advantage\" with an army of lawyers and operating on such a massive scale, giant tech companies face extremely limited competition, both locally and internationally, and can outcompete or simply buy up competitors around the world.86 Much like chartered companies in the nineteenth century, who used limited trade competition to create monopolistic economic control within the colonies, these giant tech companies can control how the connectivity infrastructure is built, what apps and services users have access to, and what happens to the data due to the lack of competition. With Free Basics spanning sixty countries, reaching hundreds of millions of mobile phone users in Africa alone,87 Facebook has the most data points about new users from emerging markets, and the best resources to synthesize this data into usable information-more than the majority of other companies in the market and most governments.88 This makes Facebook the centerpiece of control for extremely valuable data sets, at no benefit to the users or the countries themselves.</p><p>III.LIMITATIONS OF DATA PROTECTION LAWS</p><p>Some scholars believe that the digital colonialism as described in Part II, is enhanced by scant data protection laws in Africa that leave users exposed.89 However, the limits to data protection laws, which occur regardless of the relative strength or weakness of the laws, are overwhelming and fail to provide a panacea to digital colonialism. This Part describes these limitations and how they operate.</p><p>A. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Kenya's Data Protection Laws</p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force on May 25, 2018, is now the world's strongest data protection law.90 It applies to European companies broadly, as well as any company across the globe that collects data on its citizens. Designed to modernize laws that protect sensitive and personal information of users,91 this law \"reshape[s\u013c how technology companies store, process, and profit from users' personal information.\"92 It also gives the user the \"right to be forgotten,\" as well as the right to withdraw their data from collection.93</p><p>GDPR has elevated the standard for data protection laws globally, and yet in Africa, there is no continent-wide consensus of an approach to personal data protection, as some countries have little to no data protection laws or constitutional protections, while others have robust data protection laws.94 Based on 2017 data, there are seventeen countries in Africa that have enacted comprehensive personal data protection legislation. Three more countries, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe, have enacted personal data protection legislation that is currently moving through the lawmaking process. In addition, the African Union (AU) adopted the AU Convention on Cybersecurity and Data Protection (AU Convention) in June 2014,95 which provides \"a personal data protection framework which African countries may potentially transpose into their national legislation.\"96 However, the AU Convention has only been ratified by four of the fifty-four AU member jurisdictions and needs to be ratified by fifteen member _jurisdictions in order to take effect.97 Nevertheless, there are common themes and principles between the GDPR and comprehensive data protection legislation adopted by some African countries.98 These themes comprise</p><p>* notice;</p><p>* choice and consent;</p><p>* data security;</p><p>* data access and correction;</p><p>* data quality and integrity;</p><p>* data retention and destruction;</p><p>* registration with a data protection authority (DPA);</p><p>* cross-border data transfers;</p><p>* personal data breach notification; and</p><p>* appointment of a data protection officer (DPO).99</p><p>Many of these themes are incorporated in Kenya's 2018 Data Protection Bill (DPB), which is said to mirror the GDPR.100 Once passed, it will give Kenyan citizens a series of rights including: 1) the right to ask companies to clearly explain, using accessible language, how their personal data is being collected, used, and stored; 2) the right to request that their personal data be deleted; and 3) the right to object to their personal data being used for specific purposes like targeted advertising.101 This will also require companies to gain consent from users before collecting their data.102 The DPB is all-encompassing, applying to \"all data subjects, regardless if they reside in Kenya, whose data is, or has been, collected or processed by a data controller in Kenya.\"103 However, this bill has received much scrutiny,104 and many provisions, much like some in the GDPR, reflect the limits of data protection laws against digital colonialism.</p><p>Once enacted, the Bill will give effect to Article 31(c) and Article 31(d) of the 2010 Constitution of Kenya, which guarantees every person the right not to have \"information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed,\" and the right not to have \"the privacy of their communications infringed.\"105 This will directly tie this law to the Constitution of Kenya, the supreme law of the land, which is binding on all persons.</p><p>B. Violation of Data Privacy Laws</p><p>Unfortunately, big tech companies can violate (and have blatantly violated) these laws, since they have the time, money, and resources to fight for their desired outcomes, even if they stand in direct violation of pre-established laws. For example, Uber has flaunted its willingness to operate in clear violation of local laws, launching in cities where its operation violates city ordinances.106 \"The company's non-compliance with city ordinances ranges from Uber drivers not having the required driving permits to refusing a request by California state regulators to provide information about their drivers.\"107 Uber's violation of the law extends globally-a French Court in 2016 convicted Uber of violating French transport and privacy laws.</p><p>Additionally, Google Books made a clear and public move to violate copyright law.109 The goal of Google Books was to scan millions of books into digital format to add to their search engine, despite the project's clear violation of age-old copyright laws.110 At this legal battle's inception, approximately 24 million titles were under copyright protection. The potential cost for Google infringing on each work totaled 3.6 trillion, and yet Google forged ahead.111 After a nearly decade-long legal battle, Google prevailed, and the courts upheld their fair-use claims.112</p><p>These examples from the Global North indicate that the presence of a comprehensive data protection legislation does not mean that large tech companies will actually comply if the benefit of violation exceeds the burden of consequence. This also proves the limits to penalties, fines, and sanctions against large tech companies-digital colonialism's most prominent purveyors.</p><p>C.Limitations of Penalties, Fines, and Sanctions</p><p>GDPR fines for offenses are the greater sum of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of a firm's global turnover.113 However, if Google was willing to risk paying 3.6 trillion for a clear violation of law, arguably it would be willing to risk paying the GDPR penalty. That is, if the violation is worth it for the company, or if they have the resources to defend the alleged violation in court, the company may go ahead with its ac- tions, even if it knows they are likely to be in violation. Kenya's DBP on the on the other hand, is silent on penalties or fines against corporations found to be in violation of the data protection law, leaving it up to the complaints commission to decide the course of action.114Although this is a better proposition considering that the complaint commission may be able to exercise more effective sanctions that would serve as greater deterrents for large tech companies than monetary fines, there is still a loophole. Large tech companies and data brokers could simply dissolve before they ever have to face any accountability measures. This is the current predicament of Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica, a data firm, harvested the personal data of approximately 50 million Americans and at least one million Brits through Facebook. This data was ultimately used to influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election of Donald Trump, as demonstrated by Cambridge Analytica's CEO, who was caught via secret recording claiming direct credit for the election of Donald Trump.116 Additionally, senior executives were \"filmed describing its dominant role in Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's election campaigns in 2013 and 2017 and were caught boasting about psychological manipulation, entrapment techniques and fake news campaigns.\"117 The Information Commissioner's Office, a UK independent authority, is prosecuting SCL Elections, Cambridge Analytica's parent company, for failing to comply with an enforcement notice.118 However, SCL Elections filed bankruptcy in May and will be completely dissolved by the January 2019 trial date.119 The ICO is examining whether the SCL Elections directors can still be pursued; however, it seems that this major data firm will escape unscathed despite their clear violation of pre-GDPR protection laws.120 All of this sets the foundation for the potential abuse of power by large tech companies who can blatantly violate laws and skirt fines, penalties and sanctions, leaving the local citizens whom they exploit for data extraction powerless, despite clear data protection laws.</p><p>D.Mass Concentration of Data and Lack of Competition Enforcement</p><p>Another clear limit to data privacy laws is that the lack of protection against the mass concentration of data by dominant players is compounded by the lack of competition enforcement measures. Competition, data protection, and consumer protection law are inextricably related, and data privacy legislation often does not take this into account-Kenya's DPB included. Without these protections, enormous amounts of data will be centrally held and owned by dominant players who have the resources to stomp out their competition, leaving the fate of millions and sometimes billions of people's personal and sensitive data in the hands of a select few.</p><p>This was particularly visible in the merger decision for Facebook and WhatsApp. Facebook already had a lion's share of the data market, with access to over 2 billion users' data. The \"main reason for Facebook's interest in WhatsApp is believed to lie in the troves of data that came with the acquisition\"121-namely, 500 million users. This was also a strategic acquisition to help Facebook fuel growth in developing markets, opening up data extraction opportunities for over 172 million WhatsApp users in Africa.122 The lack of protection against mass concentration of data and the lack of regulation of anti-competitive conduct by companies fuels the concentration of mass data, as there are no regulations within data privacy law that apply when a company has either 1) simply amassed too much data at the risk of users or 2) has amassed too much data at the risk of users through means of acquisitions, decreasing market competition.</p><p>Additionally, this hole creates a high barrier of entry for small, medium, and local tech companies who simply cannot compete with global tech companies. The cost for running centralized social networks is extremely expensive. A company must pay for costly cloud infrastructure, find and pay skilled programmers, and be able to pay for quality data col- lection and storage in a way that adheres to data privacy law standards.123 A company must also think of a way to monetize their service in order to cover these costs.124 Moreover, \"competitors include multi-billion dollar corporations, who already dominate the market, enjoy the benefit of network effects, have accumulated brand equity and trade secrets, and have the power to acquire smaller companies.\"125 This leads to an overwhelming dynamic where \"the largest sets of valuable data-such as social data\" (Facebook, WhatsApp), and search (Google)-are concentrated and thereby controlled by a handful of \"winners,\" with no regulations within data privacy to promote and maintain market competition.126</p><p>E.Consent</p><p>Lastly, this inextricably affects the notion of consent, as \"it is often argued that strong competition enforcement could render data protection rules more effective by facilitating genuine consumer choice.\"127 Regardless of the requirements laid out by Kenya's data protection privacy bill, when one combines a lack of genuine consumer choice (due to the extreme lack of market competition) with a strong desire and or need for the service, can true consent be granted for data extraction?</p><p>Many believe that user consent to the authorization of data extraction and user consent to sell data to third parties shifts the power dynamic to equality between large tech companies and data subjects; however, this is simply untrue. When the users' desire for the service exceeds the threat of data misuse, consent will be freely given. The World Wide Web Foundation conducted a study in three countries, Kenya, Indonesia, and Philippines, on \"Teenagers Use of Social Media and their Understanding of Privacy Issues in Developing Countries.\"128 Teenagers are the highest users of social media and thus at the highest risk for data misuse.129 The results of this study concluded that \"[m]ost surveyed teenagers are aware that social media companies collect their personal data, but are not knowledgeable or do not care about how these platforms use these [data].\"130 So, the largest users of social media in three major countries, including Kenya, are aware of data collection but do not register or care about data misuse. Thus, their consent for data extraction is given carelessly leaving the tech companies still in control of blind users.</p><p>Additionally, the requirement of consent has not shifted the power to users, as users are often uneducated on data sharing and misuse. Even when they are aware, users oftentimes cannot understand the policies and thus blindly consent.</p><p>A Deloitte survey of 2,000 consumers in the U.S found that 91 [percent] of people consent to legal terms and services conditions without reading them. For younger people, ages 18-34 the rate is even higher with 97 [percent] agreeing to conditions before reading. The language is too complex and long-winded for most.131</p><p>In Africa, \"(p)rivacy advocacy groups say users of the Free Basics Service, who may be getting online for the first time, may have little or no understanding of what information is even being collected from them.\"132 Furthermore, the World Wide Web Foundation study found that \"[w]hile the teenagers were typically relaxed about sharing their personal information, they seemed to be unaware that, by using social media, they also share data they do not input directly, such as location data and browsing history.\"133 When users do not understand what they are consenting to, the concept of consent is null and void. The companies have no one to keep them accountable, and they remain in control by taking advantage of the ignorance of their large user base.</p><p>Even valid consent does not prevent data misuse. Large tech companies will still own personal and sensitive data after consent is given, and they can still sell this data to third parties without any accountability measures. Much like when Cambridge Analytica acquired millions of data and used it to manipulate presidential elections, \"the company pointed out, this wasn't a leak or data breach of any kind-it's simply how Facebook works.\"134 \" 'Everyone involved gave their consent,' according to the company's response on the matter.\"135</p><p>F. Limits to Defined Nation-State Privacy Laws</p><p>The limits presented above are based on the current state of technology. However, as technology continues to develop rapidly, and large tech companies invest in a variety of beta testing experiments, the limits of the current data protection laws will only become more prominent. Privacy laws are typically designed to \"only be enforceable within defined nation-state borders.\"136 However, some speculate that large tech companies are seeking to exist outside of national borders entirely.137 For example, in 2013, mystery Google barges were seen on the Western and Eastern coasts of the United States. They appeared to be floating data centers,138 perhaps an early attempt at sea-steading.139 Sea-steading \"is the attempt to create non-governmental entities outside of recognized borders and gain freedom from legal control.\"140 If large tech companies could create sea-steads, they could operate in international waters, completely unregulated, while owning the data of billions of users, dodging data privacy laws all together.141</p><p>conclusion</p><p>Digital colonialism is just as oppressive as the early colonialism from the nineteenth century. Large tech companies, typically owned and primarily operated by White men, are extracting data from uninformed users and controlling that data to profit via predictive analytics. Unfortunately, strong data protection laws will not prevent this domination. While modern data protection laws may constitute a step in the right direction, further reflection is required to answer the question of how society can protect user data in an increasingly digitally-dependent society.</p><p>1.

These same protections, however, do not exist uniformly in the resource-rich, infrastructure-poor African countries, where Western tech seeks to establish its presence. These conditions provide an ideal landscape for digital colonialism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital colonialism refers to a modern-day \"Scramble for Africa\" where largescale tech companies extract, analyze, and own user data for profit and market influence with nominal benefit to the data source. Under the guise of altruism, large scale tech companies can use their power and resources to access untapped data on the continent. Scant data protection laws and infrastructure ownership by western tech companies open the door for exploitation of data as a resource for profit and a myriad of uses including predictive analytics.</p><p>One may believe that strengthening data protection laws will be a barrier to digital colonialism. However, regardless of their relative strength or weakness, data protection laws have limits. An analysis of Kenya's 2018 data protection bill, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and documented actions of largescale tech companies exemplifies how those limits create several loopholes for continued digital colonialism including, historical violations of data privacy laws; limitations of sanctions; unchecked mass concentration of data, lack of competition enforcement, uninformed consent, and limits to defined nation-state privacy laws.</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>To discuss the extraction, synthesis, and control of user data is to discuss the pulse of commerce, the ever-looming power of large tech companies, and the shift of human emotional interaction to everything in our daily lives. However, to discuss the extraction, synthesis, and control over user data and critical connectivity infrastructure by Western tech companies in African countries with limited infrastructure, limited data protection laws, and limited competition-combined with social, political and economic power imbalances and decades of resource pillaging-is to discuss digital colonialism.</p><p>This Note argues that digital colonialism is part of the modern day \"Scramble for Africa\" that takes place through the extraction and control of user data by large scale tech companies. Part I will establish the background of colonization and the role of corporations so as to enable the comparison between nineteenth century colonialism and twenty-first century colonialism. Part II will explain the definition of digital colonialism, why data is a rich resource comparable to natural resources, and how large tech companies exploit this resource for profit and for use in predictive analytics. Part III will explain the limits to the purported solution to digital colonialism-data protection laws-using examples from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Kenya's 2018 Data Protection Bill.</p><p>I. COLONIZATION AND THE ROLE OF CORPORATIONS</p><p>In the nineteenth century, many African countries faced imperialist aggression through military invasions, land conquests, economic exploitation, genocide, and violent resource extraction at the behest of European world powers. This colonialist rise began after the end of the Transatlantic slave trade and was formalized at the Berlin Colonial Conference, where soon to be colonial powers gathered to develop a plan that would upset and disrupt the social, economic, and political landscape of Africa forever.1 Between 1884 and 1885, under the guise of White supremacy, deeply ingrained anti-Black sentiment, and unchecked power, European powers carved up the continent in what has become known as the \"Scramble for Africa\"-the creation of arbitrary lines equating to colonies, and the forced subjugation of African peoples.2 At the end of the conference, the powers present signed the General Act of the Conference of Berlin, giving purported legal effect to their new territories under the baseless premise that African nations had no sovereignty and no legal claim over their state, land, or resources.3 This, coupled with the beliefs inherent within the White imagination that African peoples were \"evolutionar[il]y backward and undeveloped\" and that \"[i]t was a European responsibility to act as trustees of Africa until Africans were mature enough to govern themselves,\"4 set the ideological tone for ruthless colonization.</p><p>European powers' proliferation of claims in Africa were characteristically expeditious such that, by 1900, European states including Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Italy, and Spain had claimed nearly 90 percent of African territory.5 Due to the rise of industrial capitalism, there was a staunch belief that the economic, and thus political, future of an industrial country hinged on exclusive control of its markets and raw materials.6 Therefore, colonial powers stole from the lands of Africa, violently extracting raw materials such as copper, cotton, rubber, tea, gold, diamonds, and tin.7</p><p>At the center of this pillaging was a simple colonialist economic agenda, to provide maximum economic benefit at a minimal price.8 Accordingly, investing in industrialization, improving the production processes, or strengthening the overall economy of the colonies was not a priority.9 Oftentimes, the colonial powers refused to process the raw materials in-country, sending the raw materials to Europe to be processed, obliterating the role of Africans in the export business and robbing them of any economic profit and potential resource flow that could have derived from processing raw materials in country.10 Although some colonial powers did invest in transportation infrastructure such as railways, such investments were strictly for the benefit of facilitating the efficient transport of raw materials and not for the enrichment of the countries themselves.11 Simply put, \"the infrastructure that was developed was designed to exploit the natural resources of the colonies.\"12</p><p>Corporations, aiding in this colonialist economic agenda, also played a dominant role in colonial expansion. As early as the seventeenth century, dozens of companies were granted trading monopolies by their respective governments throughout the world.13 Their monopoly over trade in specified territories allowed these corporations the power to safeguard this monopoly and the power to exert rights over their countrymen who lived and worked within the territory.14 The granting of monopoly status by colonialist governments made these highly risky ventures safer for investors with profit as the primary motive.15 Investing in trading companies emerged as one of the earliest forms of venture capital as, \"money could be raised in return for shares, profits could be divided among shareholders, and shares could be transferred among members and outsiders.\"16</p><p>After a brief hiatus, the nineteenth century saw the resurgence of trading companies as weapons wielded for colonial expansion and as additional revenue streams for the emerging economic system of industrial capitalism.17 By then, the experience of companies from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries such as the British East India Company had helped establish the corporate form as a dominant force for settlement and colonization.18 This second wave of colonization by trading companies proved to be robust, as \"more than 75 percent of British acquisitions south of the Sahara were acquired by chartered companies\"-not by equitable trading practices, but by monopolized consent, violence, and a virtual absence of competition in extracting raw materials and resources.19</p><p>The four major trading companies of the nineteenth century consisted of the British South African Company, the Germany East African Company, the Imperial British East African Company, and the Royal Niger Company.20 Over the span of decades, trading companies expanded indirect colonial rule through possessing new \"protectorates or spheres of influence\",21 exploited local faction rivalries, arming them in exchange for better trading deals, and established para military forces to facilitate trading goals and increase profit,23 laying the foundation for the eventual mass exploitation of mineral resources and agricultural opportunities across Africa including Niger, Nigeria, South Africa, Central Africa, and East Africa.24 The control of territories by companies established for the \"explicit purpose of making money, meant, inevitably, that the territories were administered simply for profit,\" and that the companies took no in- terest in developing local industrialization outside of its benefits for administering the movement of natural resources and raw materials.25</p><p>Although these companies were principally chartered to facilitate \"trade,\" they were also legal extensions of the crown, a fact that afforded them the right to assert sovereign powers over the non-European peoples within the colony-a power they frequently exerted.26 Trading companies gradually became more intrusive in the governance of the colonies to further their economic interests and those of the colonial powers.27 As the intrusion grew, more demands were made on non-European states, through threat of military action, to concede to the interests of the trading companies.28 Eventually, chartered companies, as extensions of the crown, were an authoritative force in territories, playing an imperative role in territorial annexations and profiting from raw materials and valuable minerals-their primary reason for existing.29</p><p>Steeped in desperation to serve the industrial capitalist structure built upon the backs of African people and lands-the foundation for neo-mercantilism-colonial powers violently took over nations and exploited resource-rich African lands for their own economic benefit and global economic prowess, both directly and via chartered companies.</p><p>II. DIGITAL COLONIALISM</p><p>A. Defining Digital Colonialism</p><p>Earlier colonialists arrived on African shores to expand their empires by exploiting local labor to extract valuable natural resources and raw materials, building critical infrastructure like railroads in the process to facilitate the import and export of these often dispossessed goods.30 Today's colonialists, however, are digital. They build communication infrastructures such as social media platforms and network connectivity for the express purpose of harvesting data, churning a profit, and/or storing the data as raw material for predictive analytics.31</p><p>\"Digital colonialism\" is the decentralized extraction and control of data from citizens with or without their explicit consent \"through com- munication networks developed and owned by Western tech companies.\"32 As professors Hendricks, Marker, and Vestergaard from the University of Copenhagen posit, this structure has four fundamental actors:</p><p>(1) The Western tech companies who create and provide the technology and infrastructure that harvest the data for ad targeting and ad distribution;33</p><p>(2) The advertising and consulting firms who use the technology provided by (1) to target various groups with highly personalized ads and messages aimed at increasing profits;34</p><p>(3) The \"local companies, parties, and organizations who pay (2) to help them impose their different agendas for the respective countries\";35 and</p><p>(4) The citizens who knowingly and unknowingly act as data sources for (1) and as target groups for (2) and (3).36</p><p>Scholar Michael Kwet further explains:</p><p>Under digital colonialism, foreign powers, led by the United States, are planting infrastructure in the Global South engineered for its own needs, enabling economic and culture domination while imposing privatized forms of governance. To accomplish this task, major corporations design digital technology to ensure their own dominance over critical functions in the tech ecosystem. This allows them to accumulate profits from revenues derived from rent (in the form of intellectual property or access to infrastructure) and surveillance (in the form of Big Data). It also empowers them to exercise control over the flow of information (such as the distribution of news and streaming services), social activities (like social networking and cultural exchange) and a plethora of other politi- cal, social and economic and military functions mediated by their technologies.37</p><p>Laying critical connectivity infrastructure owned by Western tech companies, to extract and control untapped user data, however, is the vanguard for this cultural and economic dominance. The extraction, analysis, and control of data in African countries with limited infrastructure, limited data protection laws, and limited competition, combined with social, political, and economic power imbalances and decades of resource pillaging is what gives the above consequences true power.</p><p>B. Data as a Resource</p><p>According to the Oxford New English Dictionary, currency is defined as a system of assets, property, and resources owned by someone or something in general use in a particular country.38 Data is the new currency, and access to data-rather than money, natural resources, or advanced weaponry-is now the most valuable asset available to nationstates and corporations.39 This development lays the foundation for large Western tech companies' movement into African markets.</p><p>Data is collected by corporations of all sizes through online behavioral tracking technology which \"refers to the practice of tracking web users (and mobile apps users) on the Internet. . . .\"40 This technology records a large variety of data including, but not limited to, ad clicks, device specific information, face scan, ISP, ad name, phone numbers, search queries, time, date, browser history, email addresses, IP addresses, location, operating system, and profile information.41 The method of tracking this data includes, but is not limited to, cookies, doubleclick and Adsense, profile information, device tracking technology, facial recognition software, and search queries.42 Collectively, this data creates an \"anonymous\" digital profile of millions of users that is ultimately used to integrate multiple accounts to produce personalized content for location services and notification, and, most importantly, to be sold to data brokers, used as a means for selling access to users for targeted advertising by third party corporations, or collected and stored for future predictive analytic use.43 With over 1.25 billion people living in Africa,44 this market represents a treasure trove of data, much of which is as yet untapped by Western tech companies.45</p><p>Due to this robust and efficient online behavioral tracking technology, consumerism has now shifted from a story of mass consumption to a \"story of one.\"46 Because of the rapid development of portable technological devices like iPhones, smart watches and tablets, coupled with the constant and ever-increasing use of social media across generations,47 the potential for consumer engagement can now operate twenty-four hours a day, making the transition from mass advertising to targeted advertising a lucrative pursuit. Now, advertisers no longer must make assumptions about consumers' behavior48 and can instead target consumers with extreme precision based on hyper-personalized data.49</p><p>This helps corporations attract new business and \"maximize engagement among target audiences,\" resulting in a higher return on investment,50 and creating a more efficient and cost-effective process for promotion, price point decision making, and distribution of products and/or services.51 Within the modern capitalist society, this is the most valuable information any company can possess.</p><p>However, the value of this data is based on the ability to \"make sense of the avalanche of data,\"52 and companies like Alphabet and Facebook have a leading edge due to their size, access to data, resources, and data science infrastructure.53 For less robust companies and marketers, harnessing data effectively can be challenging,54 as \"the abundance of data produced by disparate sources has made the task of identifying and unifying relevant insight seem colossal.\"55 The inherent technical challenges in turning large stores of data into valuable currency means that behemoths like Alphabet and Facebook are well-positioned to dominate new large markets with their highly-equipped platforms and resources by synthesizing the data into usable information, effectively controlling the market.</p><p>Artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning and natural language processing, gives companies the capability to better synthesize billions of data points and make inferences about users.56 This data can be used to infer personal information such as a person's background, religion and beliefs, political views, sexual orientation and gender identity, social connections, health, ethnicity, income levels, educational attainment, marital status, family composition, financial stability, and creditworthiness, all without the user directly giving this information.57 \"The result is the creation and amalgamation of digital footprints that provide in-depth knowledge about [one's] life.\"58 This data is eventually synthesized, used, and sold for immense profit.59</p><p>What is more alarming is that a handful of tech companies, like Alphabet and Facebook, are able to use artificial intelligence for predictive analytics, which is \"the use of data, statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data.\"60 The goal is to go beyond knowing what is happening and what has happened to provide a best assessment of how users will behave in the future.61 Although predictive analytics can have positive effects in many sectors, such as the healthcare industry, they can also distort the lines of privacy when dealing with individualized human behavior, particularly when only a handful of companies have this information.</p><p>These possible intrusions into basic concepts of privacy can be seen in Facebook's uncanny ability to predict when a person is motivated to do something,62 when a person is feeling a range of emotions, such as feeling down,63 and when a couple's relationship will end64-all before the users even know it themselves. Predictive analytics allows a handful of companies to understand even the innermost emotions, and to predict how this will affect future behavior. This information is extremely useful to millions of corporations across the globe. It can affect the global economy, workforce development, small and large scale investments, resource allocation, advertising, presidential elections, and every single segment of global capitalism.</p><p>Furthermore, since machines are not humans and cannot \"think,\" artificial intelligence needs gargantuan sets of data to \"learn\" from and derive its predictive accuracy-to which only a handful of corporations have access. Facebook itself has access to over two billion people's sensitive information, including what they \"like\" and \"dislike,\" who their friends are, to whom they talk the most, and where they physically travel65-a level of intimate personal data that no other company in the world has. Google dominates search engines with the ability to collect data on over 1.17 billion global users.66 Companies like Facebook and Google then use these highly personal inferences and sensitive data as a means of selling access to individuals to third-party corporations67- making 40 billion dollars in 2017 alone.68 Additionally, when only a select few companies have access to the largest sets of valuable data, they have a supreme advantage over competitors, ultimately controlling that market and deciding who gets access, both presently and in the future, while making the most profit.69</p><p>For tech companies, the treasure trove of citizens' data that lies in Africa is a natural resource. The data may be extracted and sold as a commodity to corporations and political interests who base their revenue model on knowing their target groups so that they are able to push political messages and agendas or sell targeted products to citizens, thereby increasing their bottom-line.70 The essence of this business model is already established in the West. Tech companies \"provide seemingly free communication services and search engines\" and track users across platforms, apps and the internet, all to enable advertisers to target consumers and voters with hyper-personalized ads based on behavioral patterns, making an enormous profit. However, when this business strategy is pursued in countries with limited infrastructure, limited data protection laws, and limited competition-while rooted in neoliberal notions of human rights-it transitions from a business model into a form of digital colonialism.</p><p>Facebook's Free Basics and Project Aires, and Google's Project Csquared and Project Loon, are just a few projects deployed by Western tech companies in Africa as they expand their global reach for profit.71 Much like the colonialists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, who built critical infrastructure like railroads for the sole purpose of continuing to economically exploit the natural resources of Africa, giant tech companies like Facebook and Alphabet are building network connectivity infrastructure for the benefit of profiting from the use of their online services, rather than building local infrastructure for sustained economic development in African countries.</p><p>In 2017, Google and its partners committed $100 million to Csquared, a broadband project in Africa aimed at providing high-speed, affordable, and reliable connectivity infrastructure to further grow internet access in Africa.72 This is a laudable goal; however, by \"doubling down on its efforts to support the underlying internet infrastructure, which, in turn, opens up new markets for the internet giant's own online services,\" it increases their access to data.73 In 2012, the idea for Project Loon was born in order to get billions of people online where cell towers do not exist via helium balloons.74 This type of technological advancement could be revolutionary for rural communities and other places in which millions of people are in desperate need for internet access yet physical hardware connectivity is not always possible, particularly after natural disasters. However, as scholar Tom Simonite in the MIT Technology Review notes:</p><p>It is odd for a large public company to build out infrastructure aimed at helping the world's poorest people. But in addition to Google's professed desires to help the world, the economics of ad-supported Web businesses give the company other reasons to think big. It's hard to find new customers in Internet markets such as the United States. Getting billions more people online would provide a valuable new supply of eyeballs and personal data for ad targeting.75</p><p>Although software is not technically infrastructure, it is also central to the overall development of technological connectivity being used to harvest data for economic profit. Free Basics, Facebook's mobile application, gives users in developing nations access to limited online services and content for free. \"Fundamentally, Free Basics is a data-lite mobile application that allows users to browse a narrowed down version of the internet\"76 as an \"on ramp\" to introduce internet to those who otherwise would not have access.77 By using neoliberal code words like \"democra- cy,\" \"equality,\" and \"internet as a basic human right,\" Facebook masks its true long-term goal of collecting data on \"the next billion.\"78 Free Basics harvests an enormous amount of metadata on users.79 When a user clicks on a website in Free Basics, \"that click sends packets of data to Facebook's servers.\"80 Furthermore, \"[s\u013cince all of the data exchanged on Free Basics goes through Facebook's Proxy servers, Facebook now has a way to access users [sic] data outside of Facebook.\"81 Research by Citizen Media and activist group Global Voices found that the Free Basics program has enabled Facebook to gather data about the habits, interests, and behaviors of users in the developing world, where Facebook aspires to have a strong presence as more users come online.82 In sum, \"Free Basics is a closed space where Facebook picks the content-and profits from users' data along the way-creating what some people call a 'poor internet for poor people.' \"83</p><p>Only 31 percent of people on the continent of Africa have access to the internet,84 making it clear that Africa faces connectivity, access, and infrastructure issues. However, it is by no means certain that this is a problem for foreign tech companies.85 Due to this lack of infrastructure and connectivity, giant tech companies are acting as the \"White savior,\" much like colonial powers who disguised the Scramble for Africa as liberalization intended to help the \"noble savage.\" These companies claim that they want to bridge the digital divide and give internet access to the millions of people who otherwise would not have it, but their true purpose is simply to extract data for profit and predictive analytics.</p><p>Furthermore, by capitalizing on \" 'first mover' advantage\" with an army of lawyers and operating on such a massive scale, giant tech companies face extremely limited competition, both locally and internationally, and can outcompete or simply buy up competitors around the world.86 Much like chartered companies in the nineteenth century, who used limited trade competition to create monopolistic economic control within the colonies, these giant tech companies can control how the connectivity infrastructure is built, what apps and services users have access to, and what happens to the data due to the lack of competition. With Free Basics spanning sixty countries, reaching hundreds of millions of mobile phone users in Africa alone,87 Facebook has the most data points about new users from emerging markets, and the best resources to synthesize this data into usable information-more than the majority of other companies in the market and most governments.88 This makes Facebook the centerpiece of control for extremely valuable data sets, at no benefit to the users or the countries themselves.</p><p>III.LIMITATIONS OF DATA PROTECTION LAWS</p><p>Some scholars believe that the digital colonialism as described in Part II, is enhanced by scant data protection laws in Africa that leave users exposed.89 However, the limits to data protection laws, which occur regardless of the relative strength or weakness of the laws, are overwhelming and fail to provide a panacea to digital colonialism. This Part describes these limitations and how they operate.</p><p>A. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Kenya's Data Protection Laws</p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force on May 25, 2018, is now the world's strongest data protection law.90 It applies to European companies broadly, as well as any company across the globe that collects data on its citizens. Designed to modernize laws that protect sensitive and personal information of users,91 this law \"reshape[s\u013c how technology companies store, process, and profit from users' personal information.\"92 It also gives the user the \"right to be forgotten,\" as well as the right to withdraw their data from collection.93</p><p>GDPR has elevated the standard for data protection laws globally, and yet in Africa, there is no continent-wide consensus of an approach to personal data protection, as some countries have little to no data protection laws or constitutional protections, while others have robust data protection laws.94 Based on 2017 data, there are seventeen countries in Africa that have enacted comprehensive personal data protection legislation. Three more countries, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe, have enacted personal data protection legislation that is currently moving through the lawmaking process. In addition, the African Union (AU) adopted the AU Convention on Cybersecurity and Data Protection (AU Convention) in June 2014,95 which provides \"a personal data protection framework which African countries may potentially transpose into their national legislation.\"96 However, the AU Convention has only been ratified by four of the fifty-four AU member jurisdictions and needs to be ratified by fifteen member _jurisdictions in order to take effect.97 Nevertheless, there are common themes and principles between the GDPR and comprehensive data protection legislation adopted by some African countries.98 These themes comprise</p><p>* notice;</p><p>* choice and consent;</p><p>* data security;</p><p>* data access and correction;</p><p>* data quality and integrity;</p><p>* data retention and destruction;</p><p>* registration with a data protection authority (DPA);</p><p>* cross-border data transfers;</p><p>* personal data breach notification; and</p><p>* appointment of a data protection officer (DPO).99</p><p>Many of these themes are incorporated in Kenya's 2018 Data Protection Bill (DPB), which is said to mirror the GDPR.100 Once passed, it will give Kenyan citizens a series of rights including: 1) the right to ask companies to clearly explain, using accessible language, how their personal data is being collected, used, and stored; 2) the right to request that their personal data be deleted; and 3) the right to object to their personal data being used for specific purposes like targeted advertising.101 This will also require companies to gain consent from users before collecting their data.102 The DPB is all-encompassing, applying to \"all data subjects, regardless if they reside in Kenya, whose data is, or has been, collected or processed by a data controller in Kenya.\"103 However, this bill has received much scrutiny,104 and many provisions, much like some in the GDPR, reflect the limits of data protection laws against digital colonialism.</p><p>Once enacted, the Bill will give effect to Article 31(c) and Article 31(d) of the 2010 Constitution of Kenya, which guarantees every person the right not to have \"information relating to their family or private affairs unnecessarily required or revealed,\" and the right not to have \"the privacy of their communications infringed.\"105 This will directly tie this law to the Constitution of Kenya, the supreme law of the land, which is binding on all persons.</p><p>B. Violation of Data Privacy Laws</p><p>Unfortunately, big tech companies can violate (and have blatantly violated) these laws, since they have the time, money, and resources to fight for their desired outcomes, even if they stand in direct violation of pre-established laws. For example, Uber has flaunted its willingness to operate in clear violation of local laws, launching in cities where its operation violates city ordinances.106 \"The company's non-compliance with city ordinances ranges from Uber drivers not having the required driving permits to refusing a request by California state regulators to provide information about their drivers.\"107 Uber's violation of the law extends globally-a French Court in 2016 convicted Uber of violating French transport and privacy laws.</p><p>Additionally, Google Books made a clear and public move to violate copyright law.109 The goal of Google Books was to scan millions of books into digital format to add to their search engine, despite the project's clear violation of age-old copyright laws.110 At this legal battle's inception, approximately 24 million titles were under copyright protection. The potential cost for Google infringing on each work totaled 3.6 trillion, and yet Google forged ahead.111 After a nearly decade-long legal battle, Google prevailed, and the courts upheld their fair-use claims.112</p><p>These examples from the Global North indicate that the presence of a comprehensive data protection legislation does not mean that large tech companies will actually comply if the benefit of violation exceeds the burden of consequence. This also proves the limits to penalties, fines, and sanctions against large tech companies-digital colonialism's most prominent purveyors.</p><p>C.Limitations of Penalties, Fines, and Sanctions</p><p>GDPR fines for offenses are the greater sum of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of a firm's global turnover.113 However, if Google was willing to risk paying 3.6 trillion for a clear violation of law, arguably it would be willing to risk paying the GDPR penalty. That is, if the violation is worth it for the company, or if they have the resources to defend the alleged violation in court, the company may go ahead with its ac- tions, even if it knows they are likely to be in violation. Kenya's DBP on the on the other hand, is silent on penalties or fines against corporations found to be in violation of the data protection law, leaving it up to the complaints commission to decide the course of action.114Although this is a better proposition considering that the complaint commission may be able to exercise more effective sanctions that would serve as greater deterrents for large tech companies than monetary fines, there is still a loophole. Large tech companies and data brokers could simply dissolve before they ever have to face any accountability measures. This is the current predicament of Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica, a data firm, harvested the personal data of approximately 50 million Americans and at least one million Brits through Facebook. This data was ultimately used to influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election of Donald Trump, as demonstrated by Cambridge Analytica's CEO, who was caught via secret recording claiming direct credit for the election of Donald Trump.116 Additionally, senior executives were \"filmed describing its dominant role in Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's election campaigns in 2013 and 2017 and were caught boasting about psychological manipulation, entrapment techniques and fake news campaigns.\"117 The Information Commissioner's Office, a UK independent authority, is prosecuting SCL Elections, Cambridge Analytica's parent company, for failing to comply with an enforcement notice.118 However, SCL Elections filed bankruptcy in May and will be completely dissolved by the January 2019 trial date.119 The ICO is examining whether the SCL Elections directors can still be pursued; however, it seems that this major data firm will escape unscathed despite their clear violation of pre-GDPR protection laws.120 All of this sets the foundation for the potential abuse of power by large tech companies who can blatantly violate laws and skirt fines, penalties and sanctions, leaving the local citizens whom they exploit for data extraction powerless, despite clear data protection laws.</p><p>D.Mass Concentration of Data and Lack of Competition Enforcement</p><p>Another clear limit to data privacy laws is that the lack of protection against the mass concentration of data by dominant players is compounded by the lack of competition enforcement measures. Competition, data protection, and consumer protection law are inextricably related, and data privacy legislation often does not take this into account-Kenya's DPB included. Without these protections, enormous amounts of data will be centrally held and owned by dominant players who have the resources to stomp out their competition, leaving the fate of millions and sometimes billions of people's personal and sensitive data in the hands of a select few.</p><p>This was particularly visible in the merger decision for Facebook and WhatsApp. Facebook already had a lion's share of the data market, with access to over 2 billion users' data. The \"main reason for Facebook's interest in WhatsApp is believed to lie in the troves of data that came with the acquisition\"121-namely, 500 million users. This was also a strategic acquisition to help Facebook fuel growth in developing markets, opening up data extraction opportunities for over 172 million WhatsApp users in Africa.122 The lack of protection against mass concentration of data and the lack of regulation of anti-competitive conduct by companies fuels the concentration of mass data, as there are no regulations within data privacy law that apply when a company has either 1) simply amassed too much data at the risk of users or 2) has amassed too much data at the risk of users through means of acquisitions, decreasing market competition.</p><p>Additionally, this hole creates a high barrier of entry for small, medium, and local tech companies who simply cannot compete with global tech companies. The cost for running centralized social networks is extremely expensive. A company must pay for costly cloud infrastructure, find and pay skilled programmers, and be able to pay for quality data col- lection and storage in a way that adheres to data privacy law standards.123 A company must also think of a way to monetize their service in order to cover these costs.124 Moreover, \"competitors include multi-billion dollar corporations, who already dominate the market, enjoy the benefit of network effects, have accumulated brand equity and trade secrets, and have the power to acquire smaller companies.\"125 This leads to an overwhelming dynamic where \"the largest sets of valuable data-such as social data\" (Facebook, WhatsApp), and search (Google)-are concentrated and thereby controlled by a handful of \"winners,\" with no regulations within data privacy to promote and maintain market competition.126</p><p>E.Consent</p><p>Lastly, this inextricably affects the notion of consent, as \"it is often argued that strong competition enforcement could render data protection rules more effective by facilitating genuine consumer choice.\"127 Regardless of the requirements laid out by Kenya's data protection privacy bill, when one combines a lack of genuine consumer choice (due to the extreme lack of market competition) with a strong desire and or need for the service, can true consent be granted for data extraction?</p><p>Many believe that user consent to the authorization of data extraction and user consent to sell data to third parties shifts the power dynamic to equality between large tech companies and data subjects; however, this is simply untrue. When the users' desire for the service exceeds the threat of data misuse, consent will be freely given. The World Wide Web Foundation conducted a study in three countries, Kenya, Indonesia, and Philippines, on \"Teenagers Use of Social Media and their Understanding of Privacy Issues in Developing Countries.\"128 Teenagers are the highest users of social media and thus at the highest risk for data misuse.129 The results of this study concluded that \"[m]ost surveyed teenagers are aware that social media companies collect their personal data, but are not knowledgeable or do not care about how these platforms use these [data].\"130 So, the largest users of social media in three major countries, including Kenya, are aware of data collection but do not register or care about data misuse. Thus, their consent for data extraction is given carelessly leaving the tech companies still in control of blind users.</p><p>Additionally, the requirement of consent has not shifted the power to users, as users are often uneducated on data sharing and misuse. Even when they are aware, users oftentimes cannot understand the policies and thus blindly consent.</p><p>A Deloitte survey of 2,000 consumers in the U.S found that 91 [percent] of people consent to legal terms and services conditions without reading them. For younger people, ages 18-34 the rate is even higher with 97 [percent] agreeing to conditions before reading. The language is too complex and long-winded for most.131</p><p>In Africa, \"(p)rivacy advocacy groups say users of the Free Basics Service, who may be getting online for the first time, may have little or no understanding of what information is even being collected from them.\"132 Furthermore, the World Wide Web Foundation study found that \"[w]hile the teenagers were typically relaxed about sharing their personal information, they seemed to be unaware that, by using social media, they also share data they do not input directly, such as location data and browsing history.\"133 When users do not understand what they are consenting to, the concept of consent is null and void. The companies have no one to keep them accountable, and they remain in control by taking advantage of the ignorance of their large user base.</p><p>Even valid consent does not prevent data misuse. Large tech companies will still own personal and sensitive data after consent is given, and they can still sell this data to third parties without any accountability measures. Much like when Cambridge Analytica acquired millions of data and used it to manipulate presidential elections, \"the company pointed out, this wasn't a leak or data breach of any kind-it's simply how Facebook works.\"134 \" 'Everyone involved gave their consent,' according to the company's response on the matter.\"135</p><p>F. Limits to Defined Nation-State Privacy Laws</p><p>The limits presented above are based on the current state of technology. However, as technology continues to develop rapidly, and large tech companies invest in a variety of beta testing experiments, the limits of the current data protection laws will only become more prominent. Privacy laws are typically designed to \"only be enforceable within defined nation-state borders.\"136 However, some speculate that large tech companies are seeking to exist outside of national borders entirely.137 For example, in 2013, mystery Google barges were seen on the Western and Eastern coasts of the United States. They appeared to be floating data centers,138 perhaps an early attempt at sea-steading.139 Sea-steading \"is the attempt to create non-governmental entities outside of recognized borders and gain freedom from legal control.\"140 If large tech companies could create sea-steads, they could operate in international waters, completely unregulated, while owning the data of billions of users, dodging data privacy laws all together.141</p><p>conclusion</p><p>Digital colonialism is just as oppressive as the early colonialism from the nineteenth century. Large tech companies, typically owned and primarily operated by White men, are extracting data from uninformed users and controlling that data to profit via predictive analytics. Unfortunately, strong data protection laws will not prevent this domination. While modern data protection laws may constitute a step in the right direction, further reflection is required to answer the question of how society can protect user data in an increasingly digitally-dependent society.</p><p>1.

Part of the reason why countries such as India, Indonesia and South Africa boycotted the declaration was because they had no opportunity to put their own interests about data into the document.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The boycott represents an ongoing struggle by some countries to assert their claim over the data generated by their own citizens.</p><p>Just as oil-producing nations pushed for oil refineries to add local value to crude oil [and diamond producing nations push for beneficiation and home based diamond production industries], so governments today want the world's Big Tech companies to build data centres on their own soil. The cloud that powers much of the world's tech industry is grounded in vast data centres located mainly around northern Europe and the US.</p><p>Take, for example, the case of Facebook. While India is the country with the biggest amount of Facebook users, when you look at the location of Facebook's 15 data centres, ten are in North America, four in Europe and one in Asia.</p><p>The economic argument for countries in the global south to host more data centres is that it would boost digital industrialisation by creating competitive advantages for local cloud companies, and develop links to other parts of the local IT sector.</p><p>Many countries have flirted with regulations on what sort of data should be stored locally. Others require the consent of the person associated with the data for it to be transmitted overseas. France wants its own data centre infrastructure despite the closure of some of the businesses initially behind the idea. The most comprehensive laws are in China and Russia, which mandate localisation across multiple sectors for many kinds of personal data.</p><p>Countries such as India and Indonesia with their massive online populations arguably have the most to gain economically from such regulations as they currently receive the least data infrastructure investment from the tech giants relative to the number of users.</p><p>Supporters of data localisation cite developing countries' structural dependency on foreign-owned digital infrastructure and an unfair share of the industry's economic benefits. They dream of using data localisation to force tech companies into becoming permanent entities on home soil to eventually increase the amount of taxes they can impose on them.</p><p>Detractors point to the high business costs of local servers. They say localisation regulations interfere with global innovation, are difficult to enforce, and ignore the technical requirements of data centres: proximity to fibre optic cables, a stable supply of electricity, and low temperature air or water for cooling the giant servers.</p><p>Attempts to measure the economic impact of localisation are extremely partisan. The most cited study from 2014 uses an opaque methodology and was produced by the European Centre for International Political Economy, a free trade think-tank based in Brussels, some of whose funding comes from unknown multinational businesses. Not surprisingly, it finds gross losses for countries considering localisation.</p><p>Yet, a 2018 study commissioned by Facebook found that its data centre spending in the US had created tens of thousands of jobs, supported renewable energy investments and contributed $5.8-billion to US GDP in just six years.</p><p>The economic costs and benefits depend on the type of data stored, whether it's a duplicate or the only copy, the level of government support for wider infrastructure subsidies, to name just a few factors.</p><p>While the international economics of personal data may follow some of the same general dynamics as oil production, data is fundamentally different from oil because it does a double duty - providing not just monetary value to businesses, but also surveillance opportunities for governments. Some civil society activists I've met as part of my research in India and Indonesia told me they were sceptical of their own governments' narratives about data colonialism, worrying instead about the increased access to sensitive personal information that localisation gives to governments.</p><p>It's not just large corporations and states that have roles to play in this bid for 'data sovereignty'. Tech developers may yet find ways to support the rights of individuals to control their own personal data with platforms such as databox, which gives each of us something akin to our own personal servers. These technologies are still in development, but projects are springing up - mostly around Europe - that not only give people greater control over their personal data, but aim to produce social value rather than profit. Such experiments may yet find a place in the developing world alongside what states and large corporations are doing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WINDOB-WINDHOEKOBS111020190000505</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WINDOB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8M-HJH1-F00C-62FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465539</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Paragon Media Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Windhoek Observer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 11, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>GROUP OF TWENTY (G20)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

At the close of June's G20 summit in Japan, a number of developing countries <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/india-boycotts-osaka-track-at-g20-summit-1561897592466.html\">refused to sign</url> an international declaration on data flows - the so-called Osaka Track. Part of the reason why countries such as India, Indonesia and South Africa boycotted the declaration was because they had no opportunity to put their own interests about data into the document. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With 50 other signatories, the declaration still stands as a statement of future intent to negotiate further, but the boycott represents an ongoing struggle by some countries to assert their claim over the data generated by their own citizens.</p><p>Back in the dark ages of 2016, data was touted as the new oil. Although the metaphor was quickly <url normalizedValue=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/data-is-not-the-new-oil-721f5109851b\">debunked</url> it's still a helpful way to understand the global digital economy. Now, as international negotiations over data flows intensify, the oil comparison helps explain the economics of what's called \"data localisation\" - the bid to keep citizens' data within their own country.</p><p>Just as oil-producing nations pushed for oil refineries to add value to crude oil, so governments today want the world's Big Tech companies to build data centres on their own soil. The cloud that powers much of the world's tech industry is grounded in vast data centres located mainly around northern Europe and the US coasts. Yet, at the same time, US Big Tech companies are increasingly turning to markets in the global south for expansion as enormous numbers of young tech savvy populations come online. </p><h>Accusations of 'digital imperalism'</h><p>Take, for example, the case of Facebook. While India is the country with the biggest amount of Facebook users, when you look at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.datacenters.com/providers/facebook\">location of Facebook's 15 data centres</url>, ten are in North America, four in Europe and one in Asia - in Singapore. </p><p>This disconnect between new sources of data and the location of data centres has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.livemint.com/Companies/QMZDxbCufK3O2dJE4xccyI/Indias-data-must-be-controlled-by-Indians-not-by-global-co.html\">led to accusations</url> from countries such as India of \"data colonisation\" and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/digital-colonialism-threatening-global-south-190129140828809.html\">\"digital colonialism\"</url>.</p><p>The economic argument for countries in the global south to host more data centres is that it would boost digital industrialisation by creating competitive advantages for local cloud companies, and develop links to other parts of the local IT sector.</p><p>Many <url normalizedValue=\"http://siba-ese.unisalento.it/index.php/paco/article/view/19553/16635\">countries</url> have flirted with regulations on what sort of data should be stored locally. Some cover only certain sectors such as health data in Australia. Others, such as South Korea, require the consent of the person associated with the data for it to be transmitted overseas. France continues to pursue its own data centre infrastructure, dubbed \"le cloud souverain\", despite the closure of some of the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rudebaguette.com/2019/08/cloudwatt-orange-cloud-souverain-fin/\">businesses initially behind the idea</url>. The most comprehensive laws are in China and Russia, which mandate localisation across multiple sectors for many kinds of personal data.</p><p>Countries such as India and Indonesia with their massive and growing online populations arguably have the most to gain economically from such regulations as they currently receive the least data infrastructure investment from the tech giants relative to the number of users.</p><h>The economics aren't clear cut</h><p>Supporters of data localisation cite developing countries' structural dependency on foreign-owned digital infrastructure and an unfair share of the industry's economic benefits. They dream of using data localisation to force tech companies into becoming permanent entities on home soil to eventually increase the amount of taxes they can impose on them. </p><p>Detractors point to the high business costs of local servers, not just for the tech giants, but also for the very digital start ups that governments say they want to encourage. They say localisation regulations interfere with global innovation, are difficult to enforce, and ignore the technical requirements of data centres: proximity to the internet's \"backbone\" of fibre optic cables, a stable supply of electricity, and low temperature air or water for cooling the giant servers.</p><p>Attempts to measure the economic impact of localisation are extremely partisan. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/174726\">most cited study</url> from 2014 uses an opaque methodology and was produced by the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ecipe.org/\">European Centre for International Political Economy</url>, a free trade think-tank based in Brussels, some of whose funding comes from unknown       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thecorrespondent.com/3884/big-business-orders-its-pro-ttip-arguments-from-these-think-tanks/179184456-59671a10\">multinational businesses</url>. Not surprisingly, it finds gross losses for countries considering localisation. Yet, a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://baxtel.com/data-center/facebook/files/facebook_data_centers_2018\">2018 study</url> commissioned by Facebook found that its data centre spending in the US had created tens of thousands of jobs, supported renewable energy investments and contributed US$5.8 billion to US GDP in just six years.</p><p>Like the equivalent arguments for and against free trade, taking a dogmatic position for or against the issue masks other complexities on the ground. The economic costs and benefits depend on the type of data stored, whether it's a duplicate or the only copy, the level of government support for wider infrastructure subsidies, to name just a few factors. </p><p>India has been the most vocal supporter for localisation, promoting its own regulation as \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf\">a template for the developing world</url>\", but it's in a strong position to do so given the country's relatively advanced digital industrialisation and technical manpower. Other emerging economies with large online populations, such as Indonesia, have vacillated on their localisation regulations under pressure from the US government which has threatened       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://inet.detik.com/law-and-policy/d-4318420/revisi-pp-pste-diduga-sarat-tekanan-asing\">to pull preferential trade terms</url> for other goods and services if they went ahead with restrictive regulations.</p><h>What governments do with the data</h><p>While the international economics of personal data may follow some of the same general dynamics as oil production, data is fundamentally different from oil because it does a double duty - providing not just monetary value to businesses, but also surveillance opportunities for governments. Some civil society activists I've met as part of my research in India and Indonesia told me they were sceptical of their own governments' narratives about data colonialism, worrying instead about the increased access to sensitive personal information that localisation gives to governments.</p><p>It's not just large corporations and states that have roles to play in this bid for \"data sovereignty\". Tech developers may yet find ways to support the rights of individuals to control their own personal data with platforms such as <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.databoxproject.uk\">databox</url>, which gives each of us something akin to our own personal servers. These technologies are still in development, but       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.decodeproject.eu/pilots\">projects</url> are springing up - mostly around Europe - that not only give people greater control over their personal data, but aim to produce social value rather than profit. Such experiments may yet find a place in the developing world alongside what states and large corporations are doing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jacqueline Hicks receives funding from EU Horizon 2020.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONUK-123048</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONUK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4N-D8P1-JB75-93PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463594</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1151\"/><timeReceived>12:18 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - United Kingdom</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7117\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00098AA</classCode><className>INTERGOVERNMENTAL TALKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001207</classCode><className>NEW ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLLK</classCode><className>DIGITAL ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000203</classCode><className>BOYCOTTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLLK</classCode><className>DIGITAL ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001897</classCode><className>COMPUTING &amp;

With the industry constantly changing and innovating, within this article you can find some of the most recent developments within the digital currencies vertical. From tips and advice on crypto banking, to how stablecoins and digital assets could soon have a consistent regulatory framework.  New Ziglu insurance provides safe and secure access to cryptocurrencies   Ziglu, the new cryptocurrency challenger, has launched an insurance programme for customers holding cryptocurrencies to provide greater security and peace of mind.   Each Ziglu customer\u2019s cryptocurrency holdings are always insured against cyber-crime up to a value of \u00a350,000 and held in a segregated account. The vast majority of customer assets are stored in offline (\u201ccold\u201d) wallets, meaning they are not accessible via the internet and therefore at lower risk of theft.   Mark Hipperson, Founder &amp; Chief Executive Officer of Ziglu, said \u201cOne of the biggest concerns for users is the safekeeping of their funds and cryptocurrencies. Ziglu\u2019s insurance programme brings peace of mind to existing customers or those dipping their toes into cryptocurrency for the first time.\u201d   Ziglu launched last month with a vision to offer access to cryptocurrencies securely. Ziglu\u2019s customers can now instantly and securely exchange money into digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin &amp; Bitcoin Cash at competitive prices and monitor their balances in real-time.   Ziglu is constantly enhancing the platform in response to customer needs. Since launching a month ago Ziglu has listened to its growing community to enhance the user experience and exchange flow, to provide a more intuitive and smoother transaction experience.   Crypto Banking: Why it\u2019s a case of Who Dares Wins, and how to come out ahead.   The emerging world of cryptocurrencies appears to be getting back on track in 2020 after a volatile 2019. The current value of the cryptocurrency market is around $270 billion, benefiting from the chaos caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.   Though incumbent banks have been slow to enter the crypto market, Fintech\u2019s, crypto exchanges and big tech players like Facebook and Amazon are all jostling for an early leadership position in crypto banking.   For these companies to succeed, Leon Gauham, CSO of Elsewhen, a digital product consultancy company, says they must:     \u201c1. Have a clear and focussed aim. The most successful crypto-enabled banks are likely to be those which target narrow customer segments to secure a competitive edge. As crypto starts to attract interest from institutional investors, and Robo-advisors start to be able to offer fully automated financial advice, FinTech\u2019s could emerge to bundle these products into a financial service for these customers.   \u201c2. Learn the UX lessons from retail bank challengers and their approach to customer-centricity. It\u2019s early days but there are signs that some crypto-enabled banks are seeking to adopt retail bank best practices when it comes to prioritising customer-centricity including entirely digital onboarding and high-touch customer services.   \u201c3. Be Ready for Regulatory Relaxation. In the UK, there are signs the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s formerly icy view of crypto assets/ crypto banking may be thawing. Players keen to take pole position in crypto need to position themselves to be ready to take advantage of any relaxing of restrictions.\u201d   Bitstock\u2019s New eBook by Liz Louw rewrites the Definition of Bitcoin   Content marketer Liz Louw has authored a second eBook entitled \u2018What is Bitcoin? \u2013 the 11th Birthday Edition\u2019. Released with Bitstocks, a Bitcoin market advisory and investment firm, the book will mark the 11 years since the conception of Bitcoin and blockchain technology,   The eBook is marketed as the ideal starting place for anyone who wants to learn more about Bitcoin, and prides itself on being a fresh look on the industry   Louw said, \u201cWe found most existing content that tries to answer the question \u2018What is Bitcoin?\u2019 focuses on a specific aspect of the system Instead of choosing a single angle, I decided to discover the story from Satoshi\u2019s perspective himself; we start with the professional challenges Satoshi faced circa 2008, how he used an incentive system to align the tech with human psychology and economic principles, and the resulting (current-day and potential) applications.\u201d   Louw is a prominent voice within a male-dominated industry and has frequently contributed to the bitcoin conversation with blog posts, eBooks and interviews. Her pieces are always extensively researched, backed up with stats and written to be both authoritative and persuasive   Louw attributes part of her success in navigating these topics is her ability to view the industry as a constantly evolving entity. \u201cWhen I started working in the cryptocurrency industry, the most enticing promise of Bitcoin was to help you get rich quick,\u201d she said. \u201cOver time, my research showed me that Bitcoin was much more than a speculative asset and that it\u2019s going to play a pivotal role in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the data-driven economy.\u201d   The World Federation of Exchanges calls to address the development of global stablecoins with a taxonomy \u2013 and to include crypto-assets   The World Federation of Exchanges (\u201cWFE\u201d), the global industry group for exchanges and CCPs, called for a response to the growth of stablecoins by developing a common taxonomy that would also cover crypto-assets more broadly, creating consistent and common regulatory classifications before they fragment further.   The WFE asked the Financial Stability Board, and other international standard-setting bodies, to generate, adopt and use a global taxonomy as it would drive a common understanding of whether a global stablecoin (GSC) or crypto-asset fits a certain classification or definition. This would reduce the variance between jurisdictions and curb regulatory dissonance. A periodic review of the taxonomy would ensure that forms of GSC and crypto-assets, which have matured and may constitute a new, viable and commonly used product, can be incorporated and regulated accordingly.   Nandini Sukumar, Chief Executive Officer of the WFE said; \u201cWe support the overall ambition of seeking to address fragmented regulatory approaches by moving to an outcomes focus, applying the \u2018same business, same risk, same rules\u2019 principle; and building on the need for cross-border co-operation in the supervision of global stablecoin, both for wholesale and retail.\u201d   The WFE asked the FSB to consider three areas for further work:  Creating classifications via a taxonomy for all GSC and crypto-assets \u2013 Application of the recommendations to all crypto-assets Applying the cross-border co-operation recommendations and information-sharing requirements to the supervision of all those trading GSC/crypto-assets Regulators should cooperate to share information on global stablecoins and crypto-assets and also on their issuers and the platforms on which they are traded, the WFE said. Without formalised co-ordinated approaches to enforcement and oversight in general, issues around market integrity and consumer protection will not be fully addressed.  Unilever-backed Covid-19 Wargame developed   Ken Charman, CEO of fintech start-up uFlexReward has developed a wargame/role play simulation for companies to test out different options for restructuring their workforce and the long-term impact of their decisions.   The simulation, backed by Unilever, allows companies to explore creative alternatives to \u201cthe usual\u201d cost reduction strategies that rely heavily on redundancies.   Wargames can be used to explore tactical, operational and strategic issues across a business, and encourage players to think innovatively and creatively in a safe to fail environment; identify emerging issues; test hypotheses; assess alternate options and highlight the potential consequences of choices.

Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire of France, which holds the rotating presidency of the G7 top world economies, said the group opposed the idea that companies could have the same privilege as nations in creating means of payment - but without the control and obligations that go with it. </p><p>\"We cannot accept private companies issuing their own currencies without democratic control,\" Le Maire said.

Governments are starting to worry that big tech companies are encroaching on areas that belong to governments, such as issuing currency. Facebook's June 18 announcement of Libra heralded an effort to expand beyond social networking and move into e-commerce and global payments. The G7 are concerned that Facebook's ambitions for a digital currency might not only weaken their control over monetary and banking policies but also pose security risks. | Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRETOR-111835127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRETOR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKW-G761-F091-R4PM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"240\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pretoria News (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While Libra\u2019s own prospects have dimmed, major central banks are considering whether \u201cpublic\u201d digital currencies are needed to fill a gap in retail payment needs.\u00a0</p><p>Some analysts suggest that the addition of private and central bank-backed digital currencies could provide the long expected but elusive shock that finally dislodges the US dollar from its decades-long dominance in global trade and finance. These technological advances could also become the ingredients for a \u201c synthetic hegemonic currency\u201d \u2014 a digital basket of reserve currencies \u2014 as recently proposed by outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney.\u00a0</p><p>While these are intriguing possibilities, they are improbable in the near term.\u00a0Improvements in payment technology may have lowered the cost of switching from cash to digital payments, but there is little evidence they have done much to reduce the expense of moving among currencies. Such costs are non-pecuniary. Widely-held perceptions of the dollar\u2019s safety and stability have kept it\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/gopinath/publications/banking-trade-and-making-dominant-currency\"> dominant</url> in the international monetary system for decades.\u00a0</p><p>The dollar holds strongly reinforcing roles in trade invoicing \u2014 it accounts for five times the US share of world trade \u2014 and global banking. These have created large network effects: the more people use the dollar, the more useful it becomes to everyone else. This has been reinforced as emerging markets, which rely extensively on the dollar, increase their share of global economic activity. Their share of global domestic product now stands at\u00a0 60 per cent.</p><p>Advances in payment technologies do not address fundamental issues of what it takes to be a global reserve currency. Consider the euro, which has been the leading contender to replace the dollar over the past 20 years. Its impact on the dollar\u2019s dominance has been modest at best, owing to financial fragmentation, inadequate fiscal risk-sharing, and slow progress on the euro area\u2019s governance framework. Uncertainty about the long-term stability of the eurozone does not help. It is difficult to imagine how technology would address these issues.</p><p>The dollar\u2019s status is bolstered by the institutions, rule of law, and credible investor protection that the US is seen as providing. Simply raising the supply of an alternative currency will not be enough to surmount these considerations. Chinese efforts to internationalise the renminbi have met only limited success despite a policy push and liquidity support through bilateral swaps with\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cfr.org/article/central-bank-currency-swaps-tracker\"> more than 30 central banks</url>.</p><p>When sovereign governments, investors, and traders are confronted with digital currency choices, they are likely to reassess what currency to use for transactions across borders. Their choice will be based on many of the same factors as in the past \u2014 liquidity, stability, convertibility \u2014 but also new concerns, such as the technological superiority of the issuing country. This latter issue could become a decisive factor, given legitimate concerns about privacy and security with digitised monies.\u00a0</p><p>Few sovereigns will meet such criteria. The US may\u00a0parlay its leadership in combating global money laundering and terrorism finance into making the dollar the dominant digital currency.\u00a0</p><p>Despite high hopes, it is difficult to see how technology can hasten the creation of a \u201csynthetic hegemonic currency\u201d. Trade and financial contracts continue to be denominated overwhelmingly in a single currency, rather than a basket of currencies. For such a public synthetic alternative to work, central banks, whose currencies underlay it, would have to co-ordinate to ensure its stability and reduce perceived risks. But global needs can conflict with monetary policy objectives at home, significantly reducing the attraction for leading reserve currencies to participate.\u00a0</p><p>Digital currencies issued by big tech firms would undoubtedly have some advantages relative to fiat currencies. Large-scale offerings such as China\u2019s WeChat Pay offer\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2019/09/19/digital-currencies-the-rise-of-stablecoins/\"> seamless integration</url> of multiple services on a single platform, combined with a low-cost and user-friendly payment system. Even so, the likelihood that one would give rise to a distinct unit of account disconnected from a fiat currency is remote, not least due to the complex\u00a0regulatory and jurisdictional issues involved.\u00a0</p><p>The international monetary system needs work. We need cheaper and faster cross-border payments: currently, settlement of cross-border remittances is slow, costly, and burdensome to those least able to afford it. Technology can bring quick gains here and improve financial inclusion. Recognising its potential and risks, the G20 has asked the IMF to look at the macroeconomic implications of global stablecoins.\u00a0</p><p>The world would also benefit from a more balanced system in which the euro and the renminbi have a bigger role. But technology cannot solve this problem alone. It takes old-fashioned development of institutions to improve the euro area\u2019s architecture and resilience, and stronger domestic institutions and further liberalisation of markets in China.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This piece expresses the author\u2019s personal views</emphasis></p><p>Letter in response to this article:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A global digital currency would put workers in a stronger position / From John Paris, Atlanta, GA, US</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-e5dd66b82ca011ea84bea548267b914b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXJ-SDX1-JB77-K554-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"920\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 7, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002F2B</classCode><className>BANK OF ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Following e-commerce talks launched in January  this year by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), various proposals for  the future of digital trade architecture were discussed this May.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What might a slate of new rules mean for digital development prospects, going forward? With 76 of 164<br/>WTO members participating, finding a middle ground between different <br/>development levels, along with degrees of complementary and conflicting <br/>interests, signal a long negotiating process.</p><p>State of Play</p><p>Current talks encompass both e-commerce (physical goods transactions <br/>online) and digital trade (data-heavy goods and services). Though <br/>broader consensus exists on e-commerce \u2014 whether in improving trade <br/>facilitation or helping micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) <br/>ride the e-commerce bandwagon \u2014 preferences for data governance models <br/>are more mixed.</p><p>Beyond gunning for greater privacy protection, the European Union<br/>(EU) advocates for free cross-border data flows, along with eliminating<br/>data localisation and forced source code surrender practices in a bid <br/>to protect intellectual property rights (IPR).</p><p>The United States<br/>(US), meanwhile, emphasises the same latter preferences, which would <br/>allow its technological corporations to continue expanding abroad and <br/>maintain their competitive edge in a progressively data-driven global <br/>economy.</p><p>Conversely, China has so far opted for a narrower focus<br/>on e-commerce in negotiations, favouring data localisation on security <br/>grounds and eschewing deeper commitments on cross-border data <br/>liberalisation.</p><p>Emerging Discourse</p><p>Collectively, these hard-line positions could delay the compromise <br/>necessary to alleviate future trade tensions. Opposition is likely if, <br/>for instance, Beijing drops out from ratifying most favoured nation <br/>(MFN) digital rules, as its digital behemoths can harness global data <br/>flows without offering reciprocal access.</p><p>Recent events also suggest an emerging discourse on viewing data <br/>governance through a development-focused lens. As concerns over <br/>technological hegemony and neo-colonialism fester, some developing <br/>countries question what the push for binding rules, such as on <br/>implementing unfettered cross-border data liberalisation, in premature <br/>digital landscapes might mean for their political economy.</p><p>For instance, various parties will argue over whether opening the <br/>data floodgates to Big Tech could detrimentally impact the development <br/>of local digital industry players who lack the same talent, capital and <br/>technological capabilities. WTO members like India have thus elected to <br/>abstain from negotiations, reducing the prospects of a more inclusive <br/>global digital economy.</p><p>Bigger Picture</p><p>Yet more than digital trade rules alone will impact development <br/>prospects. Strict one-size-fits-all IPR regimes, for example, <br/>simultaneously facilitate foreign direct investment (FDI) from digital <br/>multinational corporations but hamper technology diffusion and knowledge spill-overs for innovation.</p><p>Despite attempts to redesign the multilateral trade architecture that<br/>aim to contain China's ascent as a rising geo-technological competitor <br/>and align its state capitalism model with liberal market ideas, the <br/>adverse knock-on effects for developing countries cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The potential push for broad WTO reforms<br/>on industrial subsidies and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), for <br/>instance, could constrain the growth of nascent information <br/>communication technology (ICT) sectors and digital players to a <br/>market-ready stage. Vietnam's 5G network developer Viettel, for instance, would not have gotten off the ground without initial access to military-controlled finance.</p><p>Coupled with bilateral actions like Washington's export controls on <br/>Chinese technology firms, these proposals pose questions for the fate of<br/>the Digital Silk Road (DSR) and consequently, the digital development <br/>fortunes linked to the spread of Chinese technology.</p><p>Chinese SOEs and subsidised private actors like Huawei Marine have been increasingly involved<br/>in building and purchasing critical information infrastructure, such as<br/>submarine cables for faster data transmission. Huawei's 5G network <br/>offerings have also elicited greater interest among developing countries<br/>allegedly due to its subsidy-derived cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Without alternative options, such as a Digital Marshall Plan, <br/>climbing the rungs of the digital development ladder could become more <br/>challenging for countries and wider regions, such as in ASEAN which has <br/>been relatively receptive towards Huawei and the DSR so far.</p><p>Way Forward</p><p>Ultimately, institutions are comprised of its members. WTO member <br/>actions are hence critical to addressing concerns of inequality and <br/>economic power asymmetries both within and between countries in the <br/>digital age.</p><p>First, engaging in greater dialogue and capacity-building \u2014 whether <br/>at the WTO or complementary multilateral institutions, such as the G20's<br/>Osaka Track on global data governance \u2014 is pivotal to halt devolutions <br/>into protectionism. Abstaining from negotiations may send a message, but<br/>does not enrich nor realise difficult yet necessary conversations. <br/>Narrowing the development divide is also key; a lack of knowledge and <br/>capacity to compete could lead countries to opt for protectionism, an <br/>easier and politically expedient response.</p><p>Second, trade rules should be applied with flexibilities to enable <br/>public policy objectives\u2014 be it security, privacy, or development\u2014 <br/>though countries should abstain from using these goals as an aegis for <br/>protectionism. Given the WTO's diverse membership, blanket regulations <br/>are less viable than hammering out interoperable digital rules with <br/>agreed distinctions between non-tariff measures versus non-tariff <br/>barriers and acceptable responses towards trade-distorting digital <br/>practices.</p><p>Third, members should minimise the impact of geopolitics in derailing<br/>technology's potential in delivering development. While curbing <br/>trade-distorting practices is necessary to level the playing field, <br/>reforms can be done by using existing WTO rules rather than <br/>multilaterally or bilaterally changing the rules of the game. Current <br/>actions not only set risky precedents<br/>for rising powers, but alienate domestic reformist forces, inflame <br/>geopolitical tensions and may impinge upon pathways to digital <br/>prosperity.</p><p>This is a tall order for ongoing WTO negotiations, given the need to <br/>not only bridge insecurity between developed and developing countries, <br/>but also insecurity between proponents of different capitalisms and data<br/>governance rules \u2014 all of whom oppose the advantages each model bestows<br/>upon each other's economic players.</p><p>The alternative, however, is a world of deepening digital governance <br/>rifts and technological divides that undermine the continued, <br/>rules-based open exchange of ideas, labour, goods and services necessary<br/>to achieve inclusive development in a digital age. A valiant attempt to<br/>forge a multilateral digital trade consensus is thus not just the best <br/>option, but the only one.</p><p>*Amalina Anuar is a Research Analyst with the Centre for  Multilateralism Studies (CMS) at the S.

Grocers have remained largely immune to digital disruption-until recently. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Powerful trends, including new competitive pressures, technological advances, and evolving consumer attitudes and behaviors, will disrupt the grocery business from coast to coast in the next few years. Some grocers are learning from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/supercharging-retail-sales-through-geospatial-analytics\">other retail sectors</url>\u00a0and countries, recognizing threats early, seizing opportunities, and catching a wave of profitable growth. Others are struggling, and some may disappear. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Until relatively recently, the US grocery sector has remained sheltered from the forces of e-commerce for a couple of reasons: Most American shoppers still prefer to choose their own food (especially meat, produce, and other perishable goods), and few grocers have had the financial capacity to invest in the highly efficient, large-scale cold chains required to make home deliveries at a profit. That is changing. </p><p>While online sales accounted for anywhere from 3 to 4 percent of the US grocery market in 2019, the share could be greater than 10 percent by 2025 as major retailers-including well-funded entrants from outside the sector-invest in automation and innovative operating models to solve challenges in fulfillment and last-mile delivery. As quality rises and online grocers make more compelling offers, millions of shoppers will get comfortable offloading a task that only about 15 percent say they enjoy. We have seen that online grocery is supply driven, and as online grocers provide more supply, customers will adopt the new method of grocery shopping. </p><p>Grocers large and small should step back now and reevaluate their near- and long-term strategies. There is no time to waste. It took TV 13 years to reach 50 million users. The iPod took four years, Facebook took one year, and Twitter took nine months to hit that number. The speed of technology adoption has been startling some of the world's most successful companies since the 1990s-and it is accelerating faster than ever. Major grocery players, including traditional competitors (such as Kroger and Walmart), e-commerce giants (such as Amazon), and start-ups with venture-capital funding, are making the kinds of major investments and acquisitions-in customer-value proposition, customer experience, picking, and delivery-that herald an era of true transformation. </p><p>Many US grocers can and do actively look to other parts of the world for examples of how to be effective online. In fact, many of the technological innovations in this space come from outside of the United States, such as technological developments in pickup from Israel and Western Europe. There have also been a range of approaches to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-transport-and-logistics/our-insights/how-customer-demands-are-reshaping-last-mile-delivery\">last-mile delivery</url>. In the Netherlands, for example, Picnic provides customers with fixed delivery slots, backed by their milkman model and demonstrated to be able to reach up to 14 deliveries per hour. In China, Hema offers guaranteed delivery of both groceries and prepared meals in fewer than 30 minutes. We are also starting to see significant innovations in the omnichannel grocery-customer experience in several Asian markets (such as China and Japan). This isn't to say that there aren't home-grown US innovations happening-there most certainly are, especially on the gig delivery front-but the disruption in online grocery is a global phenomenon, and US grocers should look around the world for solutions to help inform their digital journeys.</p><p>We are following five powerful trends that will shape the industry's transformation in the United States. Understanding them could help grocers of all sizes chart a course to profitable growth in the new, much more competitive environment. </p><h>Trend 1: The fight is on</h><p>Until relatively recently, shoppers' grocery options were limited to what was available at their most convenient brick-and-mortar store. Today, tens of millions of Americans can shop for groceries online, where their options include curbside pickup and home delivery. Many formidable players are now competing for e-grocery dominance.</p><p>Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods Market in 2017 gave the e-commerce giant new credibility in fresh grocery and allowed the expansion of immediate Amazon Fresh service to new markets. Instacart, which launched in 2012, has expanded rapidly and can reach more than 80 percent of US households. In response, many traditional grocers are rapidly expanding their online operations (Exhibit 1). For example, Walmart has been expanding its online-order offering, with same-day delivery from 1,600 stores and pickup from 3,100 locations as of November 2019. Kroger has expanded its pickup locations for online orders to 1,900 locations and offers delivery of online-ordered groceries from 2,300 locations.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Retail/Our Insights/Digital disruption at the grocery store/SVGZ-DigitalDisruptionGrocery-Ex1.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>Many grocers are also thinking about more ways to gain \"share of stomach,\" such as by offering ready-to-heat and ready-to-eat meals, in-store restaurants, meal kits, and even vending machines for fresh products. Some are expanding into adjacencies, such as household products or health and wellness items, that provide more opportunity for growth and customer delight. Almost all are looking for new ways to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/power-partnerships-manufacturer-retailer-collaborations-that-work\">partner with consumer-packaged-goods companies</url>\u00a0to engage more deeply with customers. </p><p>Given that the majority of large grocers have already developed some form of an e-commerce offering, new entrants have clear disadvantages, including a lack of brand equity and scale compared with traditional grocers. However, they tend to have more strategic agility, cultures of innovation, and white space. Such features provide opportunities to craft value propositions for the customer of the future without sacrificing the customer of today. </p><p>Some larger and more traditional grocers may resist transformative innovation in the shopping experience as they maintain their focus on the preferences and demands of their current core customer base. A recent example is when Trader Joe's discontinued its delivery services in New York City, citing already close proximity to customers and an unwillingness to pass on delivery costs to customers. </p><h>Trend 2: Early movers have advantages</h><p>The grocery market is supply driven, and consumers don't yet know what they want. Like grocers, shoppers can't predict exactly what the future will bring. Not surprisingly, most first-time online customers expect to get their groceries more seamlessly than when going to the store themselves. But many can't imagine all the options digital grocers might offer. </p><p>Indeed, the offerings themselves are now shaping customer expectations about each element of the experience, including the type and speed of service-which will evolve as quickly as the offers do. Recall, for example, Amazon Prime's introduction of free two-day shipping. Customers may not have been clamoring for it, but it has transformed their expectations across a broad range of industries. Nontraditional grocery players, such as Amazon and Instacart, are now shaping the market in a similar way-for example, by offering immediate grocery-delivery service in major metropolitan areas across the United States. Recently, Walmart announced free one-day delivery. </p><p>Other changes also seem to be taking hold: </p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Order tracking and delivery-slot notification.</emphasis> Instacart has raised the bar for communication, offering driver-to-customer updates and committing to specific delivery windows to reduce the time customers must wait at home for orders.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Expanded assortment.</emphasis> As the lines between digital- and physical-shopping experiences blur, so do the lines between general retailers and grocers. Many customers are seeking the convenience of ordering everything they need, whenever they need it, from a single platform in a single order. </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Online and in-store price parity.</emphasis> Many grocers have been able to charge a premium price for online-basket items, but we may see a push toward a more transparent pricing model. While many retailers have used online price-matching policies, the jury is out on whether the reciprocal will hold. Currently, Walmart does not match in-store prices, while Target does. </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Low per-order fees and attractive subscription models. </emphasis>With the influx of competition into the market, customers can take advantage of various offers, including percentage-off promo codes and free delivery on the first order, at sign-up. To retain customers, these promos may transform into everyday low fees.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>While convenience attracts most first-time customers to online ordering, it may not keep them coming back. Some regular online grocery shoppers are citing a pain point of falling into a \"grocery rut\" because of automated ordering of the same basket again and again. Some miss the sensory experience of shopping in person and feel that they miss out on discovering new ingredients, different meal ideas, and good values. Others may grow frustrated with the glitches that come with new convenience offerings: out-of-stock issues, incorrect or missing items, and general lackluster service. However, we are already beginning to see leaders in service quality, with Walmart's grocery pickup resulting in 63 percent customer satisfaction, a considerable amount higher than the industry average of 56 percent.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>We believe the winners in e-grocery will be those that deliver a great and consistent customer experience the fastest.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>We believe the winners in e-grocery will be those that deliver a great and consistent customer experience the fastest. They will give customers the sense of discovery, exploration, and inspiration they seek from any grocer, whether in a physical or virtual environment. Whichever player discovers and delivers the optimal customer experience first will be the incumbent. Some believe this means offering the most seamless click-and-collect experience, while others believe this means offering the fastest delivery. It remains to be seen which experience US consumers value the most, but it is certain that they will reward consistency. </p><h>Trend 3: Scale matters</h><p>Demand density-or orders per square mile-in the United States is significantly lower than it is in European countries, particularly the United Kingdom, which has long been at the forefront of online grocery. The relatively low e-grocery penetration of the United States (around 3 to 4 percent versus around 7 percent in the United Kingdom), coupled with lower population density, creates a significant challenge for grocers and rewards those that have scale. Making matters more challenging, customer demand is fragmented between delivery and pickup, and various delivery speeds each require a different last-mile model.</p><p>Where demand density is low and demand is fragmented, investments in large fulfillment centers, delivery fleets, and drivers are hard to justify. It can be impossible to cover the costs without adequate demand within the serviceable radius. Recognizing the challenges, some major grocers are using their stores as fulfillment centers, getting more value from existing assets rather than making new investments (Exhibit 2). After Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market, for example, it announced that it would fill orders from Whole Foods Market stores. Target and Walmart now offer e-commerce fulfillment at store locations and last-mile delivery through the acquisition of Shipt and a partnership with Postmates, respectively. They are also finding that integrating e-commerce fulfillment and retail-store operations can improve employee utilization, since staff can fulfill electronic orders when in-store customer traffic is low. </p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Retail/Our Insights/Digital disruption at the grocery store/SVGZ-DigitalDisruptionGrocery-Ex2.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>Some large grocers, using their geographic proximity to customers, have tried to tap into the new gig-delivery world by using Postmates or the now-defunct UberRUSH. How that plays out remains to be seen, especially given the open questions, such as whether third parties will maintain food-safety standards, protect the retailer from reputational risks, and keep prices low if the gig economy matures or venture funding decelerates. Some grocers may join forces with noncompeting retailers (such as hard- and soft-goods players) to create, inorganically, delivery ecosystems that rival Amazon. Pooling the demand of various grocery and nongrocery offerings could become a viable way to keep last-mile-delivery costs down and compete with large ecosystems.</p><p>The demand-density challenge will become less of an issue as e-commerce operations achieve scale, through either market penetration or dominance, and a move to more centralized fulfillment models will make financial sense in more locations.</p><h>Trend 4: Economics improve with automation innovation</h><p>The two pillars of e-commerce fulfillment-picking and last-mile delivery-add significant operating costs to an already low-margin business, so we expect large grocers to turn to automation and robotics. Technology advancements could help level the playing field, but you need scale and demand density to justify the heavy up-front investment.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/automation-in-retail-an-executive-overview-for-getting-ready\">Picking automation </url>is already well under way. Amazon purchased Kiva Systems for picking-center robotics. Ocado has automated grocery-fulfillment centers in the United Kingdom and partnered with Sobeys and Kroger to automate picking centers in Canada and the United States, respectively. Kroger has also forged a partnership with Cimcorp to bring an automated storage-and-picking system to its dairy facilities. </p><p>Automation is also coming to last-mile delivery. The dawn of driverless-vehicle and drone deliveries will scale only after regulations are in place. These technologies are also hindered by a need for the recipient to be home at the scheduled time of delivery. That said, they are evolving rapidly, driven by start-ups and old-school players, such as auto manufacturers-autonomous Ford vehicles are already delivering Domino's pizza in Miami, for example. Here, too, adoption speeds may exceed expectations by wide margins. </p><h>Trend 5: The talent gap is a major bottleneck</h><p>Nearly every major industry, from insurance to mining, is struggling to recruit and retain digital talent, given that demand currently outpaces supply. Large tech companies and hot start-ups continue to have the first pick of data scientists, tech engineers, robotics and artificial-intelligence experts, scrum masters, full-stack architects, and a host of other technical specialists. </p><p>We believe that is a major issue, since <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-analytics-and-digital-will-drive-next-generation-retail-merchandising\">digital talent </url>may be the single most important determinant of a company's likelihood to succeed in the grocery market in the next few years. Any strong talent strategy begins with retaining and training existing talent, of course, as well as uncovering latent talent already in the business. But to compete with the recruiting capabilities of large technology companies, grocers should take several additional steps: </p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hire a chief digital officer or the equivalent.</emphasis> A chief digital officer's vision and business and technical knowledge can lead a digital transformation across an organization. </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Form positions for data scientists, tech engineers, and other experts. </emphasis>These are critical roles that will create value.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Develop a clear digital strategy. </emphasis>A digital strategy at the core of the overall business strategy is key.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Break out from the rest of the organization and rethink location strategies where required. </emphasis>This type of transformational reorganization-a powerful signal that real change is under way-can help attract talent.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Reconsider traditional recruiting practices and look beyond brand-name universities.</emphasis> Innovative recruiting activities-for example, by hosting \"hackathons\"-can help attract digital talent. Local colleges may be producing superb graduates who would like to stay close to home, providing a rich talent resource.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Offer more of the benefits millennials seek.</emphasis> Millennials look for offerings such as development opportunities, extra flexibility, telework, and-perhaps most of all-a sense of meaning and purpose. </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Create an innovative environment.</emphasis> A culture that rivals those of the big tech companies and the smallest start-ups includes an openness to risk taking, team-based ideation and solution building, clear career paths, and compelling performance recognition.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Prepare to pay market rates and reward employees for attracting talent. </emphasis>Attracting and retaining top talent will require grocers to offer competitive and compelling pay and incentives.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>What will it take to win in e-grocery?</h><p>Online grocery on its own is not new news to retailers and the broader consumer community, but the current pace of investment and innovation is unprecedented. We believe that this will continue to be a supply-driven market, meaning that the actions retailers and other players in the grocery ecosystem take now will define what the industry becomes going forward. Consumer expectations are higher than they were even a year ago, but they are still being set. Here are a few suggestions for leaders striving to win in e-grocery:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Set an aspirational vision for your customer proposition using a data-driven fact base. </emphasis>Determine the core elements and differentiators of your omnichannel grocery offering and root them in a customer promise that you are prepared to deliver (such as fee structures, pricing models, and assortment choices). Leverage techniques such as conjoint analysis and ethnographic research to inform the value proposition.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Build a robust demand-forecasting model for your current and future markets.</emphasis> Project market demand for your trade areas and forecast your potential share. Geospatial-analytics techniques should inform your demand modeling and your optimal mix of click-and-collect versus delivery offerings.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Determine your optimal fulfillment model, which is likely to be bimodal.</emphasis> Explore the range of picking technologies available in the market and choose one or more that best suit your customer proposition and demand economics. Perform the same analyses when choosing delivery speeds and transportation models.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Design your tech stack and prepare your IT systems. </emphasis>Build the IT plan that underlies each element of the customer proposition and select which vendors you will work with (most grocers won't have this capability on their own). Having a flexible technology stack that supports an agile operating model is key.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Modify your organization and operating model to embed digital at the core. </emphasis>Align on a reporting structure for the e-commerce team (for example, using omnichannel or separate merchants and having dedicated or pooled labor in stores) and agree on decision rights and ways of working. Robust human-capital and talent plans and strategies will be necessary.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>About the authors</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steven Begley</emphasis> is a partner in McKinsey's New Jersey office, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Eric Marohn</emphasis> is a consultant in the Chicago office, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sabah Mikha </emphasis>is a consultant in the Southern California office, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=88C6837B6933414596533C0E1F21A5C4&amp;_z=z\">Aaron Rettaliata</url></emphasis> is a partner in the Pittsburgh office.</p><p>The authors wish to thank Katie Ragan for her contributions to this article.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCKNSY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCKNSY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6V-G6W1-JB24-R2XG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470364</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3170\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 McKinsey &amp;

Driving the news: The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is set to soon replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), significantly modernizes rules[1] around intellectual property (IP), like digital music rights, movies e-books. It requires strong standards against parties that seek to circumvent protection measures that are used often to protect that type of content.It also includes a provision that provides legal protection to tech platforms for the third-party content that they host or process on their platforms, a provision that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi fought hard[2] to leave out. In the digital news publishing business, global copyright provisions are trying to tackle compensation to publishers for the distribution of their content. </p><p>In Europe, the European Parliament in March approved[3] a copyright directive that includes a provision to force tech platforms to pay publishers for their content. In October, France became the first member state to ratify the law. Shortly after, French policymakers accused[4] Google of undermining the rules and said it would sanction Google for using tactics to avoid paying publishers on Google News. Google has argued[5] that restrictive copyright rules being proposed by the EU, similar to those that passed in Spain in 2014, would hurt small publishers. There have been examples of this argument[6] being made by smaller publishers themselves. In the U.S., a prominent newspaper trade group, The News Media Alliance (NMA), is also trying to pressure Google to pay publishers. A report[7] last month from the News Media Alliance (NMA) challenged Google's finding that traffic to Spanish publishers plummeted after Google News shut down in Spain in 2014. The group's CEO, David Chavern, said in an interview with Axios that Google is using this narrative to lobby against future copyright rules in other countries that would require them to pay out publishers.Google points to a survey that suggests that traffic to Spanish publishers plummeted in the immediate aftermath of its exit from the Spanish market. But Cedro, a Spanish non-profit association that collects and distributes payments to publishers from distributors, commissioned its own studies and found that Google's departure from Spain was \"non significant for the top 20 newspapers,\" but varied for smaller publications. In an interview with Axios, Cedro CEO Jorge Corrales said news traffic has migrated instead towards two news aggregators that pay publishers. \"The intellectual property rules haven't stopped the development of these companies ... It's an example of a project done right with IP rights of content owners in mind.\" In Australia, the digital platforms arm within the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission last week put tech companies on notice[8] if they're unable to address power imbalances with media companies. Google says in a statement to Axios that it's engaged closely with Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.Meanwhile, Google has been fighting many copyright rules around the world that it considers to be too broad. In the music industry, Google-owned YouTube last year set up one of its most aggressive[9] consumer-facing lobbying efforts ever to fight Europe's new copyright directive. The directive passed alongside the rule that forces Google to pay publishers in Europe. Currently in the U.S., copyrightlaws favor distributors of music over owners of music rights. They place the burden on rights holders to track down infringing material file by file and send take-down notices. Content creators say this precedent has led to a game of whack-a-mole, becausenew files just pop up immediately. What's next: The Copyright Office is reviewing the issue and is soon expected to issue a report on some of the problems.Groups that represent content creators would like to see some incentive for the tech companies to work with rights holders to come up with a voluntary solution to better police for copyrighted material. The other side: Some legal scholars[10] and activists[11] feel instead that the U.S. copyright regime is too protective of corporate ownership at the expense of fair use and public access to works, pointing to Congress' repeated extension of the copyright term[12].The bottom line: The power pendulum is slowly swinging back to owners of intellectual property, but many content owners still have to fight to make money from the distribution of their work online.

BUT TAPPING INTO THE FULL POTENTIAL COMES AT A PRICE.</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline>By Gary Dretzka, Tribune Staff Writer.</nitf:byline><nitf:dateline>LAS VEGAS</nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital television has been getting all the press, but several big tech players--including Motorola Inc. and Lucent Technologies--see a new future for the old medium of radio.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Right now, digital audio broadcasting is a blip on the radar screen of the consumer electronics industry, but it was a hot topic at this spring's convention of the National Association of Broadcasters.</p><p>The FCC probably will decide within the next year which transmission standard it will adopt, just as it is likely to decide whether to boost the number of low-power stations available to listeners across the nation. Meanwhile, the Internet has become a leading supplier of radio signals, providing far-flung audiences with new independent channels and digital transmission of a slew of existing stations.</p><p>Locally, over-the-air broadcasting soon will begin undergoing enormous changes.</p><p>In underserved markets, low-power stations could be allowed to hunt with the big dogs. The FCC seems ready to grant licenses to new entities, if only to inspire competition in an increasingly consolidated marketplace.</p><p>The biggest problem, established broadcasters say, is that the low-power signals could interfere with those of existing stations, and these entities would face less regulation. In cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, frequency spectrum already is almost filled to overflowing, so it isn't likely that many new stations could be added.</p><p>Just as in the television industry, however, the most revolutionary aspect of digital transmission comes in the expanded options available both to stations and listeners.</p><p>There is some bad news here, however, in that consumers will have to buy a new set if they want to experience the full robustness of a digital AM and FM signal. Blessedly, it won't cost as much as an high-definition TV set, and the channel numbers will remain the same.</p><p>\"Existing receivers will work in the system, because, for a period of time, we will continue to broadcast in analog,\" explained William J. Casey, director of marketing and sales for Lucent Digital Radio, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lucent Technologies. \"The stations want to do it because it increases fidelity for the consumer; there would be the ability to license or rent out that space on the sideband to data providers, and it is an opportunity to provide and enhance public service, such as emergency broadcasts.</p><p>\"For example, with the digital signal, if, there's a tornado, a transmitter can send a signal out to a digital radio and literally wake it up. . . . It turns the radio on at a high volume and issues a warning.\"</p><p>Last week, Lucent said it had successfully tested its In-Band On-Channel Digital Audio Broadcast system in live broadcasts with National Public Radio member station WBJB-FM in Lincroft, N.J.Lucent said there was no degradation of the host FM analog channel during the transmission of the digital FM signal over the same band.</p><p>Suren Pai, subsidiary president, said testing will continue in 1999 and the technology should be commercially available next year.</p><p>Said David Bickle, public relations manager for Lucent's New Ventures Group, \"FM will have a near-CD-quality sound, and AM will sound like FM does today. At the same time, you'll have the ability to receive data over the digital signal.</p><p>\"A radio probably will have a video display, which could show the name of the artist, the name of the song, local traffic or weather.\"</p><p>Casey estimates that a digital car radio might cost $100 more than a comparable existing unit, depending on the extra services provided.</p><p>But, as Ron Rodrigues, editor of Radio &amp; Records magazine, notes, we're not too far from seeing the day when wireless communications will allow car radios to browse the Internet for commercial-free or distant Web stations, and receive data on a dashboard screen.</p><p>Listening to radio over the Internet, at home or at work, is a growing phenomenon. \"It's been a big issue for the last year, especially after Arbitron came out with statistics showing that something like 16 percent to 27 percent of computer users are listening to audio on their computers and the Internet,\" said Rodrigues.</p><p>What's happening, observes E. Van Cullens, president of Harris Corp., a leading supplier of products and systems for the broadcast market, is, \"You're seeing that long-awaited, much-touted, overhyped convergence of voice, data and video, and you're going to see bigger companies starting to straddle those markets, because you now have the technology to actually intermix these things. Everybody's going to end up in the same place, because a bit is a bit is a bit, and once you get it digital, it becomes a software game.\"</p><p>On the Internet, of course, radio suddenly can become a visual, interactive medium. It also can begin to stream data.</p><p>Besides music or talk programming, a station's Web site can offer an advertiser a direct sales path to listeners through computerized links to the company. Similarly, it can create new advertising inventory for its national and international clients, because a station can sell both local and distant spots.</p><p>\"I may be working on a spreadsheet at my office, and, on my Internet radio, I hear a commercial for Minute Rice, in which they're providing a recipe,\" said Michael Fisher, a sales representative for RadioWave.com Inc., a subsidiary of Schaumburg-based Motorola. \"So I can maximize my screen and go to the company's Web site, pull up the recipe, print it and cook it tonight. Or, I could order some clothes for my kids from the Spiegel catalog, or get an on-line quote from an insurance company.</p><p>\"When a sales guy goes out and tries to sell a commercial, he can offer a company a $100 spot on the radio station, or a $120 commercial that also goes out on the Internet. Right now, we're simulcasting, but, when you get enough listeners on the Internet, you'll have the opportunity to sell one commercial to (age) 25-to-54 women in one market and a different one to men--or, if the sponsor doesn't want to spend the extra $20, you can insert a national ad for a different company.\"</p><p>The RadioWave.com player software can be downloaded from the Internet or installed from a CD-ROM. It allows access to about 90 of the 2,000 stations on the Web. Others are available through companies such as RealNetworks Inc., Onradio.com and Broadcast.com.</p><p>Add to this MP3, a format that not only would compete with radio, but record stores as well.</p><p>Recently, both RealNetworks and Microsoft announced their intention to deliver music to consumers directly through the Internet.</p><p>Using software from RealJukeBox, PC-owners can download encoded music from the Web in RealAudio or the MP3 format. They also can use it to record their own compact discs--this time with the blessing of record companies that have partnered with RealNetworks.</p><p>Microsoft had earlier unveiled its own format, MS Audio, in an elaborate presentation at the House of Blues in Los Angeles.</p><p>From this distance, the future of digital radio and audio delivery of music may seem confusing and more than a bit daunting. But, if nothing else, the cacophony of new ideas and products is coming through with much less static.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Business.

Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter announced a new tool called \u2018hash\u2019 to mark extremist content to delete it, sharing the database among big companies starting next year. The move came amid criticism from authorities in the United States and Europe to these companies that they\u2019re not \u2018doing enough\u2019 to fight extremism on the internet and social media platforms in particular. The European Commission threatened to toughen rules, so the big technology companies said they\u2019re developing a new way of tackling terrorist content on the internet.</p><p>That\u2019s not the first time that a Big Tech vow has been made to fight \u2018Digital Terrorism\u2019 and there\u2019s no guarantee that this new step will do more to eradicate extremist content from the world wide web. Though the companies said this new way of \u2018labelling\u2019 extremist content with a water mark and sharing the information about it with others, creating a database for such content, should help clear the web of such content. Sophisticated algorithms, specific key-words and all other monitoring tools were circumvented by extremist and terrorist \u2018electronic army\u2019 before. You don\u2019t need to be a \u201ctech geek\u201d to know how all these measures of post-moderation of the internet activities are not effective. Meanwhile, it\u2019s almost impossible to pre-moderate such activities. The problem is further exaggerated for social media platforms, as the main essence of it is to be completely free. The main source of revenue for these platforms is dependent on figures of user numbers. Anything that might stop the growth of traffic, not to mention reducing it, will adversely affect revenues and thus the market value of these platforms.</p><p>Though some countries have put a lot of effort in regulating the internet, developing laws and policing procedures to combat cybercrime, it\u2019s still far from protected in that regard. Yes, such legislations might apply to extremist and terrorist activities on the web, but the problem is always the difficulty to punish those committing such acts and therefore deterring others. Even with the most strict laws and regulations, those extremists and terrorists will develop ways to go round it. So we\u2019re only left with \u2018reactive\u2019 measures regardless of their effectiveness. Argument of the big internet companies is that they provide tools for all to use and policing this usage is beyond their means. When these companies are accused with \u201cnot doing enough\u201d to fight extremism and terrorism they can easily argue that \u201cenough\u201d is difficult to define. Yet, they need to do more and thus came this latest step mainly to appease authorities with no guarantee that the end-goal will be achieved.</p><p>A recent example is the flurry about fake news on social media related to US presidential elections. When Facebook responded to accusations by developing means to delete news that looked like fabricated, it ended inadvertently hurting mainstream media. Most respected media outlets suffered in last few weeks as their traffic dropped due to sharp reduction in referrals from their Facebook pages. What happened is that Facebook was deleting posts of their stories, while fake news from bogus accounts continued to pour into the platform. That\u2019s almost like the big world powers\u2019 campaign to eradicate Daesh (the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) in the so-called \u201cwar on terror\u201d that started more than a couple of years ago. Billions of dollars, thousands of air raids, numerous meetings and training sessions and wars against few thousands of terrorists have still not been able to destroy Daesh. Unfortunately, Daesh is still dominating swaths of Syria and Iraq and gaining allegiance of terrorist groups in Libya, Yemen, Nigeria and elsewhere. It might be right to question whether this war on terror is defeating terrorism or strengthening it!</p><p>Digital fight against terrorism may prove not much different from the military fight against it. While devising measures to eradicate extremist and terrorist content from the internet, it might end up deleting proper content instead. Moreover, that digital war on terror is more difficult as most of the extremist and terrorist content is religion-sensitive content. Fear of discrimination and backlash by a huge population of a certain religion may be a constraint. Actually, some of the content that may look \u201cbenign religious content\u201d could be worth targeting as well but internet companies won\u2019t risk losing millions of users in this region.</p><p>Under the circumstances, the war on terror can be won, but it seems there\u2019s not enough will to go a further mile. Simply, how come the whole world can\u2019t face a few thousands of terrorists and defeat them?</p><p>Dr Ahmed Mustafa is an Abu Dhabi-based journalist.</p><p>- Ban Ki-moon - Dr Ramzy Baroud - Abdulkhaleq Abdulla Al Nisr Publishing LLC 2016.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/78/148190409498.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/78/148190409498.jpg</url></p><p>Array<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-83442754</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MDD-DXF1-F11P-X4HK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"856\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

The more tech-oriented Nasdaq 100 index climbed more than 700 per cent over the same period.</p><p>This stretched valuations. A key measure of that - the ratio between the Nasdaq 100 companies'share prices and expected earnings - rose to more than 25 at the start of this year, against a 10-year average of 19, according to S&amp;;P Capital IQ figures. Many analysts expected the stocks to fall back to earth when the next downturn came.</p><p>Instead, the sector has reasserted its dominance in the coronavirus era, with the Nasdaq 100 climbing 15 per cent in April to end up back in positive territory for the year. The price-to-earnings ratio has now stretched towards 28 as earnings have slumped but stocks have rebounded.</p><p>\"It was a narrow bull market driven mainly by one sector, and typically this is the sector that is sold the hardest when it ends,\" says Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, and one of many analysts who thought the era of tech stock supremacy would end. \"But what is interesting is how tech-friendly this recession has been.\"</p><p>With millions cooped up at home, companies like online retailing giant Amazon and internet streaming service Netflix are clear winners. They are both up about 30 per cent so far this year.</p><p>Zoom, the video conferencing company, is another victor, doubling in value in 2020. Microsoft, which has also benefited from the video-calling boom, is up more than 10 per cent. Google, Apple and Facebook are also now roughly flat for the year, after each falling more than 30 per cent from the February highs.</p><p>This is part of a broader trend of stronger, less indebted companies doing well, as investors fret over the impact of an economic lockdown. Talk of introducing stricter regulations around privacy and concerns about digital monopolies have also faded from the political agenda as the coronavirus crisis dominates. This has added to the tech sector's tailwinds.</p><p>As a result, the five biggest constituents of the S&amp;;P 500 - Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google's parent Alphabet and Facebook - now account for a fifth of the entire index's market capitalization. That is a modern-day record in terms of concentration, Goldman Sachs notes, and comes with potential risk for investors.</p><p>\"Narrow breadth can last for extended periods, but past episodes have signalled below-average market returns and eventual momentum reversals,\" David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist, warned this week.</p><p>He admits to sharing the \"incredulity\" of many investors that the S&amp;;P 500 is now just 14 per cent below its all-time high, despite the biggest economic shock in a century, but calculates that the median stock in the index is still about 28 per cent below its high.</p><p>Typically, such narrow rallies end either when investors crowd into the market leaders but fail to justify their inflated valuations, or when an improving economic outlook helps laggards catch up. Increasingly, it is looking like investors are betting on the former outcome.</p><p>The April rally has also been helped by a huge comeback from beaten-up energy stocks, as investors have bet that some of the gloom surrounding the industry is overdone. Despite U.S. oil prices briefly plunging into negative territory last month, energy is the best-performing sector of the U.S. equity market this month, up about 30 per cent.</p><p>European stocks have also bounced back since the worst of the sell-off, but the Stoxx 600 index rose just 6 per cent in April, and remains down 18 per cent for the year.</p><p>The lack of big technology stocks in the region has been a drag, but index heavyweights such as L'Or\u00e9al and Nestl\u00e9 are now nearly flat for the year, having weathered the early part of the crisis. Healthcare company Roche has gained 8 per cent thanks to its testing expertise.</p><p>In Asia, the Chinese \"Bat\" stocks - the local equivalent of the FANG stocks - have been more of a mixed bag. Search engine Baidu is still down 20 per cent this year, after an advertising drought hit sales, while online retailer Alibaba is down just 6 per cent and Tencent's thriving online gaming platform has helped its stock erase its March losses to climb 11 per cent this year.</p><p>Some of the coronavirus-era stock market winners are likely to stay buoyant once the crisis recedes, as the outbreak accelerates existing trends such as online streaming and shopping. But in some cases analysts say high valuations will be a risk if growth fails to justify investors' faith.</p><p>Yet the biggest question is whether the global stock market rally is sustainable, or merely a temporary - if powerful - bounce, engineered by central bank and government stimulus packages that will fade as the virus's economic destruction hits.</p><p>\"Many promising bear rallies fizzle as the initial euphoria clears and the grim realities of underlying fundamentals come to the fore,\" said Andrew Lapthorne, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.</p><p>Financial Times !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

It concerned attacks on it from outside. A devastating report from a Commons committee looking at disinformation highlighted the threat posed by unregulated political advertising. It lambasted the big tech companies as \"digital gangsters\" for their greedy collusion in this.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Another report, by the Royal United Services Institute, showed how the Chinese authorities systematically control foreign academic and media discussion and turn economic ties to their political advantage. If you think you live in a free country, ask when your rulers last spoke out bluntly on topics such as Taiwan and Tibet.</p><p>The combination of foreign interference and technological change threatens to overturn our political system. How can we have a fair election when unlimited money from murky sources - including foreign ones - can pay for secret messages that most voters never see? That is what Facebook enabled in the Brexit referendum. How can we deal sensibly with the world's second-biggest economy if our discussions and actions are constrained by greed for its money? Read Charles Parton's report for Rusi. That is what is happening with China, right now.</p><p>Showing exemplary bipartisan spirit - perhaps more effectively than the much talked-about new group of independent-minded rebels - the MPs in the digital, culture, media and sport committee have pushed ahead with their inquiry into disinformation (originally conceived under the misleading label of \"Fake News\"). The committee, chaired by Damian Collins, collaborated with lawmakers from a dozen other countries to convene an international grand committee into digital threats to democracy last November in London. Facebook, for the third time, refused to send its top brass. An amiable but ill-informed PR man parried questions with obfuscation and prevarication. The message from the feudal overlord of the digital economy was clear: we serfs should know our place.</p><p>The final report of the MPs' inquiry makes blistering reading. Facebook puts profits ahead of users' privacy, their security and the health of democracy. It uses its market dominance to crush rivals. It obstructs outside scrutiny and apologises (feebly) only when caught. The committee also used an ingenious legal dodge to seize damning internal Facebook emails that were sealed evidence in a US lawsuit. Anyone tempted to join in the fashionable disdain for our politicians and politics should reflect on the vigour and initiative shown by this committee. We should all also consider its recommendations for the defence of democracy. One is that our electoral law is no longer fit for purpose. In my youth I spent a lot of time fighting elections. Every scrap of paper seen by the electorate had an \"imprint\", giving the election agent's name and address. \"Treating\" - giving even the most modest refreshments to a potential voter - was a serious breach of the law.</p><p>Spending was meticulously recorded.</p><p>Cynical behaviour by political parties has rendered these rules threadbare in the offline world. But in the cyber realm they flap uselessly in the wind. The frictionless anonymity of the internet makes it easy to conceal the funding, source and content of election material. Adverts can be micro-targeted to appeal to tiny groups of voters, exploiting the most private quirks, hopes and fears harvested from their previous online activity. As nobody else sees this material, any contradictory, false or inflammatory claims can escape public scrutiny.</p><p>Most of the tools we need to fix this are to hand. We can apply antimonopoly rules to the tech giants. A government report on digital competition by Jason Furman, a US economist, is due out shortly. We also need better regulation of their activities, balancing free expression, privacy and innovation with public safety. A white paper on \"digital harms\" is due out next month. Let us hope neither launch coincides with news about Brexit. But we are not short of reports. We are short of action. We urgently need a judge-led inquiry into foreign interference in our politics, in particular during the Brexit and Scottish independence referendums, and the 2017 general election. Mr Collins's report raises startling questions about foreign influence, disinformation, funding, voter manipulation and data sharing. The contemptuous responses to his committee's questions from some, such as the Brexit donor Arron Banks and the Vote Leave campaigner Dominic Cummings, only heighten concern.</p><p>This goes far beyond the scope of the ongoing inquiry by the underpowered Information Commissioner's Office. The investigation should have the authorisation and clearance needed to see the sizzlingly significant material gathered by our intelligence agencies - ie as far as possible, the scope and clout of Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. It might find some overlap.</p><p>The biggest questions concern the future. Social media platforms run by tech giants are easy to regulate compared with encrypted messaging applications that may have no real owner. Artificial intelligence (such as phone canvassing by human-seeming robots) will transform electioneering. The danger is of a digital Eatanswill - the farcically corrupt and unfair election depicted by Charles Dickens in the Pickwick Papers. But the joke will be on us - and the punchline written in Chinese.</p><p>A digital Eatanswill looms but the joke will be on us - in Chinese</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-146790665</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VH5-3S51-DYTY-C4R9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"919\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Spending was meticulously recorded.</p><p>Cynical behaviour by political parties has rendered these rules threadbare in the offline world. But in the cyber realm they flap uselessly in the wind. The frictionless anonymity of the internet makes it easy to conceal the funding, source and content of election material. Adverts can be micro-targeted to appeal to tiny groups of voters, exploiting the most private quirks, hopes and fears harvested from their previous online activity. As nobody else sees this material, any contradictory, false or inflammatory claims can escape public scrutiny.</p><p>Most of the tools we need to fix this are to hand. We can apply anti-monopoly rules to the tech giants. A government report on digital competition by Jason Furman, a US economist, is due out shortly. We also need better regulation of their activities, balancing free expression, privacy and innovation with public safety. A white paper on \"digital harms\" is due out next month. Let us hope neither launch coincides with news about Brexit.</p><p>But we are not short of reports. We are short of action. We urgently need a judge-led inquiry into foreign interference in our politics, in particular during the Brexit and Scottish independence referendums, and the 2017 general election. Mr Collins's report raises startling questions about foreign influence, disinformation, funding, voter manipulation and data sharing. The contemptuous responses to his committee's questions from some, such as the Brexit donor Arron Banks and the Vote Leave campaigner Dominic Cummings, only heighten concern.</p><p>This goes far beyond the scope of the ongoing inquiry by the underpowered Information Commissioner's Office. The investigation should have the authorisation and clearance needed to see the sizzlingly significant material gathered by our intelligence agencies - with, as far as possible, the scope and clout of Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. It might find some overlap.</p><p>The biggest questions concern the future. Social media platforms run by tech giants are easy to regulate compared with encrypted messaging applications that may have no real owner. Artificial intelligence (such as phone canvassing by human-seeming robots) will transform electioneering. The danger is of a digital Eatanswill - the farcically corrupt and unfair election depicted by Charles Dickens in the Pickwick Papers. But the joke will be on us - and the punchline written in Chinese.</p><p>                   @edwardlucas                   @edwardlucas                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-52040946</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VH4-B231-JCJY-G077-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"922\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

It concerned attacks on it from outside. A devastating report from a Commons committee looking at disinformation highlighted the threat posed by unregulated political advertising. It lambasted the big tech companies as \"digital gangsters\" for their greedy collusion in this.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Another report, by the Royal United Services Institute, showed how the Chinese authorities systematically control foreign academic and media discussion and turn economic ties to their political advantage. If you think you live in a free country, ask when your rulers last spoke out bluntly on topics such as Taiwan and Tibet.</p><p>The combination of foreign interference and technological change threatens to overturn our political system. How can we have a fair election when unlimited money from murky sources - including foreign ones - can pay for secret messages that most voters never see? That is what Facebook enabled in the Brexit referendum. How can we deal sensibly with the world's second-biggest economy if our discussions and actions are constrained by greed for its money? Read Charles Parton's report for Rusi. That is what is happening with China, right now.</p><p>Showing exemplary bipartisan spirit - perhaps more effectively than the much talked-about new group of independent-minded rebels - the MPs in the digital, culture, media and sport committee have pushed ahead with their inquiry into disinformation (originally conceived under the misleading label of \"Fake News\"). The committee, chaired by Damian Collins, collaborated with lawmakers from a dozen other countries to convene an international grand committee into digital threats to democracy last November in London. Facebook, for the third time, refused to send its top brass. An amiable but ill-informed PR man parried questions with obfuscation and prevarication. The message from the feudal overlord of the digital economy was clear: we serfs should know our place.</p><p>The final report of the MPs' inquiry makes blistering reading. Facebook puts profits ahead of users' privacy, their security and the health of democracy. It uses its market dominance to crush rivals. It obstructs outside scrutiny and apologises (feebly) only when caught. The committee also used an ingenious legal dodge to seize damning internal Facebook emails that were sealed evidence in a US lawsuit. Anyone tempted to join in the fashionable disdain for our politicians and politics should reflect on the vigour and initiative shown by this committee. We should all also consider its recommendations for the defence of democracy. One is that our electoral law is no longer fit for purpose. In my youth I spent a lot of time fighting elections. Every scrap of paper seen by the electorate had an \"imprint\", giving the election agent's name and address. \"Treating\" - giving even the most modest refreshments to a potential voter - was a serious breach of the law.</p><p>Spending was meticulously recorded.</p><p>Cynical behaviour by political parties has rendered these rules threadbare in the offline world. But in the cyber realm they flap uselessly in the wind. The frictionless anonymity of the internet makes it easy to conceal the funding, source and content of election material. Adverts can be micro-targeted to appeal to tiny groups of voters, exploiting the most private quirks, hopes and fears harvested from their previous online activity. As nobody else sees this material, any contradictory, false or inflammatory claims can escape public scrutiny.</p><p>Most of the tools we need to fix this are to hand.

It concerned attacks on it from outside. A devastating report from a Commons committee looking at disinformation highlighted the threat posed by unregulated political advertising. It lambasted the big tech companies as \"digital gangsters\" for their greedy collusion in this.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Another report, by the Royal United Services Institute, showed how the Chinese authorities systematically control foreign academic and media discussion and turn economic ties to their political advantage. If you think you live in a free country, ask when your rulers last spoke out bluntly on topics such as Taiwan and Tibet.</p><p>The combination of foreign interference and technological change threatens to overturn our political system. How can we have a fair election when unlimited money from murky sources - including foreign ones - can pay for secret messages that most voters never see? That is what Facebook enabled in the Brexit referendum. How can we deal sensibly with the world's second-biggest economy if our discussions and actions are constrained by greed for its money? Read Charles Parton's report for RUSI. That is what is happening with China, right now.</p><p>Showing exemplary bipartisan spirit - perhaps more effectively than the much talked-about new group of independent-minded rebels - the MPs in the digital, culture, media and sport committee have pushed ahead with their inquiry into disinformation (originally conceived under the misleading label of \"Fake News\"). The committee, chaired by Damian Collins, collaborated with lawmakers from a dozen other countries to convene an international grand committee into digital threats to democracy last November in London. Facebook, for the third time, refused to send its top brass. An amiable but ill-informed PR man parried questions with obfuscation and prevarication. The message from the feudal overlord of the digital economy was clear: we serfs should know our place.</p><p>The final report of the MPs' inquiry makes blistering reading. Facebook puts profits ahead of users' privacy, their security and the health of democracy. It uses its market dominance to crush rivals. It obstructs outside scrutiny and apologises (feebly) only when caught. The committee also used an ingenious legal dodge to seize damning internal Facebook emails that were sealed evidence in a US lawsuit. Anyone tempted to join in the fashionable disdain for our politicians and politics should reflect on the vigour and initiative shown by this committee. We should all also consider its recommendations for the defence of democracy. One is that our electoral law is no longer fit for purpose. In my youth I spent a lot of time fighting elections. Every scrap of paper seen by the electorate had an \"imprint\", giving the election agent's name and address. \"Treating\" - giving even the most modest refreshments to a potential voter - was a serious breach of the law.</p><p>Spending was meticulously recorded.</p><p>Cynical behaviour by political parties has rendered these rules threadbare in the offline world. But in the cyber realm they flap uselessly in the wind. The frictionless anonymity of the internet makes it easy to conceal the funding, source and content of election material. Adverts can be micro-targeted to appeal to tiny groups of voters, exploiting the most private quirks, hopes and fears harvested from their previous online activity. As nobody else sees this material, any contradictory, false or inflammatory claims can escape public scrutiny.</p><p>Most of the tools we need to fix this are to hand. We can apply antimonopoly rules to the tech giants. A government report on digital competition by Jason Furman, a US economist, is due out shortly. We also need better regulation of their activities, balancing free expression, privacy and innovation with public safety. A white paper on \"digital harms\" is due out next month. Let us hope neither launch coincides with news about Brexit.</p><p>But we are not short of reports. We are short of action. We urgently need a judge-led inquiry into foreign interference in our politics, in particular during the Brexit and Scottish independence referendums, and the 2017 general election. Mr Collins's report raises startling questions about foreign influence, disinformation, funding, voter manipulation and data sharing. The contemptuous responses to his committee's questions from some, such as the Brexit donor Arron Banks and the Vote Leave campaigner Dominic Cummings, only heighten concern.</p><p>This goes far beyond the scope of the ongoing inquiry by the underpowered Information Commissioner's Office. The investigation should have the authorisation and clearance needed to see the sizzlingly significant material gathered by our intelligence agencies - with, as far as possible, the scope and clout of Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. It might find some overlap.</p><p>The biggest questions concern the future. Social media platforms run by tech giants are easy to regulate compared with encrypted messaging applications that may have no real owner. Artificial intelligence (such as phone canvassing by human-seeming robots) will transform electioneering. The danger is of a digital Eatanswill - the farcically corrupt and unfair election depicted by Charles Dickens in the Pickwick Papers. But the joke will be on us - and the punchline written in Chinese.</p><p>A digital Eatanswill looms but the joke will be on us - in Chinese</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-146792379</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VH5-3S51-DYTY-C413-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"919\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Most noteworthy about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c291a12-b87c-42a6-bd35-be961693c3e7\"> this week\u2019s showdown</url> between bosses of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook and the House antitrust subcommittee was how the chiefs found themselves bashed by both sides of the political spectrum. Unlike the clumsy show of 2018, when Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress, lawmakers this time were well-prepared. Armed with 1.3m pages of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3cb3da3-a306-4557-9d6f-ed519230bc81\"> documents unearthed</url> in their 13-month probe of Big Tech, they landed some verbal blows. Since the investigation may shape future political efforts to curb the tech giants\u2019 influence, the CEOs have reason to be nervous.</p><p>Any political consensus on toughening regulation may yet be hampered by a sharp bipartisan divide. Republicans\u2019 central charge was that Silicon Valley has an inbuilt bias against conservatives. Such claims are easily disproved by a glimpse, say, at the most-clicked links on Facebook, which are regularly from conservative websites. Any idea of a pro-liberal bias is also belied perhaps by the vigour with which Democrats on the committee portrayed the tech chiefs as \u201ccyber barons\u201d whose companies distort competition in multiple ways.</p><p>Committee members\u2019 accusations ranged from hooking in consumers by funnelling them towards their own products and services, to monetising consumers\u2019 data while compromising their privacy, to using their power to stifle rivals \u2014 sometimes by taking them over. The corporate chiefs were sometimes unconvincing in claims that they did not remember particular events, or were \u201conly joking\u201d in apparently embarrassing emails. </p><p>Big Tech companies can argue with some merit that they owe their success above all to being wildly popular with consumers for the innovative products and services they provide. They have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/257c3f8c-a4cf-11ea-81ac-4854aed294e5\"> grown even bigger</url> during the pandemic because their technology has often proved a lifeline in lockdown. Any action to prevent them becoming overpowerful must avoid doing more harm than good.</p><p>Yet the CEOs fell back too often on arguments that the US needs their giant tech groups if it is to compete with China. What the US needs above all is a competitive innovation ecosystem without unfair barriers to entry. That is one that promotes creation of more high-tech businesses capable of repeating the feat of today\u2019s giants, two of which went from zero to trillion-dollar values in under a quarter of a century. (The third that has reached that milestone, Apple, was struggling before Steve Jobs\u2019 return in 1996). Research has shown most innovation happens in tech firms when they are smaller.</p><p>Subcommittee chairman David Cicilline said in closing of the four companies that some need to be broken up and \u201call need to be properly regulated and held accountable\u201d. His probe has no power to order break-ups \u2014 that is up to regulators. But the subcommittee\u2019s findings may feed into other regulatory probes that are under way.</p><p>The second part of Mr Cicilline\u2019s statement seems unarguable. His probe may play a useful role by recommending an update of US <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/943cb0f6-3495-4eb0-a1b8-e66ecc68215c\"> antitrust law</url>. The predominant test of anti-competitive behaviour since the 1980s \u2014 whether consumer welfare is being violated, which often means whether prices are being pushed up \u2014 is inadequate for the online era. As this week\u2019s hearing made clear, potential abuses can take many forms. The fact consumers like tech businesses does not mean that the companies\u2019 broader effect on the economy, innovation \u2014 and democracy \u2014 is entirely benign.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-00d8f8dafce24331a3ac5437ad9e2ce7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NK-94G1-DXP9-910Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"609\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Today, our most valued goods are digital, and we are producing an enormous amount of \"invisible\" digital waste.</p><p><br/><br/>The 50th Earth Day has just passed but it was special in that it occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. While this pandemic has to be urgently dealt with, the world is already immersed in a more long-standing crisis of global warming. It is interesting to see many commentators who have explicitly tied these two together in a larger narrative of how unthought exploitation of nature has major consequences for human communities. However, there is another lurking crisis waiting to happen in a replay of the earlier climate crisis. This crisis is catalysed by our addiction and immersion into the digital world, a phenomenon that we see as being quite similar to global warming. We refer to this phenomenon as \"digital global warming.\" This term reflects a state of living in an uncontrolled smog of digital waste, digital data and exhaust generated by technologies of today. Just as the by-products of industrialised societies, like the exhaust from cars, have contributed to global climate warming, the by-products of using billions of digital devices and applications are ushering us into the era of digital global warming.<br/><br/>The cause and effect of the invisible digital by-product that accompanies every digital transaction can be understood through the framework of waste. There are many types of by-products ranging from human sewage, automobile exhaust and invisible chemicals, which have seeped into the air and earth, that constitute waste. Human civilisation could well be a chronology of how we produce, and then manage, waste. But waste is not merely dirty or something to be discarded; it ultimately defines the character of our societies. For instance, the existence of physical waste produces ideas of cultural waste that make societies reject communities within themselves. From early attempts at managing human sewage to managing air, and water pollution today, the degree of social progress is defined by the response to waste. Although hidden and invisible, waste can affect us globally in terrible ways: it causes medical epidemics, poisons the air, makes water undrinkable, and contributes to physical and mental disorders. One can even argue that naturally occurring coronavirus strains are the result of poor handling of waste in wet markets (as in COVID-19) and other human-animal interaction points (such as in H1N1 and avian flu).<br/><br/>Culture of Waste<br/><br/>One's waste is another's fortune, as the mafia in Italy or Mumbai can testify. By controlling the entire waste cycle and dumps, the Cammaro mafia in Naples makes an annual turnover of more than $6 billion (this is estimated at $2 billion for Mumbai). Waste itself leads to new cultural forms, which could be called as cultures of waste.<br/><br/>In addition to carelessly strewn digital waste across the visible web, the accumulation and feeding of digital discards into data dumpsters (that we call \"dampsters\") forms the underbelly of the Internet accessible through the dark web. By some estimates, this dark web content-not indexed by search engines such as Google, but accessible to the public-is estimated to be four times larger than the visible web, literally forming the largest virtual landfill imaginable. Websites like Pastebin, and thousands of dark web dampsters in this vast dark side of the web creates an environment for the digital mafia to control and trade on sensitive digital information, such as financial records, pornography, stolen credentials, credit cards, private information of individuals such as sexual or political orientation, digital DNA signatures, and plenty of other artefacts that can be monetised or misused. This dumpster is populated by cyberattacks that breach data from the visible (or deep) web, or from the collection of callously strewn litter and data dumped by hackers and malware into dampsters. Unlike the physical world where garbage is removed from one location to another, in the digital world, data is not moved but repeatedly copied, traded or resold, and stored indefinitely outside normal jurisdictional controls. Hence, once someone taps into your digital discard, there is no stopping its exponential proliferation.<br/><br/>Unlike the cultures of waste-which are special cultural ways of dealing with waste-certain cultures create excess waste as a product of their ways of living. Many rich countries are prime examples of cultures that promote excessive waste. As an example, the United States (US) produces more than 250 million tonnes of garbage a year, which works out to greater than 1,500 pounds of garbage per year per person. Excess digital waste, on the other hand, is a global problem-leaving behind or hoarding digital data is cheap (and many times free for the individual) and encourages a wasteful culture. A measure of the amount, and growth, of digital footprint per capita (much like carbon footprint) is a good indicator of digital waste produced by each country.<br/><br/>Social media sites lead the way in encouraging a wasteful culture since it suits their business model. Built upon practices that foster addiction, which hook users into an endless stream of music, video, and games, it results in keeping individuals within their platform that delivers these services to their users while continuously capturing exhaust from their activities to influence user behaviour, which, in turn, fuels their businesses, and the non-strategic and un-monetisable discards fed to the highest bidder.<br/><br/>Personal Sphere<br/><br/>Not all waste that leads to digital global warming can be traced back to uncontrolled exhaust alone. The digital world is full of litter, voluntarily strewn around by users without regard to the cost of the waste created and deposited for eternity. A recent example is contact tracing applications developed by various governments and technology companies to identify people who may have been exposed to individuals with Covid-19. They are critical in addressing the pandemic, but simultaneously expose the perils of sharing personal data that if left open can be used for unintended purposes by third parties. This accumulated stream of data is a gold mine for artificial intelligence technologies that could be used to train new models without our consent to uncover secrets hidden in the data. As an example, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2019 used public YouTube videos to train a neural network model that correlates vocal features to facial features in these public videos. When the system is fed a new sound sample, it can predict how the person speaking is likely to look like. Needless to say, several YouTubers in the database were not pleased with their unexpected starring role in the demo videos.<br/><br/>Technology, through personalised digital applications, has become so indispensable to our digital-first daily lives that many already find it impossible to navigate their daily existence without it. With the ubiquitous presence of sensors and technologies that can cheaply store and analyse oceans of data residue in the cloud, even our physical actions are accounted digitally. For example, Facebook has been collecting \"off Facebook activities,\" which are activities an individual has performed anywhere outside of Facebook. This allows Facebook to create a profile of every single individual-whether or not they have a Facebook account.<br/><br/>Even bio markers, long considered the holy grail of identifying what is uniquely personal about individuals, are now free radicals in the digital smog. The impact of the culture of digital waste has not left behind the realm of historically guarded mental states and our unvocalised thoughts, either with the emerging big tech around \"psychographic\" profiles or the emotion analytics market. The cost that this unmitigated collection of digital intelligence can have on the larger society can be seen by analysing trends, such as social credit scores, deep fakes, and emerging embedded bio-sensor technologies. Today, this intermingled digital stream of personal data with varying degrees of sensitivity is handled much like how sewage was handled in early civilisations: with no effective sorting, channelling and disposal of the vast amounts of waste that accumulate to the detriment of the society.<br/><br/>Regional Impact<br/><br/>For the citizens of Los Angeles (LA), 8 July 1943 marked an important day as they woke up to a circus like atmosphere when a surprise attack of a mysterious thick grey fog descended on LA streets. It left kids with teary eyes, a confused population, and confounded speechless politicians. There was rampant speculation on the cause, with many believing that it was a chemical attack by the Japanese! It took another nine years and plenty of face mask sales and dead-end theories about the cause, of this recurring \"smog\" before this phenomenon was tied back to automobile exhaust by Caltech professor Arie Haagen-Smit in 1952. In hindsight, this connection should have been obvious-afterall LA was the largest car market at the time.<br/><br/>Smog, while not anticipated, heralded the success of Ford's mass production of automobiles more than 50 years after its founding. The very instrument that enabled people to conquer distance, to stay connected with friends and family, shop, travel and find new opportunities of earning a livelihood was also a silent killer that contributed to localised smog and, over time, global warming.<br/><br/>It took another 20 years for any serious regulations in the US to help mitigate a catastrophic health crisis in the making. While regulations have reduced smog in LA significantly over the last four decades, the impact of the exhaust from automobiles is in stark view even today in large cities in China, India, and in many other countries around the world where regulation continues to take a back seat to economic progress and convenience.<br/><br/>What happened with cars earlier is now happening with new devices and applications that have overrun the world. Just like the gasoline engine converts gasoline into physical motion, these digital technologies are the engines that convert the telemetry of our every move into economic gain. Not only are these devices more widely used than cars and vehicles (for example, the number of cell phones in use in the world is expected to cross 5 billion by this year), but they also create a flood of uncontrolled digital exhaust. There are over 2 billion laptops in use today, more than 400 million closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras watching our communities, 400 million iPads, 200 million voice-activated devices like Alexa and Google Home, hundreds of millions of smart televisions, 50 million smart homes, and much more. Today, in aggregate, the number of digital devices in our lives significantly outnumbers the population of this earth, not counting the multiple (at least 10 on an average) applications per device.<br/><br/>Each one of these devices and applications generates a continuous stream of data that can be used for collective or aggregate analytics that can shape cultures and regions. We have seen this have a profound impact on social behaviour, such as in Xinjang province in western China, or in the vast surveillance camera network in Chicago, or use of digital DNA databases to tackle unsolved crimes. All of which is possible only with a collection of sensitive data easily accessible in the cloud.<br/><br/>Global Dimensions<br/><br/>Digital technology is ubiquitous and is available in the richest and poorest areas across the world. Thus, it is impossible today to merely talk of technology in the digitalised West and ignore the rest of the world. China and India are already the two leading users of mobile technologies and are also the fastest growing economies of the world. There are major digital payment and other economic revolutions in Africa. By bringing these societies into the consciousness of the technological world, we can map the global effects of the impending digital global warming.<br/><br/>With increased global use of digital services comes increased opportunity for cross-border intelligence gathering from dampsters. State-sponsored espionage is not necessarily motivated by financial gains but by the need to glean persistent strategic advantage. In May 2019, a German researcher, Adrian Zenz, doggedly dived into multiple dampsters to find construction requests for proposals, geo-spatial maps, and other data in obscure corners of the Chinese internet that revealed a security build-up in China's remote Xinjiang region pointing to mass detention and policing of Turkic Muslims. This is just one example of the vast treasure trove of discarded data that third parties can mine from these dampsters.<br/><br/>A combination of these data dumps in conjunction with advances in artificial intelligence has proven to be a deadly concoction for cross-border offences. In the 2016 US election, exhaust from Facebook users that took the form of a user's profile, a user's friend network, and other inferred metadata about a user's preference (by some accounts Facebook has more than 29,000 data points for each user) and interests was leveraged by Russia to create a divide among the US population. A similar story repeated itself in countries around the world and is expected to be the new norm in democratic elections going forward.<br/><br/>Additionally, countries have become increasingly aware of the sensitivities of allowing their citizens to share their data with foreign companies. For example, US intelligence issued a warning to citizens of the US about the use of TikTok, a popular social app hosted and developed in part by the Chinese government due to evidence of spying. India took it a step further and banned the TikTok app temporarily. Social media apps are not the only means for regimes to seed surveillance technology across the globe. CCTV manufacturers from China, for example, have flooded Latin American countries at (or below) cost as a way to gain a feed of surveillance data that can be controlled and processed across jurisdictional boundaries from China.<br/><br/>So, is there no escape from this eventuality? We should not expect this kind of self-imposed restrictions on import of digital data anytime soon, since there is only a nascent emergence of understanding among nations of what constitutes personal digital ownership rights, and what constitutes appropriate digital waste. This is complicated in a scenario where nations may want access to another nation's digital exhaust as they may view it as an untapped intelligence asset. Over the last few years, the cost of storing digital exhaust indefinitely has reduced dramatically with cheap storage, while simultaneously, data mining technologies using artificial intelligence and machine learning have improved significantly. This combination of cheap storage and maturing data mining technologies makes it more likely for many willing consumers of this digital waste to extract strategic advantage over competition, both domestic and foreign. In 2019, 187 countries agreed to add plastic into the Basel Convention, a treaty that regulated movement of hazardous material from one country to another. Perhaps, it is not too premature to add digital exhaust as well.<br/><br/>One could argue that digital capitalism is a different form of capitalism in that waste is an intrinsic economic product of great value. Digital waste itself becomes a prime product for this form of capitalism. And uncontrolled growth of this invisible digital waste is the next step to digital global warming.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EPWKLY-0053472807</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EPWKLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603D-VRT1-DXMP-K3M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365197</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2657\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Economic &amp;

Far from it; those in the world of tech looking to race to the cutting edge will often push ahead with the former, to the detriment of the latter.\u00a0<br/>These issues are more relevant than ever before; the COVID-19 pandemic has not only accelerated digital progress, but abruptly shoved it over a cliff. According to the World Economic Forum, 86% of United Nations member states used the internet to provide COVID-19 updates.\u00a0<br/>Around the world, governments have been rushing to migrate municipal services online so that citizens can access essential public tools while reducing social contacts. Amid the urgency of the situation, how can countries ensure that roll-out and delivery of services are always done in an ethical manner?</p><p><br/>Even before the pandemic made online access to government services essential, the Netherlands has been consistently ranked as ahead of the curve in this respect. It has the highest rate of internet access among its citizens at 98% as of 2018, almost ten percent higher than the EU average.\u00a0<br/>The Netherlands: an overviewA 2018 McKinsey report ranked the nation as one of nine \"digital front-runners\" which boasts higher rates of productivity (which is measured by average GDP in euros per hours worked) and lower rates of unemployment than other central and eastern European countries.<br/>The 2019 EU e-Government benchmark ranked the usability of the Netherlands' digital government services at 100%, the mobile-friendliness of digital government at 90%, and the adoption of digital government services online at 80%, the latter of which is considerably higher than the EU average of 57%.<br/>Within the Dutch government, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (BZK) is responsible for developing and overseeing these digital services.\u00a0<br/>One of the largest programs of the BZK is DigID, a centralized, secured digital identity connected to one's Dutch security number that can be used to access a host of public services ranging from applying for benefits to uploading marriage and birth certificates.<br/>In total, Dutch citizens with a DigID can access 650 different service providers spanning both state and semi-state functions. The service is not mandatory for all citizens but is required to access online versions of government services. Uptake of the service is high: of the Netherlands' 17.1m people, around 14m (more than 80% of the population) have a DigiD.\u00a0<br/>A 2019 study by the McKinsey Global Institute shows that increased digital access to government services can boost a country's economy by between 3% and 13%. This assumes, however, high adoption rates, which research has shown is contingent on high levels of public trust.\u00a0<br/>Evidently, The Netherlands does not struggle with adoption. The maintenance of public trust, however, is a more complex manner, one that requires concerted efforts to promote ethical practices that will promote trust.<br/>Fostering trust in a distrusting worldSebastiaan van Lunteren, a project leader of the Digital Government Innovation Budget in this department, told TNW that promoting a \"human-centric approach\" is key to maintaining this trust.<br/>\"For every tool that's being built, you start by looking at the citizens, at the inhabitants of your nation, and you put them at the center of what you build,\" Van Lunteren explained.<br/>Trust, Van Lunteren notes, is essential, and the impact of diminished trust in public institutions can be catastrophic. The rise of COVID-19 misinformation, and the swell of misinformation and disinformation in general, is one of the most troubling side effects of the erosion of public trust.<br/>Some of the ways to promote public trust are quite straightforward: for example, BZK has launched an open data initiative that means much of the code used for digital services, including the Dutch COVID-19 contact tracing app, is open-source and available on GitHub. The choice for open source and an open way of working was very important to meet the criticism from privacy experts and technicians during the start of the project: \"If you want to create trust, you have to be transparent.\"<br/>Other methods of promoting public trust include the BZK's digital inclusion strategy, which seeks to ensure that no one is excluded from digital communications. Needlessly complicated jargon is excised from communications with citizens. \"The focus is that everybody should be able to join the new digital society,\" Lunteren says.<br/>BZK partners with libraries around the country to include digital skills in reading and writing initiatives for those with lower levels of literacy. This strategy aims to ensure all digital government apps and services have the technology needed so that people with disabilities have access.<br/>BZK representatives will also conduct a 30-minute talk at the upcoming TNW2020 conference to discuss digital governance ethics in more detail.<br/>Ensuring that citizens' data is stored in a centralized, cross-departmental database is important for encouraging use. BZK aims to have digital governance be as seamless as possible, never forcing a citizen to enter the same information more than once.<br/>Having this seamless experience is important for trust because what citizens desire in digital government is mirrored in what they desire from the commercial e-business model. They want similar levels of convenience and ease of use as they get from 'Big Tech' firms such as Google and Facebook while also having solid and transparent ethical guidelines.\u00a0<br/>\"They're right in their request because we live in a society that's so digitally advanced that this is possible,\" Van\u00a0 Lunteren says.<br/>Yet the digital transformation of government will never, Van Lunteren concludes, be able to keep up with the breathless pace at which the business of tech can move, albeit for good reason. For any digital initiatives that are rolled out, they must first trundle through a series of legal and financial checks to ensure compliance.\u00a0<br/>Reducing bias in AIVan Lunteren also devotes some of his time to working on adapting policy in order to ensure that human rights are central to the development of new technologies.<br/>Globally, the use of AI in government, particularly with regard to the use of facial recognition in the judicial system, has attracted criticism. Far from being an objective, scientific tool, many AIs do have bias, or unintentionally discriminate because the data shows bias. As a result, they have often been found to discriminate against minorities.<br/>Van Lunteren asks: \"How do we stop these algorithms if they're breaking laws, if they discriminate, or if they do something else that basically violates\u00a0 human rights?\" It's important for regulators to control algorithms, and BZK has developed different instruments to do so, including impact assessments, guidelines, ethical data tools, etc. BZK has partnered with the University of Amsterdam and local government to create the Civic AI Lab, a research lab devoted to researching and promoting applications of AI that promote the economic and social rights of citizens.<br/>\"We're launching a human rights and AI award [in the Civic AI Lab] soon for public projects that develop AI systems that do not harm human rights.\"<br/>Technology is everywhere and is rapidly developing - the impact it will have on society is considerable, but still largely unknown. This is a major challenge for those developing technology policies for governments. Van Lunteren says: \"You know it is inevitable, as a government, that you are going to have to get everything online. You cannot control this digital world as a government, not as easily as you could control the physical world.\"<br/>The digital revolution has upended every facet of human existence. It has created a system where now, it is the world of the internet; the rest of us are just merely living in it. Yet digital government solutions do not have the same ethical problems that the rise of major private tech firms have had. They could repair trust, not break it further.<br/>Want to learn more about digital governance ethics?

Far from it; those in the world of tech looking to race to the cutting edge will often push ahead with the former, to the detriment of the latter. These issues are more relevant than ever before; the COVID-19 pandemic has not only accelerated digital progress, but abruptly shoved it over a cliff. According to the World Economic Forum[1], 86% of United Nations member states used the internet to provide COVID-19 updates. </p><p>Around the world, governments have been rushing to migrate municipal services online so that citizens can access essential public tools while reducing social contacts. Amid the urgency of the situation, how can countries ensure that roll-out and delivery of services are always done in an ethical manner? Even before the pandemic made online access to government services essential, the Netherlands has been consistently ranked as ahead of the curve in this respect. It has the highest rate of internet access among its citizens at 98% as of 2018[2], almost ten percent higher than the EU average.The Netherlands: an overviewA 2018 McKinsey report[3] ranked the nation as one of nine 'digital front-runners' which boasts higher rates of productivity (which is measured by average GDP in euros per hours worked) and lower rates of unemployment than other central and eastern European countries. The 2019 EU e-Government benchmark[4] ranked the usability of the Netherlands' digital government services at 100%, the mobile-friendliness of digital government at 90%, and the adoption of digital government services online at 80%, the latter of which is considerably higher than the EU average of 57%. Within the Dutch government, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (BZK) is responsible for developing and overseeing these digital services. One of the largest programs of the BZK is DigID[5], a centralized, secured digital identity connected to one's Dutch security number that can be used to access a host of public services ranging from applying for benefits to uploading marriage and birth certificates. In total, Dutch citizens with a DigID can access 650 different service providers spanning both state and semi-state functions. The service is not mandatory for all citizens but is required to access online versions of government services. Uptake of the service is high: of the Netherlands' 17.1m people, around 14m (more than 80% of the population) have a DigiD. A 2019 study by the McKinsey Global Institute[6] shows that increased digital access to government services can boost a country's economy by between 3% and 13%. This assumes, however, high adoption rates, which research has shown is contingent on high levels of public trust[7]. Evidently, The Netherlands does not struggle with adoption. The maintenance of public trust, however, is a more complex manner, one that requires concerted efforts to promote ethical practices that will promote trust.Fostering trust in a distrusting worldSebastiaan van Lunteren, a project leader of the Digital Government Innovation Budget in this department, told TNW that promoting a 'human-centric approach' is key to maintaining this trust. 'For every tool that's being built, you start by looking at the citizens, at the inhabitants of your nation, and you put them at the center of what you build,' Van Lunteren explained. Trust, Van Lunteren notes, is essential, and the impact of diminished trust in public institutions can be catastrophic. The rise of COVID-19 misinformation, and the swell of misinformation and disinformation in general, is one of the most troubling side effects of the erosion of public trust. Some of the ways to promote public trust are quite straightforward: for example, BZK has launched an open data initiative that means much of the code used for digital services, including the Dutch COVID-19 contact tracing app, is open-source and available on GitHub. The choice for open source and an open way of working was very important to meet the criticism from privacy experts and technicians during the start of the project: 'If you want to create trust, you have to be transparent.' Other methods of promoting public trust include the BZK's digital inclusion strategy, which seeks to ensure that no one is excluded from digital communications. Needlessly complicated jargon is excised from communications with citizens. 'The focus is that everybody should be able to join the new digital society,' Lunteren says. BZK partners with libraries around the country to include digital skills in reading and writing initiatives for those with lower levels of literacy. This strategy aims to ensure all digital government apps and services have the technology needed so that people with disabilities have access. BZK representatives will also conduct a 30-minute talk at the upcoming TNW2020 conference[8] to discuss digital governance ethics in more detail. Ensuring that citizens' data is stored in a centralized, cross-departmental database is important for encouraging use. BZK aims to have digital governance be as seamless as possible, never forcing a citizen to enter the same information more than once. Having this seamless experience is important for trust because what citizens desire in digital government is mirrored in what they desire from the commercial e-business model. They want similar levels of convenience and ease of use as they get from 'Big Tech' firms such as Google and Facebook while also having solid and transparent ethical guidelines. 'They're right in their request because we live in a society that's so digitally advanced that this is possible,' Van Lunteren says. Yet the digital transformation of government will never, Van Lunteren concludes, be able to keep up with the breathless pace at which the business of tech can move, albeit for good reason. For any digital initiatives that are rolled out, they must first trundle through a series of legal and financial checks to ensure compliance.Reducing bias in AIVan Lunteren also devotes some of his time to working on adapting policy in order to ensure that human rights are central to the development of new technologies. Globally, the use of AI in government, particularly with regard to the use of facial recognition in the judicial system, has attracted criticism. Far from being an objective, scientific tool, many AIs do have bias, or unintentionally discriminate because the data shows bias. As a result, they have often been found to discriminate against minorities[9]. Van Lunteren asks: 'How do we stop these algorithms if they're breaking laws, if they discriminate, or if they do something else that basically violates human rights?' It's important for regulators to control algorithms, and BZK has developed different instruments to do so, including impact assessments, guidelines, ethical data tools, etc. BZK has partnered with the University of Amsterdam and local government to create the Civic AI Lab[10], a research lab devoted to researching and promoting applications of AI that promote the economic and social rights of citizens. 'We're launching a human rights and AI award [in the Civic AI Lab] soon for public projects that develop AI systems that do not harm human rights.' Technology is everywhere and is rapidly developing \u2014 the impact it will have on society is considerable, but still largely unknown. This is a major challenge for those developing technology policies for governments. Van Lunteren says: 'You know it is inevitable, as a government, that you are going to have to get everything online. You cannot control this digital world as a government, not as easily as you could control the physical world.' The digital revolution has upended every facet of human existence. It has created a system where now, it is the world of the internet; the rest of us are just merely living in it. Yet digital government solutions do not have the same ethical problems that the rise of major private tech firms have had. They could repair trust, not break it further.

But is it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">sign up here</url> to receive it weekdays.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital success can be as flimsy as tissue paper. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Remember Groupon</url>? BlackBerry went from the king of our pockets to nada in a hot minute. Heck, it seemed like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">we got bored of those internet cake videos</url> in a week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even in technology, though, some habits can prove tenacious.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">No one has been able to get large numbers of Americans to use something other than Google for all our burning questions. The world has settled into only two flavors of smartphones: iPhones and Androids. And in the United States, it\u2019s tough to crack Amazon\u2019s lock on online shopping.</p><p>It\u2019s not necessarily because these products or services are better than the alternatives. They might be, but there are also strategic arts that explain why some companies endure. And there\u2019s the power of inertia. Sometimes we do what we do because that\u2019s what we do.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with these habits. But we have long thought of technology as more dynamic and open to newcomers. And yet, is it?</p><p>Let\u2019s focus on online shopping. In the United States, Amazon has at least seven times the online business of Walmart, Target, eBay or anyone else.</p><p>Amazon is really good at what it does. It sells just about every product imaginable \u2014 for good or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">for ill</url>, buying is easy and stuff typically arrives reliably and fast. Prices often aren\u2019t the cheapest, and Amazon\u2019s website feels like it was made by 1990s robots rather than by humans with souls \u2026 but no matter.</p><p>And also there\u2019s the power of habit that Amazon cleverly reinforces. We\u2019re on Amazon because we\u2019re used to it, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">it just works</url>. Merchants focus their attention on Amazon because we\u2019re all shopping there. And the Prime shopping club is essentially an incentive to never shop anywhere else.</p><p>My colleague Dai Wakabayashi chronicled this week Google\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">repeated, mostly failed efforts</url> to make it as easy as possible for merchants to sell us stuff through Google instead. Dai told me that Google is now letting merchants list many products without paying sales commissions, and it\u2019s making it easy for them to port over information directly from their Amazon product listings. Google is trying so hard!</p><p>Google can be a scatterbrained mess, but it\u2019s also rich and attracts billions of eyeballs every day. If it can\u2019t persuade Americans to shop somewhere other than Amazon, that shows us something both about Amazon\u2019s strengths and about how tough it can be to persuade us to try something different. (Worth noting: Amazon rules online but a vast majority of our consumer spending happens in stores.)</p><p>Everyone in Silicon Valley knows the history of technology winners becoming losers in a flash, so many successful tech companies live in fear of losing it all.</p><p>One question for those of us who use technology, and for governments concerned about keeping competition healthy, is whether there\u2019s something different that makes today\u2019s tech powers more immovable than yesterday\u2019s. This is at the heart of the upcoming congressional <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">antitrust hearings</url> involving four of America\u2019s digital superpowers.</p><p>The bottom line is internet users like us benefit if lots of companies are afraid for their future and fighting hard for our attention and dollars. But in some corners of technology, that\u2019s not really happening.</p><p>Every fight is about data</p><p>I\u2019m constantly struck that lots of problems about our digital lives boil down to data: who has it, who doesn\u2019t and how it\u2019s interpreted and kept secret.</p><p>Let me give you one example: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">The Wall Street Journal</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">NBC News</url> had details this week about Facebook previously shelving internal studies of possible racial bias on its site \u2014 including research that dug into why Black people appeared far more likely to have their accounts disabled for perceived violations of hate speech rules.</p><p>Facebook said in part that it worried these research projects relied on faulty data. Facebook doesn\u2019t know if you\u2019re Black, but it makes inferences about race from the information you engage with. Those inferences can be wrong, and Facebook said it didn\u2019t want to rely on bad data.</p><p>Mind you, Facebook uses this same data to target advertising for companies who want to sell to Black people. The data was good enough for Facebook\u2019s paying customers. (And, a former Facebook researcher <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">tweeted</url> that those probing possible bias didn\u2019t rely only on Facebook\u2019s inferences on race.)</p><p>The reason we know about this fight inside Facebook is that the company\u2019s employees see data that we never will, and some of them were uncomfortable with how their bosses used or suppressed the information. There are similar tales <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">at YouTube</url> and at just about every internet superpower.</p><p>There are two crucial lessons here: First, we often think data is somehow pure and untainted by human bias, but that\u2019s wrong. Information is gathered and interpreted by humans \u2014 or by computers programmed by humans \u2014 and is therefore subject to our whims and bias.</p><p>And second, we are hopelessly incapable of understanding the inner workings of the world\u2019s biggest information machines because they see every morsel of information happening inside their walls and we see only what they choose to tell us. Data is power, and we have little of both.</p><p>Before we go \u2026</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Trying to influence the influential: George Mason University\u2019s Global Antitrust Institute has pushed a message of restraint in antitrust enforcement to hundreds of overseas regulators and judges at lavish all-expense paid conferences in Hawaii, Tokyo and Portugal.

Sumarie Greybe, co-founder of Naked Insurance, runs a lean shop with about 20 staff. She says its clients get all they need from the app - quotes on vehicles take 90 seconds and they are firm, not merely indicative.</p><p>But it does not try to match a competitor's quote and will not look at cars valued at more than R1.5m. The Naked management team take it in turns to answer the phone for the rare occasions when clients want to ask questions that way. Using the HelloPeter complaints site, Naked has done well, coming third in the full insurance universe for the best complaint record.</p><p>However, pure digital insurers all over the world have found it difficult to reach profitability. Given that they have relied heavily on cut-throat pricing, pioneers in the US such as Lemonade, Root and Metromile have paid for this with high loss ratios. Regulations make it impossible for an insurer to operate across borders Amazon-style, which may shield the local players from an aggressive onslaught.</p><p>Naked and Pineapple both cultivate a &amp; caring&amp; image, a return to the mutual risk sharing which was once the heart of insurance. Pineapple limits its total take, including expenses, to 15% of premium and Naked to 20%, giving any further surplus to charity. Granadilla gives any surplus back to clients.</p><p>Pineapple co-founder Matthew Elan Smith says the team took part in an innovation programme, run by Hannover Re in 2016. It found insurers were considered inefficient. Their expense ratios were high and they were hardly client-centric. &amp; Too many clients consider insurance to be a black hole and cannot see that their premiums help other people,&amp; he says.</p><p>The company introduced &amp; the Pineapple wallet&amp; so that clients can track how much of their premium goes to fees, and which fees go back to members.</p><p>Elan Smith says Pineapple wanted to build trust by insuring low-premium items such as cellphones and computers before launching motor insurance, which accounts for more than 60% of premiums written in the personal lines market.</p><p>Granadilla is not considering a move into motor insurance, given the logistical complexity of building up service providers from tow trucks to panel beaters. But founder Jonathan Walker says it is looking at offering life products in conjunction with its underwriter and major outside shareholder Bryte, part of the global Toronto-based Fairfax insurance group.</p><p>Walker says that unlike its two competitors, Granadilla does not employ any actuaries, preferring to use machine learning to price risks.</p><p>Walker's career to date was in banking - until his phone and laptop were stolen a few years ago and his claim took eight weeks to be paid out.</p><p>Initially, Granadilla focused on insuring cellphones, but it now offers insurance on 15 electronic gadgets. &amp; We are looking at the emerging middle class which might not have motor or homeowners' insurance yet,&amp; says Walker.</p><p>Old Mutual tried and failed to penetrate this market through iWyze, which offered &amp; valuables insurance&amp; but it didn't work in a giant corporate environment.</p><p>It seems to be working better at Granadilla, however, which employs just 11 people and has a purely digital approach.</p><p>Walker says the app has had 70,000 hits since it was launched in July 2018.</p><p>Still, it would not have been possible for the digital insurers to launch without their credible parents, all established players in the insurance market. Compass Insurance, part of the Hannover Re group, is a shareholder in Pineapple. Hollard and its parent, Yellowwoods, are shareholders in Naked, which sits in their campus in Parktown, Joburg.</p><p>Greybe says it has been useful to access the Hollard procurement network for needs such as heavy panel-beating.</p><p>Granadilla's partner, Bryte, is the old SA Eagle, which became Zurich. The group produced mediocre returns as a listed company, but through Fairfax, Granadilla has the potential to expand internationally.</p><p>Greybe says the Naked IT system was developed from the ground up, so it does rely on a licence agreement with a third party. She says Naked is a tech company that happens to sell insurance, and most of the staff are software developers; it is the same story at Pineapple and Granadilla. None of the international players has come into SA yet - probably a reflection of the fumbling economy.</p><p>US-based Trov came close, while market leader Lemonade has its hands full with an ambitious expansion into Germany, still the world's fourth-largest economy.</p><p>As for life insurance and big tech, Anthony Miller, CEO of Simply Life, says it has been much harder to build a viable digital-only business in life insurance, as it remains a grudge purchase. &amp; Short-term claims are a high-frequency event and a lot of people will insure, say, a new watch without prompting.</p><p>&amp; But most people see their own mortality as a distant prospect.&amp; Miller says that in the life and savings sector, technology should enable rather than displace humans. Simply does not rely purely on incoming sales through the website and app. It has focused on group sales to small companies and has also opened up to brokers who can sign their clients far more quickly to the product than if they went through traditional insurers.</p><p>Miller says digital insurers can deliver a policy at a cost 60%-80% below the legacy insurers (including direct call-centre businesses such as Outsurance) and he is happy to cut his margin to pay upfront broker commission.</p><p>MiWay CEO Ren\u00e9 Otto says the Santam-owned direct insurer offers the facility to do the entire purchase and sales transaction online, but all but a handful of clients prefer to talk to a human being before they close the deal.</p><p>In contrast, Elan Smith says his clients are happy to deal via chatbots, and in fact get extremely irritated when they wait on the phone for service. And Pineapple does not inspect the client's premises to value the merchandise - it only uses assessors at the claims stage if there are suspicions of fraud.</p><p>As you'd expect, all three insurers advertise primarily through social media - Facebook, Google and Instagram - though there is still a powerful human connection.</p><p>Elan Smith says more than 40% of Pineapple sales are originated through referrals from existing clients.</p><p>Sumarie Greybe: Runs a lean shop with about 20 staffFreddy Mavunda</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLFM-FMfmFM2111monInvestorsNotebook</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLFM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJJ-WKD1-DYT4-K3KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1170\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

Dieser Prozess vollzieht sich in beispiellosem Tempo. Die Informationstechnologie dringt tief in den Finanzdienstleistungsbereich vor - vom Markteintritt der Big-Tech-Unternehmen bis zur Nutzung mobiler Zahlungs-Apps - und stellt damit die traditionelle Finanzinfrastruktur vor immense Herausforderungen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ich finde, die Zentralbanken m\u00fcssten die Initiative ergreifen und eine Schl\u00fcsselrolle bei der Optimierung der Zahlungssicherheit und -effizienz spielen. Mit der Lancierung des BIS Innovation Hub kommt der Bank f\u00fcr Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich (BIZ) dabei eine f\u00fchrende Rolle zu. Der Hub hat den Auftrag, wichtige Trends in der Entwicklung neuer Finanztechnologie zu erkennen und zu erforschen und \u00f6ffentliche G\u00fcter zur Verbesserung der globalen Finanzsysteme zu entwickeln, und er bietet den Zentralbanken eine neue Diskussionsplattform.</p><p>In der ersten Phase werden drei Hubs er\u00f6ffnet\u00a0- in Hongkong, Singapur und in der Schweiz. Der mit der Schweizerischen Nationalbank als Partner betriebene Hub wird untersuchen, welche Vorteile sich aus der Umwandlung von finanziellen Verm\u00f6genswerten und W\u00e4hrungen in digitales Token-Geld ergeben, wenn die Abwicklung von Wertschriftentransaktionen mit Zentralbankgeld auf einer einzigen Plattform erfolgen kann.</p><p>Singapur wird den Fokus auf Technologien zur Bankenregulierung und Finanzaufsicht legen sowie auf die Entwicklung grundlegender \u00f6ffentlicher digitaler Infrastruktur. In Hongkong wiederum wird der Einsatz der Distributed-Ledger-Technologie (DLT) in der Aussenhandelsfinanzierung im Mittelpunkt stehen.</p><p>Eine zentrale Frage f\u00fcr die BIZ ist dabei: Muss Geld von Grund auf neu erfunden oder sollte bloss seine Bereitstellung und Nutzung verbessert werden?  Unseres Erachtens gen\u00fcgt Letzteres. Dabei bleibt eine vertrauensw\u00fcrdige offizielle W\u00e4hrung, die es dem \u00f6ffentlichen und dem privaten Sektor erm\u00f6glicht, die eigenen St\u00e4rken am besten zu nutzen, die sicherste Grundlage f\u00fcr eine tragf\u00e4hige digitale Wirtschaft.</p><p> Die grosse St\u00e4rke von Zentralbanken liegt darin, eine grundlegende Infrastruktur f\u00fcr das Geldsystem bereitzustellen. Der private Sektor wiederum l\u00e4uft zur Hochform auf, wenn er seinen Innovationsgeist voll und ganz in den Dienst seiner Kunden stellen kann.</p><p>Viele Zentralbanken beaufsichtigen bereits effiziente, schnelle nationale Zahlungsverkehrssysteme, doch manchenorts bleibt noch viel zu tun. Und die grenz\u00fcberschreitenden Zahlungsverkehrssysteme m\u00fcssen dringend verbessert werden. Dies ist nicht nur eine Frage der Technologie, sondern auch der Koordination von Standards und Praxen zwischen den einzelnen L\u00e4ndern.</p><p>Wir finden, dass man dabei die digitale Finanzstruktur als \u00f6ffentliches Gut sehen sollte: Durch freien Zugang wird Innovation gef\u00f6rdert, und durch den regulatorischen Rahmen werden gleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen f\u00fcr neue Marktteilnehmer geschaffen. Der private Sektor sollte sie nicht selber bereitstellen, sondern k\u00f6nnte die \u00f6ffentliche Infrastruktur nutzen und sich auf kundenorientierte Dienstleistungen und Produkte konzentrieren.</p><p>Private m\u00fcssten nach wie vor die regulatorischen Standards und die Auflagen der Regulierungsbeh\u00f6rden - einschliesslich Verbraucherschutzvorschriften - einhalten, Geldw\u00e4sche bek\u00e4mpfen und Terrorismusfinanzierung verhindern. Eine solche Modernisierung des Zahlungsverkehrssystems sollte einen Rund-um-die-Uhr-Betrieb mit sofortiger Abwicklung in der offiziellen W\u00e4hrung im Bankensystem erm\u00f6glichen und die Finanzstabilit\u00e4t f\u00f6rdern.</p><p>Eine damit zusammenh\u00e4ngende Frage ist, ob man sich auf Big-Tech-Unternehmen verlassen sollte, wenn es darum geht, Systeme f\u00fcr grenz\u00fcberschreitende Zahlungen aufzubauen, die zum Beispiel globale \u00abstable coins\u00bb nutzen. \u00abStable coins\u00bb m\u00fcssen den \u00fcberzeugenden Beweis, wie sie diese Zahlungen zu verbessern verm\u00f6gen, zwar erst noch erbringen. Sie zwingen aber den \u00f6ffentlichen Sektor, die Probleme des bestehenden Systems anzugehen.</p><p>Angesichts des Hypes um Kryptow\u00e4hrungen und der manchenorts ge\u00e4usserten Erwartung an die Zentralbanken, sie sollten selber Digitalgeld f\u00fcr Verbraucher ausgeben, m\u00fcssen wir uns den Unterschied zwischen der Architektur und der Technologie - zwischen der Neuerfindung des Geldes und der Optimierung von dessen Funktionsweise - vergegenw\u00e4rtigen. Digitales Zentralbankgeld stellt einen technischen Fortschritt dar und k\u00f6nnte das Finanzsystem verbessern, es ist aber keine Neuerfindung des Geldes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Agust\u00edn Carstens</emphasis> ist Generaldirektor der Bank f\u00fcr Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich (BIZ).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZZ-issueNZZ20191126article0251988317</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKJ-P251-JDRR-B4N9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">12122</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 AG f\u00fcr Die Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung NZZ Alle Rechte vorbehalten</copyright><publicationName>Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung (Internationale Ausgabe) &amp;

Dieser Prozess vollzieht sich in beispiellosem Tempo. Die Informationstechnologie dringt tief in den Finanzdienstleistungsbereich vor - vom Markteintritt der Big-Tech-Unternehmen bis zur Nutzung mobiler Zahlungs-Apps - und stellt damit die traditionelle Finanzinfrastruktur vor immense Herausforderungen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ich finde, die Zentralbanken m\u00fcssten die Initiative ergreifen und eine Schl\u00fcsselrolle bei der Optimierung der Zahlungssicherheit und -effizienz spielen. Mit der Lancierung des BIS Innovation Hub kommt der Bank f\u00fcr Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich (BIZ) dabei eine f\u00fchrende Rolle zu. Der Hub hat den Auftrag, wichtige Trends in der Entwicklung neuer Finanztechnologie zu erkennen und zu erforschen und \u00f6ffentliche G\u00fcter zur Verbesserung der globalen Finanzsysteme zu entwickeln, und er bietet den Zentralbanken eine neue Diskussionsplattform.</p><p>In der ersten Phase werden drei Hubs er\u00f6ffnet\u00a0- in Hongkong, Singapur und in der Schweiz. Der mit der Schweizerischen Nationalbank als Partner betriebene Hub wird untersuchen, welche Vorteile sich aus der Umwandlung von finanziellen Verm\u00f6genswerten und W\u00e4hrungen in digitales Token-Geld ergeben, wenn die Abwicklung von Wertschriftentransaktionen mit Zentralbankgeld auf einer einzigen Plattform erfolgen kann.</p><p>Singapur wird den Fokus auf Technologien zur Bankenregulierung und Finanzaufsicht legen sowie auf die Entwicklung grundlegender \u00f6ffentlicher digitaler Infrastruktur. In Hongkong wiederum wird der Einsatz der Distributed-Ledger-Technologie (DLT) in der Aussenhandelsfinanzierung im Mittelpunkt stehen.</p><p>Eine zentrale Frage f\u00fcr die BIZ ist dabei: Muss Geld von Grund auf neu erfunden oder sollte bloss seine Bereitstellung und Nutzung verbessert werden?  Unseres Erachtens gen\u00fcgt Letzteres. Dabei bleibt eine vertrauensw\u00fcrdige offizielle W\u00e4hrung, die es dem \u00f6ffentlichen und dem privaten Sektor erm\u00f6glicht, die eigenen St\u00e4rken am besten zu nutzen, die sicherste Grundlage f\u00fcr eine tragf\u00e4hige digitale Wirtschaft.</p><p> Die grosse St\u00e4rke von Zentralbanken liegt darin, eine grundlegende Infrastruktur f\u00fcr das Geldsystem bereitzustellen. Der private Sektor wiederum l\u00e4uft zur Hochform auf, wenn er seinen Innovationsgeist voll und ganz in den Dienst seiner Kunden stellen kann.</p><p>Viele Zentralbanken beaufsichtigen bereits effiziente, schnelle nationale Zahlungsverkehrssysteme, doch manchenorts bleibt noch viel zu tun. Und die grenz\u00fcberschreitenden Zahlungsverkehrssysteme m\u00fcssen dringend verbessert werden. Dies ist nicht nur eine Frage der Technologie, sondern auch der Koordination von Standards und Praxen zwischen den einzelnen L\u00e4ndern.</p><p>Wir finden, dass man dabei die digitale Finanzstruktur als \u00f6ffentliches Gut sehen sollte: Durch freien Zugang wird Innovation gef\u00f6rdert, und durch den regulatorischen Rahmen werden gleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen f\u00fcr neue Marktteilnehmer geschaffen. Der private Sektor sollte sie nicht selber bereitstellen, sondern k\u00f6nnte die \u00f6ffentliche Infrastruktur nutzen und sich auf kundenorientierte Dienstleistungen und Produkte konzentrieren.</p><p>Private m\u00fcssten nach wie vor die regulatorischen Standards und die Auflagen der Regulierungsbeh\u00f6rden - einschliesslich Verbraucherschutzvorschriften - einhalten, Geldw\u00e4sche bek\u00e4mpfen und Terrorismusfinanzierung verhindern. Eine solche Modernisierung des Zahlungsverkehrssystems sollte einen Rund-um-die-Uhr-Betrieb mit sofortiger Abwicklung in der offiziellen W\u00e4hrung im Bankensystem erm\u00f6glichen und die Finanzstabilit\u00e4t f\u00f6rdern.</p><p>Eine damit zusammenh\u00e4ngende Frage ist, ob man sich auf Big-Tech-Unternehmen verlassen sollte, wenn es darum geht, Systeme f\u00fcr grenz\u00fcberschreitende Zahlungen aufzubauen, die zum Beispiel globale \u00abstable coins\u00bb nutzen. \u00abStable coins\u00bb m\u00fcssen den \u00fcberzeugenden Beweis, wie sie diese Zahlungen zu verbessern verm\u00f6gen, zwar erst noch erbringen. Sie zwingen aber den \u00f6ffentlichen Sektor, die Probleme des bestehenden Systems anzugehen.</p><p>Angesichts des Hypes um Kryptow\u00e4hrungen und der manchenorts ge\u00e4usserten Erwartung an die Zentralbanken, sie sollten selber Digitalgeld f\u00fcr Verbraucher ausgeben, m\u00fcssen wir uns den Unterschied zwischen der Architektur und der Technologie - zwischen der Neuerfindung des Geldes und der Optimierung von dessen Funktionsweise - vergegenw\u00e4rtigen. Digitales Zentralbankgeld stellt einen technischen Fortschritt dar und k\u00f6nnte das Finanzsystem verbessern, es ist aber keine Neuerfindung des Geldes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Agust\u00edn Carstens</emphasis> ist Generaldirektor der Bank f\u00fcr Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich (BIZ).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZZ-issueINZZ20191126article0251981378</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKJ-P251-JDRR-B4H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">12122</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 AG f\u00fcr Die Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung NZZ Alle Rechte vorbehalten</copyright><publicationName>Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung (Internationale Ausgabe) &amp;

Cloud technologies and AI can help banks weather changes brought by COVID-19 and distinguish their offerings in the the long term.</p><p>Before Coronavirus, the 2020s were already being framed as the decade for digital bank transformation. Such changes reflected a mounting hunger for must-have innovations including seamless, hyper-personalised user experiences.</p><p>This shift also reflected a practical need for more efficient operations as well as increasing pressures for banks to boost their return on equities and decrease cost-income ratios. Meanwhile, systems such as Open Banking (allowing third party applications access to bank accounts) was disrupting the industry, splitting the value chain into distribution and manufacturing and increasing competition from new entrants such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.What is the World Economic Forum doing about the coronavirus outbreak?</p><p>Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic requires global cooperation among governments, international organizations and the business community, which is at the centre of the World Economic Forum\u2019s mission as the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation.How can we collaborate to stop the spread of COVID-19?</p><p>Since its launch on 11 March, the Forum\u2019s COVID Action Platform has brought together 1,667 stakeholders from 1,106 businesses and organizations to mitigate the risk and impact of the unprecedented global health emergency that is COVID-19.</p><p>The platform is created with the support of the World Health Organization and is open to all businesses and industry groups, as well as other stakeholders, aiming to integrate and inform joint action.</p><p>As an organization, the Forum has a track record of supporting efforts to contain epidemics. In 2017, at our Annual Meeting, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was launched \u2013 bringing together experts from government, business, health, academia and civil society to accelerate the development of vaccines. CEPI is currently supporting the race to develop a vaccine against this strand of the coronavirus.</p><p>COVID-19 is accelerating these demands. It\u2019s even changing consumers\u2019 behaviours, pushing them to consider new tools and technologies. A March 2020 survey by Lightico found that 82% of customers were concerned about visiting their branch in person and that 63% of those polled were now more willing to try digital applications. These shifts will be long-lasting.</p><p>To understand banking\u2019s shifting needs, Temenos partners with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) each year for a global study on the future of banking. Research is based on interviews with more than 300 banking business Executives from retail, commercial and private banks. Over half of those surveyed are at C-suite level. This year, the study took place amid the COVID-19 crisis. The results give a fascinating insight into banking leaders\u2019 approach to these unprecedented times, as well as how they see their industry in the years to come.</p><p>The findings suggest three trends which will shape the future of the banking industry:</p><p>1. New technologies will drive banking transformation over the next 5 years</p><p>A large majority of respondents to the survey (66%) cited new technologies as having the biggest impact in banking over the next five years. This represents a 57% increase from last year\u2019s figure, which could reflect the impact of the Coronavirus crisis. Customer demands, shifting external environments and external competitors also featured. However, new technology provides the tools to fend off many of these issues \u2013 such as new competition from Big Tech.</p><p>One technology which has seen increased demand both from new entrants and established banks is Cloud and Software as a Service (SaaS). It has low infrastructure costs, lets products be created and changed quickly, and offers resilience, scalability and security. 84% of respondents believe that Cloud technology will be transformative in banking. Cloud also featured in the top three technology investment priorities for banks, with more than a quarter of executives naming it as a primary focus.</p><p>Cloud and SaaS has allowed banks to operate with an agility and speed usually associated with their fintech competitors. In just three weeks, Atlantic Union Bank in the US used a cloud-based SaaS solution to fund over $1.4bn in US Government Paycheck Protection Program loans for 6,500 businesses. EQ bank - Canada\u2019s first digitally-born bank \u2013 has used the scalability of Cloud to meet the surge in digital demand and recently reach $3 billion in deposits.Have you read?</p><p>This is how digital banking could boost China\u2019s economy China is fast becoming the world leader in mobile payment</p><p>2. Artificial intelligence will separate the winners from the losers in banking</p><p>Of all advanced technologies, banking leaders strongly believe (77%) that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be the most game-changing.</p><p>They see a diverse range of uses for AI. Front of mind is improving customer experience through personalisation. Many banks also see the potential for AI to support new business. Some private banks, for example, are using advanced investment algorithms to strengthen their portfolio management. Finally, because digital transformation is an end-to-end process, respondents are targeting deployment in fraud detection and back office functions in their future business plans.</p><p>Developing AI platforms was the focus of technology investment for 33% of executives globally. This was second only to cybersecurity \u2013 an unsurprising leader given widespread concerns about data breaches and cybercime.</p><p>For AI in banking to be viable, it must be explainable. If AI helps a bank decide not to offer a loan, that can be life-changing and customers will need a reason why. Regulators are thus increasingly requiring explainability. For example, the EU\u2019s GDPR has introduced a \u2018right to explanation\u2019 of the output from new technologies like AI algorithms. This is one reason that 42% of respondents to our report cited \u2018regulation around new technology\u2019 as one of the most impactful trends for the industry over the next five years.</p><p>Explainability also provides an opportunity for banks to build better relationships. It allows customers to understand why a negative decision was reached and could provide customers with steps that would help rectify this.</p><p>3. Banks will overhaul their business models to create digital ecosystems</p><p>Finally, our report shows that digital transformation is beginning to change business models in banking. More than 80% of respondents believe that banking will become part of a platform of services. And 45% are committed to transforming their business models into digital ecosystems and making the bank the centre of these platforms.</p><p>Over the past few decades, technology has had an evolutionary effect on banks\u2019 business models. First, services moved out of the branch and onto the Internet. Then banks went mobile \u2013 allowing customers access to key services from nearly anywhere through devices like tablets and phones. The services themselves didn\u2019t change though, only the method of access.</p><p>The ecosystem model takes these changes further. Customers interact with the products and services they need through their banking apps. These are based on intuitive, self-learning software, which allows offerings to be enhanced and added in response to customer needs. Such technology brings new value and an entirely new customer experience. While mobile brought banking into everyday lives, ecosystems integrate our everyday lives with banking. They bring many key elements of modern banking technology \u2013 such as cloud, explainable AI, and open APIs \u2013 together into one seamless user journey.</p><p>Early success stories include Partners Federal Credit Union - which serves the Walt Disney Company. To serve users\u2019 increasingly digital expectations, Partners developed an app that offers core banking, coupons from local merchants and an education portal where members can enhance their money management skills. A built-in feedback function informs innovative new features. This includes mobile check cashing, where image recognition and verification technology allows members to make deposits directly from their smart devices.</p><p>After launching the app, Partners was adding 1,800 new users each month, resulting in a 20 percent increase in remote deposits and a 64 percent increase in mobile card payments.</p><p>A unique opportunity</p><p>The current environment is undoubtedly challenging for banks. The behavioural and economic effects of the coronavirus crisis will be profound, and come on top of lingering financial, operational and consumer pressures.</p><p>But banks still have capital, compliance and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 the customers\u2019 trust. This means that, with the right strategy, banks have a unique opportunity to succeed in the long term. Pursuing advanced technology and digital ecosystems will be key to that success.

SuperAwesome[2]'s 'kidtech' infrastructure is used by hundreds of kids companies, such as Mattel, Disney,Hasbro, and Lego to enable kid-safe content, advertising, and other digital services. </p><p>The company has defined the digital standards which nowkeep more than half a billion children anonymous when they engage with online games and videos.

We're delightedto welcome Harbert European Growth Capital as a partner,' said Dylan Collins, SuperAwesome CEO, in a statement. 'In the light of the continuing controversies around Big Tech capturing personal data on children, it's never beenmore important to have infrastructure which can enable safe, anonymous digital engagement forchildren online. We are seeing an overwhelming response by responsible companieseverywhere for this.' Above: SuperAwesome targets appropriate ads at kids. Image Credit: SuperAwesomeSuperAwesome said itincreased revenue by more than 75 percent in 2018, reaching a revenue run rate of almost $60 million. Several factors have driven the company's growth:SuperAwesome's Popjam platform has become the community management tool ofchoice for young influencers and brands interacting with their under-13 audience onYouTube. The rapid decline of kids TV is shifting vast amounts of digital dollars into the kids audience, which now requires specific privacy-based technology. It is compliant with the U.S. COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and Europe's GDPR-K (General Data Protection Regulation). Growing focus on children's digital privacy: New laws are mandating specific zero-data 'kidtech' to ensure children are kept anonymous with all digital interactions. AOL/Oath was recently fined $5M for illegally capturing personal data on an under-13 audience.SuperAwesome also disclosed growing levels of profitability, significantly beating their targets. 'We are thrilled to be able to support SuperAwesome's growth plans as part of this capitalraise,' said Johan Kampe, senior managing director at Harbert European Growth Capital, in a statement. SuperAwesome also revealed plans to launch a dedicated kids ad-based video-on-demand service (AVOD), offeringcompletely free streaming content to children. 'As the infrastructure behindthe kids digital media ecosystem, including the largest kid-safe ad delivery platform, we are in aunique position to enable an AVOD service built specifically for the privacy and safety needs ofthe industry,' Collins said. 'In particular there is a huge requirement for a dedicated platform focused on theneeds of family YouTubers and influencers who have very large under-13 audiences but simplycan't be serviced by YouTube because of its design as an adult platform.'

His presidency appears, although it began with a White House tech summit, to be either avoiding them or outsourcing the president's policies to business-friendly conservatives.</p><p>That lack of clarity comes as tech creeps ever deeper into our lives and commerce.</p><p>Think about rules governing companies that provide you internet service. The Obama administration stood, if inconsistently, for net neutrality -- the idea that all traffic on the web should be treated equally.</p><p>The internet as you know it has worked on that principle. It's why your cable or cellphone company can't block or slow down data from one app or website to favor rivals that have paid for express-lane treatment. So when AT&amp;T excluded its own video app from cellphone data caps, it ran into trouble with the FCC.</p><p>Trump's FCC boss, Ajit Pai, in late April moved to undo some Obama-era net neutrality rules. The broadband industry likes that. It says the rules that stand in the way of being able to charge Netflix, Hulu or some future app for special delivery privileges discourage investment in better broadband. </p><p>Most wireless companies want to ditch net neutrality, as well. And they object to being treated by the same rules as cable companies. </p><p>Sprint's position is different. </p><p>CEO Marcelo Claure has said dumping the regulation would help industry leaders Verizon and AT&amp;T \"drive us out of business.\" </p><p>The two big players are gobbling up content providers such as DirecTV and AOL. In a net neutrality-free world, those acquisitions could give VIP treatment for their programming companies. The big guys could bulk up even more, leaving Sprint looking that much scrawnier.</p><p>Meantime, Trump has yet to nominate new policymakers to the FCC, leaving in doubt which direction the agency might head. </p><p>Pai has argued for reclassifying internet carriers for regulation by the Federal Trade Commission. Its powers are weaker, able to punish a company for bad behavior after a violation rather than forbidding it ahead of time.</p><p>All that makes the tech regulation at least as uncertain 100-days-and-counting as when Trump first started tweeting from the White House on Day One.</p><p>More Digital Life stories </p><p>Louisville to get Google Fiber, hints for KC's future</p><p>Verizon plans to offer Google Fiber-like speeds to millions</p><p>'Nobody's got to use the internet.'
