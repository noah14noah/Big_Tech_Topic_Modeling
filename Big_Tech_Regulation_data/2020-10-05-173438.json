During Tuesday's hearing with Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, he cited examples of each company engaging in anticompetitive behavior to privilege their platforms. It was the second hearing on the topic since the House Judiciary Committee announced a bipartisan tech industry investigation (see 1906110072).</p><p>Ranking member Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., questioned Democratic calls to break up big tech companies, proposals he said likely won't solve privacy concerns and other issues. Antitrust laws don't exist to punish companies because they're big, he said. The most successful companies often become very big, not because of anticompetitive conduct, but because they offer the best services, he said.</p><p>Representatives for each of the four companies argued tech sector competition is thriving. They listed a multitude of companies and industries that threaten their platforms' market shares.</p><p>\"The notion that they all see themselves in fierce competition strains credulity,\" Cicilline told reporters. He cited remarks from Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. \"This investigation has to look beyond the words of these companies and their own characterization of their behavior or their market dominance,\" Cicilline added. Fortunately it's not up to the companies to characterize themselves, Cicilline continued, saying the final result will be a \"fact-based determination.\" Industry obviously can't regulate itself, and the solution will require action from policymakers, either through regulation, new statutory enactments, new resources for antitrust enforcers or most likely a combination of the three, he said.</p><p>Cicilline claimed Amazon is responsible for more than half of e-commerce, Facebook accounts for about 60 percent of the social media market, and Apple has \"complete and unprecedented power\" over people's devices. There's not been a single antitrust enforcement challenge to some 400 acquisitions by Google and Facebook, he said. Lawmakers need to ensure antitrust policies are in place to allow the next Amazon, Apple, Facebook or Google to grow, he said.</p><p>In addition to emerging firms, Google competes with companies across various developing fields, Economic Policy Director Adam Cohen testified. He listed operating systems, mobile devices and apps, voice assistants, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, cloud computing, digital advertising and video sharing.</p><p>There's \"vigorous\" competition in a \"rapidly evolving and dynamic\" online environment, testified Facebook Global Policy Development Head Matt Perault. Facebook's competitors for photo and video sharing, messaging and advertising include: Twitter, Snapchat, Apple, iMessage, Pinterest, Skype, Telegram, Viber, Google, YouTube and Amazon, he said.</p><p>Amazon Associate General Counsel-Litigation and Regulatory Legal Nate Sutton cited \"intense competition from well-established competitors\" like Walmart, Target, Macy's, Safeway and Kroger. He said that's in addition to thousands of retailers across the world.</p><p>Of the some 2 million apps in Apple's App Store, only a small number are made by Apple, testified Vice President-Corporate Law and Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer. The store allows \"enormous opportunity for developers to reach millions of users overnight, and the vast majority of apps, over 84 percent ... share none of the revenue they make from our store with Apple,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook engages in anticompetitive behavior through buying up competitors, said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. Perault denied the suggestion, saying acquisitions are meant to bring value to Facebook products and noting that not all purchases end up benefiting the company. Jayapal also accused Amazon of stealing ideas from independent sellers and offering copy-cat products via Amazon. The platform offers the occasional private brand, Sutton said.</p><p>Antitrust law is dictated by the hard-fought consensus that it should focus on consumer welfare, testified ex-Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen, now at Baker Botts. Antitrust enforcement has also evolved with emerging technologies, she said. If policymakers seek to adjust antitrust law, they should understand the underlying court interpretations, \"application of that law to particular types of anticompetitive behavior in defined markets\" and \"the boundaries between antitrust law and regulation,\" she said.</p><p>The U.S. might be entering a startup \"winter,\" testified Columbia Law School professor Tim Wu, citing statistics of a decline in American startups from the Brookings Institution and Labor Department. Instead of dreaming of creating innovative services, entrepreneurs are trending in the direction of dreaming up ways of getting bought by large corporations, he said: \"We are becoming a country of giant concerns, admirable in their way, but where incremental improvement is the norm, where bureaucracy rules, and stagnation may be inevitable.\" Yale economics professor Fiona Scott Morton rejected the argument that the incentive to be bought up is fueling innovation. The reality is that such incentives inspire entrepreneurs to create services that model the incumbents, offering nothing new for consumers, she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKY-MRG1-DYRJ-017T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Close to half of these pieces of legislation deal with combating money laundering and terrorist financing, a theme consistent with the efforts of regulators in other countries. Armada to Help Banks Identify Suspicious Crypto Transactions CipherTrace announced the news of the Armada launch via a press release[3] issued on Tuesday (April 28, 2020). According to the press statement, the Armada tool will help banks and financial institutions in the U.S. plug blind spots and gray areas associated with crypto transactions.As part of the announcement, the crypto forensics company revealed that Armada interfaces with the know-your-customer (KYC) protocols already being utilized by banks while providing on-ramps to its vast network of monitoring infrastructure that covers more than 500 virtual asset providers (VASPs).According to CipherTrace, with the Armada tool, banks can develop more robust anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) protocols. </p><p>The announcement also highlighted other features relating to the enhancement of due-diligence and risk profiling of crypto clients for banks[4].Commenting on the importance of a tool like Armada, CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans pointed to cases of money laundering associated with cryptos and banks caught in the middle of these activities.Jevans recalled the enforcement action levied against M.Y. Safra Bank by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for the bank's inadequate crypto AML infrastructure.According to the CipherTrace chief:'If M.Y. Safra Bank had deployed Armada to detect illegal cryptocurrency transactions, they would not be scrambling to meet the OCC's requests. Though the OCC did not levy a fine, M.Y Safra Bank must implement an independent BSA audit, monitor and report suspicious activity, institute an independent party to review past activities, and hire a BSA officer and sufficient supporting staff \u2014 all within 180 days.'While the Armada tool is designed for banks, CipherTrace has also collaborated with exchanges[5] to aid the latter in becoming more regulatory compliant. As previously reported[6] by Blockonomi, CipherTrace has partnered with the likes of Rakuten[7] and Binance[8] for better AML protection. AML and CFT a Major Focus for U.S. Cryptocurrency Legislation AML and CFT are among the major concerns of U.S. lawmakers concerning cryptos judging from the focus areas of the cryptocurrency bills currently before Congress. Of the 32 of such pieces of legislation, 12 deal with developing laws to combat money laundering and terrorist financing orchestrated via virtual currencies[9].The majority of the bills[10] under consideration, however, aim to clarify the country's crypto regulatory climate, as well as streamlined tax rules. Pundits like former U.S. Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang have described the country's cryptocurrency regulations as hodgepodge[11].Indeed, several stakeholders[12] have identified the patchwork[13] of State and Federal laws affecting crypto businesses as being a stumbling block to the country's advancement in the emerging digital economy.Some lawmakers are also wary of the entry of 'big tech' like Facebook into the crypto and broader financial market scene. Some of the currently proposed bills seek to place strict regulatory hurdles on the path of projects like Libra.Other Libra-related bills contain arguments for big tech companies entering the finance sector[14] to obtain bank holding company licenses to bring them under the purview of strict Federal regulatory guidelines. 1,041 [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/cryptocurrency-exchanges\">https://blockonomi.com/cryptocurrency-exchanges</url>/ [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/regulation\">https://blockonomi.com/regulation</url>/ [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ciphertrace-launches-armada-financial-institutions-130000656.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ciphertrace-launches-armada-financial-institutions-130000656.html</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/digital-app-banks\">https://blockonomi.com/digital-app-banks</url>/ [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/exchanges\">https://blockonomi.com/exchanges</url>/ [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/ciphertrace-crypto-exchanges-clampdown\">https://blockonomi.com/ciphertrace-crypto-exchanges-clampdown</url>/ [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/rakuten-partners-ciphertrace-for-its-exchange\">https://blockonomi.com/rakuten-partners-ciphertrace-for-its-exchange</url>/ [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/binance-teams-with-ciphertrace\">https://blockonomi.com/binance-teams-with-ciphertrace</url>/ [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/coinbase-promo-code\">https://blockonomi.com/coinbase-promo-code</url>/ [ 10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/us-politician-unveils-crypto-currency-act\">https://blockonomi.com/us-politician-unveils-crypto-currency-act</url>/ [ 11]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/yang-says-better-crypto-regulation-needed\">https://blockonomi.com/yang-says-better-crypto-regulation-needed</url>/ [ 12]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/circle-crypto-winter-staff-laid-off-funding-goal-cut-regulators-bashed\">https://blockonomi.com/circle-crypto-winter-staff-laid-off-funding-goal-cut-regulators-bashed</url>/ [ 13]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/global-finance-authority-step-up-crypto-regulation\">https://blockonomi.com/global-finance-authority-step-up-crypto-regulation</url>/ [ 14]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/finance\">https://blockonomi.com/finance</url>/ </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BLOC10009530158817334992125876100078</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BLOC-10009530</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSR-0Y21-JCMN-Y40V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><timeReceived>3:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Blockonomi</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>AML</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Privacy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cryptocurrency Money Laundering</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CipherTrace</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CoinTracking</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Regulation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Anti-Money Laundering</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

We live in a world shaped by an original Marxist economic model that developed itself into a socialist centralised model, which coexists now with a (paradoxically) neo-liberal hyper-capitalist model. The current system is thus fragmented, which affects the governments in practice. </p><p>The challenge is that all of these models are increasingly dependent on energies that are not sustainable and the digital centralised technologies that make them happen. The global economy, with all its paradoxes, is based on energies developed in the last 200 years (energies such as coal and oil) and more recently, 50 years of digital technologies (technologies, digital models, processors hardware and software). The inception of the internet provoked an acceleration of disruptive technological models.

The foundations for the concept of a circular economyCircular Economy, Sustainable Innovation, IOT and Blockchain. A driven by sustainable innovation that balances consumption and production in key markets and industries is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, and the\u00a0dispose). The circular economy model advocates the keeping of resources in use for as long as possible, the extraction of the maximum value from them whilst in use, then the regeneration of products and materials at the end of each service life. Blockchain distributed ledger technologies in balance with AI and IOT can create a trust economy, which separates and/or reduces the collusion between centralised corporate power and governments in key organisations, countries, while holding them accountable and liable. These emergent disruptive technologies can increase collective responsibility for each other and the planet, and help reduce the polarisation of societies. Can blockchain facilitate the transition of the global ecosystem into a greener and peaceful Can blockchain facilitate the transition of the global ecosystem into a greener and peaceful future? In order for this to happen the question is who takes over these disruptive technologies\u00a0and if they are developed for centralised or decentralised purposes. Top questions for any company that wants to look at blockchain: 1. How much time do you spend using online tools? (emails, social media, researching, data, analytics, offline? answer by percentage (try to detail time - one hour day or more?) 2. How much do you know about disruptive technologies such as AI, Smart Identity, IOT, Quantum Computing, Smart Cities, Bitcoin, VR? more than 50% or less? 3. How familiar are you with the concept of digital transformation applied to organisations? more than 50% or less? 4. Do you know what are distributed ledgers technologies or smart contracts? I have a clue, I have no clue / less than 50% more than 50%? 5. What do you know about blockchain? I have a clue, I have no clue / less than 50% more than 50%? 6. What do you think blockchain can do for your organisation? comment 1 line? don't know? 7. What are your top 5 priorities?      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Survey-charities-and-blockchain-relations.png\">http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Survey-charities-and-blockchain-relations.png</url> infographic with areas of consideration for companies looking blockchain relations, source CAF 2. Blockchain considerations regarding 360 multi-sector areas\u00a0 Other questions, considerations to think and reflect: Blockchain and Digital transformation Blockchain education - context Blockchain campaign - calls to action - how to use Blockchain technology and how to use it Blockchain and financial inclusion Blockchain and multiple areas of usage Blockchain and supply change Blockchain and smart contracts Blockchain risks and opportunities Blockchain and governments Blockchain decentralised Blockchain centralised and its risks Blockchain usage comes at a massively increased processing overhead. Its potential is shaped by different kinds of performance, and its use will definitely bring us new considerations and unexpected trade-offs. Getting there, therefore, will not be simple and will require a number of trade-offs: Getting there, therefore, will not be simple and will require a number of trade-offs: 1. Blockchain is an evolving disruptive concept, technology and is not the end game or solution for all problems. It has to be taken under right consideration and within concrete needs and focus. 2. Peer to peer IoT blockchain driven organisations are going to be more powerful than ever if they use technology and their own focus in the right way. But there will some sensitive key questions about control and special understanding technology, legislations and being in continuous change. 3. Blockchain is a complex and fast-changing tech that makes sense partly through the lens of the so-called sharing economy or circular economy, which is paradoxically managed and powered by big tech players software and community digitally driven platforms. So manage blockchain implies master tech and digital and understand the 360 implications of digital transformation. 4. As previously electricity changed all the infrastructure of society, IOT and blockchain are operating the same 360 degrees revolution. 5. Why? Mostly because it is enabling a full disruption of the concept of middlemen that powers most of the world economy business models and infrastructures. Moreover brings the Peer to Peer commons models of society to a new level and last but not least it will create a powerful digital identity for all the 7 billion humans in the world and the things around them. 6. This is profoundly challenging and brings a lot of new ownership questions and special ethical questions, as governments, organisations and other corporations are laying down of a whole new infrastructure. 7. There will be concerns about local versus global Blockchain usage and issues questions with local and government controls 8. Blockchain technology is reshaping many sectors such as the energy and the supply chain industries 9. Retail Vs. Institutional IoT blockchain media, infrastructure driven communities; 10. A critical element is the Open versus close IoT blockchain infrastructures - who will control all the data; 11. The advent of IoT blockchain digital identity ledgers - digital currencies and global decentralised organisation will need co-ordination is an opportunity and a challenge; 12. Big data / Social Media / Blockchain tech bring new security and identity big questions. Cyber full hacking will happen more than ever, the IoT driven-disruption, platforms and social - creating smart identity - social identity - governmental - energy - supply chain - financial disruption will touch and disrupt the way we behave as humans and in society. 13. As with previous tech disruption blockchain has more fundamental capacity of full disruption and as with any previous society development can be used for total control of society or for full decentralisation and build a circular economy. 3. Circular Economy, Blockchain and new operating models The benefits of blockchain technology are creating new operating models for many types of organizations. Charities, which manage large amounts of money, require complex accounting and conduct a lot of research, have much to gain from blockchain technology as digital transactions and smart technology increase. \u2022 Can digital tokens and coloured coins that represent assets create a way to make donations of intangible assets like intellectual property?\u2022 Can self-governing contracts provide new opportunities for businesses to embed philanthropy as well as new ways for charities to raise funds and address social problems?\u2022 Can the blockchain offer a 'radical transparency' to overcome the lack of public trust?\u2022 Will the 'Internet Of Things' supported by blockchain technology deliver an environment in which smart machines become a 'hyper-rational' donor class? Cost a distributed ledger reduces the cost of storageSecurity client-side encryption is superiorSpeed the power of a decentralised distributed network trumps a centralised server. Key features of the blockchain are:\u2022 Transparency: The ledger is public and can be seen by any user. Any system based on it is fully transparent.\u2022 Reduced transaction costs: The ledger is maintained and owned by users, so there is no need for a third party, thereby reducing associated costs.\u2022 Building trust: Since blockchain technology eliminates the need for third parties and makes transactions open, it could deliver major benefits in improving trust.\u2022 Integrating the physical and the digital: Blockchain technology provides a way to represent any asset, tangible or not, in the digital world. It does this in a way that ownership status can be identified at any point in time while being completely integrated with digital payment mechanisms. In practice, the potential of the blockchain is so powerful that nine major banks, including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, have joined partnership with one another to invest and develop the technology. Santander estimates that the blockchain can save banks up to $20 billion a year in infrastructure costs by eliminating central authorities and bypassing slow, expensive payment networks. As with any new technology there are challenges to overcome from a legal, regulatory and political perspective. Security and permissions are high on the financial services agenda, as is the need to fit the blockchain technology into a market environment that is far more than exchange and proof of value. 4. Conclusion - Circular Economy, Digital Transformation, IOT and Blockchain: Opportunities and Challenges There is no doubt about the opportunities of blockchain in increasing transparency and openness, while reducing costs. The challenge is how to manage this and organise. Any company would be able to view details of any transaction. Because the blockchain is owned and maintained by all users, it removes the need for third parties and the transaction costs that come with them. Smart contracts for giving. Smart contracts are computer protocols underpinned by blockchain technology. While traditional contracts require a third party to manage them and execute terms, smart contracts are designed to be independent and self-executing - for instance by triggering payments when certain conditions are met. This could be a significant boost for international charities working in countries where reliable third parties are difficult to come by. Such contracts could also be used by businesses to fulfil pledges on their charitable contributions. An 'internet of things' which automates philanthropy. With everyday household appliances like energy meters, fridges, toasters and washing machines increasing being connected to the internet, blockchain technology could provide a mechanism to allow these objects to connect seamlessly to each other and to users. They would be able to sell spare processing capacity to the blockchain in exchange for money. Using smart contracts, they could even decide how to spend the money, and which charities to give to. Opening up news ways for people to give. Experts believe that blockchain technology could lead to a fundamental rethink of how we think about asset ownership and lead to a growing 'sharing economy' as typified by services like ZipCar, Uber and AirBnB. Donations of spare physical capacity could provide new ways of addressing social problems. For example, smart buildings could be used to create new systems for identifying and allocating unused accommodation, which could be used to address the challenge of rough sleeping. Firstly, they are autonomous. They run on their own, without any person or company in charge.Secondly, they are permanent. They're like global computers with 100 percent uptime. Because the contents of the database is copied across thousands of computers, if 99 per cent of the computers running it were taken offline, the records would remain accessible and the network could rebuild itself.Thirdly, they are secure. The encryption used on blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum is industry standard, open source, and has never been broken. Their ledgers are what is known as 'cryptographically auditable', which means you can be mathematically certain that their entries have not been forged.Fourthly, they are open, allowing anyone to develop products and services on them, and allowing anyone to audit the code. Blockchain and Internet of Things. People have been thinking about the Internet of Things (IoT) for a while, but unless you're a tech fan, you're probably not exactly sure what it is. Essentially the idea is to give physical objects identities on the internet. Just like your computer or phone are connected to the internet now, in the not too distant future, so too will your car, house, fridge, and almost anything else you can imagine. This allows them to be controlled remotely, and talk to each other. Imagine, for example, appliances that barter with each other for electricity at peak times, cars that negotiate and pay each other for road space, or a bridge that tells vehicles to slow down because there is ice on it. This isn't just a pipe dream, research and advisory firm Gartner\u00a0estimates[1]\u00a0that by 2020, 20.8 billion 'things' will be connected to the internet. But what does this have to do with blockchain technology? As global corporation suhc as IBM and Samsung point out in their recent\u00a0report[2], blockchain technology solves a number of problems that have thus far hindered the development of the Internet of Things. These can be summarised as: cost, trust and future proofing (permanence). For IoT firms, the cost of supporting billions of smart devices will be substantial. In place of centralised clouds and large server farms, blockchains allow IoT firms to outsource infrastructure provision to the places in the world with the lowest costs (2[3]). As a blockchain is a shared system, these costs are also shared between all of its users, eliminating redundancy and increasing efficiency. On the subject of trust, the authors of the Samsung and IBM paper write: 'In the post-Snowden era, it is evident that trust in the Internet is over Current security models based on closed source approaches are obsolete and must be replaced by a newer approach - security through transparency. For this, a shift to open source is required.'. Blockchains are both open source and also 'trustless' meaning that you don't have to rely on any human, instead relying on the consensus of the network.Transparent Supply Chains / Notary ServicesAt the beginning of the blog I said that blockchains are open and permanent. That's really important for businesses based on transparency and trust. Immutable, open ledgers provide a neutral space where companies can prove exactly where their products and components are on the supply chain at any given time, and consumers can trace the source of their purchases. There are a number of startups in this field: Everledger[4], currently being incubated in the Barclays accelerator, is using the Bitcoin blockchain to tackle the problem of counterfeit diamonds. By creating a digital 'DNA' record comprising cut, clarity, color, carat weight and 14 other reference points for each stone, the company is able to create a transparent ledger of diamonds - their origin, ownership history and any processes it has undergone over time. Provenance\u00a0[5]\u00a0is another firm working in this space, providing a service that allows businesses to verifiably share the story behind their products with consumers. The authors of the provenance white paper write: 'Despite various efforts, full 'chains of custody[6]' that tell the stories of products remain largely rudimentary and difficult to verify.\u00a0Fragmentation of these efforts make them open to fraud[7]'. Of course, blockchains change all this. Stampery[8]\u00a0and\u00a0Blockverify[9]\u00a0are two other companies using the bitcoin blockchain to verify all manner of items, from emails and documents to pharmaceuticals. Blockchain and Secure Digital Identity. One of the biggest problems with our attempts at online identity so far has been the risk of centrally managed data. Numerous high profile cases of companies losing vast quantities of data to hackers underlines this issue. The holy grail of online identity is for it to be verifiable without requiring users to give up control of their data. Blockchains use public key cryptography (whose inventors just won The Turing Award) which gives us new ways to solve this problem. ShoCard[10]\u00a0is a company using the bitcoin blockchain to do exactly that. The ShoCard system allows users to control their own data, and share only the data that is relevant. It also removes the necessity to continuously enter (and forget) usernames and passwords.\u00a0Onename[11]\u00a0is another company looking to do a similar thing. The Bitnation\u00a0Blockchain Emergency ID[12]\u00a0is a fascinating take on digital ID using a blockchain. Inspired by stories of passports confiscated from migrant workers, the Emergency ID creates a web of trust so that family members can verify each other's ties. Blockchain and Governance and Government Blockchain technology also opens up lots of possibilities for governments. In a report on the matter this year, the UK Government's Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Mark Walport suggested a number of areas that the technology could assist in, including: Transparency and traceability of how aid money is spentProtecting critical infrastructureRegistering assets such as intellectual property, wills, NHS health data and pensionsReducing benefit fraud Furthermore, the Estonian government, which has a reputation for being one of the world's most technologically progressive governments, is partnering with Bitnation to allow e-residents to notarise their marriages and birth certificates on the Horizon blockchain. The press release reads: 'If a couple get married on the [blockchain], it doesn't mean they get married in the jurisdiction of Estonia, or in any other nation state jurisdiction. Instead, they get married in the 'blockchain jurisdiction'. The blockchain technology provides a worldwide, legally-binding proof of existence and integrity of your contractual agreements.' The most exciting thing about this field is that we have no idea how many more countless innovations blockchain technology will lead to. This really is the beginning of the internet all over again. As in any technology and stage of technical and economic development there is no utopia in blockchain. The truth is that when we fold real world management, permissions, authorities and trust, back on top of the blockchain, we undo the decentralisation at the heart of the design. If we can't get away from administrators then the idealistic peer-to-peer consensus algorithm of blockchain is academic, and simply too much to bear.

And digital technologies are key to making it happen.<br/><br/>Too often, however, the public sector has lagged in digital transformation, with many organizations mired in outmoded technologies, disconnected workers, and frustrated citizens.</p><p><br/><br/>Cisco's Marcus Moffett is working to change all that.<br/><br/>'Government,' Moffett said, 'has moved from laggard on digital transformation to, in a lot of cases, leading the charge.'<br/><br/>As chief technology officer for Cisco's U.S. Public Sector organization, Moffett is in a perfect position to support innovation in communities across the country. That could be ensuring public safety in New Orleans, driving digital literacy in New Mexico, or using video in New York prisons to connect inmates with their children - to name but three projects on which he has been involved.<br/><br/>'We do see government being very innovative in a number of areas,' he said, 'whether you're talking about citizen services, healthcare, the military, or education. Government is taking a very active role with digital transformation.'<br/><br/>Of course, there remain no shortage of challenges in the public sector - including budget shortfalls, regulatory hurdles, and talent gaps.<br/><br/>Not to mention, the rising demands of citizens and government workers. Accustomed to the seamless experiences offered by big tech players and online retailers, many won't tolerate clunky, paper-based government processes, slow response times, or byzantine, opaque bureaucracies.<br/><br/>In response, many government agencies are driving new investments and encouraging innovative solutions.<br/><br/>A rock-solid foundation<br/><br/>For many public sector organizations, it starts with the foundation - through upgrades in network architecture and infrastructure.<br/><br/>'It takes a modern platform,' Moffett said, 'along with modern skills and modern consumption models.'<br/><br/>To empower the workforce, connect citizens in novel new ways, and gain deep, real-time insights via the Internet of Things, a highly secure, flexible network infrastructure is paramount. And it must be built to accommodate ever-increasing torrents of data and future demands from 5G, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies.<br/><br/>'When we talk about the modern platform,' he said of Cisco's technologies, 'from base level connectivity to collaboration to security to what you do in the data center, to the campus core, out to IoT, we've got you covered. So whether it's internal for your own workforce, or external to the citizens, you're able to develop the platform to deliver specific services in a secure fashion.'<br/><br/>Given the unique challenges of public sector organizations, Moffett often gets involved in the funding process - together with Cisco Capital.<br/><br/>'In commercial and enterprise,' Moffett said, 'you show customers what you have and they go find the money. In government, it's the exact opposite. We have to help find the money so that government can move the needle. Everything is done by grants and contracts.'<br/><br/>'With this modern platform,' he said, 'our government customers are taking a more holistic look at their entire technology footprint, and how that supports digital capabilities. Nobody wants to stand in line at a government office for hours to wait for social security cards or licenses or certificates for construction. So government is taking note of the fact that it saves an immense amount of time.'<br/><br/>In New Orleans, for example, the adoption of more than 500 IP video cameras increased public safety and lessened the burden on law enforcement.<br/><br/>'They implemented that technology,' Moffett said, 'and saved over 3,000 man hours just with solving cases more rapidly. Those 3,000 hours given back to law enforcement; they're able to spend more time in the community. Simple things like that give the citizenry more confidence in government.'<br/><br/>Not to mention, the Big Easy is reporting the lowest crime rates in decades. Elsewhere in the city, flood sensors monitor the city's elaborate dykes and levees, while Cisco network technologies coordinate responses among fire, police, and emergency medical services.<br/><br/>Given that many public sector assets - anything from transportation to power utilities - can be high-profile targets, cybersecurity is as essential as physical safety.<br/><br/>'We're a security first company,' Moffett stressed, 'so we always think about security, whether it's at the network layer, using things like MACsec, all the way up to the highest levels of security. Being able to protect the network from end to end is critically important.'<br/><br/>Finding the talent to change the world<br/><br/>In the enterprise space, there's never enough tech talent. And the problem's only compounded in the public sector, where older IT workers are retiring, and younger talent is drawn to the larger salaries offered by enterprises and technology companies.<br/><br/>'They call it the 'silver tsunami',' Moffett said. 'It's really an aging workforce in government. So when you think about new technologies, whether it's artificial intelligence or the way networking is evolving with intent-based networking, your workforce has to be able to keep up. Government struggles to find the money to train people effectively, and attract talent today.'<br/><br/>One trend that benefits public sector organizations, however, is the tendency of workers, especially younger ones, to want to make a difference in the world. Increasingly, it's not all about profit.<br/><br/>'Government has a great opportunity to show people that it's not necessarily what's in your paycheck every week,' Moffett emphasized, 'even though that's very important. There's a lot more that you can do to make the world a better place. And government is the place to do that.'<br/><br/>The talent crunch is especially challenging outside the major cities. Which brings us to another of Moffett's core passions: closing the urban/rural divide. Often talented workers may not want to leave rural areas where they were born and raised, but the opportunities simply aren't there.<br/><br/>'I'm in Mississippi this week,' Moffett said from the family farm where he grew up. 'Mississippi has the same challenge as everybody else. You've got government services that are needed. Technology is what's delivering all of that, yet educating the local workforce who want to stay here versus leave, is a big one.'<br/><br/>Moffett applauds the efforts of Cisco's Network Academy to bring tech skills to underserved areas.<br/><br/>'Cisco Networking Academy have trained over 20 million students since the inception,' he said, 'nearly 2 million last year alone. And absolutely you've started to see this being extended into some rural pilots, in the inner city, and even into prisons.'<br/><br/>Moffett's even more excited about what's to come. Cisco's Internet for the Future will enable a vast new array of capabilities, he believes, especially as emerging technologies like AI and IoT reach their full potential. And the possibilities for the public sector are immense.<br/><br/>'Cisco's running the majority of the Internet,' Moffett explained, 'and has been for a very long time. So we see this as the next wave. So first and foremost, and whether it's data center fabrics, in-campus and wide area networks, or with service provider cores, Cisco's at the heart of connectivity.'<br/><br/>'Technology is just doing a lot of things we haven't had in the past,' he concluded, 'to extend capability to people, and it really is life changing.'<br/><br/>Contact:<br/><br/>Tel: 094462 33618<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7S-H5B1-JD3Y-Y0MK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1265\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

She is currently writing a book about textile artisans. Cisco yesterday 'issued a call to governments and citizens around the world to establish privacy as a fundamental human right in the digital economy,' according to a Cisco press release[1]. Other Big Tech companies have already endorsed drafting a federal privacy law, as reported by Ars Technica in Cisco, like Apple and other tech giants, now wants new federal privacy law.[2] Is this a sign that tech executives have suddenly developed misgivings about how the companies they've created collect and misuse our data? No, not exactly. </p><p>As the New York Times reported in August, in Tech Industry Pursues a Federal Privacy Law, on Its Own Terms[3], in the wake of California adopting a sweeping privacy protection law:In recent months, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft and others have aggressively lobbied officials in the Trump administration and elsewhere to start outlining a federal privacy law, according to administration officials and the companies. The law would have a dual purpose, they said: It would overrule the California law and instead put into place a kinder set of rules that would give the companies wide leeway over how personal digital information was handled.[Jerri-Lynn here: my emphasis.] 'We are committed to being part of the process and a constructive part of the process,' said Dean Garfield, president of a leading tech industry lobbying group, the Information Technology Industry Council, which is working on proposals for the federal law. 'The best way is to work toward developing our own blueprint.'What Has Cisco Proposed? Let's turn to that Cisco press release again, in which the company urges three basic principles for US data privacy legislation:Ensureinteroperability betweendifferentprivacy protection regimes; Avoid fracturing of legal obligations for data privacy through a uniform federal lawthat aligns with the emerging global consensus; Reassure customers that enforcement of privacy rights will be robust without costly and unnecessary litigation.And now, let's examine each of these in turn. First,Ensureinteroperability betweendifferentprivacy protection regimes. The EU implemented its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[4] in May 1918,a change EU GDPR.org called 'the most important change in data privacy regulation in 20 years'(for a summary see here[5]). What Cisco recognizes in making this recommendation is that any change the US would make to its privacy protection regime would need to mesh with the EU framework. I'm not going to focus on this point here, but will instead focus on Cisco's other two points, which concern US domestic privacy law. Second, Avoid fracturing of legal obligations for data privacy through a uniform federal lawthat aligns with the emerging global consensus.The stated concern - over 'fracturing' - merely refers to the cost of having to comply with multiple state regulatory regimes. A recent post in the New Jersey Law Journal,The California Consumer Privacy Act: What You Need to Know[6], for example, outlines what criteria trigger obligations by businesses outside the state to comply with the new California statute. And my post from yesterday, Illinois Supreme Court Affirms Biometric Privacy Law, Clearing the Way for Lawsuits[7], discusses one law firm's assessment of what steps businesses that have employees in Illinois or that operate in the state should consider to avoid liability under the state's biometric statute. Cisco's call to replace this fractured system with a uniform national framework rejects the position Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis set out 1932: that states should act as 'laboratories of democracy', assaying their own policy experiments, before the national government acts on an issue. The best recent example of this I can think of is Colorado's decision to legalize marijuana five years ago[8]. But there are many other such experiments that have been successfully undertaken, and implemented at the state, and city level \u2014 some of which \u2014 such as California's emissions framework - that have then been taken up at the national level. What Cisco and Big Tech especially fear: California's privacy framework, which comes into effect in 2020.[9] And the concern is not limited to compliance with the provisions of this flagship data protection statute, but also, as I wrote in this December post, Advertising Trade Association Presses for Federal Data Privacy Regulation[10], a recognition that large companies may have less coercive influence over state legislatures and policymakers than they do at the federal level:Undoubtedly a huge unmentioned motivating factor, as far as data procurers, users, and brokers are concerned, is that the governments of some states - including California - have not been captured to the same extent as the federal regulatory apparatus. So on occasion, states may either enact meaningful consumer protections, and in some instances, state legal officers actually attempt to enforce them. I am of course well aware that a certain amount of grandstanding occurs at the state level, but nonetheless, the situation is not nearly as dire as the federal state of play \u2014 where the deterioration, I should point out, in public policies even remotely reflecting popular opinion and majority needs, occurred well before Trump was inaugurated.Third,Reassure customers that enforcement of privacy rights will be robust without costly and unnecessary litigation.This brings us to the heart of the matter. Big US corporations fear lawsuits. The taming of the Justice Department and various regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, in enforcement matters means that private lawsuits are one of the sole remaining means ordinary people can use to try to redress grievances. As an aside, I should mention that regular readers know this deterioration is not something that occurred on Trump's Watch. I'll spare you a recitation of the litany of citations to previous posts on his immediate predecessor's failures in this regard, but will be happy to discuss some of them in comments, if there's interest. As to lawsuits, I recognise there are huge obstacles to bringing and prevailing in these, especially in class actions. These obstacles have increased, and indeed accelerated, since at least the Clinton administration, as part of a considered campaign in which corporate lobbyists - acting on behalf of potential corporate defendants- have largely prevailed. Elements include:statutory changes, such as the the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (1995) and the Class Action Fairness Act (2005); Supreme Court decisions, including imposing restrictions on punitive damages, upholding mandatory arbitration clauses, and interpreting standing and pleading requirements; seating business-friendly friendly judges, which the Trump administration has excelled at, building on previous framework constructed by his predecessors (and not just the Republican ones); and funding and pursuing 'legal reform' or 'tort reform' campaigns, which include financing judicial campaigns, particularly for the highest state courts - where judgeships are often elected positions; and changes to state laws.What Is To Be Done? I'm glad to see Cisco espousing the importance of data privacy as a 'fundamental human right'- even if this is a mere rhetorical exercise. I fear, however, once the current Congress considers this issue, that the federal data privacy regime they will enact will be much worse than the current state of play. Corporate Democrats rely too much on tech money for campaign finance to construct a system of tight restrictions, and progressive Democrats have their eyes set on different prizes \u2014 Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, tax increases on the wealthiest. Although there are some Republicans who espouse libertarian principles, I think it unlikely that the Trump administration nor many influential Republicans, will take up the challenge of safeguarding our privacy.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/02/cisco-joins-tech-giants-calling-federal-privacy-law.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/02/cisco-joins-tech-giants-calling-federal-privacy-law.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Guest Post[11], Legal[12], Politics[13], Regulations and regulators[14], Surveillance state[15] on February 8, 2019[16] by Jerri-Lynn Scofield[17].

The backlash against Silicon Valley firms is only just starting, Douglas said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A number of European cities are creating transport strategies that focus on integrating autonomous systems, like Paris' plan to have driverless shuttles by the 2024 Olympics and London's for autonomous buses. Are more European cities going to follow that trend?</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Obviously, the big data companies are either Chinese or American so the leaders in connected mobility are the Qualcomms and Broadcoms and the Ciscos of the world. There's a lot more tech of the data type coming from the US and that's not surprising. What you see coming out of America is an incredibly data-centric, autonomous-centric vision and it's being driven by the American industry, which is very strong on tech.</p><p>Europeans have a very different approach and their approach is trying to use data to make multi-mobility happen. The American perspective is private ownership of autonomous vehicles. The European mobility perspective is of cities trying to own and manage data in order to enable multi-mobility to happen across a number of different vehicles and, in the future, including autonomous vehicles.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Are European cities' developments in autonomous vehicles driven by American tech giants or are there more active European startups?</emphasis></p><p>When you speak to Europeans, they tell you Europe is behind and when you speak to Americans, they tell you that America is behind and Europe's ahead. If you are in the car sharing or bike sharing business or the electric scooter sharing business, you don't want to be in America because everybody is still stuck with car ownership. The mobility of today is not dominated by the American tech giants at all.</p><p>But if you look at the mobility of tomorrow, American tech giants are starting to move incredibly quickly into that space because they see the size of the prize. Google is starting to communicate very strongly that human beings are not capable of driving motor cars, we are too dangerous. We kill 1.2 billion people a year through accidents. Qualcomm put a massive banner in Paris last week saying '5G is coming, brought to you by Qualcomm'.</p><p>The big American companies are jumping for the big, big winner take all scenario, which is the autonomous vehicle on demand, the robo-taxi. Uber obviously has slowed down after the accident [a woman was killed by a driverless Uber car last month in the US] but the massive race from America is big companies, many tech companies going full speed ahead for on-demand robo taxis.</p><p>That's Lyft, Uber, Google, Qualcomm. Europeans haven't really got a tech company going for on-demand autonomous vehicles. What they have are car companies trying to become more autonomous and those companies have a vision of drivers being behind the wheel and when the driver doesn't want to drive the car, the car can drive autonomously. They have a few car companies starting to have car sharing. BMW's DriveNow, Daimler's car2go. But those are very, very small investments compared to GM, which spent $1 billion on cruise automation.</p><h/><p>Oslo, London and Amsterdam are leading the race to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from transport, a study showed on Tuesday (25 April).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Because European companies invest less than American companies, will the development towards autonomous transport be much slower in Europe compared to in the US?</emphasis></p><p>My sense is that the prize in Europe will not be as big as the prize in the US. America is a country where the culture of the economy is very much winner takes all, it has very little public transport spending. It's very car-centric and what is happening in America is that in the future there is a very strong likelihood that single car driving of combustion cars is going to be replaced almost entirely by single car occupancy of autonomous and electric vehicles with a very rich digital infrastructure. So you'll call an autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel, you'll jump in it, it'll sell you stuff on Amazon, it'll sell you Facebook ads. It'll be crunching your data and if you're a wealthy person who is prepared to opt-in for your data, it'll give you a free lift in exchange for selling you ads, for you shopping on Amazon, etc.</p><p>What's happening in Europe is that Europeans are starting to talk for the first time against American tech. They're starting to be concerned about 'big tech', about GAFA [Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon], and they're also concerned about the negative side of the future of autonomous vehicles. Americans don't have as many concerns about the downsides of autonomous vehicles, of which there could be many. For example, the massive reduction in what we call active mobility, walking and cycling.</p><p>Every single European city is trying to improve their walking and cycling. For good reason: it improves congestion, reduces pollution, it improves the health of their citizens. Something that they as socialist countries with national health budgets have to pay for the downsides of health. In America, with private healthcare, people are suffering from obesity, and that cost is not born by the state or the city, it's born by private citizens. A city like Paris has put (EURO)150 million into bike lanes, they actively are pushing an incredibly ambitious biking programme.</p><p>Paris is very ambitious with autonomous vehicles, but they want what we call autonomous shuttles, these things that can move 15-16 people at a time. It has a small footprint for moving a lot of people. Americans are pushing for basically a computer on wheels with massive connectivity, using your data, selling you stuff online. I think because of the politics, the culture, the history of American tech companies, we're starting to get two very different narratives driving mobility in Europe and in America.</p><p>It's very hard for regulators to say to tech 'You can't sell to my citizens'. But when it comes to mobility, cities have the right to say 'You can't operate on my roads because these are public spaces'. Transport for London did that with Uber [<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">in September 2017. The app still works in London while Uber appeals the city's decisio</emphasis>n]. They did not renew their license because they thought their corporate behaviour was not appropriate.</p><p>Suddenly you're seeing, for the first time, trans-tech companies understand they need to play nice in cities because these guys hold the keys. It's not like combining Apple and using Google software, it's not going to be so easy to come in onto European roads and put your tech through and behave the way you want to. As Uber has found out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">There has been a broader backlash recently from European regulators and governments against American tech giants.</emphasis></p><p>The backlash has just started. Facebook has just made it worst.</p><h/><p>Taxify is arriving in Paris: the Estonian company backed by Chienese investors is challenging Uber abroad. Uber counterattacks by asking loyalty from its drivers and users. EURACTIV's partner Italia Oggi reports.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Are European city governments' concerns focused on American tech giants accessing people's data through public transport partnerships?</emphasis></p><p>I see a couple of concerns and fears from European policymakers. One is the extent of power the American tech giants can have and how fast American tech giants can move in transport. There's not a city that doesn't talk about 'Uberisation', that doesn't understand how quickly Uber went and took over the taxi industry and reduced its value. The way the taxi industry works in Europe is they give list licenses. And a taxi driver, when he or she retires, can sell their license to a younger person, which they do normally for (EURO)200,000. And that was normally their retirement.</p><p>So this system, even though it wasn't efficient for us as commuters, it was enabling them to retire quite wealthy and they were therefore less of a burden on states and cities. The price of a taxi license in Italy has gone down now from (EURO)200,000 to (EURO)100,000 because of Uber. That price will go down to zero, making them a further burden on the state. The one big fear I have is that the change in business model that Uber has and the speed that American tech companies can move at can replace European companies that pay tax and employ people, etc.</p><p>At the same time, tech coming out of China now with new mobility is so much better, so much quicker, so much cheaper than anything Europe can produce, that they are concerned about where Europe will fit in. Europe was a leader in transport because transport was mechanical, used combustion engines and was non-digital. Now transport is electric and digital. Americans are masters of digital, Chinese are masters of electric. Europeans are masters of neither of those two. From having been leaders with airplanes, trains, buses, motor cars, bicycles. They're now looking very behind because transport is effectively being replaced by smartphones on wheels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">European governments are increasingly concerned about American tech companies' dominance in areas like logistics as well. Are some cities moving to come up with ways to limit their access to transport data through specific legislation on data access?</emphasis></p><p>Absolutely. That's exactly what we're seeing and it's all starting with data. Uber last year announced their programme Movement, which is opening their data to cities. The reason why they did it is they understand it's good for mobility, for the city, to have access to all the transport data. And the other reason why they did it is they realise Uber can only operate in cities with the blessing of the cities.</p><p>Once the cities don't renew the license like Transport for London did, or the cities start coming up with reasons why Uber can't pick up passengers there or there, its competitive advantage goes. The power cities have is over public infrastructure, the roads, the parking and pickup points. Cities will actively use that to punish companies that don't pay tax, that use data to direct consumption into companies that are not benefiting the city, etc. It's the only lever they have and it's a lever they will be using.</p><h/><p>EU judges ruled on Wednesday that Uber is a transport service, rather than a digital app, and therefore requires national authorities' authorisation to operate in Europe.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1227005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1N-94B1-JCF9-40M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1746\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 3, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ashley Webster has everything you need to know, Ashley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, I wish I did, Dagen. I got most of the headlines here. But I don't have the adjusted earnings per share. But I can tell you, revenue coming in at 18.76 billion that is slightly better than was expected. And look at the premarket on Citigroup, up, well, $0.53, it's up 1-1/2 percent coming back just a little bit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The banks actually have had a better time this year. They got hammered at the end of last year, but Citi is already up 38 percent this year. But here we go, we have 195 on the EPS, is that correct? And that means that's a -- that is a nice beat on the earnings front. The estimate was for 181 guys, the actual was 195. So, positive news for Citigroup. The first big financial company out of the gate on second-quarter earnings, up more than one percent in premarket.</p><p>We know, we were warned about a month ago that fixed income and equity trading revenue are going to be down in the mid-single digits. What people will be looking for is how they did in Asia concerns about the trade dispute with China did actually helped Citigroup. There are many countries in Asia. Maybe more business was picked up as companies leave China to go to other Asian countries.</p><p>But overall, first blush Dagen, not bad. At least certainly on the headline numbers. But it's been a tough goal, we know the interest rates are low, so banks are not making much money that nimb, be net interest margin not making a whole lot of money on loans with those interest rates so low.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, you charge more on loans than what you pay in deposit.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So when you, you know, with the longer -- like longer term rates sinking, in anticipation that the Federal Reserve is going to cut rates shortly, that's potentially squeezed --</p><p>WEBSTER: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- certainly squeezed the margins there. But again, a beat on the top line and a beat on the bottom line. Ashley Webster, thank you so much.</p><p>WEBSTER: My pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Le's bring in Rafferty Capital Markets' chief financial strategist, Dick Bove for his reaction.</p><p>Dick, have you gotten a chance to listen to what Ashley was talking about? Even take a peek at these numbers here for Citi.</p><p>DICK BOVE, CHIEF FINANCIAL STRATEGIST, RAFFERTY CAPITAL MARKET: You know, I apologize, I haven't seen numbers at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's OK.</p><p>BOVE: And I get my computer focused on it. But the point is that Citigroup and the other banks should have a decent quarter. They should have good quarter because, you know, you have to look not at the interest rate, you have to look at what they're selling, right? And in the quarter, you know, what they sell primarily are loans and loans, you know we're decent in the second quarter. You had good results from commercial industrial side, you know, you had mortgages, you know, picked up somewhat. You know, consumers are borrowing money like crazy through their credit cards and they're also, you know, coming back in the auto loan sector.</p><p>So, if you have unit volume increasing and interest rates really haven't changed yet even though they're expected to change, then your margins should be relatively stable and if they're stable when basically your earnings should be up. In addition, you know, you've had basically some very big IPOs this quarter, you had, you know, the yield curve go down right across the board, which actually creates a fortune in profit for the banks. Because remember, they have $3.5 trillion in securities that they own.</p><p>So, if you get the whole yield curve dropping, you know, you are seeing a big increase, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars in profits for the banking industry. So, you know, this should be a decent quarter. The problem is nobody will care. And the reason they won't care is because they're going to focus, focus, focus on, you know, what's going to happen with interest rates at the Fed and they -- taking the opinion that if interest rates go down, it's bad for banks, even though there is no historical evidence whatsoever to indicate that that statement is true.</p><p>So, I don't know. My guess is you ought to be buying Citigroup, you ought to be buying banks but the market's going to be very skittish about these companies.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dick, you've always said this, that these companies that if the economy and the borrower and the consumer is healthy, that's one of the most critical things to pay attention to.</p><p>And I'll turn to a quote from Citigroup, and its earnings announcement, quote, we have good momentum in solid growth across our consumer franchise particularly in the U.S. We navigated in uncertain environment successfully by executing our strategy and by showing disciplined expense credit and risk management, this is according to Citigroup's curbing.</p><p>BOVE: You know, if you take a look at the way they've reshaped the company, right? They've gotten rid of, you know, most of their foreign involvement, getting out of you know, countries all around the world. They've closed down businesses in the United States, they've eliminated the deposit facilities all over United States, and they've got -- let's say, two really, really strong trust.</p><p>One is, they still are a dominant credit company around credit card company around the world. And the credit card business looks great right now, it looks great because, you know, earnings are up slightly for individuals in real terms and obviously, jobs are up significantly.</p><p>The second business that they focused on, is trading in investment banking. And while trading always goes down in the second quarter versus the first quarter, from the seasonal standpoint, you know, investment banking has been terrific, right? I mean, investment banking, you've got all of these companies that came to market, they're prices went up. Therefore, the green shoes are extraordinarily profitable for companies who are part of this indication.</p><p>So, again, you know, you should see decent numbers coming out of banks this quarter. And if you take a look at what the banks do, relative to what supposedly the S&amp;P 500 is going to do. The banks are going to show up earnings and the S&amp;P is going to be flat to down according to other people, I don't make that forecast. If that's true, then the banks should be bought in addition to which the multiples on bank stocks are very low. But the problem is nobody cares about anything I just said, all they care about is what did Me. Powell -- Chairman Powell say to the Senate and House last week. What is going to happen to interest rates, and that's just -- it's a farce because what happens to interest rates is not going to kill banks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I will point out, Citigroup stock is up 38 percent here today which is wildly outperforming kind of your broad market gauges, even the S&amp;P 500 here. Mitch, you have a question for Dick.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC CHARITABLE FOUNDATION: (INAUDIBLE) that's almost two times of the S&amp;P as they grow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: If they're not going to care about bank stocks, they're not going to care about the answer to this question either, which is one of the things that was a big talking point in the earnings calls of all of the banks after the first quarter was expenses and then this press release, they even talked expenses. Are banks really cutting back their spend and is that really part of what's driving the earnings? Obviously, the revenue's up, but earnings per share is up but are expense control big part of the equation here, Dick?</p><p>BOVE: Oh, yes, absolutely, you're definitely correct, a hundred percent. I mean, basically, technology, you know, people think that another false impression about banks is that they lying in technology. Banks are the most advanced companies in technology in the United States, other than the technology companies themselves. And they've used that technology, extraordinarily effectively to replace labor-intensive activities with machines.</p><p>And as a result of that, you know, their expenses are not growing. You know, their loan losses are going to creep up, but the loan losses are extraordinarily low. So, a huge part of the story on banks over the last few years has been the fact that their expenses don't go up, and their revenues eke up, you know, in small amounts which leads to, you know, relatively good increases in pretax income.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Dick, I want to ask you, its Deirdre. Quickly, you mentioned the investment banking as a strength which obviously it is. And we expect to hear from its peers of course through the week.</p><p>But what do you make of more and more companies going public with direct listings? And Spotify was the first to do it that's not been a loan, and seems like more and more companies are going to be doing this which essentially means just cutting out the middle man, in this case, investment bankers. Are all -- is this business being disrupted? Or are we looking at a few companies that have just chosen to go public differently?</p><p>BOVE: Well, the whole -- you're right Deirdre, the whole structure of the market has changed, right? In other words, you got private equity companies, you've got money flowing in from overseas, so that the need to go to a big bank to do a public offering for you is becoming significantly reduced.</p><p>However, you know, you get all these unicorns which are coming to market that don't have any profits, perhaps they never had profits. And you do -- you do need someone to sell that story. And in order to get someone to sell that story, you do have to go to a big bank, and these big banks I think have done an extraordinarily effective job for themselves, and the shareholders in this past quarter and I think that will show up when all of these numbers are out for Citi and J.P. Morgan and Goldman and Morgan Stanley and all of these guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dick, good to see you this morning, thank you so much. Dick Bove, joining us.</p><p>BOVE: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Turning to U.S.-China trade, the president speaking out this morning on China's economic growth in the second quarter. Edward Lawrence, live at the White House with the very latest. Good morning, Ed.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Dagen. Yes, the president woke up with the economy on his mind. His first set of tweets on that talking about how he's talking about the antiquated -- his words, the antiquated policy of the Federal Reserve, but we are still growing. He says, much room to grow for the U.S. economy, then the president turned to China. The president saying that Chinese have had the slowest growth they've had in 27 years as of right now. The president pointing to the fact that tariffs are playing a major role in that economy, also, playing a major role in the fact that companies are trying to leave China for nontariff companies.</p><p>The president going on on Twitter to say that China has wished that it did not break the deal that it made with the United States, the president making the case, that China's actually paying for the tariffs which is something you said before by devaluing pumping money into their system here. The president holding off though on everything else the China imports into the United States placing that under tariff, although that still is an option for the president. Now right now, the talks on the phone are still happening between the two trade groups, the U.S. trying to get a date for the next round of face-to-face talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: Now, we're facing a country that hacks our computers, that steals our intellectual property, forces technology transfer, manipulates (INAUDIBLE) its currency and dumps fentanyl into our communities. So, those are the kinds of things we're trying to negotiate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: And Peter Navarro there, that went out see economic adversaries on that trade council, the greater council that's trying to negotiate with this. They're also trying to gauge how amenable the Chinese will be when they come back to the talks to see what the concessions that they had made and taken out of the deal will be placed back into a trade deal, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Edward Lawrence, at the White House.</p><p>Coming up, Louisiana underwater, we take you live to New Orleans for a closer look at how that city is recovering from tropical depression Barry.</p><p>And Prime Day protest, activist taking action against Amazon as the retail giant kicks off its global shopping event. How your deals could be affected.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Barry making landfall in Louisiana over the weekend. It's weakened into tropical depression, but still brings the threat of flooding and heavy rain.</p><p>Fox Business's Jeff Flock is live in New Orleans with the very latest. Good morning, Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Dagen, good morning to you. They prepared for the worst and hoped for best, and well, they got what they hoped for. This is -- this is New Orleans in Mississippi, and maybe you see.</p><p>But I think -- I don't think you can tell, you know, you have had a hurricane coming in with river at record high levels for this time of year. In fact, to give indication how high it is, there's a -- there's a marker out there that is on dry land.</p><p>And actually, you see how much the Mississippi has come in. But despite that, it wasn't as bad as they thought. Yes, there were some overtopping of levees. Take a lot at a picture from Plaquemines Parish, south of here. There was an overtop there, a couple of others. But there's a big difference between overtop and a failure, failure means big floods.</p><p>Outside the levee system, though, yes, there was flooding, and we got pictures of some of the rescues that took place. Some people from roofs of their houses. But these are people that live in low-lying areas, and probably, should not have stayed in the face of this hurricane anyway.</p><p>I leave you, Dagen, perhaps with a picture of New Orleans, a block little by a tree here, but if Frank takes a look down there, there are 224 floodgates in New Orleans. That's one of them there. They closed them all, they're now in the process of reopening them. And that one leading into the French Quarter, right there open protected the city.</p><p>Did they learn something from Katrina? By gosh, I think they did. Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jeff, good to see you my friend. Jeff Flock in New Orleans.</p><p>FLOCK: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, taking action against Amazon. Protesters rallying against Prime Day as the retail giant kicks off its annual global shopping event. How this would impact your deals?</p><p>Plus, big tech threat. Billionaire Peter Thiel, calling for an FBI investigation and the CIA into Google, over its relationship with China. More details on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Amazon Prime Day, online shoppers getting two days of deals. While Amazon employees in Minnesota plan to go on strike. Susan Lee is covering a story live from Minneapolis. Good morning, Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Dagen. That's right. So, Christmas and July, with Amazon kicking off its two-day Prime Day events where they are expected to bring in around $4 billion to $7 billion over the next 48 hours.</p><p>But given the success of Amazon, it's really become a political flashpoints. They make billions of dollars of the U.S. consumer. And some say, they don't pay their fair share when it comes to corporate taxes and they don't treat their workers as good as they should.</p><p>Now, we are here just outside Minneapolis, and we are expecting a first-of- its-kind workers strike on one of the most important days for Amazon. Now, this is not the first worker protests we've seen here at this fulfillment center. In fact, one took place in December last year.</p><p>But, we are expecting one for one of the most important days for Amazon here on this prime day. And speaking it to us this morning, we're catching up with Meg Brady who's one of the Amazon workers and part of -- I would say part of the organizing as well in this -- in this protest. We're expecting 100 workers to go on strike. I'm just wondering, what are they protesting?</p><p>MEG BRADY, WORKER, AMAZON: Well, working at Amazon is really difficult. It's very hard place to work. And one of the things that would reduce some of the stresses if management would reduce the rates, the production rates that were required to meet every hour.</p><p>LI: That's right. So, we're talking about productivity quotas, meeting the number of packages you need to pack up within an hour. And here, it's at 600, whether they're big or small. And some say that seems a little unfair, right?</p><p>BRADY: Right, in my particular job at 600 items an hour I handle, and we also would like to see some improvements made in ergonomics, because the repetitive nature of our work leads to workplace injuries.</p><p>LI: That's why, in fact, you are on medical leave yourself.</p><p>BRADY: That's correct.</p><p>LI: Yes, were you injured here at this Amazon fulfillment center?</p><p>BRADY: I was. Yes.</p><p>LI: Yes. And so, a reduction. How big of a reduction are you looking for? What would be fair to you?</p><p>BRADY: I would say, even a 10 percent reduction in rate across the board would help workers quite a bit.</p><p>LI: Yes. So, just a 10 percent reduction. So that's just around 540 packages an hour, down from the 600. That's what you're looking for?</p><p>BRADY: Right, and then, in my particular case, the rates do vary depending on what position you're in.</p><p>LI: Yes, and another issue that workers are protesting is the fact that they are hiring more temporary staff, and not giving up full-time positions.</p><p>BRADY: Right, the temporary workers, they are held to the same standards that full-time Amazon employees are held to. But yet, they don't have Amazon benefits.</p><p>LI: Right, but just to give the other side of this story. We did get in contact with Amazon. They say that 90 percent of the workers here at this fulfillment center are full-time staff.</p><p>BRADY: Right, well, the integrity's workers are full-time but they're still not employees.</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>BRADY: Amazon, please.</p><p>LI: But what I'm hearing from you is it's -- I guess about the working conditions and also the full-time positions. It's not about money, because Amazon has moved up their minimum wage to $15 an hour.</p><p>In fact, they told us here at this particular fulfillment center, the average wage is around $16 to $20 with benefits.</p><p>BRADY: That's correct. I make $17.15 an hour.</p><p>LI: Yes, and what about unionization then? Are you getting pushback in terms of forming one by Amazon?</p><p>BRADY: Right. Amazon is anti-union. I, personally, I'm a pro-union. That's not really what we're protesting today, but that could be something that we look at in the future.</p><p>LI: Yes, and it's not just the workers here at this fulfillment center, I believe a pilot, it's coming to join, and also some of that well-paid engineers in Seattle flying here as well.</p><p>BRADY: Right. We have quite a show of support from other co-workers.</p><p>LI: Yes, but why Prime Day? I mean, why not select another day? Is this -- I guess, to make your message heard more loudly?</p><p>BRADY: Yes, and normally, if there's a disruption in work, they would transfer the work to another fulfillment center. But that's not possible today because all the fulfillment centers are busy.</p><p>LI: And what would you like Jeff Bezos to hear from you? He is the richest man in the world and he, of course, is the founder and owner of Amazon.</p><p>BRADY: Well, management demands the best from its workers. And now, we want management's best.</p><p>LI: OK, Meg, Meg, thank you so much. Great to see you.</p><p>BRADY: Thank you.</p><p>LI: And so, we are expecting the six-hour walkout just to take place in the afternoon. So, at the end of the day's session, and then, heading into the night session as well. And as I mentioned to you, Dagen, first-of-its- kind because workers usually don't go on strike when it's this busy. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Susan, thank you for that. Susan Lee in Minneapolis. Amazon Prime Day, two days. Mitch, have you been looking at this like to impact on the business? Like -- because I raised the issue with one of our earlier guests with Charlie O'Shea that is it -- is that Prime Day phenomenon losing its oomph, but maybe it's given oomph to these other retailers like Wal-Mart and Target. Best to take advantage of it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I think it's helping the entire retail ecosystem whether or not it's digital or in store, and going back to something we were talking about earlier, is the consumer is very, very strong right now, and that's the component of our economy that is probably the strongest, no better time than when the consumer strong to create retail buying opportunities.</p><p>So, but I think prime day is a great sort of catalyst to sort of get people to think about shopping. Six months away from the busiest time of the year for shopping. So, that's why they do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, just reminds people, right? Reminds people, if you haven't been on Amazon past 48 hours, here you go. Here's the deal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Oh, wait, that's fit that's on sale.</p><p>BOLTON: There you go, Mitch.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lots of amazon the Amazon -- the Amazon products like the deals on the echo of Dyson vacuum. There you go.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, I think Amazon wants people to be addicted to its ecosystem much as a lot of people are with Apple. So, when you talk about Amazon offering, echoes and anything that's run by Alexa. And, of course, we've heard that they're developing kind of mini robot, right? They want you to use their services as much as the shopping.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And they're also creating products like the video doorbell and stuff that tie-into all of their other products.</p><p>BOLTON: Right. Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And because what's next, especially, when we get into a 5G world is the Internet of things where all of these devices are connected to one another.</p><p>RONICA CLEARY, PRESIDENT, CLEARY STRATEGIES: You know, it may -- it may not affect the woman that we just heard with Susan, but there was a report out last week -- I mean, Amazon is spending $700 million to train their workforce in light of a third of their workforce in response to automation.</p><p>To give their workforce a better ability to adapt to how technology is changing things. Because that fulfillment center, that's -- that woman works in, I mean that may not exist with any humans working in it in so many years.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right.</p><p>CLEARY: So, there is some sort of response maybe not direct, but there is a responsible on part of the company to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Well, that's a good point, contracting an effort even because it cost them money to replace workers.</p><p>CLEARY: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Again, this falls on the private sector rather than politicians who have been talking and doing nothing. Not walking the talk for literally decades in this country. You know, again, it comes down to what are these private businesses doing to make -- to make sure that it their own workforces are trained and retrained and modern and current.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And relevant for the skills that are needed to drive the businesses in the future.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: It's a lot cheaper to train your existing talent that they go out and replace them with new ones.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, absolutely. Thank you all. Coming up, it -- curbing illegal immigration. President Trump's large-scale nationwide raids against undocumented immigrants not unfolding that way so far.</p><p>And targeting tech, billionaire Peter Thiel said to be calling for an investigation into Google over its relationship with China.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, July 15th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Markets poised for a higher open looking to push new all-time highs at 52 gain on Dow Futures. All three major market gauges in the green following a record-setting week for the Dow, NASDAQ and S&amp;P.</p><p>Citigroup with the double beat profits rising on lower cost and gains in consumer lending. The news lifting Citi other banks ahead of the open. You have gains across the board Citigroup stock, it's up almost more than 35 percent year-to-date, adding nearly one percent in premarket action.</p><p>In Europe, you have buying in England, France and Germany this morning. The biggest winner there, the DAX in Germany up about half of one percent.</p><p>More signs of a slowdown in China, that was kind of -- factored into the Asian markets. China's economy growing by 6.2 percent in the second quarter, sounds strong, but it was the slowest rate since 1992, at least 92. Slowest rate on record. In Japan, the Nikkei was closed for a holiday.</p><p>Border battle. ICE going ahead nation-wide with a crackdown on illegal immigrants. This as some local leaders fight back against the raids.</p><p>Bitcoin plunging. The cryptocurrency diving more than 10 percent over the weekend, briefly trading below $10,000. This follows last week's comments from President Donald Trump saying he is not fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, talking about regulation.</p><p>Plus, high-tech threat. Billionaire, Peter Thiel, reportedly calling for investigation into Google over its work with China. What these allegations could mean for the tech giant.</p><p>To our top story this half hour. A nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration. ICE action planned in 10 major cities as agents try to round up thousands of immigrants already ordered out of the country. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham visited the border on Friday, and Maria Bartiromo spoke with him yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" and he weighed on the raids.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We've got some pushback from some Democrats, and liberal mayors trying to stop the ICE officials and Border Patrol officials from carrying out their directive.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): The ICE raids today are focused on criminals who have gone to court and lost their case. Democrats are also advocating decriminalizing entry into United States and providing free health care to illegal immigrants once they get here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joining me now U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli. Ken, good to see you this morning.</p><p>KEN CUCCINELLI, ACTING DIRECTOR, U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES: Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A story in the Wall Street Journal titled: Large Scale Immigration Raids Fail to Materialize reports this, \"ICE agents were put on standby for potential raids this weekend and while some operations continued in individual cities, agents were never given an order to execute on a nationwide scale,\" one administration official says. What do you make of this? Again, it seems like the public was led to believe there was going to be something kind of massive and widespread, not happening.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: So, the way I understand that (INAUDIBLE), the Acting Director of ICE has set this up is that he has given discretion to his local responsible officers to perform their responsibility fit. Now, I'm speaking very generally, but that's the way law enforcement should operate. Law enforcement operations have to be taken on case-by-case basis if for no other reason officers' safety.</p><p>So, the notion that you're going to hear some national rollout announcement is really, I think, kind of people are, are misconstruing that. And let's remember just how far we fallen that ICE just doing their job -- so many loyal, competent, professional officers just doing their job has suddenly become news. And this is what they do every day, whether it's cracking down on employers violating our law or whether it's gathering people who are disobeying federal orders over a million people with federal removal orders who are not obeying those orders.</p><p>And they do target, as you heard Senator Graham say, they still prioritize criminals in this country, but that is not an exclusive target. Anyone in that million people who have been through massive due process and gotten removal order are subject to removal and ICE'S job is to do exactly that, they take their job very seriously, they're very good at it, despite a lot of the vitriol lobbed at them by elements of the political class.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ken, we should point out -- I just want to make this clear -- your agency is not directly involved in law enforcement.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's charged, but you administrator the country's legal immigration system.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: And asylum. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Green cards, right? Eligible asylum-seekers that's what you handle.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I wondered about the wisdom of talking about these raids because President Trump started talking about them last month. He announced a similar raid last month; it was postponed amid concern over the officers' safety. And you've been asked about it and commented about the raid last week. Why give illegal immigrants in this country who would be eligible for deportation? Why give them a heads-up? It just seems -- is this just political? Is it to rattle the left? Is it to basically -- is it a political move to get the left Liberals or even Democrats in this country to seem like they're siding with illegal immigrants versus those here who are here legally?</p><p>CUCCINELLI: First of all, it is important not only that a justice system work and be just but that it be seen to work and be just. The importance of that is that people who are considering coming here who think all they've got to do is get by the border illegally, and that they're home mystery ICE stands in the way of that; they are the wall there. And when those people come in illegally, and get orders of removal, they need to know that even after that point that our legal system the rule of law still applies and that they will be removed or they're subject to removal that's who this is important for in addition to just maintaining the rule of law.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But Ken, my question is when you talk about raids that are going to happen across the country, you're giving people who might be deported a heads-up, and you're giving people the Democrats in some of these sanctuary cities a heads-up. It seems like that you're doing it for political purposes. If you were quiet, it would be easier for agents themselves to go into these communities and actually apprehend people who are here illegally, who are offered deportation and send them back to their home country.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: Well, unfortunately, this particular subject matter illegal immigration is a hot button, it is -- major subject of policy debate, and so you do get public discussion including of law enforcement operation at a general level. It should it never get specific beforehand that causes all sorts of problems. But you are right, it is discussed publicly. But what people should understand is that for those more than million people who have had due process, and have removal orders, they are always subject to this removal.</p><p>It is -- and ICE doesn't sit around say all right on x and such date, we're going to go after 1000-2000 of these people. This is a rolling effort on their part. What you've heard talked about is a broader push. But understand that ICE is doing their job every day, whether it's enforcing against employers breaking the law, whether it's people with removal orders and so on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The mayor and police chief from Los Angeles pushed back against ICE. Listen to this, Ken.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC GARCETTI, MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES: I want every Angeleno to know their rights and how to exercise them. I want you to know that you do not need be afraid; your city is on your side. And rest assured here in Los Angeles, we are not coordinating with ICE.</p><p>MICHAEL MOORE, POLICE CHIEF, LOS ANGELES: Our police force is going to do the job of federal law enforcement. Immigration is a federal matter; safety is a police matter. So, we're not going to mix those two.</p><p>GARCETTI: Plus, this is a partisan politics. It's about being a good neighbor --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ken, your reaction to that.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: Yes, that's pathetic. That is pathetic! We're talking about people would who have been through a massive due process, and by and large broken the law to come here. And, and, remember, ICE still targets criminals -- meaning people who have committed other crimes after coming into this country. And so for the mayor and police chief of one of the largest counties in the country, largest cities in the country to speak about harboring criminals, by and large, because remember that's the priority for ICE and they proudly say we're not going to help protect those people, not 15 miles from where I sit.</p><p>Prince Georges County police in Maryland were saying same thing after MS-13 killed a 14-year-old girl and the people who killed her were illegal aliens who had previously been detained and should have been handed over to ICE. But no, Maryland proudly proclaimed itself a sanctuary state and Prince Georges County as sanctuary locality. And they proudly didn't hand these people over, and now, another girl is dead, and she was an illegal alien and she still deserve to live. The fact that it isn't just Americans who are victimized, other aliens are victimized too. ICE is protecting against that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Horrific crimes. But my point is, is that when you have administration officials talking to the press about the upcoming raids, the upcoming raids, the upcoming raids, it turns into back-and-forth political posturing rather than just allowing these ICE agents to quietly go into these communities and apprehend these people who are here illegally, who are potential criminals, who are -- have their deportation efforts already in place. That's my point. Is that when you talk about it so publicly, it turns into this left and right back-and-forth and it's just political posturing, and actually isn't following through with the deportations into law.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: Look, there are pros and cons to being more public about this. You have just identified I think quite accurately one of the cons, one of the negatives. And as I mentioned earlier, one of the pros is that we are trying to create a deterrence effect as well because we're trying to affect future behavior, and calculus each may come to maybe a little different. You think that it shouldn't be talked about beforehand obviously, the president thinks somewhat differently weighing more in favor of the deterrent effect.</p><p>Those are honest debates that I think are legitimate to have and, of course, always prioritizing officers' safety which factors in. And obviously, the president has come out a little bit differently from how you feel about it. I try to focus maximizing the deterrence opportunities here. As you note, this is an ICE responsibility, it's not my agency. We have a lot of respect for our ICE agents and for the work they do. We want them safe as possible but we also want to take advantage of the fact to tell the rest of the world: look, this is how we operate. We enforce our laws, and you can't expect to simply ignore them if you come to America.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right, Ken Cuccinelli thank you so much, Acting Director U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: Good to be with you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Take care. Coming up, Christmas in July. Retail giant, Amazon, kicking off its annual prime day, prime two-day shopping event. Not everyone is onboard. Stuart Varney weighs in.</p><p>And big banks in focus. Shares of Citigroup jumping up almost one percent after beating Wall Street expectation on quarterly earnings. We take you to the trading floor for a look, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Citigroup, the first of the big banks to report quarterly earnings, posting a beat this morning. Jackie DeAngelis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the details. Jackie.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Dagen. Traders watching Citi very closely this morning because kicks off the bank's earnings season, and earnings season in earnest, too. Traders wanted to hear that there's more than just a pending rate from the Fed that's going to drive stocks higher and strong earnings from the banks certainly could be it. We got earnings per share from Citigroup of $1.83. That was higher than expected on revenue $18.76 billion and so everyone will be watching. What's Bank of America going to say? What's Goldman, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley going to say later on in the week? Meantime, they said that a jump in fixed income trading helped earnings at also cost- cutting. The conference call at 10:00 a.m., people are going to be wanting to hear what they say about their international business, specifically Asia.</p><p>I want to switch gears and take a look at shares of Google for a moment because, over the weekend, Axios reported that Peter Thiel was speaking in Washington, D.C., and he said that the FBI and CIA should actually investigate Google to see if it's been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence. Google not responding to this yet, but certainly this could open Pandora's Box, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jackie, thank you so much for that. Jackie DeAngelis at the New York Stock Exchange. Amazon's Prime Day in full swing, online shoppers getting two days of deals while employees in Minnesota plan to go on strike. Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney. Mr. Varney, what say you, sir?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I say it's Christmas in July, that's what I say. I mean, I think what Amazon has done with the -- it started, I think, in 2000 -- don't know exactly when it started, but Prime Days, it started, expanded, and grew and it is a revolution in the retailing business. Wal-Mart's joined in, Target's joined in, eBay's joined in, it starts today, 48 hours of these Prime Days, 18 countries involved, a million products will be what is it a million deals that are on offer, it just turns the retailing business on its headed, doesn't it.</p><p>It used to be Black Friday, day after Thanksgiving, or back-to-school, you could see the lines out the doors for the -- for the special offers, now it's all done online, gigantic retailing operation, Christmas in July. Frankly, I love it. But I don't think it's -- we quite understand yet how big a deal it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stuart, I'm on the phone shopping for you.</p><p>VARNEY: Oh, thank you very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I am trying to figure out what would you buy you? Are not planning to -- you're not much, you're not really much of a shopper, but I know -- you love a deal.</p><p>VARNEY: Why do you say I am not much of a shopper?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't think that you're, because I think that you're very careful with your money.</p><p>VARNEY: Are you calling me cheap?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I'm just -- I'm -- no, not at all. But I don't think that you were a frivolous person.</p><p>VARNEY: Where's Maria? No, sorry. I know, I'm not, and you're quite right, I do have a hard time putting my hand in my pocket --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: -- and putting money down right there or slapping down the plastic.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: I have a hard time doing that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let other people --</p><p>VARNEY: I am thrifty.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, let other people shop where you're --</p><p>VARNEY: And thrift as a virtue, young lady.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I agree, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I agree with you 100 percent all day long every day. Stuart starts in less than 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY: I do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stuart, thank you so much.</p><p>VARNEY: See you later. And reminder, \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" every day, 9:00 a.m. to noon Eastern. Coming up, Facebook under the microscope, the Securities and Exchange Commission considering a crackdown on the social media giant's cryptocurrency. And casting a new bond, James Bond, Daniel Craig passing torch to a new double 007. We'll you who might be taking over that iconic role next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mayor lay -- major lay-offs reportedly are coming at Huawei here in the U.S. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: That's right, Dagen. The Wall Street Journal is reporting this morning that hundreds of people can be let go after the Trump administration black listed the company. These job cuts expected to affect Huawei research and developments of subsidiary, which has labs in California, Texas, and Washington State. Huawei has declined to comment.</p><p>Well, the Securities Exchange Commission is reportedly examining whether Facebook's Libra should fall under the agency's oversight. The Wall Street Journal reporting that if the SEC decided that Libra's structure effectively makes it an ETF. Facebook would need the agent's approval to launch the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, under pressure, as President Trump has criticized cryptocurrencies, that was last week and that includes Libra. It's holding about $10,000 right now, but there is a loss as you can see. $600 in change on Bitcoin. And then get this, the James Bond franchise is getting shaken and stirred.</p><p>The Daily Mail is reporting that British actress, Lashana Lynch, is going to be revealed as the next 007 agent in the new Bond 25 movie, which is out next year. Lynch is going to be the first woman, the first black woman to play the role. There's a twist, do I give it away or do I hold back? I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just give it to me.</p><p>CASONE: OK. This Daniel Craig is in this movie.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>CASONE: So put the two things together and that would kind of make sense of why she's 007 but he's also 007.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK.</p><p>CASONE: Double O, double O? I don't know. That's all I got.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK.</p><p>CASONE: But, you know, Daniel Craig is -- this is his last movie though as James Bond he said. Darn it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Darn it.</p><p>CASONE: Love him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. He doesn't look so good in person though.</p><p>CASONE: He doesn't?</p><p>MCDOWELL: He looks like cheese that's been left out in the yard for like a week. But still ahead, final thoughts from our all-star panel. We'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Final thoughts from our all-star panel. Ronica (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>CLEARY: Does it make me a contrarian if I'm going to go shopping at Target?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. There you go</p><p>CLEARLY: Happy Amazon Prime Day.</p><p>CASONE: Well done. Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I'm going to be on an airplane so I'll definitely shop. But Citi's earnings were a beat and I hope that's an indication of what the rest of the earnings season is like this (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. They --</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, I'm following Mitch's lead and I'm all about Citi and the banks this week, and if they can take over for tech, that would be great to keep this rally going.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Citigroup was already up like 37, 38 percent before today.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yay. How high could it go?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Huawei outperforming the broad markets. What -- and the economy looks good, like that's the most important thing.

Thank you, Thomas, for joining us this morning. We at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse look forward to your leadership in the years ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So as Thomas said, we're back for day 2 of our 21st Annual Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Financial Services Forum, and I'm pleased to kick off the day welcoming back Citigroup. I'm not just welcoming back Citigroup, I'm welcoming back Naveed Sultan, who heads up TTS, Treasury and Trade Solutions, for Citigroup. He joined us here in February of 2016. A fair bit has changed since 2016, including about 35% growth in related TTS revenue and related TTS-driven deposits if you look 2019 versus 2015.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So without further delay, let's get started here. We'll have a fireside chat, and then Naveed will be available afterwards for a breakout session.</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN, GLOBAL HEAD OF TREASURY &amp; TRADE SOLUTIONS, CITIGROUP INC.: Thank you, Susan.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: Thank you.</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: Okay, day 2. So let's get started, if you would, at kind of a higher level with maybe a brief overview of the TTS businesses, maybe just to level set here on size, scope, composition of the businesses.</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: Yes. Thank you. If you think about the TTS business, it's very strategic and foundational for Citigroup's business and operating model. And we deliver a wide range of working capital management solutions to our clients around the world, leveraging our global platform. It includes products and solutions in payments area, receivable areas, liquidity management services, commercial cards, trade finance, trade services and foreign exchange.</p><p>Our engagement with the clients is wide-ranging. So we do business with corporate clients. 80%-plus Fortune 500 companies use our platform around the world, government entities; public sector entities, financial institutions, including banks; digital economy clients; the big tech; the fintech; as well as the commercial banking clients. As far as the digital economy clients are concerned, digital economy clients are on an accelerated path to globalization, and our platform is a very natural fit for them to achieve that goal.</p><p>In terms of the size and scope, we are in 98 markets where we actually have banking licenses. And in some of those markets, we have operated well over 100 years. We are connected with over 250 trading systems, including several -- on top of that, several alternative payment mechanisms and channels. So on average, we process about $4 trillion worth of flows, which could go up to, whatever, $5 trillion, $6 trillion on a big day, and that's essentially in 145 currencies around the world. And we have a market share of about 15% for the SWIFT dollar flows.</p><p>Now if you look at this business from a client perspective, it has both operating and strategic relevance. The operating relevance is that we are deeply embedded in our clients' operating environment, in their operating processes and help them do business around the world on a day-to-day basis. Strategically, because we provide working capital management solutions and help our clients become more efficient. The companies who have more efficient working capital management tend to outperform their peers on 4 critical dimensions: growth, reinvestment, dividend payout and market gap. So both from an operating and strategic standpoint, it's very, very relevant to our clients.</p><p>Now it's -- in terms of its contribution to Citi, 2019 was the sixth consecutive year of growth. We delivered about $10 billion worth of revenues, over 20% of company's net income and 45% of total company's deposits, which, as of December 31, the average was about $559 billion. And that mostly is the operating deposits. Highly efficient business, according to independent objective studies and consistently has delivered well over 20% return on equity. Last year, we grew our deposits by 10% on a constant dollar basis. And I think the correlation between the operating activity and the deposits is very, very tight and close post Basel III and all the rest of it. So therefore, it does reflect their growth in deposits, operating deposits, does reflect the growth in the underlying operating drivers.</p><p>So that's more or less -- like I said, it's a very strategic business. It's fundamental to our business and operating model.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: And so let's back up a second. Based on the numbers that you gave me, the pretax margin and the ROE are clearly above the average for Citi as a whole. How have those trended over time?</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: The -- for the last 6 years, like I said, we have delivered 6th consecutive year of revenue growth. We have a very sharp focus on scalability and operating efficiency. And if you look at the trajectory of all the key ratios in the last 6 years, they have been a positive trajectory despite different macroeconomic environments, geopolitical context and interest rate volatility in U.S. and elsewhere in the world.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: Okay. And in terms of the deposit flows, up 10%, I think you said, last year, and we drove a number, having grown about 35% over the last 4 years. Can we talk a little bit about the key drivers of the deposits. And kind of what's going on with deposit flows? What goes on in a risk-on versus risk-off environment?</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: I think the deposit growth is an outcome of your client engagement and your ability to continue to improve your operating drivers. So that is you are delivering your solutions to your clients around the world, they are expanding in different markets, they are going into new customer segments. And since we are so embedded into their operating processes, next market geographically or next business segment is a very logical extension of our engagement with our clients. So once that happens, you see the deposits picking up because operating liquidity is, by definition, what is needed to finance the underlying flows of a client.</p><p>Then we have been seeing -- continuously gaining more market share, not only with the existing clients but, of course, also with the new age clients. And because of the platform we have, whenever there is a consolidation in the marketplace, there is a natural gravitation towards our platform. So all those -- some new solutions, of course, new solutions. And the thing is that clients are continuously becoming more sophisticated. They are -- they need advice from partners like us to help them navigate an environment which is going through structural shifts.</p><p>The economies are in transition, finance is in transition, globalization is in transition. So if you look at, in that context, we are very compatible with how the clients want to do business globally and we assist them navigating those shifts, that leads to more business, and that creates an outcome for our liquidity, for our deposits share.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: Perfect. So you've touched on some of these elements already, but let's talk about the growth strategy with Treasury and Trade Solutions. And maybe talk about how you maintain that market leadership over time and how you maintain this, let's call it, mid-single -- mid- to high single-digit growth rate, although I don't think that you would assume that, that was a naturally sustainable growth rate for this business.</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: Yes. Well, like I said, I mean, if you think about the nature of our network, it is -- I -- we talk about it a lot, and sometimes there are debate in the industry that some synthetic network is going to come and replace these traditional networks. But just to explain what the network is because it really gives us a very differentiated and a unique position in the marketplace.</p><p>So the network is really, first of all, 95 markets where we have banking licenses. We understand the legal and regulatory jurisdictions. We understand the business environment and risk relating to those markets. And we have very close relationship with the regulators and policymakers. And we have been a significant participant in those economies. So that's one component of our model.</p><p>The second one is that our core technology infrastructure is global and is consistent around the world. On top of that infrastructure, which is really our digital channels, online channels, our payment systems, trade systems and things of those -- commercial card systems. On top of that, we have built a very rich set of functionalities, products as well as our solutions. So that's the third component.</p><p>The fourth component is our coverage model. We in our coverage organization are organized exactly the way the client is organized. So they are in many, many markets. There are many subsidiaries, many buying centers, regional treasury centers, global treasury centers. So we cover them between our relationship managers and salespeople exactly how they are organized, and therefore, we have very embedded relationships with these buying centers. So having explained the uniqueness of this, that particular network continues to facilitate a greater share of clients' wallet, be it our existing clients or be it new age clients.</p><p>In addition to that, if you look at how the digital economy is evolving today, we are also attracting flows from this new breed of fintechs, which we call aggregators. So what the aggregators do, they aggregate flows from those customer segments we don't directly do business with. So these could be the consumer bank, consumer clients. It could be small businesses around the world. And then they are looking for a platform to distribute it around the world.</p><p>And I think what is very important for us to remember is that the globalization is becoming very inclusive. Today, one can produce anything anywhere and distribute it everywhere using these digital platforms. And therefore, that access to a global platform is very, very important. So we feel very confident.</p><p>And then, of course, on top of that, we are continuously investing in that innovation, improving the client experience, broadening our product capabilities, operational resilience. So we believe that we are unique, our positioning. We feel good about our positioning, that as the environment evolves as we go into the future, we will be able to maintain that growth despite the -- of course, we will have impacts of the economic headwinds and interest rate volatility. But through the cycle, we believe that our growth rate will be over the GDP growth rates.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: So let's talk about the competitive landscape a little bit. You're in 98 countries with banking licenses, so it's very hard to replicate. The presence that you have had for as long as you have had it at several banks, and it's a small handful, have a similar infrastructure and capability, but there's always change in the competitive landscape, whether it's new entrants into the treasury services business or otherwise. Can we talk a little bit about what you're seeing there in terms of the competitive landscape?</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: Yes. I mean clearly, the -- there is a widespread recognition in the market that this is a very attractive business. So you are seeing both traditional and nontraditional players coming into this particular space. And as far as we are concerned, like I made the point in the earlier discussion, that we have a very unique and differentiated position. Our strategy is informed by 2 things: what the client needs are; and secondly, that we want to be the financial platform for global commerce.</p><p>If you look at today, how the world is evolving, 7 of the topmost valuable companies in the world today are platform companies. And we have a unique opportunity because of these assets we have built to make that transition into becoming the financial platform for global commerce. And therefore, we are really making a lot of investments in 4 areas: client experience; connectivity and data; innovation; and safety, soundness and operational resilience. So we believe that our competitive position is strong, and we will continue to gain the market share.</p><p>Now if you look at the nontraditional players, the nontraditional players which would, really you think about the fintechs. The portion of the fintech on the institutional side has become more collaborative. On the consumer side, it's more competitive because the fintech on the consumer side think that it's easier to disintermediate the consumer relationships. On the institutional side, there is a recognition that the relationships are so embedded. Therefore, it's very difficult to disintermediate.</p><p>And particularly, in our case, because of relationships, global scale, the fintechs find our platform very attractive to come and work with us from an operating standpoint. So therefore, we work very closely with the fintechs as partners as well as its clients. In fact, we have built a practice within our financial institutions group, what we call fintech. So as clients, we want to facilitate them to grow their business around the world.</p><p>And as far as the collaboration is concerned, partnerships, we integrate their capabilities into our solutions. They bring new ideas, technology. We have the scale, the trust and client access. So that relationship works exceedingly well. So I think this competitive interest is a confirmation of the opportunity, and we actually find it a very positive motivator to make sure we don't become complacent and we stay ahead of the game.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: So it's interesting when I think about this change in the competitive environment, and you talk about it as a catalyst. One of the things that's so attractive about these businesses is that the market is huge, right? It's huge whether you look at just the U.S. version or the global version, and obviously, you're looking at the global version.</p><p>It's massively fragmented, right? There's very little good data available, but your market share is somewhere between, let's call it, 5% and 6%. I think JPMorgan told us on Tuesday that theirs was about 6%, which I'm going to assume you're then close to 6-ish percent as well. But these market shares haven't really moved. The top 3 players are all in the 5%, 6%-ish range, and there's only a top 3 or top 5 players. What are in -- what is, in your view, the driver of incremental market share consolidation? Because in every other business, you should be looking to be at 2x that market share.</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: I think -- yes, absolutely. It's a great question. So like you said, I think the market is very fragmented. And it depends upon what lens you are using, and it's difficult to estimate. Coalition actually puts our market share around 9%, 9% to 10%, considering our revenues last year of $10 billion. So total addressable wallet, you can say, give and take, about $100 billion. That is large corporates, our formally defined target market, but we are not competing in the rest of the market. So it could be a different lens if you say 5%, it's much bigger. Overall...</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: I'm using an overall market.</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: Yes, overall. Yes, exactly. So no, no, it's a very, very, very good question. So what we believe is that if you look at how the consolidation or how the transition has been happening over the years, in the past, whatever the underlying driver of consolidation -- so let's say, post financial and economic crisis, we saw many of our peer group retrenching closer to their home markets geographically or they're exiting relating business lines. The natural flow of that business was our platform, so it got consolidated on our platform.</p><p>There is another very important driver, which is not very well understood. Then the clients -- because the trend of efficiency and value creation is secular, that's where the clients are going. So when they look at the value creation either on the top line or becoming more efficient, they start looking at consolidation of some of their activities.</p><p>So we are the market leaders in supply chain finance, in addition to the overall market leadership and commercial cards. Now these are fairly recent business lines. So say, up till a few years ago, this particular business was allocated by our clients to disparate providers in different geographies around the world, and that obviously is very inefficient. That's fragmented. You have to deal with so many different providers. When they started looking for the benefits of scale, consistency of experience and one single provider, we were the natural beneficiaries. And so they started consolidating their supply chain business with us. They started consolidating their commercial card business with us.</p><p>If you look at the -- amongst other things, if you look at the impact of digitization and globalization, it's going to go towards consolidation. And by and large, they are looking for a global platform. And as you very well know, the industry boundaries -- industries are converging and -- into ecosystems. So therefore, we believe that our strategy of being the financial platform for global commerce is absolutely the right one. And our in-depth relationships across different segments will allow us to continue to gain the market share, either by consolidation; offering them new solutions as we navigate these changes in the marketplace; and thirdly, to your point, which was the right one, that it actually broadens our access to the market beyond that $100 billion.</p><p>The example I gave of the aggregators, the flows which aggregators bring are not part of our formal defined market. So once -- when you are a platform, your ability to access much broader market improves quite considerably. So I think net-net, we believe that we are extremely well positioned for growth, and there are multiple sources of growth, both how we engage with the market traditionally as well as how the new flows are being created. And we believe that platform is in a much better position to services.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: And just to clarify here. If we were sitting here 15 or 20 years ago, we would have talked about very high switching costs, right? I believe that given where technology is today, the switching costs are far lower. So while relationships are embedded from a human standpoint, the technology to make that switch from one provider to the next or add another provider to a platform is much easier facilitated today.</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: Again, I think it's a great question because your conventional thinking tend to suggest that the switching cost being high is a good thing, that the inefficiency or how much you got connected with the client and all that. I think the way the world is going, your switching cost is delivered by your -- quality of your client experience.</p><p>The technology allows you to switch very quickly.</p><p>I mean if you look at different cab services providers or transport services providers, you can switch just by clicking a few icons on your smartphone. But what keeps you with one particular provider is the quality of the experience they give you. And I think that's exactly what our strategy is. So we are making a huge amount of investment into improving the client experience.</p><p>So I'll just give you one example. In the traditional lens, which was like the switching cost -- and it's a very pertinent point because it will take about 2, 2.5 months to open an account of a client or onboarded. So if you think about it, it is a very high switching cost. So if client has already a relationship with you would saying, \"Well, you're the new client, new bank, it will take me another 2, 2.5 months to open an account.\" Yes, you find that these guys are not perfect, but the switching cost is very high. I don't want to switch. We have reduced that down to 48 hours. It's all digital. It's live in 34 markets because we believe that you got to keep the client with yourself through delivering economic value. And if you're scalable, you have a great client experience, very easy.</p><p>The opposite of very easy connectivity is that you can also very easily leave, right? So if you have those attributes, we believe actually, in our case, the sources of value get very diversified. Because you're attracting all the flows, it's very easy to do business with. Your marginal cost is approaching 0 because it's very scalable. And then you are offering not only your own proprietary solutions, third-party solutions are also coming on to your platform. And therefore, I think our ability to continue to grow, it's basically reflecting all the attributes of a platform business model as we see it in the industry today.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: So if I connect a few dots here, at the beginning of our conversation, we talked about not just growth but consistent pretax margin improvement and the amount of technology investment, it sounds like, you've made in the business to be down to onboarding a client in 48 hours. If I tie these things together, it would indicate to me that you've invested pretty aggressively in the operating infrastructure of the business to reduce the marginal cost, the unit operating cost of transacting. How much is it about reducing -- tie together for me maybe the benefit of reducing the unit operating cost as well as that seems to be what's translating to better customer service, and it's really very tightly married together.</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: Absolutely. You're absolutely right. So like I said, if you are executing that particular strategy and when you're making investments in improving the client experience, reducing the redundancies, friction points, your unit cost is -- marginal unit cost is reducing. And that is an outcome of the fact that you were taking out the redundancies, you are taking out the friction points vis-a-vis the clients. And that, in turn, gives the clients incentive to direct more flows into your platform because it's so easy, it's a great experience. And of course, if your marginal cost is approaching 0 over a period of time, you also have -- and part of that, you can always pass it on to your clients based on -- that's an economic decision you have to make, but you have the flexibility to pass part of that onto your clients.</p><p>It's a very interesting dynamic that you improve the unit cost, you take out the friction, you make it a lot easier for clients to do business with you. On the other side, it starts building the scale, and it creates that virtuous cycle of more scale and more volumes, reduce the marginal cost, economic incentives flowing back to the client, more volumes coming through. And then, of course, you're always adding new innovations, you are bringing in technology from new partners.</p><p>So I'll give you 2 examples. Recently, HighRadius, which is one of the fintech partners, we've also taken an equity position. They use machine learning and artificial intelligence and natural language processing to solve one of the big pain points in the industry. And that is essentially when the -- a payment comes in, how you reconcile with the receivables side. And that has been one of the big pain points. We launched that within a span of about 3 to 6 months in a partnership.</p><p>So the reason I'm highlighting that is that it's not just the scale and the marginal cost, we are also adding more products, more solutions, proprietary or third party. And that is exactly the characteristics of a platform that the interaction of those 4 continues to clear -- create nonlinear growth. So we are in this transition right now, but we are very excited about the prospects of the platform we have.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: And so let's just talk about data on that platform for a minute because data and analytics and artificial intelligence are all taking the -- not just your unit operating cost down but also providing value added to the customer. So let's talk about, for a minute, how it is that you're harnessing the data that's available to you across Citi, for both Citi and for the clients.</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: Yes. A lot has been said about data, and one expression which I find very interesting is that data is the oil of 21st century. And I -- we generally believe that the generation, management and monetization of data in a systematic manner at the institutional level is going to create a very significant differentiation. And our approach is that when these new technologies come in, we don't want to be engaged with these technologies on the periphery of how we do business with it today. We want to fundamentally rethink how we do business so that we can leverage the full outcome of these technologies.</p><p>So what we have done is, in data, we are making a lot of investments into the underlying infrastructure of organizing the data so it is accessible and we can drive client insights out of it. In TTS, we have created 4 horizontals, and one of the horizontals is data. What does a horizontal mean? Some of these technologies don't lend themselves to vertical organization because they cut across your different business lines. So this data horizontal cuts across products, geographies and customer segments so that we can build the right infrastructure and the relevant. So our investment is driven by that we are embedding data in all our solutions and products as well as the client journey with us.</p><p>So I'll give you 2, 3 examples really to make it real for you. So when we start engaging with the client in terms of developing a solution or helping them solve a pain point, we analyze the data, we model it. We benchmark it based on several variables which the client give us, how they are organized around the world, what is the legal regulatory jurisdictions, foreign exchange, restrictions, where they want long, their liquidity, where they want short liquidity, all the rest of this. So it's actually hundreds of variables. So we put all of those into our model, and then we create the best possible outcome, which can be actually -- and this is interactive on digital front end. And you can sit in front of a client and keep moving until the client thinks, \"I think this is the optimum outcome.\" So that is when you start creating a solution.</p><p>When you bring the client onboard, the Know Your Customer compliance requirements as well as opening the account, entitling the products, we look at all our internal data. We go to third-party sources and get the information relating to the company. And then we have -- ask the client minimal questions in terms of additional information so that we don't cause inconvenience. And that is one of the drivers why we have reduced it down to 48 hours. Once the client is onboard, start doing business, we use biometrics, bio-matrices. We use artificial intelligence, obviously exploiting the data to fraud prevention, giving them the best possible execution, reconciliation as well as financing utilization and predicting the liquidity flow.</p><p>And fourthly, once they are in a BAU environment with us, doing business, our exploitation of data, usage of data, we keep proactively giving them suggestions that this particular geography has made these changes in the regulation, your company has done this particular acquisition or even if you're staying with your current structure, we believe that if you organize this particular way, you have a better outcome for your liquidity and for your assets. And particularly these days, as we know, the global supply chains are shifting for different reasons. So the clients are looking at their operational footprint again. They are looking at how the new supply chains are going to look like. So our knowledge of the market, deep understanding of the local rules and regulations, coupled with the understanding of the client, we proactively give them recommendation based on data.</p><p>So we -- so as you can see, we are embedding data in a very thoughtful manner in the client journey with us in every step. And we believe that is the right way to do it as opposed to just have a peripheral approach to data, which superimposes on your current operating environment, which may or may not be compatible. And by the way, that is true for other technologies as well.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: That seems to me as one more element of kind of completing and accelerating the journey around the virtuous cycle in this business.</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: Okay. So I'm at 0 on the clock. If I have you back in 3 years, let's see another 35% growth. I know that's a little bit difficult to do, but we do look forward to watching your growth outpace GDP growth.</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: No, no, absolutely. And I think I can't put a number out there, but we are very, very excited about the prospect of this. And the way to look at this business is in the context of financial platform for global commerce. The world is increasingly becoming global despite the geopolitics, trade tensions and tariffs. And I think some of these global changes and structural shifts get -- go unnoticed because of these headlines. But fundamentally, the global supply chains are becoming more knowledge-intensive, more services-intensive.</p><p>Only 18% of the global trade today is driven by cost arbitrage, and there are many other factors at play. So the point I'm making is that every client of ours, because of our global experience and deep relationships in those markets, wants to have our advice and insights how they rethink and navigate in this changing world. And that's we believe is what offers us an exciting opportunity as we move forward here.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: Thank you.</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: Thank you, Susan. It's always a pleasure to be here.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: Thank you. Citi will be available for a breakout session in -- I believe it's the Plaza 1 room, to the right.</p><p>NAVEED SULTAN: Thank you so much.</p><p>SUSAN ROTH KATZKE: Thank you.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

The House Judiciary Committee bipartisan investigation involves major tech companies, and FTC enforcement and other practices, he said. \"I wouldn't say [the FTC is] under investigation. It's not a prosecution, but ... they're part of our review in this comprehensive investigation.\" Cicilline said the committee is expecting more material later after collecting tens of thousands of documents in initial responses from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook last Monday.</p><p>Chopra suggests a corporate royalty controls the economy, but the reality is a regulatory royalty controls politics, said American Enterprise Institute Visiting Scholar Roslyn Layton. After 18 months under EU's general data protection regulation, the largest tech platforms gained market share in the EU, while fledgling rivals have lost ground, she said, noting that online trust is at its lowest since 2006.</p><p>The FTC could use more resources and tools, Chopra said, but the biggest thing is to energetically examine and use existing tools. Reconsider its antitrust presumptions and maybe shift the burden onto tech companies to prove their acquisitions aren't harmful, he recommended. Chopra again aired frustration about the agency's $5 billion privacy settlement with Facebook, criticizing that CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg weren't deposed. Deterrence isn't adequate without executive accountability, he said.</p><p>In the past decade, five of the largest tech platforms have acquired more than 400 companies without any real challenge from antitrust enforcers, said Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y. Subcommittee ranking member Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., warned against punishing success. Antitrust laws exist to promote success, he said. He blamed the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act for \"collateral damage.\"</p><p>Lawmakers and witnesses agreed privacy and competition are increasingly intersecting. \"The relationship between competition and privacy is not either/or,\" Cicilline said. They're related \"concepts that must be at the forefront as we consider proposals to restore the internet to its full promise.\" Policymakers can't silo privacy from competition, testified Harvard economist Jason Furman. Privacy is at the core of the economics of digital markets, and it shapes competition, said Imperial College Business School economist Tommaso Valletti. He also blamed large tech companies for not providing the data needed to properly assess competition concerns.</p><p>Competition for markets, like the social media market Facebook dominates, will be difficult absent significant policy changes, said Furman. Tech acquisitions are repeatedly approved without scrutiny, he said. Citing a tech sector antitrust immunity, Valletti suggested lowering thresholds for what triggers deal review. Chopra often wonders what the world would look like if Google hadn't bought YouTube, for instance, and small competitors could grow on their own.</p><p>Hidden privacy policy terms are a \"price hike\" that needs to be considered when looking at competition, Chopra said. He argued Facebook unseated MySpace partially through its claims about privacy and control. Facebook says users would \"be able to control who sees your information,\" he recalled. \"We should want firms to compete on terms of privacy.\" Chopra declined to answer reporter questions after the hearing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBK-2GX1-JC8G-817T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 21, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Fines are an appropriate remedy, but they're essentially the cost of business that can easily be passed onto consumers.\" Internet Association didn't comment.</p><p>Through its advertising tech monopoly, Google picks winners and losers, said Louisiana AG Jeff Landry (R): \"Continuing down this road will kill online publishing, or Google will control who stays and who goes. How's that for fulfilling the promise of the internet as an open place?\" He warned corporate power can become stronger than government and, in turn, democracy. Google can tell advertisers everything they need to know about their target audiences, and it's \"wholly\" unregulated, Landry said.</p><p>Peterson cited Columbia Law School professor Tim Wu's claim concentration of private power is a threat to constitutional design, and antitrust law provides the \"final check\" on private power. He suggested Google's past buy of DoubleClick was harmful and called false the arguments the market would even itself out. Antitrust law needs to protect the health of the free market, Peterson said, noting the consumer welfare standard can adapt to the tech industry. He said the scope and power of big tech's data is so far-reaching that it's imperative for AGs, DOJ and the FTC to take this \"very seriously.\" Silicon Valley's shift from mobile technology to artificial intelligence means the U.S. needs to be that much more aware, he said.</p><p>These \"data barons\" are able to build \"super profiles\" of consumers, using location data, purchase data, photos, friends, likes and an endless amount of other information, Peterson said. The question becomes does industry or the consumer own the data, Slatery said.

During a competition policy hearing, Nebraska AG Doug Peterson (R) urged state enforcers to be fast, thorough and thoughtful in probing the industry: \"Once we gather the information necessary, we have to consider whether or not to break things.\"</p><p>\"Structural change driven by the government may well be necessary,\" said Tennessee AG Herbert Slatery (R). \"Working around the edges of regulation is probably not going to help. Fines are an appropriate remedy, but they're essentially the cost of business that can easily be passed onto consumers.\" Internet Association didn't comment.</p><p>Through its advertising tech monopoly, Google picks winners and losers, said Louisiana AG Jeff Landry (R): \"Continuing down this road will kill online publishing, or Google will control who stays and who goes. How's that for fulfilling the promise of the internet as an open place?\" He warned corporate power can become stronger than government and, in turn, democracy. Google can tell advertisers everything they need to know about their target audiences, and it's \"wholly\" unregulated, Landry said.</p><p>Peterson cited Columbia Law School professor Tim Wu's claim concentration of private power is a threat to constitutional design, and antitrust law provides the \"final check\" on private power. He suggested Google's past buy of DoubleClick was harmful and called false the arguments the market would even itself out. Antitrust law needs to protect the health of the free market, Peterson said, noting the consumer welfare standard can adapt to the tech industry. He said the scope and power of big tech's data is so far-reaching that it's imperative for AGs, DOJ and the FTC to take this \"very seriously.\" Silicon Valley's shift from mobile technology to artificial intelligence means the U.S. needs to be that much more aware, he said.</p><p>These \"data barons\" are able to build \"super profiles\" of consumers, using location data, purchase data, photos, friends, likes and an endless amount of other information, Peterson said. The question becomes does industry or the consumer own the data, Slatery said. Tennessee believes consumers own the data, and if industry wants to own it, it must secure consent in a transparent manner, Slatery said: \"Not a person in this room knows how their data is used, much less the value it holds in the hands of these tech companies.\" Peterson argued the so-called \"free\" services aren't entirely free because consumers pay for broadband and mobile use.</p><p>There's also a need for transparency on content moderation, said South Dakota AG Jason Ravnsborg (R) on a separate panel. Every organization needs to explain the \"rules,\" he said. If companies \"make a mistake or it's part of the algorithm, what are they going to do to change it or make an improvement?

The privately held bank's $62 billion CLO portfolio is larger than those of either of the two biggest U.S. bank buyers, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase.

In fact, these sandboxes are battlefields on which the big tech companies are taking great risks with our financial future,\" argues Karen Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, in an op-ed. \"It's troubling enough that Facebook, Google and the like know where we live, who our friends are, and what we think. Consumers offered a savings account by a tech company are unlikely to understand that its higher-returnproducts come with a hidden catch: no safety net or upfront capital to cover claims for redress. Those who trust fintech providers are taking risks virtually no one can predict. With so much at stake, we cannot wait to find out if sandboxes allow cage fighting.\"</p><p>New York Times</p><p>Branching outAs American banks \"shift employees and hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of assets from London to new subsidiaries\" across the European Union, \"one thing is clear about the legacy of Brexit: Financial services will be spread across Europe, withno one city again dominatingthe financial arena as London has.\"</p><p>Washington Post</p><p>Misconduct allegedThe Federal Housing Finance Agency's inspector general said former Director Mel Watt attempted to \"coerce or induce\" arelationship with a female employeewho sought a promotion and accused him of two counts of misconduct. The IG's report, which was completed last November, was obtained by the paper through a Freedom of Information Act request. \"We find that there are no circumstances under which it would be appropriate for the head of FHFA to induce a subordinate female employee to meet with him alone, in his apartment, for a conversation in which he professes his attraction for that employee and holds out opportunities for the employee to serve in specific executive positions over which he exercises total control,\" the report says.

The move is the latest in a recentseries of retreatsmade by the financially stretched Chinese group.\"</p><p>No shorts allowedGermany's financial regulator has barred investors from shorting the stock of digital payments company Wirecard, \"marking the first time it has used such powers to restrict trading in a single stock,\" the paper says. BaFin last used the measure during the 2008 financial crisis to protect the stocks of 11 banks. The regulator cited Wirecard's \"importance for the economy\" and the \"serious threat to market confidence\" following a recent nosedive in its stock price after the paper \"revealed the existence of an internal investigation intoalleged accounting irregularitiesinvolving several of the group's subsidiaries in Asia.\"</p><p>Eye on AmericaBritish fintech GoCardless has raised $75 million \"from some of the biggest technology investors\" as it prepares to launch in the U.S. this year. The company \"allows its more than 30,000 corporate clients to collect recurring payments online using bank account details rather than debit and credit card numbers. The company processesabout $10 billion of paymentsglobally every year.\"</p><p>Not kid stuffSo-called sandboxes for financial technology experimentation create an image \"of small boys clad in tiny hoodies using little pails. In fact, these sandboxes are battlefields on which the big tech companies are taking great risks with our financial future,\" argues Karen Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, in an op-ed. \"It's troubling enough that Facebook, Google and the like know where we live, who our friends are, and what we think. Consumers offered a savings account by a tech company are unlikely to understand that its higher-returnproducts come with a hidden catch: no safety net or upfront capital to cover claims for redress. Those who trust fintech providers are taking risks virtually no one can predict. With so much at stake, we cannot wait to find out if sandboxes allow cage fighting.\"</p><p>New York Times</p><p>Branching outAs American banks \"shift employees and hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of assets from London to new subsidiaries\" across the European Union, \"one thing is clear about the legacy of Brexit: Financial services will be spread across Europe, withno one city again dominatingthe financial arena as London has.\"</p><p>Washington Post</p><p>Misconduct allegedThe Federal Housing Finance Agency's inspector general said former Director Mel Watt attempted to \"coerce or induce\" arelationship with a female employeewho sought a promotion and accused him of two counts of misconduct. The IG's report, which was completed last November, was obtained by the paper through a Freedom of Information Act request. \"We find that there are no circumstances under which it would be appropriate for the head of FHFA to induce a subordinate female employee to meet with him alone, in his apartment, for a conversation in which he professes his attraction for that employee and holds out opportunities for the employee to serve in specific executive positions over which he exercises total control,\" the report says. Watt, who retired at the end of his term last month, has denied he did anything wrong.</p><p>Quotable</p><p>\"When you think of data, AI artificial intelligence, raw digitization of changing processes, we still have tens of thousands of people in call centers, and we know when we can digitize those processes we not onlyradically change or improve the customer experience, it costs less to provide.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000169-05c6-dcbb-a17b-3ddff9cb0000-34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VG2-R8P1-JCRW-5124-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"991\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Nearly two decades later, the anniversary still holds significant weight, particularly for Wall Street, as so many financial firms had offices in the World Trade Center.Since the attacks, there have been plenty of fantastic pieces written uncovering countless acts of heroism. However, if you decide to read one piece today, I encourage you to check out this story from The New Yorker[1] originally published in February 2002. It's a profile of Rick Rescorla, who was a VP in charge of security at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and credited for saving thousands of lives thanks to evacuation plans he put in place prior to the attacks.The entire story is worth a read[2], but the final paragraph, a quote from Rescorla's best friend, is one that has always stuck with me, and is representative of many who lost their lives that day.\"I've tried to tell Susan this, in a way, but she's not ready yet for the truth. In the next weeks or months, I'll get her down here, and we'll take a walk along the ocean, and I'll explain these things. </p><p>You see, for Rick Rescorla, this was a natural death. People like Rick, they don't die old men. They aren't destined for that and it isn't right for them to do so. It just isn't right, by God, for them to become feeble, old, and helpless sons of bitches. There are certain men born in this world, and they're supposed to die setting an example for the rest of the weak bastards we're surrounded with.\"If you're not yet a subscriber, you can sign up here to get your daily dose of the stories dominating banking, business, and big deals.[3]You can also register here for Business Insider's Master Your Money Live Digital Bootcamp series, presented by Fidelity.

Citi's new boss breaks barriers[7] https://www.businessinsider .com/citigroup-ceo-michael-corbat-to-retire-jane-fraser-president-replacement-2020-9;The big news of the day came out of Citigroup, which announced its CEO, Michael Corbat, was retiring effective February 2021.That, in and of itself, would be a big story. But the bigger news was Corbat's replacement: Jane Fraser[8].Fraser's soon-to-be appointment marks the first time a woman has been tapped to lead a major US bank. And while Fraser, who currently serves as president and CEO of Citi's consumer banking division, was pegged by many to eventually take the helm from Corbat, no one anticipated it would come this soon.Graham Rapier and Reed Alexander[9] have all the details, including some instant reaction from analysts.Click here to read the full story.[10] Coatue's alt-data head is out after the firm's $350 million quant fund's trades broke down[11] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/laffonts-alternative-data-buyer-dave-schwartz-no-longer-at-coatue-2020-9Bradley\">https://www.businessinsider.com/laffonts-alternative-data-buyer-dave-schwartz-no-longer-at-coatue-2020-9Bradley</url> Saacks and Alex Morrell[12] have the scoop on the departure of $28 billion hedge fund Coatue's alt-data lead.

Revolution and the like arise when elites forget that they need to share.\" According to Dr Dunlop, we've forgotten the struggles of history that have given us the free and democratic lives we have.</p><p>\"It took blood and determination from the vulnerable,\" he says. \"No elite ever gave up power willingly. All they will ever do is share to preserve their own privilege. As Thomas Jefferson said, 'The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure'.\" The recent Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed it had been able to gather information from 5000 different data points on 200 million individual US citizens.

What if these dictators had got their hands on this trove of information about the habits of each and every one of us?</p><p>Susskind says our future isn't yet set. But it may soon be.</p><p>\"It is fluid, who the power might reside with in the future,\" he says, \"although I regret that it increasingly doesn't look like - if things continue as they are - it will reside in the hands of us, the citizens.\" And it's 50-50 whether our new overlords will be governments or corporations. He says there must be a seismic shift in our awareness: Governments and voters must value data from a citizen's perspective, not that of a customer.</p><p>Dr Dunlop says we must refuse to allow market forces to control our politics: \"Voting and buying are different. In a market, the winner takes all. In a democracy, even the loser must be protected. Democracy is about protecting the rights of the minority. It is not winner-takes-all.</p><p>\"Which is why I want them (big data corporations) - the really big ones - nationalised. We are not a resource to be mined; we are citizens with rights.\" Information is power. And we have little idea how much information about our daily lives we are giving up every time we download a new app, browse web pages or enter search terms.</p><p>To big business, Dr Dunlop says that data is now more valuable than oil. And it's mined directly from you.</p><p>\"Every major business is now, or soon will be, a data organisation,\" he says. \"Data is their primary resource. Woolworths, for example, is a huge real-time experiment in data management drawn from their cash registers, emails, loyalty cards and the like. This governs the emails they send out. Where they place stock in their store. What stock they buy. Their supply chains. We are surveilled in basically every transaction we undertake, online or off.\" And that data can be used for a great deal more than marketing. It can be used to guide what we know. This determines what we believe. And that affects government at every level.</p><p>Dr Dunlop warns we must seize back control of data drawn from our personal lives.</p><p>He argues companies must pay for the right to record and process our activities. But is this even possible?</p><p>\"Everything is hard to do,\" Dr Dunlop says. \"The horse has already bolted. We nonetheless have to rein it in. There are alternatives, and the first step towards achieving them is to acknowledge their existence. The next step is not letting anyone tell you something can't be done.\" Digital technology is muscling in on political functions.</p><p>AI surveils the function of free speech, the heart of democracy. AI guides and compels us to do things we wouldn't otherwise do. AI assumes the roles of justice - such as the distribution of services, the allocation of jobs and mortgages and insurance\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.</p><p>\"Now that tech is colonising the world of the political, is it acceptable for that technology to be developed and judged solely by reference to market principles?\" asks Susskind. \"My answer is no. I think, rather than seeing the marketisation of politics, we will have to see the politicisation of markets - where we impose political norms and standards on big tech firms.\" Big Data firms have assumed, whether they know it or not and even whether they like it or not what have traditionally been political powers. Dr Dunlop says this is why we must come to grips with the value of privacy.</p><p>\"We haven't forgotten. It's just that to live in the world, you have to use these technologies. You can't - or it is very difficult to - live without a credit card or an email address. We've probably been lulled a bit, but the bottom line is that we need to make sure these industries are regulated so our rights, like privacy, are guaranteed.\"But his vision of the future is stark: \"There is a theory that we only get change in the wake of a massive disaster, either a natural disaster like a plague or man-made one like a war. It's up to us to achieve change without that.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-e1c04b12502411e9abfaed57bc942202c629f8c3b2000d9e36fb19a9223669b7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADVSUN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VS1-YM31-F0JP-W219-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1522\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Advertiser Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 30, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

He says there must be a seismic shift in our awareness: Governments and voters must value data from a citizen's perspective, not that of a customer.</p><p>Dr Dunlop says we must refuse to allow market forces to control our politics: \"Voting and buying are different. In a market, the winner takes all. In a democracy, even the loser must be protected. Democracy is about protecting the rights of the minority. It is not winner-takes-all.</p><p>\"Which is why I want them (big data corporations) - the really big ones - nationalised. We are not a resource to be mined; we are citizens with rights.\" Information is power. And we have little idea how much information about our daily lives we are giving up every time we download a new app, browse web pages or enter search terms.</p><p>To big business, Dr Dunlop says that data is now more valuable than oil. And it's mined directly from you.</p><p>\"Every major business is now, or soon will be, a data organisation,\" he says. \"Data is their primary resource. Woolworths, for example, is a huge real-time experiment in data management drawn from their cash registers, emails, loyalty cards and the like. This governs the emails they send out.</p><p>\"Where they place stock in their store. What stock they buy. Their supply chains. We are surveilled in basically every transaction we undertake, online or off.\" And that data can be used for a great deal more than marketing. It can be used to guide what we know. This determines what we believe. And that affects government at every level.</p><p>Dr Dunlop warns we must seize back control of data drawn from our personal lives.</p><p>He argues companies must pay for the right to record and process our activities. But is this even possible?</p><p>\"Everything is hard to do,\" Dr Dunlop says. \"The horse has already bolted. We nonetheless have to rein it in. There are alternatives, and the first step towards achieving them is to acknowledge their existence. The next step is not letting anyone tell you something can't be done.\" Digital technology is muscling in on political functions.</p><p>AI surveils the function of free speech, the heart of democracy. AI guides and compels us to do things we wouldn't otherwise do. AI assumes the roles of justice - such as the distribution of services, the allocation of jobs and mortgages and insurance\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.</p><p>\"Now that tech is colonising the world of the political, is it acceptable for that technology to be developed and judged solely by reference to market principles?\" asks Susskind.</p><p>\"My answer is no. I think, rather than seeing the marketisation of politics, we will have to see the politicisation of markets - where we impose political norms and standards on big tech firms.\" Big data firms have assumed, whether they know it or not and even whether they like it or not, what have traditionally been political powers. Dr Dunlop says this is why we must come to grips with the value of privacy.</p><p>\"We haven't forgotten. It's just that to live in the world, you have to use these technologies. You can't - or it is very difficult to - live without a credit card or an email address. We've probably been lulled a bit, but the bottom line is that we need to make sure these industries are regulated so our rights, like privacy, are guaranteed.\"But his vision of the future is stark: \"There is a theory that we only get change in the wake of a massive disaster, either a natural disaster like a plague or man-made one like a war. It's up to us to achieve change without that.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-816c52ea568411e9a1c4a8afa9367263b501cfa042d50c4a1219400a59181852</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADVSUN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTH-TY31-JD3N-550V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1523\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Advertiser Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 6, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for sticking around. We -- pleased to have with us Bruce Van Saun, CEO of <person><nameText>Citizens </nameText></person>Financial. And I think you know the drill by now. What we'll do is do 20 to 30 minutes of fireside chat-style Q&amp;A. You have the cards on your seats or next to you. As questions come up, please fill them out, and I'll start mixing them in at the 20- to 30-minute point at some point. So Bruce, thank you for being here once again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: A year ago when we sat here, some of the postelection optimism had worn off the bank sector, but since then, we've seen some real positive developments in terms of rates, tax reform, deregulation. Perhaps you could give us your view on the outlook for the banking sector in the near to medium term?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.: Well, I actually am quite bullish on the outlook for the banking sector. We have an administration that's focused on a growth agenda and that's favorable for banking performance. So I think you should see that transmitted through to higher loan demand as this year goes on. You also see, I think, interest rates continue on their upward path, which is good for asset-sensitive banks and less regulation also, I think, frees up resources to focus on doing more for customers and doing more for the real economy. So there's a number of reasons that I think the outlook continues to be sanguine. I think borrowers are in good shape, so interest rates rise has been moderate, and we don't see signs of stress from a credit standpoint. And there is a lot of focus now on transformational business models to become more digital and to figure out how to use data and to become more personal in your interactions with your customers. And so it's a very interesting time, but I think there's a bit of a tailwind.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And then specifically in terms of <person><nameText>Citizens, </nameText></person>you appear, certainly, more leveraged than most regional banks to all of the good things that have happened and continue to happen in terms of rates sensitivity, tax reform, excess capital. As we move forward past these near-term positives, what are your key priorities over the next few years?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Well, I think, ultimately, we want to get to a top-performing bank status, where we're highly respected and we run a great consumer bank and we run a great commercial bank. I think the things that should differentiate us would be how we interact with customers, our real focus on helping customers reach their potential, becoming that trusted adviser to individuals on life's journey or companies as they try to grow their businesses. So we got to get that right, if you're going to create long-term franchise value. I think we'll be at this mindset of continuous improvement, like we like to refer to it. So we'll continue to operate the bank with real financial and operating discipline. And I think we've demonstrated that we can do that, and you should expect that to continue. And then the other thing is, we really want to build out excellence in our capabilities because banking is a crowded landscape, and so the places that you're playing, you've got to have top-quality people and top-quality offerings. And so that's part of the build process that we're going through, and I've been quite pleased, since we've separated from RBS, at our ability to really attract top talent into the company.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Right. You mentioned loan growth. Loan growth, C&amp;I loan growth, specifically, for the industry was disappointing last year. And you had some slowing as well, but 1Q looks solid. And the industry trends, and we -- I'm sure you view that, I think we see an acceleration over the balance of the year. What are you hearing from your commercial borrowers? And what do you expect in terms of C&amp;I growth going forward?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Yes. So I think we're still looking for a positive loan growth scenario for this year. We'll see -- I think, right now we are seeing C&amp;I pickup quite dramatically relative to kind of the second half performance of last year. So we had decent level of spot loan growth in Q1. We entered Q2 with very strong pipelines, and we're pulling those pipelines through and the pipelines are refilling. So kind of what I expected to see in response to tax reform and some of the pro-growth policies is starting to gain some traction. So we think that's quite positive. On the Consumer side, we've had more of a niche strategy, where we go into pockets like education refinance loans or some of our installment merchant financing, and I think we've been able to get a decent and consistent level of growth, while also bringing down some areas where we may have a bit of overexposure such as auto and kind of play a balance sheet optimization game in terms of the mix of assets and where we're playing. So we're still able to achieve that growth, notwithstanding we are reducing some portfolios and growing others, but I like the way that the outlook is shaping up for Consumer as well as for Commercial.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And in terms of commercial real estate, which has been an area of relative strength, given that you had low concentration coming out of the IPO, how much runway for growth do you see there?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: I think that market is still behaving quite well. So I think there is a proper amount of discipline on the part of investors/borrowers, and also the banks. And so I think the banks are staying close to another A list clients that they have confidence are good operators and are doing strong projects. And -- but stuff is still getting done. There are still needs in the kind of general geographies that we serve for more of certain types of assets, whether it's multifamily or office or distribution space. And so we're continuing to see some opportunities, and I think we're being properly disciplined about that, but there's still some runway there, and so I think we'll still continue to grow. I'm not sure we'll make it all the way back to being equal weight, but the fact that we start with an underweight position, given what occurred with RBS being overweight and then forcing us to downsize our portfolio, I think we're continuing to regain some market share.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And then back on the Consumer side, you mentioned student and auto and those are 2 areas that I think people, at least investors that I speak with, tend to recoil, and there is some genuine fear about exposures there. What gives you confidence in your...</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: I really don't have -- that's kind of the last of my worry list for us. Because I think where we've chosen to play in terms of risk appetite is really at the high end of the spectrum. So I think our auto portfolio is mostly super prime and high prime, and the same thing with the student loans that we have. And we're probably 2/3 at refi versus in-school lending, and that tends to be even higher credit quality as well. So I think we have good discipline in those 2 spaces and there may be some storm clouds building farther down the credit spectrum, but we are not playing in those parts of the spectrum.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Shifting to the other side of the balance sheet, there's a -- seems to be a hyperfocus with investors now on deposit competition, deposit betas, which have been very low thus far, but we're starting to see some healthy offers. What's your view on deposit competition as we move forward?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Yes, I think that you're seeing the deposit competition in the places that you would expect to see it. And so -- and the betas being higher in the areas where you would expect to see them being higher. So I think, again, the corporates are seeing their loans replaced, and they are generally sophisticated and they have treasurers or CFOs who are saying, \"Okay, if you're going to charge me more on my loans, I want more on my cash.\" And so you're seeing that ramp at a decent clip now. I think wealth customers as well who -- 5% or 10% of their invested portfolio that's sitting in cash, that's -- that can be real money to make sure you're getting a little better return and squeezing out more on that cash. So the areas that you would expect to see the betas starting to click up, I think we're seeing, but I think it's what we expected to see, the whole industry expected to see. And I think the more mass balances the consumer balances where there is smaller balances, where it doesn't make as much difference if somebody's got $800 in their savings account, they're not clamoring to see the rate pass through there because it doesn't amount to all that much money at the end of the day. And so the law of those numbers is a big part of your deposit base and that's, I think, helped to keep the overall betas at a manageable level up till now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Some of the perceived curve busters on the deposit side of the direct-to-consumer banks that we've -- that we see with some of the healthier offers. You recently announced a new direct-to-consumer platform, <person><nameText>Citizens </nameText></person>Access. Could you tell us about your strategy there? And where you see that going over the next few years?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Yes. I think the overall direct banks, online banks, are targeting a snipe segment of the market that is more rate sensitive and maybe a little more sophisticated and prepared to go online and shop for a better rate. And I think the customer experience there plays into who they get comfortable with, where they want to go shopping, where they want to transact. I think what we've -- as we've continued to digitize the company and get stronger in our digital offerings and really enhance our data analytics and data capabilities, it's just a natural next step to put a direct bank out there, and we have, already, a national consumer lending footprint. We might as well go nationally with an offering around the savings side and the deposit side. So makes a lot of sense to us, and I think it's complementary to what we offer to our customers through the branches and other channels.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So on the subject of competition, there's been some controversy about how much of the benefit from tax reform that the banks will hold on to versus what will be competed away. What's your view on that?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: I think it's likely that the status quo will hold for some time period. And so I think, generally, banks have become much more sophisticated and looking at rate of return calculations on individual customers or on companies. And so credit oftentimes is already thin -- thinly priced and the way it gets to the total return is looking at the total sale -- the total wallet and bringing in some of those fees and it's in addition to that. So I think there is a bit of price competition in the commercial space today. I'm not sure it's linked to the tax reform. I think it's probably more that as loan growth and people compete more to try to get -- keep their share. And so I think it will be interesting to see in the second half of the year, as loan demand picks back up, do you start to see the competition lifting a little bit because the rising tide lifts all boats and maybe that eases off a bit. I would think that would be the case. So I don't think you're seeing an immediate transmittal of well, let's get really sharp on our loan spreads because now we have a boost to our ROE. I don't really think that's happening. I don't think that will happen for some time. And banks are disciplined on the deposit side too, they could pass it through on the deposits. And I think you're seeing that discipline hold that banks are very motivated to continue to improve their returns.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Maybe shifting gears to some of your revenue and expense initiatives. Your top 1 through 4 initiatives have been aimed at driving revenue growth and expense efficiencies. Can you update us on your most recent progress?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Yes. So I think this is one capability that probably is unique amongst our peer groups, is the ability to have that discipline and that mindset of continuous improvement that we're constantly looking for ways to run the bank better and we try to collect all the ideas we can come up with or that we can get from outside folks who say you should think about this and we're doing this at another bank. And so we put those into a program every year and the size of these things is quite impactful. So the top 1 was $200 million when I first arrived, and we've had a cadence of about $100 million to $125 million with 2, 3 and 4, and we're on track to deliver top 4 in that same range. We did hint that stay tuned for July, which is when we typically announce the next TOP program, that there might be a TOP 5 coming. But I think there is still opportunities to run the bank better, more efficiently, to deepen relationships with customers and drive more revenues. We've tried to keep the mix of those programs at least 50% on the expense side because you all as investors kind of say expense saves, we can take to the bank. We're not always sure about whether the revenue materializes, but we have a way of actually tracking this to make sure that if we say we're going to deliver this, that we monitor and measure have we actually delivered it. So anyway -- but I think that balance has worked out well and served us well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: In terms of specific initiatives, consumer fee growth has been a target, specifically, mortgage and wealth management. You have some news today in the mortgage side. Maybe you could -- for those who haven't seen it, maybe you could sort of...</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Sure. So we had a lot of work to do, when I arrived, to actually position us for a stronger mortgage business, and part of that was just putting the infrastructure in place and then there were a lot of compliance changes with TRID. So there was a lot of investing to do to basically have a platform that really worked and that was much more electronic than digital. And while we were doing that, we were out trying to scale up the business and recruit more loan officers. So we've taken the LO count from about 350 at the beginning of the year, we headed up to 525. My guess is, we'll probably finish the year this year about 525. One of the things we're doing this year is kind of focusing more on conforming and more linkage to the branches and being more disciplined in terms of the exact LO demographic that we're looking for. So you'll see a little bit of churn in the count, and then I think you'll start to see us resume to grow again. But when we step back and look at the business, our scale was not where it needed to be overall and the channel is really limited to the retail LO channel and some direct-to-consumer digital and phone marketing that we were doing. So Franklin acquisition that we just announced today, Franklin American, really is a beautifully complementary acquisition to -- and right in the sweet spot of our strategy. So they have a $40 billion servicing portfolio. Our servicing portfolio today is $20 billion, so it triples the size, which is roughly the proportion that you should have off-balance sheet to on-balance sheet servicing. And it also brings new channels to us, the B2B channel, so the correspondent and wholesale channels and all of that volume is really conforming. So the retail channel tends to be maybe half conforming and half nonconforming. The correspondent channel will be much more conforming, which is really fee revenue. So we find it compelling from a financial standpoint, compelling from a strategic standpoint, and I think moves us quite a bit down the track in terms of having the mortgage business in the right place.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And solid deal metrics, 1.1x tangible, 2% accretion?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Yes. 2% in '19, 3% in 2020, less than 3-year burnback, so some great metrics, and our fee percentage takes a boost by 2%. So that's one thing people look at the model and say, I wish you had a little more fees while we bought the M&amp;A shop last year. Now we've done mortgage. We've said we're also looking in the wealth space to kind of turbo charge some of the things we have going on there. So I think if we can find really high-quality franchises that fit with our culture and we think we can really leverage those capabilities, I think those are smart things to do. And the size is such that they don't really tie up a lot of capital, they can kind of be seen as bolt-ons and add-ons and help us get to the metrics that we're trying to get to faster.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And on the Commercial side, what are the fee revenue opportunities that you see?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Yes. So there, there's really 3 big areas. One I would broadly call Capital Markets, and I think we've really built up that business so that it's very strong and very high quality in terms of being able to compete with money centers and all the super regional banks and RE deals in terms of loan syndications. And we're in bond underwriting deals as well. There is more activities that we can engage in there as we continue to build out that business, so either getting deeper by having more force and more people as we build up our coverage groups, combined with broadening capabilities, I think there is nice potential for that business going forward. We also have a business which we call Global Markets, which is really interest rate and FX risk management capabilities, which we used to do in conjunction with RBS. And so we had to move off their platforms, stand up our own platform and then go out and recruit new people and have kind of a new approach to the business. There as well, I think, we're scratching the surface of having some, I think, great new capabilities and talent that's joined the company, and so you're going to see, I think, future growth and expansion into some more sophisticated products than what we've had before. And then lastly, it's -- the big sticky product area is cash management, and I think we've probably outgrown the market over the, I'd say, the last 3, 4 years, maybe we're high single digits and the natural rate of growth appears as maybe half of that at best, maybe 2% to 4%. And I think there is opportunity, as we continue to grow our loan book and our book of customers, to actually accelerate that once we put our new cash management platform in place, which will start to roll out late this year into the first half of next year. So one of the things we're excited about is when we get up into the bigger customers, we bump into the JPs and the big guys with their cash management platforms and all the bells and whistles they have. We have a very good platform for middle market companies. In fact, we won an award from Global Finance for having one of the best for middle market, but if we want to capture some of that opportunity with the bigger companies, then I think we had to move and take that step to make the investment and upgrade that platform. So we're excited about what that potential is for the business in 2019 and beyond.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Moving to the expense side. When we think about opportunities for banks on the expense side, branch networks seem ripe for rationalization. You've shown a willingness to prune and even exit markets. How should we think about the future potential for cost saves versus the constant need to invest in technology?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Sure. So I'd say, we've had about a 1200 branch count, 800 stand-alone and 400 in-stores, and that's slowly being rationalized. Maybe that's down 50 over the last 2, 3 years. And there is 2 things that are going on. One is to look for consolidations at the margin where we can make them work, but then I think more importantly is what we call our branch transformation program, which is to take kind of yesteryear's branches that had on average 4,300 square feet and lots of space dedicated for tellers and kind of reposition them as advice centers with the smart machines up front to handle transactions, maybe only one universal banker or teller-type individual and then a bunch of private meeting rooms where people can make appointments and see specialists. So the nature of the people in the branches has changed, the nature of what the branches are used for has changed, and, oh, by the way, those newly designed branches probably only need 2,200 square feet or less. So I think that's something that over time will continue to drive a reduction in the rentable square foot base, which will save us money combined with the closures where you get 100 cents on the dollar from what you close. And I think when you kind of go back to what I said about the mindset of self-funding, is we know we need to keep investing in digital, we know we need to keep investing in data and so extract some expense dollars that are no longer efficiently used to serve your customers and turn around and invest in the things -- how the customer wants to transact with you in the future, and so that's basically what we're doing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Now that invest side, I think there is some question among investors. Will a bank of <person><nameText>Citizens</nameText></person>' size, and you're not a small bank, you're a big bank, but you have giant universal banks investing billions of dollars a year in technology. How will a bank your size be able to compete with them?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Yes, I think that's a very topical question these days because the biggest banks are pounding their chests about how great their brand is and how great the amount of money they're spending on technology, but they're also complex institutions, and there's a lot of things that they're doing, not just in consumer banking. They're doing a lot in investment banking and other things, which a fair amount of that money is directed that way. I think why I am confident that banks our size can continue to perform well is we typically run on vendor platforms that the industry is sharing, if you will. So if there is a number of regional banks on an FIS platform, for example, there's scale from that and there is demands on FIS to take care of all the needs that they see from multiple points of view and put that into the next release. So I think there is some very good vendor platforms out there that we take advantage of, but then kind of it's like cable, the last mile is really important of how you connect to your consumer. I do think that we can be nimble and really differentiate at that customer interface point. And I can give you an example, so we've had -- we've won an award from Javelin for having the best functionality of our mobile banking app for 4 years running. And last year, we ended up in a tie for first, BofA crept up and tied us. But how -- with all the money they can spend, how can we be in the same kind of conversation, and it really is being out, understanding your customer, talking to your customer, having focus groups and testing and learning and try to put really good functionality into your application. So anyway, I don't think there is a high correlation between size and efficiency ratio. So other things creep in when you get big that make it harder to manage, and I think banks our size can be flexible and nimble and can be very competitive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Great, maybe shifting to capital. We're a few weeks away from the CCAR results. You said you have a goal of managing your capital ratios back down to peers' levels over time. What do you see as a destination in terms of CET1? And maybe remind us of your capital deployment priorities?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Sure. So we refreshed our medium-term targets that we had set some at the time of the IPO and then we've achieved those last year. So in January, we put new ones out and as part of those targets, we put a CET1 ratio of 10:10.25. I think what I'd say about that is, that's not a fixed destination. I think what you have to focus on is your relative position to where your peers go. And peers are making a lot of noise and they want to get lower than that. They want to get to 9%. I think there's no fundamental reason that we need to have a premium relative to peers. If you look at our credit losses under the CCAR stress test, we're actually slightly better than the median. So there's not a flaw in our business model that requires extra capital. I think we've been properly cautious in terms of bringing down that ratio on a glide path, just because we're relatively new, we have to gain confidence from stakeholders, including the rating agencies and regulators that we're running the bank well and that we can, over time, just excise that premium. Today, announcing the deal, it's not a bad thing to have a little bit of extra capital because, I think, right now we've been able to have loan growth that exceeds that of our peers. We've had close to 100% return of capital, so we're shareholder friendly in terms of what we're returning to our shareholders. And then we can squeeze in deals that use a little bit of that CET1 up. And so I think, we're on the glide path, we're managing it down, we'll keep an eye on where peers go, and we'll continue to move that down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So given your size, you're one of those banks between 50 and 250 (sic) [$50 billion and $250 billion] and that's in terms of assets. So we sort of got this 18-month period before the change in the CCAR would affect you. Once out of the process, how do you see that? Does it affect the speed of capital return? Does it -- is there an expense save? How do you see the impact of that?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Well, I think we're starting to institutionalize these processes and, therefore, can start to release some resources. It's kind of things that we see across the bank. We had a lot of work to do coming out of RBS, there was a lot of remediation and other regulatory issues that we were behind on and frameworks we had to build in compliance and things we had to do. Once you remediate old issues, you put your frameworks in place and you start to industrialize how they operate. You just don't need as many people. And so we've been benefiting, over time, we crested, maybe a couple of years ago, 18 months ago, and as we're coming out the other side and we're running the bank better, we're gaining some efficiencies there. So I think the CCAR process is similar in many respects to that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: One of the things that we're hearing increasing concerns from investors on is the potential impact on capital and earnings from CECL accounting as it rolls on 2019 into 2020. How do you -- what's your view on that? And how it might impact?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: I think the industry in general believes that CECL is somewhat misguided, and that it is going to be procyclical. So what problem are you trying to solve and then you come up with a solution that actually doesn't solve the problem, in some ways makes it worse. But the ship sails and the pronouncement is the pronouncement. I think now we have to kind of do our best to understand how to implement it and what implications it has on the portfolios that we want to hold. And then, what implications it has on the capital position, and how is the Fed, in particular, going to deal with those extra reserves? Is it something that you get credit for in your loss scenarios? Or is it something that became, if it's a 10% bump up or 15% bump up in your reserves, is it just a new way to capture capital that you don't get the benefit of? So I'm optimistic that if you make the argument that, hey, the risks are the same, the accounting changed, but there shouldn't be a need for more capital just because the accounting changed, that shouldn't drive the capital requirement. I think we can -- the industry can make those arguments to the regulators, and usually the regulators are looking for the proper decisions, and kind of truth and justice usually prevail in those discussions. So there'll be a kind of a learning process and adjusting process, and I think we'll find ways to cope with it and manage it successfully.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Great. Last one from me before we shift to some audience questions. So your stock trades at a discount to regional bank peers, we see that as an opportunity. What do you think the market is missing in terms of valuation versus other regional banks? And what do you think you can do to change that?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Yes. Well, if you go back to the last couple of years, that wasn't the case. And if you actually go back to January, we had a premium. So I think we've fallen -- fallen off in terms of our valuation over the last, maybe 3 or 4 months. And we've seen that in the past, I think when risk tends to go off and people are a bit concerned about the outlook for a year, that often happens in the first half of the year because there's not enough quarters in the bank to demonstrate that you're able to execute and put up the good numbers. We've had, I think, a softer start to the year, almost every year since we've been a public company. I think what we've had happen later in the year is, \"Okay, well, these guys continue to execute and they're putting up great numbers.\" And the market starts to look ahead to the next year, and I think your stock is ultimately going to be anchored in your numbers, where's your EPS going? Where's your return on equity going? And ours has moved -- has improved at a faster clip than our peer group. And ultimately, you're rewarded for that. So my view is we'll continue to execute. I think we're going to have a very solid outlook for this year, I think we had a very strong first quarter. I think we gave outlook guidance for second quarter, it's going to be very strong. And I think that The Street is moving numbers up on us in the second half of the year, much like happened last year. So my hope is that, ultimately, if we deliver, the stock should take care of itself. And I think there's -- the worry beads would be things like the LDR that we have as the screen -- or the cost of interest-bearing deposits going up may be at the higher end of peers. But I would say to that is that we still think there's accretive opportunities to put our capital to work and good loan portfolios that at the margin, it's still accretive to NIM and it's still accretive to our overall performance. And so if we have to pay up a little bit to get the deposit growth to fund the loan growth, and we're building out our franchise and taking on new customers that we can cross-sell our fee-based services to, that's ultimately a good thing. And we have the initiatives on the deposit side that, I think, will continue to have a positive impact. They don't -- there is many of them, and they're running simultaneously and they have gradual impact on things like <person><nameText>Citizens </nameText></person>Access, I think will have a positive impact at the highest marginal cost of the deposits that we're raising. So there's a number of things we have that, I think, will allow us to manage that cost arc in a positive way. But the market can -- there can be some folks who are skeptical about that, and we'll just have to demonstrate that we have a plan and we can execute that plan and the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Great. Okay, shifting to some audience questions. Now you have a medium-term target of 300 to 500 basis points of operating leverage annually, what gives you the confidence that you can achieve that?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Well, I think we've demonstrated that we've been able to do that on a consistent basis. And again, you start with, if you got 70% or so of your revenue in net interest income and you can grow your loan book at maybe nominal GDP plus 1 and you're asset-sensitive, then you get to a kind of 70% of your revenues are going to be growing at a pretty good clip. And then combined that with the fee potential of the franchise where we're immature still in some capabilities and we're making the investments and we're going to pull through the return on those investments, I think we should get a reasonably good, hopefully, faster than that growth on the fee side. So to me, it always starts with, can you drive revenue growth and deliver that top line growth because then it makes everything a lot easier, then you can continue to invest. And if we, on the expense side, continue to have this mindset of continuous improvement, I think we can constrain the rate of expense growth by continuing to seek those inefficient use of expense dollars and then invest in the digital, invest in the data, invest in the things of tomorrow and do that at a spread. And so last year, we had 10% revenue growth, 3% expense growth, 7% operating leverage. You're not going to be able to do that every year, but every year we've been a public company we've been able to stay within that 3 to 5 or better corridor. I don't really think we've exhausted the opportunity set to do that for the foreseeable future.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Great. This one says, what do you see as the most disruptive force in commercial banking -- in banking over the next 5 years?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: That's a hard one, if you -- to just single out one, there's certainly lots of ways to answer that. I'd say, really moving to that digital business model is a point of disruption that banks who execute well, can turn that into an opportunity and strengthen relationship with their customers and banks who fall behind can see their franchise value erode at a, probably a faster clip than used to occur. So in banking, typically things evolve, there's evolutionary change, not revolutionary change and you could be in a group or the pack that's following behind the leaders and never fall too far behind in your business model, adjust, and you sustain the value of your franchise. I think we're at a point, and I had a conversation with Ginni Rometty of IBM about this, who thinks we're at one of those every 25 years, there's major technological change that alters the way consumers behave and interact with companies and how technology is utilized and how companies need to operate, and we're in one of those periods now with the use of data and things moving digital. And so making sure you have talent in your organization, who can see around the corners, work with partners to really stay on the front foot in that vein is really, really important. And I think if you get that wrong or you fall too far behind, that can start to erode your franchise value.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just to follow up on that, so right now, the vision you've got a multichannel offering with the branch banking, mobile, online and now you have <person><nameText>Citizens </nameText></person>Access, which is presumably going to run in parallel. Does there come a point where they converge? And how do you see that happening?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Yes, it could be. We'll see. So right now, our deposit system that we run for the core franchise is stable and good and solid. The one that we're running on is a newer version. It's also an FIS platform, but it's kind of the latest and greatest version. And so it allows us to do some things that, I think, we'll test and we'll learn and we'll see, whether it's worth converging those platforms down the road. So that's one of the things that I like about that whole <person><nameText>Citizens </nameText></person>Access initiative is you get to try out your personalization in terms of using data. You just get the muscle that you need to compete 5 years down the road, and you're doing it in a very concerted effort with a team that's focused on that and those learnings can then be ported back in to the core franchise.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I have a follow-up here on the deal announcement today. Talk a bit about -- I'd ask, basically, why Franklin American? And why now?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: I believe that Franklin American is an exceptionally well-run company with a very strong reputation in the marketplace. One of our board members, Hoddy Hanna, who's Chair and CEO of Howard Hanna Real Estate Services, probably I think the third biggest private mortgage originator in the country, is a client of Franklin American and raves about their level of service, the quality of their technology, the quality of their people. So I think you have to start with that. It's not just let's do enough to the numbers where we can buy something at 1:1 and the math is going to work. If we want to get scale on the servicing side, and we want to diversify the origination capabilities that we have, who's out there that's really a high-quality franchise and somebody that we know, that we respect in the marketplace, and this was an opportunity that came along, and I think nothing ever comes along exactly when you want it to come along. It's the owner of that business. It's a 100% owned by an individual, feels it's time that he's ready to sell the business. You have to respond when the property's on the market. So I think it's actually a good time to be buying. I think that there's a bit of a hedge that the servicing -- as rates are moving up, the servicing becomes more valuable and maybe there's a little reduction in the origination capability, but if you're thinking long term and you're thinking, what do we need in the mortgage business to really be a factor and run a great business for the next 20 years, property like this comes along, you jump on it, you buy it, you execute it and, again, it's not so much money that it impacts any of our ratios or what we're doing from a capital management standpoint.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: A couple of follow-up questions on the stock price conversation. Pointing basically that the recent underperformance seems to start with the Manafort stories. You came out pretty quick -- pretty strongly that day and basically said that there is no there, there, I think. So to the extent of it, any additional conversations with regulators or updates?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Well, I mean, I guess, what you could -- if there were a problem, would we be announcing the deal today?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Right.</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: So I'll just -- ask yourself that question. If you go back and look at our regulatory disclosures and how they've gotten thinner and thinner over time, we can't comment on our ratings publicly, but there's enough breadcrumbs out there that you can figure out that we've done a lot of good work to get the bank in a great position from a risk and regulatory and compliance standpoint, and we're at the point where we can go out and play offense and do deals. And as I think we said in that release, that we think our AML capabilities are very, very strong.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Great. Couple of questions, somewhat related to the deal and that. With the changes to Dodd-Frank, does it change how you view bank M&amp;A going forward?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: No, I think you'll probably see an uptick in bank M&amp;A, like you just saw with [Fifler's] deal. So I think there'll be some of our peers who've been acquisitive in the past will look to do bank deals. I think what we've said for <person><nameText>Citizens </nameText></person>is, we want to focus on a running the bank better and getting organic growth, which we've been able to do and there is more of that to get, and then build out our capabilities and focus on building up those fee franchises. And I still think that's the winning strategy for us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Question on competitors entering your market. So Chase is entering key markets like Boston, how do you view competition playing out?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: There's never a shortage of competition in any of the markets that we serve. There's plenty of banks out there, and what I would say is, that's why the customer experience and becoming a trusted adviser are paramount because whether it's a fintech disruptor, whether it's a money center bank, whether it's a big tech attempted disrupter, you will be able to hold on to your clients if your clients trust you and they are very satisfied with your services and that you're helping them on life's journey if they're an individual, or you're helping them be successful if they're corporate. And so that's really where we're directing our investment. I would say, we've seen big banks come into these markets before. Citi had a similar strategy about 10 years ago. They were in Boston. They were in Philadelphia. They pulled up their stakes. They're out of all those markets. It's not that easy, ultimately, to go in when all the prime locations have been taken. The people, the quality people are going to be well tended to and the banks are going to protect their investment in their people. And the amount of, I think, effort that we put into communities in terms of not only financial contribution but having the mass and the force to make a difference and be at every event with volunteers who are making these communities better, that goes a long way to protecting your position in the marketplace. So JP can come into those markets, they'll just compete, just like all the other people we compete against. I don't think we're quaking in our boots. I think we're confident that we have a lot of good tools and a lot of good position and strong franchises in Boston and Philadelphia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: This one says can you tell us -- can you update us on what's going on with your relationship with Apple?</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE W. VAN SAUN</nameText></person>: Yes, I think we've said all along that we have a very strong relationship with Apple. I think we're aligned around the importance of customer experience and we continue to receive very positive feedback on Apple. And I can't comment on why. If Goldman is trying to insinuate that they're going to broaden their relationship with Apple, that's not anything that I would have a perspective on. I think all I can comment on is our relationship with Apple, and I think it's a very strong and healthy relationship.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Great. Bruce, thank you very much.

We have a nice, full room here, and there's a whole bunch of people joining us via webcast. So I would just like to start off, as always, and say welcome. Thanks, everyone, for joining us at <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>Synergy 2015.</p><p>I think this is probably the seventh year in a row that we have included a financial analyst meeting in conjunction with our Synergy event. We think it just leverages a lot of the activities that are going on, give you a much broader perspective of the organization.</p><p>Hopefully, those of you that are here had a chance to sit in on the morning keynote this morning. There is a keynote tomorrow morning as well. And more importantly, just having the ability to have spent time with our customers, our partners, and the broader part of the <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>team to get a better understanding of the types of challenges that customers face, how we are addressing those with solutions, et cetera. So please take advantage of that.</p><p>And for those of you joining us via webcast, all of the major keynotes will be streamed on our website. If they are not up there already, they will be shortly. So please take the opportunity to cover that. I think it is great context, shows you a lot of what we are up to these days from a product point of view, operationally and corporate.</p><p>So the idea here is, similar to prior years, is that we talk in the keynotes about a pretty high level, and this is about making it a little bit more operational, taking it down a click and being very specific, specific about the product areas that we are operating in, how we are competing in individual categories, how we are thinking about solutions on a broader solution basis, how we are bringing these technologies to customers, and give you the opportunity to interact with the team more broadly.</p><p>So I will kick off here in a few minutes and talk about <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>from a tops-down point of view, fully focused on financials and the operating plan. After that, I will call up Geir Ramleth. Geir is a new member of the organization. He is our Chief Strategy Officer and Senior Vice President and General Manager of Workspace Services.</p><p>Geir is going to take a little bit of a different spin and talk more about security. We've got a lot of questions coming from this audience to better articulate how do you fit into a broader security context, what does that mean from a <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>point of view. So he is going to talk just for a few minutes about that and try to be a little bit more specific around security. And then we will drill into individual product areas on a more granular basis.</p><p>Bill Burley, longtime <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>veteran, who is our head of Windows app delivery, talk about everything we are doing on a XenApp and desktop front. Brian Dye, who runs mobile app delivery, will be here. Klaus Oestermann, Senior Vice President and General Manager of our delivery networking business; a lot of exciting things going on with NetScaler and CloudBridge. He will take you down all of those details.</p><p>After that, Carlos Sartorius, our new SVP of Worldwide Sales and Services, we will talk about customers, talk about routes to customers and be much more specific about where we win, where we have got challenges, and really what we are doing about it going forward, all in driving higher productivity for our teams and much higher customer success across the board.</p><p>And Chris Hylen, who is the Senior Vice President and General Manager of our mobility apps business, talk a lot about all these critical services that we demoed, many of them today, and how it fits into the broader <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>portfolio, not only as individual technologies, but as critical elements of many of our broader solutions.</p><p>We will take a break for those of you here in the room. And then all of the speakers, plus Mark Templeton, our President and CEO, will be available for Q&amp;A discussion. And then those of you that are here, we welcome you to join us in person at a reception that we will be having just right around the quarter here.</p><p>So with that, let's jump right in. Obviously, there's a few statements today that are forward-looking in nature. And they are, of course, pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions and the risks that can be found on our website and within our SEC filings.</p><p>So as I said, I am going to spend a little bit more time talking about financials and operations. I know that there is a lot of familiarity with the business in this room, but there's a number of you that just haven't been that close to <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>for a while. And so we just spend a couple of minutes giving context around how we got to where we are today.</p><p>This story that we talked about this morning is really not new for <person><nameText>Citrix. </nameText></person>It is the continuing evolution of a message that we have been on and a core belief that we have had for many, many years.</p><p>So when you take a step back and look at <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>by the numbers, last year we were about a $3.1 billion organization. We operate with between 9,000 and 10,000 employees around the globe. We have official offices in 36 countries. And we are fortunate to work with about 10,000 partners around the globe, being able to service customers in well over 100 countries. So we are pretty much everywhere our customers need us to be.</p><p>And that partner network, many of which are here this week, so hopefully you have a chance to interact with them, includes everything from the largest global systems integrators that are focused on major transformation efforts with our customers, down through more regional service providers to allow even SMB-type engagement with our customers.</p><p>We've got a broad portfolio of solutions that we've built up over the years to be able to address the needs of our customers. And we operate with a leading market share across all the major categories and have been recognized as a leader in some of the new, emerging areas like enterprise mobility, enterprise file sharing, et cetera.</p><p>But as I said, this isn't necessarily a new story. This is a continuation of a journey that we have been on for a long time. In fact, for many, many, many years, we have had this fundamental belief, this belief that work is not a place, but it's something you do. And giving employees the capabilities to be productive on their terms raises that productivity substantially, creates a much higher level of engagement, and the obvious financial benefits for the end customer.</p><p>So when you look way back, back -- a little over 10 years ago, we talked about remote access, because that is what the technology of the day enabled us to do. It was either delivering the client/server application over a wide area network to enhance performance, or just simply road warriors and people needing to dial in to access their corporate intranet.</p><p>That has expanded as Web architectures became much more prevalent. Things were being delivered inside of a browser. And that is why we broadened out to include delivery networking, to effectively do the same types of things for Web apps that we have been doing for client/server apps for all these years: securing, optimizing, enhancing and managing, et cetera.</p><p>A number of years ago when virtualization, of course, became much more mainstream, for the first time ever, customers were able to disaggregate the pieces of their infrastructure and reconnect them in a way that was much more flexible and driving the types of business benefits that they needed to have. And then, obviously, over the last couple of years, we have been in this world that is characterized, obviously, by mobility, broad proliferation of devices, cloud services, et cetera. And so we have been going through this pivot as an organization to really build up our mobile side. And we have been talking about that to you for the last couple of years as the broad pivot towards workspace services. And you put this all over the broad umbrella of a software-defined workspace.</p><p>So in simple terms, our mission is to provide our customers with digital tools and services to mobility-transform their business, to give employees the ability to consume IT as a service, regardless of device, location, network, et cetera, enhancing productivity and enhancing financial and business benefits for customers. That's a journey we have been on for a long time, and that is driving everything we do and everything we plan on doing in the future.</p><p>And when you step back, you look at this from a financial point of view, this is a chart that I personally have been using for a dozen years now, and using it to describe the broad evolutions of the organization and some of the things going on around us that has really forced and allowed the Company to respond and react to evolve to all of those changing forces. I talked about them just a minute ago -- access, collaboration, networking, et cetera, et cetera -- and deliver really consistent up-and-to-the-right type financial results from a 1000-foot view.</p><p>It's also allowed us, through this journey, to broaden the available market. As the types of technology requirements for our customers have changed pretty dramatically, it has allowed us to address adjacent market opportunities necessary to fundamentally deliver against all of their requirements. And you look back, in 2004, we were the dominant player in a midsize but slow-growing market called Windows apps delivery. And as we went through that journey that I was just describing a few minutes ago, that expanded into new areas like delivery networking, collaboration, communications, mobile, et cetera.</p><p>Last year, that was about a $16 billion opportunity. When we look forward and take a fairly conservative lens on some of those individual markets, it points to a roughly $25 billion opportunity by 2018. So we think we are operating in a lot of great, importance markets across the technology landscape. We think we have emerging or leading positions across many of those. And, really, from a differentiation standpoint, we are stitching together these technologies in a way that create broad solutions for customers, solutions that solve much broader problems, that are differentiated and defensible in the marketplace, and just focused on adding value.</p><p>Also during this time, you have seen the evolution of <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>as a company and just the distribution of where our revenue is coming from and the various pieces. And this chart just shows the stack bars of, in this case, our business units right now and how the business has evolved just over the last decade or so as we have continued on this journey.</p><p>That light-blue set of bars down at the bottom is workspace services, and for the majority of that history has represented Windows app delivery. That was XenApp and XenDesktop. Great business, growing about 10% CAGR all-in over the last 10 years, and providing a tremendous foundation of what we do.</p><p>Windows architecture is still the predominant infrastructure in most of our customers. And so even though they are adopting new things -- cloud-based, mobile, et cetera -- that long tail of Windows is incredibly important for our customers, and being able to deliver those apps in the most secure, managed, available way is necessary. And then, of course, you look at across mobility apps, consulting and delivery networking, building out the rest of our business over the last decade, allowing us to grow up to about a 14% CAGR over that period of time.</p><p>But the shape of the business has changed pretty dramatically as well. Back at the beginning, we were selling about 50% of total revenue in that year, coming off of new products and licenses, the new licenses that we had to sell each and every quarter, supported by some level of, at the time, software license update in that yellow bar.</p><p>The broadest shift over the last 10 years has been the move towards SaaS, the increasing importance of holistic maintenance offerings for our customers, and then just generally shrinking that new product license that needs to be sold each quarter. So up to today, we are roughly 70% of our total revenue coming from recurring sources, a number that I will talk about more in a minute, but has been gradually moving up and to the right.</p><p>So you will hear this a lot when you talk to our customers this week, if you are here in Orlando. But we hear this constantly. And it comes in a number of different ways, but basically what they are saying is, I need to mobilize my business. And you saw those videos this morning, some of our innovation award winners, of putting that into practice, because it's not simply enabling a device to access email, but it's about fundamentally mobility-transforming their entire infrastructure, the infrastructure so that it can be consumed as an IT service, consumed across device types, across location types, but changing the way that they work.</p><p>And that is coming in a number of different forms, but that is the fundamental message you are hearing. And when you talk to our customers this week, you will hear them repeat that over and over again.</p><p>But it is slightly different when you are talking to a CEO versus a CIO. There's a lot of pressures that they are both having to deal with, right? The pressures that, frankly, face all of our customers across every industry. We talked a lot about just the broadening heterogeneity of device types. It has gone from a single device to it doesn't matter; it's any-ness, the underlying complexity which is in their IT infrastructure.</p><p>For years, I used to describe, like, the data center as an archaeological dig. And what I meant by that was that customers were adopting new technologies, but in many cases, were really not unplugging what was already there. So if you go and you meet with one of our big, big customers, what you will hear from them is layer upon layer of successive technologies. They are still adding value to the organization, and they are still working.</p><p>And that is what they have to manage, that increasing complexity: mainframe, client/server, minicomputer, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, all adding value to the enterprise, all creating more complexity over time. Workforce diversification, whether that is generational or geographic; change, of course, around -- all around us; offshoring M&amp;A, et cetera, and security. And security just being the accountability that Mark talked about this morning, but it's pervasive now. And it's not just a check the box from a regulatory point of view. It's business-critical, and people need to think about it in those dimensions.</p><p>So of course, the CEO is purely focused on how do I grow my business faster; how do I improve productivity; how do I integrate M&amp;A and improve my competitive position? The CIO has got those concerns, but he is thinking about how implementation. How do I solve the problems with data security? How do I keep everything within my network? How do I manage user experience in such a way that the users are actually going to consume the technology that I give them versus just using a workaround? Which is an ever-increasing problem, pretty much across the board. And then, doing that in a way that is agnostic to device types, app, data, all in a single low-cost way.</p><p>So same type of context, same type of pressures, but coming at the problems from slightly different angles. And it is our job to really bridge those worlds to make that a reality across the board.</p><p>And so when you talk to them and you hear the conversations, they generally fall into a number of buckets that I call business initiatives, the things that they are worried about right now that they can put projects around, they could put defined budgets and accountability. But all these things, whether it is BYO, flex-working, security, continuity, they all have that common element that is mobilizing the business, to be able to separate people from their physical workspace and reconnect that on demand. And that is what we do. These are the types of business initiatives that our customers are focused on that we are enabling.</p><p>And just to put a fine point on that, this is some data that we looked at about a year ago, as well as some industry reports. And it calls out and just points out what is now fairly obvious, the fact that people are working from a number of different devices. The average person now uses three. Generally, that is a phone, tablet, the laptop. Doesn't matter what device they have; doesn't matter if it's five or 10 or 20. What matters is they need to be able to consume information on demand in the same managed, secure way.</p><p>In fact, if I look at <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>as an organization today, we now have not a single managed device outside of 50% of our computers. All the phones, all the tablets, those are all BYO. So we have more than twice as many unmanaged devices as we have managed devices in our infrastructure.</p><p>Multiple locations -- two-thirds of people are now working outside of the office. That is not just checking email, but that is actually engaging in your normal business outside of a single location.</p><p>App proliferation -- the average customer in our customer base has over 200 apps. What I talked about just a minute ago was that archaeological dig, and that is true. To give you one simple example, <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>is a relatively simple infrastructure. We obviously consume all of our own technologies. We live this message. Yet we still have over 150 apps in our infrastructure for 9,000 people. When you talk to our really big customers, that number goes up into the many, many, many thousands. And so the cost and complexity of managing that is really pronounced.</p><p>And then, the unmanaged data problem: The studies have shown that it is over 80% of large organizations have unmanaged cloud storage. I think we all know that number is probably closer to 100% when you look at the workarounds that people have used to just make their jobs easier. They haven't had the capabilities in the past to be able to consume business information in different ways, so they have a Dropbox account or some other type of service that allows them to work around the corporation.</p><p>And so data loss prevention, IP security, et cetera, is a huge problem. And being able to manage all those together is, again, an extension of what we do.</p><p>So as I have talked about a number of times, and we will spend more time over the next couple of hours drilling into, we have market-leading solutions across all of these key critical areas, whether that is virtualization, networking, mobility, et cetera, to really give customers the tools to fix these problems. And as we talk about them, we will show you how they compete and they operate individually within their market categories, and then, of course, how we differentiate across the board to create broader solutions.</p><p>And as Mark was saying this morning, there's really three fundamental issues that underlie our strategy: the idea of experiences, security, and flexibility. Experiences -- the technology has to be consumable. People have to use them. The experience needs to look more like a consumer product. It needs to give you the type of productivity that is not just another IT service that is being forced on employees, but is something that you want to use -- you want to use because it works. That is experiences.</p><p>Security, as we have talked about a number of times, and Geir will spend more time with, is embedded and contextual. There is no such thing as a single security model, but it needs to change based on the types of data that people are accessing, maybe the scenarios, the types of device location, et cetera. And it has to be able to be resilient across that framework.</p><p>And then, of course, any app, any cloud, any consumption delivery, and that is flexibility. That is the any/any/any/ampersand message that Mark was using earlier today. Experience, security, and flexibility. And you will hear us talk much more about that going forward.</p><p>So coming out of the beginning of this year, as you know, we were going through a restructuring, both from an organizational point of view, strategy, and operational. And so where we are today is organized across three primary business units. You see those here: delivery networks, workspace services, and mobility apps. And then the individual focus area of each one of those, whether it is the physical layer, the app-fluent physical layer around the delivery network; provisioning apps, desktops, and mobile; and then, of course, secure communications and other services, allowing people to be productive across the spectrum.</p><p>And all those sit on top of what is really a platform set of technologies, a few foundational products, converged infrastructure, automation, et cetera, that allow each one of the different business units to plug in where appropriate and create more value across the solution focus that we have talked about.</p><p>So the primary product lines, and these are the ones that we will talk more about in a minute, that sit within each of the business units: app ADCs and WAN optimization and delivery networking, Windows app and mobile app delivery in workspace services, and the communications cloud and workflow cloud across our mobility apps business.</p><p>The new workspace cloud, we talked a lot more about that this morning. So, again, if you hadn't had a chance to see the keynote, please watch that online. You will have a much better sense of exactly what we are trying to accomplish with the workspace cloud. That is actually being developed in really a hybrid fashion right now, in between the mobility apps and workspace services, because they both have critical elements that are being brought together to enable the delivery of these types of capabilities.</p><p>Last year, delivery networking represented just under $700 million of total revenue. That business grew 10% year on year. Workspace services, the largest part of the organization currently, a little over $1.6 billion, 4% growth year on year. And mobility apps at $652 million, up 12%. The infrastructure technologies plus our consulting services represent another -- just under $190 million and growing 24% year on year. So that is the way we are organized today. And you will see us talk more and more about these individual pieces over time.</p><p>So let me step back and talk about solutions. We get a lot of questions about what does it really mean to connect these pieces of technology. Give me some examples of what you're actually doing versus just selling customers bundles. How do the technologies really work together, and what value is that providing to customers? And so I am going to give you a couple of different perspectives.</p><p>The first is, you think about mobility, mobility in a broad context. This is defined more from a customer's point of view. You look across these individual columns, and these are the different types of individual technologies that people are consuming across a broad mobility strategy. That could be everything from mobile device management, mobile app security, secured data sharing, single sign-on, et cetera, et cetera. All of these things are capabilities necessary for a customer to really embrace mobility in a broad, enterprise-focused way. And in many cases, there is individual competitors that are selling point solutions and a few that have started to branch off into multiple columns here.</p><p>But, generally, it is a fairly fragmented space. It has historically been fairly fragmented. And so our approach has been really to think about this holistically. When we talk about mobility, you always hear us say enterprise mobility management. And that is the terminology to talk about it holistically across the board, to solve that stack of problems for customers that cut across and give them the capabilities that aren't just in the same PO, but integrated and interoperable in ways that they can create incremental value. They can really create better value for customers, and when the people are adopting across this spectrum, gives you the ability to drive a lot more up-and-to-the-right type value. It all accretes together.</p><p>That is one example when we are talking to customers about mobility and why you never hear us say MDM, or MAM, or little individuals. We talk about this holistically, because that is the language that the customers are using. And that is our obligation, to deliver these technologies together in that way.</p><p>Enterprise mobility has been a story that looks like this. This is dropping into individual products. In fact, this is pretty close to the <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>Workspace Suite. But when we had a conversation with Aer Lingus this morning, or with Sunderland in the video, or one of those other great customers, this is the type of conversation we are having: physical layer, mobile layer, app delivery, secured data fabric, communication infrastructure and collaboration tools to allow them to embrace this. And that is the type of engagement that our most strategic customers are going to be having with <person><nameText>Citrix.</nameText></person></p><p>Put a couple of stats on that. This is the trend showing mobile app delivery and data sharing together. We have only been in this business for a couple of years now. So, obviously, the CAGRs are high, up about 100% in the last couple years. 65% of our mobile mix, which Brian Dye will talk more about in the minute, includes data sharing. And so bringing together enterprise mobility, or MDM, and a common data fabric, all of a sudden gives IT a solution -- a solution to manage not only email, but all the data and attachments that go along with it, to bridge those to solve broader problems around access, around security, around management, et cetera.</p><p>So that is one view of the world. The other is looking at it from a combination of virtualization and networking together. This is something that we have been doing for longer. It is still growing at about 26% over the last four years. But these are the number of individual transactions each quarter that include both virtualization and networking technologies together as a solution. Today, that represents about 8% of the mix from a virtualization point of view. So you can think about it as attach, if you will. And from the other side, from a networking business, NetScaler -- this is about 20% to 25% of the NetScaler business each quarter, is selling as an attach alongside enterprise virtualization.</p><p>And the story that we have with customers, we talk about this internally as the customer journey or the <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>journey. And so we are fortunate enough to work with over 300,000 large enterprise customers around the world. And many of them start out on a fairly tactical basis. They are buying individual technologies to solve point product problems. That could be everything from remote access, maybe a standalone ADC or load balancer. They have got a Web app that needs to be delivered to a small group. Many different ways for us to enter and engage with the customer on a relatively tactical basis. But the strategy, of course, is how you help them connect the dots over time. Move up and to the right to create much more strategic solutions for customers, transformational in nature, if you will.</p><p>This is an actual example. This is one of our healthcare customers that started in remote access. They have been with us for a long time, moved into areas like Windows app delivery, MDM, BYO, flex-working, regulatory compliance, et cetera. But you look at the types of things on the right-hand side -- this is the projects that they were trying to deliver, deliver for their physicians, deliver for their patients, et cetera. And it has allowed them to really transform their business, very similar to the types of messages that you were hearing earlier today. This is the customer journey, and this is what we are trying to do within each of our large customers around the globe.</p><p>And that journey is represented pretty well in looking at our total big deals, as we call them, million-dollar-plus transactions. This chart shows you the cut between product group and by geo on the right. So on the left, by product group, purple is workspace services; light blue is delivery networking; and the yellow on top represents subscriptions and large service engagements. And so, clearly, that has been up and to the right over the last several years, slower in 2014 than over the last couple of years, for the obvious reasons around this pivot that we have all talked about, but still growing.</p><p>You see that a lot of growth is coming out of delivery networking as we have continued to take share across this business over the last several years, and more and more customers engaging in multi-year subscription or service contracts. That is the yellow part, moving up and to the right.</p><p>On a geo basis, it tracks pretty closely to just the overall representation of the geos into our geo mix, largest being the Americas, followed by EMEA. So I expect this trend to generally be up and to the right with our perpetual-based products and probably not so much with workspace cloud. Workspace cloud will be an opportunity for customers to do more of a land-and-expand over time.</p><p>And this driving of these large transactions on the balance sheet has led to a lot of growth in deferred revenue. This graph shows the long- and short-term deferred in the bars, and then the percent of long-term deferred on the line tracking to the right. So in 2014, total deferreds were up 10% year on year. Long-term has been growing substantially faster over the last several years. Last year, long-term deferreds were up 14% year on year.</p><p>The primary driver here is what I was just talking about a minute ago: the increasing number of large, multi-year engagements from our customers, whether that is on a term license basis or multiple years of SA or maintenance on top of a large perpetual sale.</p><p>We do expect this trend to continue. I think deferred revenue will grow in 2015. Gradually, you will see more and more of the mix shifting towards longer-term deferreds as well. In general, I would say those are probably two years. The balance of that is about a two-year contract.</p><p>So let's take a step a little bit lower and talk about the individual sources of revenue, just kind of click through the P&amp;L and some of the underlying drivers behind each one of those.</p><p>First, of course, is product and license. This is the area that has been most volatile over the last couple of years as we have been going through this broader pivot towards mobile and cloud-delivered services. And that has impacted the growth rate year on year, especially when you look at just workspace services licenses on the bottom of those stack bars. 2015 represents current consensus items -- consensus estimate, excuse me -- on this chart as well as all future charts in here are based on consensus.</p><p>However, within that, there is a number of various areas that are continuing to grow pretty rapidly. Mobile platforms is up 40% year on year 2014. This doesn't include any internal allocations from any of the solutions, suites, et cetera. This is just pure play, actually delivered numbers on an as-sold basis.</p><p>NetScaler product revenue was up 12% last year. And as we talked about on our last earnings call, there's a number of individual market segments within that that are growing at different rates. So, for example, in Q1, our business with the half-dozen really large cloud service providers was down year on year due to timing, but our business selling into core enterprises was up about 20%. So you're going to see this balance overall with NetScaler, but in broad terms, we have continued to drive market share gains over the last five years with that technology.</p><p>And then, in workspace services, the blue, I mean, the largest component here is Windows app delivery. Windows app delivery contains a few different things. Bill Burley will be up here shortly to talk more about that with some level of granularity. But I will point out that the CSP licenses are actually growing about 50%, 50% year on year. And, as a reminder, those are the licenses where we are selling on a monthly subscription to our CSP service providers as infrastructure. They are using that as infrastructure to deliver some sort of an as-a-service solution to their customers. Could be everything from very thin verticals, a regional solution, et cetera.</p><p>There's a couple of thousand service providers out there right now driving this type of growth. It is a market expansion play for us. I don't think this is cannibalistic to our existing perpetual licenses, but really allowing us to address a new set of customers, new set of customers that is everything from individuals, SMB, prosumer, et cetera.</p><p>We talked a lot about XenApp this morning. There has been a fair bit of innovation around XenApp focused on addressing a number of areas: some of the midmarket weakness that we have seen over the past couple of years, vertical opportunities, and a number of new technologies to really bring down the cost and complexity of everything from app delivery to VDI deployments. And, again, Bill will talk more about that later.</p><p>But underlying all of this, you are seeing a pretty big mix going on -- a mix shift around subscriptions and the evolution. So what I did was just kind of show you the mix here. We don't talk a lot about this, but this is the Windows app delivery license mix for the licenses that were actually delivered to customers across the last three years. The dark blue on the bottom represents our subscription licenses to the CSBs. That lighter blue-gray line is term-based licenses, and then on the very top, light blue representing perpetual licenses.</p><p>So you can see pretty clearly the shift of mix going on. It doesn't minimize the internal challenges that we are trying to drive with our perpetual license business, a lot of innovation and focus on driving that forward, but there is strength underlying a lot of the subscription and term base.</p><p>In fact, if you just look at the number of licenses or seats that we delivered in 2014, it grew low-double digits over 2013, despite revenue coming down at the same time. So I think this shift is going to continue over the next couple of years.</p><p>Next, around our license update and maintenance revenue, historically this has largely been Subscription Advantage and hardware maintenance. It is embedded in the first year of every new perpetual product license sale, in 2014 and consensus for 2015, obviously impacted by last year's softness in new license delivery around Windows app delivery.</p><p>We have been delivering some new programs, though: software license maintenance, which is a holistic offering including tech support as long as license updates, and something that we call Premier Support. And this is just our ability to get more close to customers, delivering the ongoing services that they require.</p><p>So coming out of Q1, we had about 15% of the installed base that has migrated to these new services, so obviously an opportunity for us to increase the ARR of the installed base. In fact, the average uplift from a typical SA-only customer to software maintenance is 25% to 35%. So it is a pretty big financial opportunity measured in a couple of hundred million dollars annually as we continue to migrate customers this way.</p><p>Probably also important to note is that new products coming out like the Workspace Suite, for example, only is available with the holistic software maintenance offering. So you will see this trend moving more and more at the same time.</p><p>Next is professional services. For us, this is knowledge transfer. This is technical consulting. And we have got a lot of direct support here. We provide architectural implementation guidance to our customers. It is increasingly important as the types of solutions they are engaging in are truly mission- and business-critical for their organizations.</p><p>The strategic engagement does tend to be tied to large transactions. So you have seen this number moving up and to the right as that concentration of big deals has done the same thing over the years. And so you see the steady growth in revenue.</p><p>We do price a lot of these in local currency. There has been some local currency impact we called out in Q1. We are seeing it and expect it through the balance of the year. That is one of the things that is going to be impacting 2015 and beyond.</p><p>And then, our SaaS business -- we used to talk about SaaS as a division or a business unit. But that has really changed a lot over the last 18 months or so. SaaS is a delivery vehicle, the way we're delivering software. And still the largest component is made up of our mobility apps business, but we are also delivering SaaS now in terms of our, like, XenMobile products, Workspace Cloud, et cetera, will have a large SaaS component. So that is the primary reason why we bifurcated the organizational name from the delivery type and the revenue type, if you will.</p><p>The focus of a lot of these critical services is SMB, SMB individual and prosumer, where we are providing a full stack of technologies to allow them to run their business.</p><p>We also talk a lot about SIB. And what we mean by that is small in big, and that is selling to smaller organizations, maybe department, regional, divisional, of our large enterprise customers, and then also as platform capabilities, where we bring together a lot of these to really create those solutions we have talked a lot about.</p><p>The focus in 2015 is continuing to improve our retention rates, which, as Chris will point out, have been up and to the right, but do that while we're reaccelerating for customer acquisition spending. And then, obviously going forward, given the nature of these services, they are all going to be critical elements of the <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>Workspace Cloud, and giving customers that ability to, in many cases, a-la-carte these services based on the types of problems that they are trying to drive.</p><p>And then, as I mentioned earlier, the concentration of recurring revenue has really been up and to the right over the years. And this just shows the last decade or so, the various recurring revenue sources on the stack bars to measure the revenue and then the percent of recurring in the ongoing line.</p><p>As I said a minute ago, we have moved from about 50% to 70% of recurring revenue coming out of -- forecasted for 2015. Last year, we increased about 10% year on year over the prior period. And within that, license update and maintenance was 9% growth, software-as-a-service delivery was 12% growth, and then the CSP subscriptions were just over 50% growth. So it is another one where we expect the gradual mix to increase over time. And I think the Workspace Cloud will be one of those things that won't impact 2015.</p><p>While we announced that we are going to be delivering these technologies in the back half of the year, you should really think about this more as a gradual move into 2016 and into 2017 and beyond. So no material impact this year, but another one of these foundational elements to allow us to drive that mix towards recurring revenue even higher over time.</p><p>Let me shift gears and talk a bit about operations, kind of the infrastructure of the business right now. And, obviously, a lot of focus in our conversations together has been around operating margin and how we are thinking about operating margin for 2015 and into a multi-year base.</p><p>And this is our op margin and revenue over the last number of years. And we have been balancing this growth profit cycle many times in the past, just depending on how we are reacting to required technologies that our customers need to deliver their IT services. But where we are right now is coming through a broad restructuring, which I will talk about in a minute. We are obviously optimizing the portfolio to drive more clarity and focus against the must-win markets and product pieces. We are delayering the organization in many cases, which means just making it a bit flatter, removing layers of management so that we can improve our communications, obviously our effectiveness, and our spend. And we are bringing down the physical infrastructure around facilities. We talked about 15% of our real estate portfolio I would like to see either consolidated or reduced in size.</p><p>We are reallocating a lot of these resources towards the things that are going to drive business into the future. We are reallocating towards strategic areas like mobile platforms, data sharing, and Workspace Cloud. We are reallocating towards go-to-market coverage in places where we are capacity constrained. There are markets and products where we just don't have enough capacity to actually address customer requirements to engage in a lot of the opportunities that are out there. And, of course, just generally, in product innovation, focused on reducing complexity, driving channel leverage, and extending differentiation.</p><p>And so when we talked into this year, we set a goal. We said, 2015, we are going to expand our adjusted operating margin by more than 100 basis points. That is the current estimate right there on 2015. Did say midterm target over the next couple years to 25%, and then stated our long-term operating range, that we plan to operate on a consistent basis in the mid- to high 20s. And so I think we are at the beginning right now of a multi-year cycle of margin expansion.</p><p>One of the things that has been a headwind to that over a number of years, just more broadly, has been gross margin. We had tremendous success driving SaaS and networking products. You have seen that in that stack bar chart. You saw the growth and innovation we have driven there. However, on the right you see that those carry slightly lower gross margins than a typical software business.</p><p>This is showing by our major business units gross margin and then by year over the last three years. So while all of them are pretty consistent, you do see a separation between mobility apps and delivery networking. Still incredibly profitable. Our mobility apps division runs at about 80% gross margin; delivery networking in the low 70s, albeit improving each year; and then, of course, software and license updates running in that 90% to 100% range.</p><p>And that gross margin has come down from about 90% to roughly 84%, where we are right now. That has been the majority of the headwind against our adjusted operating margin over the last several years.</p><p>We did see that start to move up a little bit in Q1. We have talked a lot about the fact that this should be plateauing right now, right around this 83%, 84% range. So we would expect that to stop being a headwind in this year and into next year as well.</p><p>Looking at the individual pieces of OpEx, as you see on the right, that is actually OpEx as a percent of revenue, just trying to isolate this gross margin mix shift over time. And up until the last quarter or two, you have seen this nice down and to the right as we have been focused on building efficiencies, growing into some of our newer businesses, driving productivity enhancements, and really building for scale.</p><p>Obviously, the last couple of quarters, where we have been in the middle of this pivot -- this pivot towards workspace services, pivot towards mobile, we saw that tick up a bit. And that is what drove a lot of the restructuring activities.</p><p>So just as a reminder, most of you know, we enter this year with a broad restructuring plan -- a plan to simplify and clarify the strategy, to begin to refine the product portfolio, to look at our individual business units more discretely, and then do a number of things operationally on a cost basis.</p><p>So here is a quick status for everyone. High-level position eliminations -- we announced 700 positions were being eliminated at the beginning of the year. We are done in the Americas. We completed that last quarter. And we will be substantially complete internationally in this period as well.</p><p>Real estate consolidation that I mentioned just a minute ago, we are looking at bringing in about 15% of our total capacity in Q1. We had 11 offices that were impacted. Six of them were closed; five of them had space reduced. This quarter, I expect to have five more follow that similar pattern. And then there's a couple of more programs in the back half of the year that are much bigger and more complex that will take some time. And those will likely be done in the second half of the year, but may trail into 2016.</p><p>The overall idea here, of course, is not just to reduce costs, but to improve engagement, to improve utilization and density across our sites, which has the incremental benefit of improving engagement of the employee workforce and improving our productivity.</p><p>The America and EMEA sales alignment that we talked about this year, whether that was on a territory basis, moving more towards market segments, or in the way we engage our partners through specializations, that work is complete at this point in time.</p><p>Product portfolio has been under a streamlining process for a couple of quarters now, and I expect that to continue through the balance of the year. And we have been aggressively evolving the leadership organization, thinking about what we need for scale over the next several years. And so we have made major appointments across sales, sales ops, marketing strategy, and product development. And a number of those guys you will spend time with today or you will meet them throughout the show, if you are here in person.</p><p>So a lot of change going on on this restructuring front. It has obviously created a bit of disruption in Q1, and we are factoring that in for Q2 and beyond. So we are working our way through it. I would say we are more committed than we have ever been, that we are making the right decisions. We are taking the hard decisions first and setting the Company up to emerge in a much more efficient, scalable manner than it was before.</p><p>As an IT-based business, people are usually a pretty good proxy. People represent two-thirds-plus of our cost base. And we have invested a lot over the years as the business has continued to expand, as the market areas have continued to expand, geo coverage, et cetera. And so you see the annual growth in headcount going back to 2010 each year and as that has increased. Moving from Q4 to Q1, sequentially, headcount came down by about 330 employees, all-in.</p><p>The reallocation that I talked about a minute ago, in terms of overall expense, tracks pretty closely to the headcount. We are obviously moving headcount towards capacity areas and go-to-market, whether that is mobile, networking, or service provider. We are continuing to invest in the high-growth product areas like data sharing. We have been investing in our tech services capacity. This big shift towards a more holistic maintenance offering requires more capacity on that front. So we are building up our centers in India and China and elsewhere. And, of course, in product innovation, in those areas that are really, really necessary to enhance this platform, integration, differentiation, and customer experience. Net-net, I expect that coming out of 2015, headcount will be down over 2014.</p><p>The recurring revenue, however, that I have talked about a couple of times allows us to drive really strong cash flow. Despite this restructuring activity, despite a lot of the external churn going on in our businesses, we continue to generate a lot of cash flow. And that is just basically driven by the high renewal rates in our existing recurring revenue businesses.</p><p>Cash flow per share, which is that line, coming out of trailing 12 months out of Q1 was about $5.15 a share. And that is obviously benefited by the ongoing capital structure programs we are driving as well.</p><p>We have talked publicly about targeting about 50% of free cash flow for share repurchase. That is our programmatic share repurchase that we do each and every period. I think that is the target for this year.</p><p>When you look at our cash balance, there is obviously a shift going on between locational cash; the light blue represents offshore and the purple is onshore cash. So obviously, the mix is changing over time, just based on where a lot of our cash flow is utilized as well as generated. Continue to think about cash usage as primarily for share repurchase and tactical acquisitions.</p><p>And then, just on informationally, we are talking about $400 million as minimum domestic cash balance. And so you see how those things move around and create minimal constraints over time.</p><p>Fortunately, we continue to generate a lot of cash flow. And those two primary uses of cash are demonstrated across our capital allocation history. On the left, M&amp;A and strategic investments; on the right, share repurchase. And so obviously over the last couple of years, as we have been bringing down M&amp;A, it has moved down at the same time that share repurchase has gone up and to the right.</p><p>And so share repo represents the dollars in the bars and then the number of shares. Over the 2010 to 2013 timeframe, we were retiring 5 million, 6 million, 7 million shares per quarter. Now, obviously, that spiked in 2014 to north of 25 million shares. And as a reminder, that was largely due to the accelerated share repurchase program that we announced midyear.</p><p>Historically, though, we have averaged about 58% of free cash flow for share repurchase. If you include the ASR, that goes up to just over 100% all in. We funded the ASR with a $1.4 billion convert, which is due 2019, carries a 0.5% coupon, and with a bond hedge that we did simultaneously with that, an effective call premium which was 100% over what the issuing price was, or roughly $120 per share. And, as I mentioned earlier, we will continue to target about 50% of free cash flow for share repurchase on a programmatic basis.</p><p>So as I wrap up, I mean, we are obviously very focused on value creation right now. And we are going to do that in a combination of both tactical and strategic ways. We will do it tactically to maintain our cost profile right now, to begin this multi-year expansion of operating margins, and to do it in a way that is reallocating resource towards those areas that will provide future growth across the business.</p><p>So just to summarize, a little bit about 2015. Obviously, revenue right now has been impacted a bit by the broad changes in the industry, but more specifically, by restructuring and FX coming out of Q1.</p><p>Our COGS, as I mentioned, is stabilizing in the mid-80s. This is after a multi-year decline due to the strength that we have seen in SaaS and delivery networking capabilities. We have been operationally reallocating a lot of expenses towards those areas that are going to fund future growth, but all-in, we will be growing OpEx significantly slower than revenue growth.</p><p>Operating margin, as I said, beginning a multi-year expansion -- more than 100 basis points this year. 25% is the next stopping point, and then mid- to high 20s long term is what we believe to be the operating range.</p><p>And then we will be thoughtful about capital return. We plan right now to target 50% or more free cash flow on programmatic share repurchase and then expect really just M&amp;A on a tactical basis, types of things we have been doing to focus on build/buy, time-to-market acceleration as well.</p><p>So that is a quick overview of the organization, hopefully sets appropriate context for the next few hours. I am going to call up Geir Ramleth here. And, as I mentioned earlier, Geir is our Chief Strategy Officer, Senior Vice President, and General Manager of Workspace Services.</p><p>Geir is a new member of the team. Geir has been on board now for just a few months, but he brings a tremendous wealth of experience and perspective to the business. Geir has not only been the CEO of a number of organizations, most recently IT company that we acquired called Octoblu, and as a <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>customer for well over 10 years as the CIO of Bechtel Corporation and a number of others. So he has got a great customer perspective, a great industry knowledge, and he knows <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>really well.</p><p>So with that, to focus on security, as I mentioned earlier, let me turn it over to Geir Ramleth.</p><p>GEIR RAMLETH, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER AND SVP AND GENERAL MANAGER OF WORKSPACE SERVICES, CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.: Great. Thank you so much, David. Good afternoon. I want to give you a little bit of insight into how I see things, and how I entered into <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>and I took over the Workspace Services job. And I will come down to a specific focus on it, which is security. But I will do a little bit of assembly first, how I got there. And then we can go through a little bit of where of that all goes. It's a very, very shifting environment.</p><p>So, for me, as a CIO earlier -- I was a CIO for Bechtel for about 12 years. And I interacted with a lot of CIOs throughout the IT environment, both in the US and overseas. And we get thrown a lot of problems the whole time, lots of challenges. And I put some of them up here as just like an indicator of that soup of stuff that comes to a CIO. And I'm trying to look at this as how we organize it. Like consumerization has been extremely disruptive to the conventional way you dealt with IT.</p><p>And then the whole BYO -- bring your own whatever-that-is device. We've got people bringing their own emails here. They are bringing their own identity; bringing their own whatever that is, all in this environment. APTs, advanced persistent threats. It's something that is really, really scary out there. And then, at the same time, keeping up productivity, privacy. And then we have the cloud. What we do in private cloud, what we do in public cloud, and the hybrid of the two, and the like.</p><p>And then the big data. What is big data -- is it very deep? Is it very wide? Where does it fit in all of this? And I personally think that the biggest payback you have is in wide data, not in deep data. I think that wide data can tell you where you might to think and where you might want to go. They can give you predictive things. Deep data only gives you better accuracy on actually what has happened rather than actually what you might want to look for.</p><p>Compliance -- many of you come from financial institutions, and you know that's a big issue out there. The IoT will be very, very disruptive to the conventional way we deal with it. Social networking -- social networking has really created a very, very difficult demarcation between where the private life is and where people actually have their professional life. Shoring -- if that is off-shoring or on-shoring, how that began changes the way we deal with everything. And then, of course, the wireless.</p><p>So if you look at these order and groupings, it really comes down to what you might have heard Mark talk about earlier today, about experience, security, and flexibility. And I want to spend some minutes here focusing on that center one, the security. And I assume that most of you have seen and heard and maybe even felt the way that this is changing. It's changing dramatically. It's no longer just an IT issue. It really is a business issue. It is something that is being brought up at all executive levels. It's brought to Board levels, and people are thinking very, very seriously about it.</p><p>Because the security of our data is no longer just an IT issue. It really is a business issue. And that is out there, if you're dealing with hackers that just basically want to be out and prove how smart they are, and they can outsmart you. If it's hactivists that are out there that have some kind of a [vengine] that want to have an agenda that they want to get out to you, or get out to the world, like the WikiLeaks and the Anonymous.</p><p>And then you have the cyber criminals, the ones that just want to get out and find money. We have seen that in a lot of the retail business. And then you have the APTs, the advanced persistent threat, out there looking for intellectual property. It's cheaper to steal it than go and invent it yourself. And when you then deal in worlds where you don't have actually symmetric legal systems, it makes it very, very challenging. And it actually then makes it extra scary when you have something like this.</p><p>And in this world, I was the latter; I was the one that thought we were fine, until you get the call and say, have you checked? And you go in check it, and you figure out that you actually are compromised. And when you go through that you really start learning that the world is very, very different.</p><p>On a joking way, I said, after I went through that I lost all respect for Hollywood; they have no imagination, because what we saw through this was quite, quite scary, of how people actually operate and to what extent they go after you, and how they actually create your security to be almost like a chronic issue.</p><p>So what this really means is that you had to embed the security into the way you do your business. You have to think about this on a very different way than you did before.</p><p>So let me go a little bit of how we got there as an industry. Initially we had that very simple environment: we put people in offices; they were on their own little local area network; and they did their business. They connected normally then to data centers. The data centers were normally also in your facilities. Most likely, in the beginning, on the LAN. They were not WAN connectivity; they just talked to their private data centers.</p><p>Then came the cloud. We started then seeing how we started using the cloud. And we started using the Internet. And all this to figure out how you actually can then come to other forms of resources, and how you can use actually deep networks for interacting within the enterprise.</p><p>And then, lastly, you get to the whole BYOD. People saying, why should I carry around two phones? Why should I have two smartphones? Why can't I use my own laptop? And so that creates a whole new issue. So you have this diagonal challenge that is that I have the stuff that I thought I can control on one diagonal. And then you have the other stuff on the left, where you actually have to leave a lot of that to others. And that creates a lot of complexity. It creates a complexity around the way that the business changes, the way that the whole security landscape changes. And what you really come down to here is that you have to change your business model around security.</p><p>So, what you had to do is you had to change your governance. You had to change what it is. It is no longer an IT issue. It is an issue that you have to deal with every user. Which actually, in the end of the day, what comes out is that you have to change the people's behavior. You have to change the way people treat your data and their data for themselves.</p><p>The second is that you have to change the architecture. And the architecture here, I'm talking not only about technical architecture. You have to change your business architecture. And going through that, and get a good focus on actually the data and not the systems, is very important. You will have to apply new forms of technology.</p><p>And lastly, you have to change your operations and your organization. So what it is is that to address these new security threats we're seeing that the businesses have to change dramatically. Because this is kind of where they came. We had all these devices come sneaking in on us. And there comes everything from the center here that is more of the traditional, to the less-so-traditional devices as you go out on the other side.</p><p>And then you come to the cloud below -- if that is in ours, is it in yours? Is it in their cloud? What it is is you might not always know. And many times you might actually go to some cloud provider that again uses somebody else's cloud.</p><p>So you have to figure that out. And when you then start connecting this -- the traditional, from the laptop being on the company network, it goes to the clouds. Okay, fine; you might be able to control those lines.</p><p>But then this one, when you start going from home, I don't know; they might use the local telephone company. They might use the cable provider, or they might sit at Starbucks doing their stuff. Same as you come then with the tablets, the smartphones, and also then how devices are starting to come in. If these are things, sensors, whatever they might be, they again start coming into your network and you have to deal with it.</p><p>Wearables: we hear about -- a lot in the last few weeks about the Apple Watch. And you heard Mark earlier today talking about how the Apple Watch will be a part of how actually people interact in the company. Is that yet another way for people to get into it? So, traditional way, our security models were pretty medieval. They were a castle or town with tall walls and a moat. And then we thought everything inside was secure, and then we had a drawbridge, and then we could go in and out on that.</p><p>It isn't very different than your traditional IT security. You secured your perimeter, and then you had the drawbridge called a firewall. And that was the one that, oh, I can go in and out of that, and everything inside is secure. We started doubting that over the last -- some years ago -- and we doubted it. And what did we do? We just built taller walls. We just kept on building the walls and we just laid on up, up, up, and we didn't change the paradigm.</p><p>And it's the paradigm change that we have done now. And that is that we are now -- we are living in a metropolitan city. We're not living in the medieval mechanism any longer. I don't know, but I bet many of you come from New York, or have either companies that are based there, or offices. But you know the New York Police Department deals with the security very, very differently than they did before. They are actually in the community, figuring out what is going on, and they are looking at people's behavior and they're looking at how the community as a whole operates. And that's what we have to do with the security on an overall basis going forward.</p><p>So, if you think about that, you take that down, and now what you have to do is you have to secure that network within it. You have to secure the network in a different way than you did before. Because the security before was kind of like, everything is good inside and everything is bad outside. And as long as I just deal with the gate, I am fine. But I actually have to think about it in a different way; I have to deal with what goes on, on that network. I have to start looking at the traffic even on the inside.</p><p>Because I can tell you, when we had our incident, they were inside. And by the way, they were inside and they looked like us. They looked exactly like us because they had taken our identities. So they come in and they operate totally disguised inside your company at that time. And that is scary. In fact, we had to shift our security people to work nighttimes because they came in, plus minus, three minutes at 6 o'clock in the afternoon. And then you have to figure out how do you now deal with that going forward.</p><p>The next is you have to then deal with virtualization, like what we do, so that you can keep data more in places where you can secure it. Keep the data closer to the sources rather than have the data roaming around.</p><p>And lastly, you can then containerize it. So if you need to take it out, you can at least put it into a container in such a way that it doesn't then just roam around in the free. So what you really come to here is that you have to come to a model where the data is secure when it is in use, when it is in transit, and when it is addressed.</p><p>So you have to think about that whole flow. So this is where we then fit in, compared to the more traditional security perimeter companies. You need them both. Because you will not find one company today that will do you 100% security safe.</p><p>So we then are working with the three things I said: data in use, data in transit, and data at rest. So what you then need is you need to build a model that is built this way. And the thing is, if you go back to what the FBI director said, that you have to kinds of companies -- the people that know they have been hacked, and the ones that don't know they have been hacked.</p><p>And if you think through that, that really means that now your models shouldn't be just built -- or your business models should not only be built on how to keep people out. It is: what do you do when they come in? So what I am trying to depict in this picture is that you have to think about the whole new model. That is one that is, I want to deter them from coming in. But if they come in, I want to detect them. And then as soon as I detect them, I can respond to it. And I can then afterwards remediate it.</p><p>So you want to do the [DDRR] on this thing in such a way that actually being compromised is a part of doing business. And if that is a part of doing business, you want to take them and increase the threshold as high as possible with tools and architecture. And that's where we are. And that's how we have these sets of products that are coming in and helping us in those areas.</p><p>So in the virtualization, we have everything from the desktop and the app and the server virtualization through our Xen products, by the NetScaler, CloudBridge, and so on, on the network. And then we have the whole set of mobile and mobility apps as it comes to containerization and the stuff we do around that.</p><p>So what you really want is, you want to protect what matters. That is data in use, data in transit, and data at rest. So, you build, then, up the mechanism to minimize the attack surface. Because if you have it spread out and you are so diluted compared to what asset is in normal architecture, you can really, really have a lot of exposure. And you want to deal with the access mechanisms. You want to be sure that you have it based in such a way that you have your single sign-on, or you have the two-factor authentication, or whatever it is, to be sure that when you deal with people they are actually the people they say they are.</p><p>In our instance, the guy that actually had the highest level of security in our company had been compromised. So you can imagine: the guy with the most credentials actually was not who we thought he was. But he looked like it because he roamed around the same way. So you really need to deal with this, and we do that in many different ways.</p><p>You have to then control the app workflow, ensure that people are on the versions of software that you want; that you can control it in such a way that you know what they are dealing with, that you have people contained in such a way that you can enhance your security.</p><p>Encrypt whenever you can. Breaking the keys around encryption is very, very hard. But we have so many things in our enterprises that are unencrypted. So we have to get to that and sharpen the visibility. We changed our model. So we actually did continuous gathering of all log files within the company. We collected them all the time, which meant -- and I don't know if you guys know what a log file is, but it's a very simple file. It's not very sophisticated. There's a lot of empty spaces in it. It's just more character files, just plain text character files. We analyzed 3 terabytes of log files a day. And that's what we needed to do, because that's how we managed to see strange, abnormal behavior in this environment.</p><p>So this was kind of like how we see the security, what we are working on to address it. I think we as a company -- coming from the outside, coming in -- I think we are extremely well positioned. I think it is something that <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>has almost like a hidden gem. I don't think that we have, in the past, been good at tooting our own horn around security. I think we should, because it is something that really hits home with me. I have lived it. And I know that if I had thought about this a little differently before I went through this, I would definitely have changed my approach dramatically.</p><p>I will end with a very scary piece of this. It might not scare you, but it scared the heck out of me. We got a phone call saying we were compromised. It was bad. I didn't have a lot of good sleep for a few days. We looked into it and tried to figure out when where they first compromising us, and it was more than six months prior.</p><p>During that six months when we had been compromised, we had two external audits of -- security audits that we passed. Now, you can say, hey, wait a moment, did we have bad consultants? No, because I don't think -- we didn't have bad consultants, but they didn't look under the right rugs. They didn't look at it the right way. Because I think many of the -- much of what is going on out there is still under the wrong models. They are not basing it on how actually the new threat vectors are coming into us.</p><p>So, with that, I am handing it over to Bill Burley, that is our GM for our Workspace Services. And he will take you from here.</p><p>BILL BURLEY, VP AND GENERAL MANAGER, WINDOWS APP DELIVERY, CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.: All right. Thanks, Geir.</p><p>GEIR RAMLETH: Some of them look like they saw a scary movie.</p><p>BILL BURLEY: Yes, well. By the way, just so we're clear, all of that security breach stuff -- that had nothing to do with <person><nameText>Citrix. </nameText></person>That was his previous company where he set up the security -- I mean (laughter).</p><p>All right. So, hi, everyone. Bill Burley, GM of the Windows App Delivery Group. Here we go. A quick bio on me. I've been affiliated with <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>since 1993. In the 1990s we set up the sales organization, recruited a marketing guy named Mark Templeton, got him on board, and went public in the mid-1990s.</p><p>But I've had a variety of roles. I've been General Manager of XenApp before. I did the cloud app delivery team, which was taking it to our service providers. I did some M&amp;A integration, and now I'm back. As scary as that might be for you, or if you (inaudible).</p><p>So this is -- this framework is really important. Mark pushed this today at the event, and keep an eye on it. It should be consistent. All of our businesses are going to look around, how we help the customers realize our products as an experience and an experience frame of mind, security, and flexibility. It says Window App Delivery; it really should be secure app delivery, as an example, but we'll talk about specifics. And the cloud-first mentality point is not just words; we actually made organizational changes on this side.</p><p>I took over the team in late February; sat with the VP of Engineering for the cloud services. That's the team that is delivering the plug-in to the control plane so you can consume XenApp and then desktop-as-a-service out of our CWC cloud. And he said we need to think cloud first. And what he meant by that is, why don't we iterate our products in the cloud on a platform that's proven -- like CWC is going to be -- and not have to worry about all the close-down we have to do when you look at the enterprise. So being able to iterate technology fast allows you to validate it.</p><p>And so it was a great idea. It was such a good idea, four days later I gave him development, all of development, server side development. And that's the way we're looking at things. So you're going to start to see things come out that are going to come out a little quicker, a little more timely, but they are going to be as a service first. And that's important so we can validate things -- validate our ideas, get consumption of them.</p><p>When we did the Cloud App Delivery Group, the things we did that made that piece important was we had a reference architecture that every CSP had to follow, or they couldn't be in the group, and they wouldn't get support and they wouldn't get updates. That way, we can move faster. It's very hard to close down for all these enterprises and have to worry about all the iterations. But this way, we can validate our ideas, so this is the way we're thinking.</p><p>So around experience -- Mark talked about this, but a couple pieces. One is Framehawk. I'm not quite sure everyone got what Framehawk was, but essentially it's a UDP protocol. And the only reason that's interesting is with TCP it has to handshake. So if I make a request, something on the other side has to say, I hear you, and here's what you want.</p><p>With UDP -- and the reason it's important is if you're in a Wi-Fi or [erot] network -- like this guy is on his phone over here doing his email, or someone is like doing things and bouncing off the walls -- you can get really bad performance.</p><p>And if you can't get a handshake, you won't get a connection. The UDP will just keep sending what it wants to send, and your performance will improve dramatically in these poor networks. So that's what Framehawk was about. And so our first iteration, we're going to continue to evolve that and make that more autonomic as we move forward. But pretty excited about that; it was an acquisition we did about 18 months ago.</p><p>And then as a tech preview -- and this is about straight performance -- new graphics engine. We're going to get 20% more server scalability and 30% more bandwidth usage. So that's available today. But we're going to deliver it in Q3 -- or second half. But it's available today as a tech preview. So big jumps in improvement on HDX.</p><p>We're doubling back down on experience. We moved some people around to make sure that we're going to invest in what essentially is the crown jewels of the company, and that's our differentiation, which is experience.</p><p>So, a second piece is the mouse. It might seem a trivial thing, but it does really make an iPad usable in a corporate setting. So I've got the iPad, and we were trying to use it when we first did the original receiver I guess around 2010, 2011. And it was just -- without a keyboard and a mouse, it just, to me, wasn't business-ready. So I just went to the Air and I was using a MacBook Air. But now with the keyboard and the mouse, you can go back; and folks that really want to use this device now, it can be used in business, and it will be.</p><p>And we've got tons of backup on selling mice in different use cases like in healthcare for the doctors who want to use their iPad, but when they get out of a patient situation and sit back down at their desk, they want that flexibility to move back to a mouse and keyboard environment. So we're looking at them by use case. Not everyone is going to want this. But when you do want to have an iPad, this is the way to use it in the business.</p><p>So, around security, we made a couple announcements. One, we're bringing back SmartAuditor and setting up with Desktop Director so it can be managed out of the current infrastructure. It's not going to act like a separate recording technology. But now we can record the streams, so does that mean? Well, depending upon where you live in the world -- for instance, we put this feature inside of it product called XenApp Gold, which was sold to the Chinese market. They like to record everything. So a little bit of an NSA thing going on there. And they record everything, and it is just general. It's just a cultural thing.</p><p>But other people need it for simple -- really, a very simple use case is user error. How many times do you have a problem, something breaks, you call IT, and they say, what did you do? And I say, I did nothing. Well, this actually records what you did and tells IT exactly what you did, in what sequence. And so it became -- it started out as a straight security solution and it evolved into a really like an excellent support tool. And so the customers are pretty excited.</p><p>We rebooted this team. We've added a bunch of people out in Nanjing working on this. We're really excited about integrating it into the platform. We've got great response from the partner community and our platinum customers. This is an added feature on top of what we sell [part platinum].</p><p>And then the second piece is table stakes for public sector. So, we've always had Common Criteria and FIPS with straight XenApp. Well, when we brought the architectures together and delivered it all from one place we had to recertify. So this is like a recertification of FIPS and Common Criteria. So, table stakes, really important to have it. And the only really unified platform -- the only unified platform for delivering apps and desktops in the world that has these -- the Common Criteria and FIPS.</p><p>So on the flexibility side, Receiver. So, we talk about Receiver, but the key of this story is StoreFront. So, if you've been following us for a long time, you get feedback from customers that complain, gosh, upgrading versions with <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>is painful. It's a bit of a rip-and-replace; it's forklift; whatever you want to call it. Whatever you want to call it, but it's painful. But with StoreFront 3 now, we're going to be able to snap in older versions sitting side-by-side with newer versions as people start to make -- we can help them migrate a lot easier.</p><p>So StoreFront's not only this great, I think, elegant-looking way of capturing the app signee -- whether they're in groups of apps, based upon my role, or single apps -- and being able to configure the look and feel, so it's my company. I'm delivering a service. So what this matters to our partners and our customers -- they don't want <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>front and center; they want who they are front and center. And this is an elegant way of not only delivering the apps and having them available, and delivering them into groups that makes sense depending upon what you do in the company, but it's also an excellent way for them to migrate. They can put multiple versions behind one StoreFront and then start an autonomic way of migrating version-to-version.</p><p>Because we're combining -- we also have a migration tool, Project Serenity, and it's now automated. So you use Project Serenity, you snap into StoreFront, you start to migrate people to the latest version. It's not a rip-and-replace. No one goes down. So that's really what the story is. It's not just about a new Receiver that has support for mobile devices. It's bigger than that. This is our migration story.</p><p>So, Linux. I don't see us as a -- the group will never be called Linux app delivery. This is a use case. We're looking at a lot of our customers who have Linux desktops. Either they've got some offshore development work or certain engineering types that have it. And we looked at how we are going to do this. Were we going to do it in VDI, or were we going to do server hosted? And so, the first iteration of us delivering Linux is on the server side. So, hosted-shared Linux desktop delivery, kind of like what we did with WinFrame in 1995.</p><p>So you can embed your apps; you can deliver the apps, as long as it's to Red Hat or SUSE-supported desktop, or server-side desktop. That's what we're delivering here. So this will help us with these extended use cases, and it's our first foot in delivering Linux capabilities. We can do VDI behind that if we'd like.</p><p>We got actually couple of big customers drove this to get this done, one of them being Ericsson. So, pretty excited. And the great thing about this platform, this will allow us or enable us to deliver browser-based -- non-Windows-browser-based apps if we choose to.</p><p>So if there are customers who are trying to deliver applications that are built on browsers other than IE, now you have the opportunity to do this. Not that I would promote it in front of our partners at Microsoft, but it does eliminate the Microsoft tax if they want to deliver those types of applications.</p><p>So that's what available there. That's kind of the value, to a certain extent. This is an enabling platform for us. It's not just the desktop it's going to deliver. All these browser-based apps that have been built, you can deliver those as well.</p><p>So we've announced in tech previews that our customers and partners -- we did a partner event yesterday and walked through it. They're pretty excited. The first one is this DesktopPlayer for Windows. This is a type 2 hypervisor -- forget all that technical stuff. Essentially, I'm going to deliver a managed Windows image. We already do it down to Mac, but now we're going to deliver it to Windows.</p><p>And this is a great way -- is if it's BYO, I'm bringing in a device, and the company wants to have -- okay, this is the image you're going to get, and they don't want their device they are bringing in to be crushed. And this is just -- okay, I have this image; it's corporate managed; and I can move between my corporate information and my personal information.</p><p>And the reason it's tech preview and not delivered is we we're waiting on the encryption on the disk side, which is an important part of our security and secure app delivery message is -- we don't want to deliver anything that doesn't have encryption built into it, native, like we do already for the Mac. We'll have that for the Windows. We'll deliver the second half of the year, but we have a tech preview here.</p><p>So there are a lot of use cases on secure side. And they want to secure image being delivered, and they want to be able to manage it centrally and even portable. So now I have the image; I don't have to be online; I use it as I would use my local desktop; but it is managed centrally.</p><p>This is a big one for our Microsoft relationship. Windows 10 is going to be pretty hot. The word is, they kind of blew it with Windows 8, kind of jamming you in the eye the whole tablet look and feel. And now you've got flexibility. The start menu is back. People are pretty excited.</p><p>And would have been able to deliver this actually in Q2, but their last couple deliverables were so different that we had to go back to scratch on a few things to make sure we haven't. So it's tech preview ready. We'll deliver it beginning of the second half. We'll probably talk about this at their event in July. They do their big partner event. And it's a big part of our relationship with them. So, keep an eye on Windows 10. I think it's going to have a lot of traction.</p><p>And then finally we're looking at AppDisk. So, the idea here is, managing desktop image is painful and costly. And the iterations you could have, depending upon the users and what they do, just could be immense, the amount of images you can manage. So, what if you had one, clean desktop image and then you would insert of the apps or groups of apps that matter to those users, depending upon what their roles were. That's all this stuff is. So you've got AppDisk. We call it AppDisk. You've heard app volumes, all these different phrases. It's about managing a clean desktop image, reducing the cost of all of those images; predictable performance.</p><p>The difference with our solution and other solutions are we're combining it with AppDNA. And what AppDNA is, that allows me to take the app, pour it into a logic engine, and they'll say, okay, this works well in a XenApp environment. And you can host it and deliver it that way. Or this is a great App-V deliverable. You should package it and stream it.</p><p>So, our solution combines the logic and spits out for the customer and the partner how it should be packaged, and then those images are set up in that way. But we're tech previewing this now. This again will be delivered in the second half. Pretty excited about being able to lower people's cost in managing desktop images, and by doing it with a solution that will catch common issues that are going to happen when you just look at dropping the app into an app volumes type of situation. That's going to be wrought with issues. But our AppDNA combo solution is going to shorten the time to deliver those images and reduce the costs faster.</p><p>So this is a big one. We talked about it earlier. So, with all of these things on customers' minds -- supporting a line of business, everything down all of my cloud initiatives is a lot. And if we were just doing -- if we thought customers woke up all day, and all they thought about was us, that might be interesting, but it's not. So we have to reduce the pain. And they were thinking about, well, what are you doing with 6.5? That's a platform.</p><p>I'm proud to say that was my last deliverable when I was the XenApp GM, was 6.5, back in 2010. And it turned out to be one of our better, more secure platforms. And it just -- all of our CSPs still run it, and there's a lot of people not moving off it. But there was this worry about end-of-life. And then there's the -- how do I migrate to the latest platform, which is the combined platform I can deliver apps and desktops from one platform?</p><p>So, with all of this, we decided to come to this show and combine a reasonable partnership with our customers. So we're going to extend the lifecycle of 6.5 through 2017 -- not until, but through 2017, allowing our customers to take a little more time to migrate, get a little more comfortable with the 7 platform. And with our StoreFront 3 and our ability to snap these in and allow people to take their time to migrate, we think this is really a good combo.</p><p>But we also added a feature pack to 6.5, so we are still committed to the platform. And I won't cover all the details. Mark covered them in the event. But feature pack -- we're going to extend the lifecycle. And then the integration is side-by-side with StoreFront 3.0. So this is the story -- really resonated with the partner community and the customers.</p><p>So I'm actually running back across to a customer presentation in about 10 minutes. And I floated this at lunch with them first to see what the thought were. People are pretty excited that I can migrate at their pace.</p><p>So, this is our Lifecycle Manager. And blueprints are -- and somebody talked about this up on stage, and they're exactly right. It's more like a recipe. So you develop a blueprint, it's -- what's a predictable way to install something? So, it's like, it follows the recipe to install. So that reduces error and speeds up the time to migrate. But we just threw it all in the cloud. And now people can just service -- download and upgrade their environments at their pace.</p><p>So really a big tech preview. And really it's -- we've been doing this a long time, but it wasn't autonomic. The tech preview is about making it autonomic. And migration is a big deal for us. And we're going to spend a lot of time with our customers and get them to the 7 platform.</p><p>And while -- before it became autonomic, we already moved through 36,000 apps. I know Mark talked about 400 customers. But I think more impressive is we've already migrated 36,000 apps on this platform. Now we've just made it a non-autonomic solution.</p><p>So, this next section is about how we look at the market and how we're organizing. So, this slide is a bit of a pat-on-the-back slide: hey, look how well we've done in these markets. But that's not the way I'm looking at it. We decided to reorg. And so our product managers had -- over the years had become feature jockeys. And what we wanted to do is have everyone look at the product holistically.</p><p>So we've done a couple things. One, we're putting all 500-plus people in the group through our CCA training. So they're going to know how to -- or not, they -- a lot of them know how, but it's a refresher on how to install, how to administer.</p><p>We want to get closer to what the customer experience is. And my attitude is this -- is the more we can put these smart people through these installs and administration classes, the quicker they'll say, well, what if I could enhance something? I can make it a little better. So, we're combining that customer empathy with going after these targeted sectors, these vertical markets. But we're doing it by use case.</p><p>So the idea is, if I can take all the product managers and each give them a different vertical market and say, what are the key use cases to each vertical market? We can go after -- there's tens of millions of seats available in just our named accounts. If we can start to look at the opportunity by use case and vertical consumption, we can get, I think, smarter on how we partner with the customers as we grow their environments.</p><p>So, we have [reorg-ed] our PM, and behind that will be our engineers. We'll start to look at things. How do we deliver things in a more vertical focus? So, this spreadsheet just gives you an idea. We take experience, security, and flexibility. And I'm a PM in a dev team, and I look at, just say, healthcare. And these are just three of the use cases, and they are kind of vague. They could be more specific -- but like a physician's use case, or administrator within the hospital or nurses.</p><p>What are the differentiators that <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>has in those areas? And are we exploiting them? Do people who know about them are exploiting them? And then what can we do to continue to improve them? So, for instance, FastConnect. That's our warming sessions. That's making sure a session is warm anytime somebody needs to connect, you get an instant-on. There's a lot of capabilities we already have that are here. But longer-term, there's a lot more we can do that doesn't take reengineering the whole product -- whether it's a set of scripts, or its connectors to [ISV's] products, connection points, design guides. This is how we're going to get sharper in the vertical markets.</p><p>So were getting smarter. We're exploiting the information that's already -- that our salespeople have already brought back, that our customers are willing to talk to us about. And we're going to go deeper by tying tighter to how they deliver their solutions.</p><p>So that's all I had. Did I get everyone back on time?</p><p>Brian Dye, our Head of Mobility. Can I say it any slower? Just slow down a little bit more. All right. Thanks, folks.</p><p>BRIAN DYE, GROUP VP &amp; GM, MOBILE PLATFORM GROUP, CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.: Thanks, Bill and good afternoon, everybody. How are you doing? I saw a few smiles -- that was encouraging. I'll try that again. I'm just checking to see whether the sugar, from lunch has really set in or whether we are all still here. So far, so good? Okay. Appreciate the tolerance there for the just-in-time arrival -- as you know, we are juggling the coverage across multiple parts of the synergy event here.</p><p>What I wanted to spend the next roughly 20 minutes giving you a quick update on is everything we are doing in the world of mobility -- I can't really say that -- I'll call it enterprise mobile security because, as you know, all of <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>is really around mobility. But if we look at enterprise mobility management in particular, the first thing that I talk to customers about is kind of the three-stage journey that I really see customers on.</p><p>I have not yet met a customer who is done with mobile. I see a lot of folks that have started, they've made progress -- I have not yet met the customer who is done and that is because they are moving through what we see are three phases.</p><p>The first is basic security. They need to get device level controls, PINs, passcodes -- maybe some data-sharing technology. They've got to get up off the ground and running because if you show up at an organization right now as an employee, and your employer doesn't have a way for you to get basic use of your mobile device, you will get a strange look from your employee, usually followed by the question of, does that mean I need to use a cuneiform and stone tablets to take my notes as well?</p><p>It's a base HR issue. It's an employee recruiting and employee sat and employee retention issue that most organizations are focused on in this first stage.</p><p>The second stage is really when you start recognizing that the moment you want access to the real data within your organization, often not just email but actually going in through VPN access into web applications, you are now opening up a rather large security access point into your existing corporate network. And at that point, data containerization and really driving secure productivity becomes the focus -- that's the second stage.</p><p>A big shift in the market has been from the center of mass 18 months ago being in stage I, to the center of mass nowadays being in stage II. And I say that not just in generic terms but really in a SKU mix term.</p><p>So, 18 to 24 months ago we were selling 80% of our sales in mobility were in stage I. It was MDM type stuff. What we are seeing now is 80% and trending up of [then] mobile enterprise sales and that's really focused on Phase II with an entitlement even into Phase III, so it's a really big, really substantial customer shift is in progress right now. The leading edge shift is actually into stage III and this is certainly early. Right? It's a small percentage of customers that are doing this now but it's directionally where we see the market going.</p><p>Stage III is about transforming your business. Those are abused words, so let's double-click on that. It really means taking advantage of the fact that you now have a secure computing platform in your pocket and you can automate things you could never automate before and automation, lest we forget, is the core for software.</p><p>For example if you can get through Phase I and Phase II -- we worked with one company -- an oil and gas producer in the Midwest. They got through stage I and stage II and they said, great, everyone now has secure email. Only one catch -- we don't get paid to give people secure email. We get paid to get oil and gas out of the ground. So how do we take advantage of this secure compute platform to go do that?</p><p>And what they did was they took small pairs of development teams and put them literally on ridealongs -- I mean literally ridealongs because there were 4 x 4 pickup trucks involved -- with two key personas. They had the lease operators and the site production foreman. They went out and literally wrote apps for those folks because they found particular situations where either they had to leave site and go back in to get a computer, leave site -- go back in to get onto a wireless network -- find all the times when that person couldn't be productive and then write apps to go automate their job.</p><p>That's really what Phase III is about. From a technology standpoint, it's a very logical flow. From the business impact standpoint of our customers, it's very nonlinear, because stage I and stage II are things you have to do. Stage three are things that actually have a business case behind them. They've got ROI, they've got incremental value to the organization. So there's a big shift that we see in our customers. They get through stage I and stage II and then they realize they have an opportunity to do stage III.</p><p>Now, we are seeing a lot of success in the market overall. Business growth has been very, very positive as you've heard us cover. We're seeing that really a function of the technology. Mobile is a relatively young market in the big scheme of things. We are still seeing very, very big technology progress as you look kind of 12 months ago versus now -- I'm anticipating very good technology progress over the next 12 months as well, and it's not just us because every vendor will say they've got great technology footprint. But if we look at the analyst community we are getting very broad recognition from a host of the industry analysts that cover the space.</p><p>So if your favorite isn't up here please let me know -- I didn't think we were missing anyone but I'm obviously looking forward to the feedback. So, we are seeing a lot of good progress in the market.</p><p>And one of the questions that I would have if I was in your shoes is where and how are we taking share? So, I really want to address those very specifically of where our growth drivers are coming from because it's three places. I want to demystify this.</p><p>First, average selling price. We are getting a higher dollar value per seat than our competitors are because we have a much more enterprise edition focus mix. We are selling relatively little standalone MDM. We are selling the vast majority of what we call XenMobile Enterprise Edition, which is addressing those stage II and stage III in the customer journey opportunities.</p><p>We think that's good for our business because it represents a higher value. It also represents a more sticky customer and obviously we are capturing the value for that upfront.</p><p>Second, we are driving a lot of activation. We are very excited about the leverage we are getting out of the core <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>machinery and especially the existing <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>core sales rep. We still have a structure that is a core sales rep supported by specialists. That core rep has done a great job of selling app and desktop virtualization.</p><p>We've earned a technology reputation in those accounts. We've earned trust in those accounts. We're leveraging that relationship and that sales footprint to [go] sales in mobile. We use <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>workspace suite as you've heard us discuss as the SKU vehicle -- the licensing and entitlement vehicle to drive that cross sell -- that's the second thing that is working.</p><p>The third -- and I didn't intend for these to be three A's -- it just kind of worked out that way -- is the assets themselves. So we are getting a higher share of wallet, because we are not just selling device management or application management.</p><p>When we go in and sell, we are selling device management, application management, enterprise sink and share, and secure networks. We are literally taking a higher share of wallet of the Company's mobility budget off the table because we own more of the assets and we can monetize more of the assets.</p><p>So, these things are really the three cores that are driving our above market share growth and driving the fact that we are capturing share in the market right now. Hopefully, that puts a light, if you will, on our growth trajectory.</p><p>Now, I do want to touch lightly on some of the things that Mark went through on his keynote. Because we really covered a tremendous amount over the breadth of the Company, I want to take a mobile specific -- really enterprise mobile-specific lens to those announcements. Because really what I hope you heard in this morning's keynote was four things.</p><p>The first was unifying the experience. As we bring together the existing Worx Home -- Worx Home is the piece of technology on an actual tablet or mobile device that a user will click on to see their apps and actually get their apps. We've already done integration -- it's already in the market today -- to let folks get to their virtualized apps, virtualized desktops, things like that.</p><p>What we are going towards as Mark discussed is bringing together Worx Home and Receiver into one logical client. So really unifying the experience for an end-user.</p><p>From a customer's perspective what that means is as they roll out new apps, as they make changes in the organization, they've got one place for their employees to go to get to their corporate delivered apps. Apps -- Windows apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, SaaS apps -- doesn't matter. You've got one place to go, and that's Receiver, right? That's the direction we're headed.</p><p>The mobile integration of this is second half -- I want to be really clear on where the deliveries are here. But that's -- as Mark talked about, that's the direction we are going.</p><p>I want to skip to the fourth one actually because I find it's a great complement. Unifying the experience on Receiver is all around unifying the experience for the end user. <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>Workspace Cloud that Mark talked about and Jesse demoed on stage is really unifying the experience for the administrator.</p><p>So we're trying to provide that level of integration on both ends of the spectrum, just like the user gets it on Receiver, the admin gets it on Workspace Cloud. So XenMobile will be delivered as you saw in the keynote as a component of Workspace Cloud when that's launched. As we discussed that's in tech preview now -- that's available in the second half of the year. XenMobile cloud as standalone obviously has been available for a while, so that component isn't new -- it's the integration into Workspace Cloud that is new.</p><p>So those are really the bookends. You've got the unification of the end user experience, the unification of the admin experience, and it really reinforces those three A's I was just talking about. In particular, our ability to cross sell and leverage the existing <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>installed base with an unfairly differentiated pitch, unfairly differentiated value -- that's what we are trying to create.</p><p>The middle two are unique to enterprise mobility because we are not standing alone there. The first are new apps -- new secured apps that are optimized for business. We've got a very big focus not on thinking about what consumers want but optimizing workflows for business. For anyone that's actually used it in our Worx mail application, one example of this is in the calendar there's one touch joins and things like that.</p><p>We also have a button called Running Late. When you touch that button it automatically emails the people in the meeting to let them know that you are running late. I would argue that besides opening the app, that is the most frequently used button in our suite of products. In case your organizations run differently than mine and every customer that I have met with, right? That's one example.</p><p>So we are building on those business-optimized applications with three more. One of them is a <person><nameText>Citrix</nameText></person>-secured Salesforce application -- <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>for Salesforce -- and what we've done is we've taken the core <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>Salesforce1 application -- and this is exactly in line with Salesforce's strategy by the way -- we created that application and then wrapped it with our security technology so you can use the <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>Salesforce app and get all the benefits and the usability and the Salesforce data access and everything else but still have the data be containerized and protected on the device and still have the workflow conductivity to the other secured applications on that device.</p><p>So it's really enabling that second phase of mobility where you want the data containerization but you still want the user experience to be able to work across the workflows.</p><p>The second two are really focused on a set of power users. Because we've definitely seen within organizations that you've got different tiers of end users. You've got folks that have never had mobile access -- they are going to be delighted no matter what you give them. You've got your normal users that are used to kind of the native mail clients and they will compare you to native.</p><p>But you've definitely got a set of power users that don't compare you to native, they compare you to their full desktop experience. They want to be able to do everything they can do on a desktop on the mobile device. And these next two apps are focused on them, because we feel like they are going to be a big competitive frontier moving forward.</p><p>The two specific apps -- first is Worx Tasks -- very straightforward app. Integrates to the outlook tasks on the backend so you can get a single view and access to your tasks, no matter whether you are on a desktop or on a mobile device.</p><p>The second one is the SlideStream app, so it's an ability to drive presentations directly on top of ShareFile -- and a cool piece of kind of sizzle that we put in there is the ability to actually fast-forward or advance the slides -- not meaning quicker -- but actually doing it from your iWatch.</p><p>So if you want to wow -- impress your friends and intimidate your enemies at your next meeting here is your opportunity to show how your iWatch is effective at work.</p><p>The last piece I want to touch on is the set of partnership announcements we made that are really about driving enterprise-grade mobility, both on security and on solving the app bottleneck problem. From a security standpoint, providing better security in particular for S/MIME and authorization is really critical, so we've announced two partnerships there. And on the app mobilization side that third phase of mobility -- the partnerships we announced are completely aimed at that, in particular, the AnyPresence and the Kony partnerships.</p><p>What we've seen on the app proliferation has been very interesting. I would compare the world of enterprise applications right now to the early days of Amazon. Folks are trying to lose money and make it up in volume. This is, of course, a problem.</p><p>This is why most enterprises have 10 or less enterprise applications and the consumer -- iTunes and Google Play store have 1 million a piece. There's obviously a problem happening there. And our belief is the problem is not writing the apps, the problem is connecting the apps to the backend data of the company -- that's where the math problem happens because most organizations have multiple app dev teams. They don't necessarily communicate as much as maybe the organization wishes they would.</p><p>So you wind up writing these expensive integrations from your pretty simple app into the backend data of the company and, then, different parts of that organization will rewrite that integration. So you are paying for it and then you are paying for it again and again and again.</p><p>What folks like AnyPresence and Kony do is they provide basically a data integration layer so you write once and then you reuse that data integration by writing to the platform. We really see that as a substantially change in the cost structure of how you develop enterprise applications and it's one of several steps we are trying to make to really unlike unlock that app bottleneck and help customers take the journey from steps one and two that are things they have to do in to steps three, which is things they want to do -- more business relevant, more sticky, more value for them.</p><p>So, two other things I want to touch on. First, we've been driving a tremendous amount of growth. How do we keep driving that growth? There's really three things.</p><p>First, we are going to continue the cross-selling motion. There are hundreds of thousands of <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>customers. We've got a long way to go -- a long and happy way to go before we have met all of their needs on enterprise mobility, so we have a lot of opportunity there. You see this in the integrations that we've already done. You see this in the integrations, for example, Receiver and Workspace Cloud that we've been announcing today. So we are enabling that already from a sales standpoint and from a technology standpoint.</p><p>The second thing that we've really focused on -- and this is a net new one for this year is activating the channel. We very consciously did not make a big push on the channel in any material geos in 2014 and it was because we were waiting on XenMobile 10 and the much more simplified architecture to enable that push on the channel. So really what we have coming together now are two very, very intentionally coincident things.</p><p>First, we shipped XenMobile 10 back in February. Customer and field feedback and partner feedback on it has been very, very positive. I'm really happy about that. And as you saw from Mark this morning this is not an incremental release. This is a dramatic step forward. 50% less hardware, either physical or virtual, required to do a deployment. 75% less time to do an install.</p><p>These are big, big steps forward. This is a much, much more channel-friendly product than we've had in the past. So we very intentionally wanted to tie or push on the channel to our delivery of a simplified technology stack.</p><p>The second thing that's been very coincidental here -- intentionally coincidental -- is the rollout of the <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>specialization program where we are rewarding -- sorry, rewarding our channel partners for their expertise, not just their volume. We've got a lot of existing <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>channel partners that are very interested in mobility. You've also got a number of relatively small specialized partners that are entirely building their business around mobile and we want to really support those mobile specialist channel players with this specialization program because we are rewarding their expertise, not just their volume.</p><p>So these two things are really working hand-in-hand. We are seeing very good adoption out of the gate on both of them.</p><p>The third piece is technology leadership, so you'd heard me talk about that customer journey, right? From basic security to secure productivity and all the way to really business mobilization. So we are going to continue to push the announcements you are seeing here and new technology we are going to be delivering through the rest of the year to push ourselves up the technology stack, in particular with a focus on unlocking that application bottleneck and providing more and more services and capabilities that will let customers adopt and break that app bottleneck.</p><p>We think the difference between 10 apps and 1 million apps is material. We think there's a lot of value for customers to unlock, and we expect to be able to capture our fair share of that reward as we provide that value.</p><p>The last thing I want to close on is really just to demonstrate how the work that we've been doing is really completely in line with and is continuing to amplify the three core strengths we are trying to bring to the market for our customers which also, of course, wind up being competitive differentiators.</p><p>Security, experience, flexibility. You heard about this from Mark this morning. If I put these specifically into an enterprise mobility frame -- let me show you where the [teeth] shows up. First on experience -- there's all sorts of individual features and things like that that make experience a great advantage for us. I talked about the Running Late button being one of them.</p><p>But I find that when you go into the senior decision-maker to customers they don't tend to resonate with a feature. A feature can be copied -- a new feature will be there six or 12 months from now versus the one you are talking about now. It's a very short-lived differentiator.</p><p>What customers are recognizing that we bring to the table are two much more sustained differentiators. The first is that we own our apps. Most players in this market -- OEM or resale, a chunk of their app portfolio. When you do that you can't control the user experience and the integrations anywhere near the level you can when you actually own the applications and our customers are seeing that in what they are delivering now and they recognize it as a sustainable advantage moving forward. That's one big one.</p><p>The second is <person><nameText>Citrix's </nameText></person>big focus on customer experience as a capability within the Company. In my personal experience, looking across other organizations in enterprise software, I believe we carry a 5 to 10 X level of customer experience as a staff function. So it's an investment we've made as a company, and it really shows up in the apps that we actually deliver and customers are rewarding us with their investment.</p><p>Second, on security, also a very structural differentiator. There's a pretty broad recognition that there are four layers of security that matter in this market. As you start from the bottom up, it's the device, the network to access the device, the data, and the application the data is accessing.</p><p>We are the only player that doesn't just have a footprint in all four of those but we have industry-leading footprint in all four of those. Everybody else that's in the market either have to have a partnership play or has a relatively weak leg of at least one of those four layers of the stack. Our customers recognize that that's also not a flash in the pan -- that's a sustainable differentiator.</p><p>The third piece is on flexibility. Bluntly put, for our customers, saving money never goes out of style -- I don't expect that this will change anytime in the near future, right? Better security, lower cost -- that's the right equation. We put a lot of focus on this. We'll continue to put a lot of focus on this.</p><p>One of the key capabilities we bring to the table -- and this is a dirty little secret in the market -- is that our on premise and cloud offering are both fully featured equivalents. A lot of folks don't like to talk about it but a number of the other competitors can't say that, right? Because they've got one of those two that's a stepchild of the other. They are actually not full-featured. So we are the only player in the market that really brings that full-featured capability to both our on premise and our cloud option, so regardless of whether a customer starts at one and moves to the other over time they are not sacrificing capabilities, they are not going to be changing their end-user experience as they do that. And the flexibility and the ability to balance TCO over time, we are finding the customers really see it as a future proofing in the investments they are making today.</p><p>So as Bill was saying when he closed -- I certainly want to keep us on schedule and make sure that we meet your days and share the time with Klaus as well. I really appreciate you joining and spending the time with us and thanks for my little slice -- hopefully it was informative.</p><p>I'll hand it over to Mr. Klaus Oestermann to talk about networking and all the great things we are doing there as well.</p><p>KLAUS OESTERMANN, SVP &amp; GM, DELIVERY NETWORKS BUSINESS UNIT, CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.: Thank you, Brian. So the next 15 or 20 minutes, I'll take you through the recent announcements that's coming out -- segmentation and a bit on the business go-to-market strategy and so forth.</p><p>So two key announcements that we are focusing on. CloudBridge Virtual WAN -- so we've come out with a new product in this market and I'll take you through the details of why this is a very interesting opportunity. It's in beta right now and we'll start shipping it this quarter. And then the announcements of NetScaler Unified Gateway, which will come out with the NetScaler 11 release that's out late in June. Those are the two big announcements.</p><p>So looking at segmentation, focusing in on the ADC markets. So, as you can see these are data from Gartner Group. Half of the potential is in the US Geo and you have the remainder in international with Western Europe being the second-largest opportunity and that's also where we kind of look at where do we deploy resources to go after the opportunity. That's also how we prioritize. From a market share standpoint, F5 being the market leader with more than half, we are number 2 with 20% and it gets to be smaller numbers from there on.</p><p>The way -- if you take that $2+ billion of TAM or product TAM that Gartner Group is talking about and you break that down into subsegments. The first one -- the biggest one is the enterprise segment and that's about $850 million, $900 million. That's a market where we've seen [5] be very entrenched in that market. We've become more successful in that market leveraging especially our portfolio but also really coming in to what we call the workspace delivery controller market, which is we estimate that market to be about $250 million so that's basically where we put NetScaler in front of the workspace infrastructure -- whether that's XenApp, XenDesktop, XenMobile. It could also be solutions from VMware or Microsoft in a similar space.</p><p>So those are our two adjacent markets and we've used the workspace delivery controller market as a land and expand strategy for quite some years. So we've basically gotten into a lot of accounts -- the first set of NetScalers -- NetScalers have gone in front of XenApp and Desktop infrastructure and then we've expanded from there on into the broader enterprise market.</p><p>SMB is a market we estimate to be about $100 million. We haven't had a dedicated effort for this market but we are clearly seeing with our virtual NetScaler VPX that we are picking up some good revenue there. We see channels that are leveraging NetScaler VPX as the load-balancing to a lot of customers in this market.</p><p>Where NetScaler all started was in the dotcom market and many of these dotcoms became clouds. So that is a unique market. We estimate that to be around $450 million. That's a market where we are the leader. We've always been the leader, we continue to be the leader.</p><p>And then the last market is telco, where if you look at telco spend on ADC and two can see the reported numbers from F5 and others -- it's 20%, 25% plus of their revenue coming from this segment. That's the latest segment that we've gotten into. We estimate that to be around $0.5 billion and we've used the ByteMobile acquisition to get into a lot of telcos. So ByteMobile has bought us into a lot of telcos now, so is part of the ByteMobile solution -- NetScaler has gotten in that way and we are now starting to do the same land and expand strategy we've done in enterprise in the telco markets. So we are starting to see some very good wins in telco. I'll talk more specifically at the end about the telco strategy.</p><p>If you look at the WAN market, we've traditionally been in the WAN [up] market and you are seeing that we've had the same workspace delivery controller focus, sitting in front of XenApp and XenDesktop deployments. And that market is, by Gartner, estimated to be around $1 billion and it's a market that has kind of stalled.</p><p>So you are seeing for the last two to three years very little to no growth in that market and that's the reason you are also seeing Riverbed being taken private, being the leader in this market. So, we believe there is a massive opportunity that is not WAN up but it is WAN virtualization.</p><p>So the spend on WAN is about $80 billion. So customers are mainly using that money to pay for MPLS connectivity. So when we are looking at how big is the WAN virtualization market, right now we estimate it to quickly become $1 billion. We actually believe it can become a lot bigger faster than that and I'll tell you why in a second.</p><p>So, some of the big new opportunities that we are going after is gateway consolidation. We are seeing a lot of companies having three, four, five, six different gateways to give users access to their infrastructure.</p><p>We see our Cisco partnership as a massive opportunity for expansion. Cisco has -- depending on which country, are in 70%, 80% market share so really aligning closely with Cisco has turned out to be a good thing for us and continues to be a good thing. And we believe the expansion into telco with specialty in the NetScaler product line is going to be a very good step for us.</p><p>So when you look at kind of what are we doing in those different spaces? You look at the cloud market -- we want to continue to lead there with dedicated teams. We want to sign new logos in that space and we are going to continue to leverage our TriScale architecture for that market.</p><p>So, you've seen in this market that, especially this year in the first half, we had some tough comps. And what we are working on in this market is really expanding the number of cloud service providers we have as well as the number of telcos that we can have so we have more bigger customers that we can sell to.</p><p>In the enterprise space, you see a focus on continuing to innovate leverage and take share, so continue to focus on where should we add more resource. SDX and TriScale -- the Cisco partnership. And then launching the Unified Gateway as well as CloudBridge Virtual WAN. And then, for the telco market, a new platform I'll talk a little bit more about and then expand the team into telco.</p><p>So from a go to market strategy, starting with enterprise, the key focus is expand the ADC share we have in this market. We've gone to about 20% so the focus moving forward is expanding from there on.</p><p>In doing that, you see NetScalerSDX being the key angle of attack here. We have a very unique product line where we basically do the same as you've seen in the server virtualization industry. So, we are taking a lot of load balancers and taking a lot of Cisco load balancers that Cisco has retired. We are taking a lot of F5s and basically a lot of these are running at 20%, 30%, 40% capacity and we are consolidating that on to fewer NetScaler SDXs. Part of a software defined networking story, part of a network consolidation story. And part of what we are also doing is not just putting ADCs on here but we are taking security infrastructure and starting to integrate that on to the platform.</p><p>So you look at key players like Palo Alto Networks, Websense, CA with their site minder -- these are security footprints that have been running on separate appliances and are now starting to get on the SDX platform. So, if you take an example with our friends from F5 here, it's not unusual we go out and take 20 F5s taken up, are using 10 kilowatts and replacing that with two of our high-end NetScalers taken off only 2 kilowatts and at the same time instead if you look at data center space instead of 40 U's it only takes up 4 U's, so a tenth of the space.</p><p>And more importantly when customers look at how much does this cost me and how can I reduce my overall spend, we typically see that the cost to doing that is 20%. So basically, what we are seeing from a lot of customers is, instead of paying their maintenance bill to F5, they can take all those individual boxes and consolidate that on to an SDX footprint. We've been pretty successful doing this in financial services and we are seeing that across the board now with a lot of customers adopting SDX as the NetScaler fabric they are using.</p><p>We deliver NetScaler appliances called MPX, Virtual VPX, and then SDX. And basically what you are seeing is about a third of our bookings now is coming from Virtual and Fabric. So we've seen a lot of units of VPX, and we are seeing a lot of bookings on the SDX platform.</p><p>From a channel strategy standpoint, you saw Mark announce this morning our tight partnership with IBM. So IBM has selected <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>with both NetScaler and CloudBridge as one of three strategic networking partners. So we are working with IBM across the board on how do we get NetScaler embedded into all of their projects. How do we go out with the new virtual WAN solution and help their customers there as well?</p><p>We continue to enhance the Cisco partnership and continue to add value there, both in Cisco embedding that into their InterCloud Cisco OEM'ing it. But also, being tightly integrated into every single switching fabric that Cisco has.</p><p>And then finally moving into -- from now on we are going to be very focused on in every single key market we operate to sign on more dedicated networking partners.</p><p>The Cisco partnership -- let's double-click on that. So we've done interim integration in every single fabric they have. We have also worked with them on what we call the NetScaler 1000B that's available through Cisco. And this 1000B product is now being leveraged in the InterCloud concept as well.</p><p>When Cisco goes out to customers and talks about software defined networking they typically do that by pushing the Nexus 9000 product line with ACI. And NetScaler is tightly integrated here. Every single function on NetScaler is supported on this, and you look at the competitive products out there -- only a few functions are supported, even against ACI. So a clear advantage we have in this market.</p><p>When we talk about software-defined networking and the value add that we bring, virtual networking, we've taken everything we have -- NetScaler CloudBridge very early on, virtualized it. We've integrated it with Cisco ACI, VMware, and others. There's a whole movement now around dev ops and automation.</p><p>So many customers are starting to look at as they try and implement software-defined networking it's different from the way they used old traditional architectures -- it was more of a south/northbound integration. Now it's more of them east/west bound integration where they are going to think very differently on how everything operates. So we've come out with NetScaler Command Center that integrates tightly into OpenStack, so if you have customers that want to implement OpenStack, NetScaler is a key component of making all this work.</p><p>Telemetry and logging. So, customers really want to know what's going on on their networks. We've released Insight Center a couple of years back and it really gives deep insight into what's going on in the network per user per application. We have a special module called HDX Insight, which kind of gives us X-ray vision into what goes on in XenApp and XenDesktop per app, per user and so forth. We've seen a lot of uptake on that feature by customers.</p><p>We look at the second market, workspace delivery controllers. There we have focused on how do we accelerate the <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>upsell. So when we sell a workspace solution, how do we ensure that networking is part of that? I'll talk about the launch of Virtual WAN as well as Unified Gateway.</p><p>So if you look at the Unified Gateway what that's really addressing is a mess that a lot of customers hide. So they basically over time have built different access infrastructures for their different environments and what we are now saying is, that's pretty complicated for your users. Why don't we help you clean that up?</p><p>So, we have a lot of projects now where we are basically taking whatever they have -- whether it's from SonicWALL, F5, the former Juniper Pulse product and consolidating all that into one Unified Gateway. So again oftentimes we see a 5 to 1 consolidation here, saving a lot of time and energy on administrating this, tightening new security rules and so forth.</p><p>Customizing this, we are enabling them to create one UL for their login. So basically they take all the backend infrastructure and make that available through one URL moving forward.</p><p>We also -- on this we are also adding the capability around smart control, so we have a new feature coming out in the June release where we can basically create one chokepoint for how you administer and run policies.</p><p>So, let's talk about WAN virtualization for a bit. So many customers -- many of your companies as well when you look at the connectivity through branches it's done through MPLS. MPLS is very expensive -- when I talked about the $80 billion WAN market before it lot of that $80 billion goes to paying for MPLS lines. What has happened over time is that users in the branches started watching YouTube, Microsoft Link's been introduced so before when 5 megabits was plenty to a branch it's no longer.</p><p>So many companies are looking at, they have to upgrade to 20 megabits to a branch to get enough bandwidth so people can actually do what they want to do -- it's very expensive. So their WAN cost is going to skyrocket. It's going to grow threefold or something like that and they simply can't afford that.</p><p>So what they are doing now is looking at cheap Internet broadband, which is about 5% or less of the cost of MPLS and then integrating that into the virtual WAN. And that's exactly why we've launched what we call CloudBridge Virtual WAN, so it's one of our new workspace delivery controllers. We integrate MPLS and Internet -- we bond those connections. So, basically, you have one virtual network where you can then prioritize and say, I want to send VoIP and XenApp over MPLS; everything else goes over Internet broadband.</p><p>It gives you very granular opportunity to pick and choose what you do. Also, it gives you a disaster recovery. So if one of these links go down -- let's say somebody digs up your MPLS cable -- all the traffic just gets swapped to the Internet broadband and you have continued computing in your branches.</p><p>We are also seeing customers in EMEA -- we are seeing certain customers in EMEA, we are seeing certain customers in the US and Latin America that are actually going all away from MPLS and doing two or three Internet broadband connections and bonding those, making it a lot cheaper and really cutting down a lot of costs in this space. We are seeing customers -- some Australian banks, for instance, that are using 4G LTE. They have been using that as passive backup up until now. But as you move into this new paradigm they are paying for it anyhow, so they are going to activate it and use it as capacity. We have customers who use satellite for oil platforms and other things where they can now integrate that into this new virtual WAN solution.</p><p>So, it's a very powerful solution. We expect quite a lot of interest and uptake around this and we are very excited about it.</p><p>Let's talk about the cloud service providers and the telco service providers. So, in both of these markets, we focused on how do we add more logos, how do we expand our share in these markets? Part of that growth is we've launched a new platform called a NetScaler 25,000 and I am not going to tire you with feats and speeds here. But in both of these markets, being very aggressive on price performance, continues to be king and this new platform will be a very, very good platform for us in both of these markets.</p><p>So I talked about telco -- how we've leveraged ByteMobile to get into a lot of accounts. We are now starting to look at adjacent projects where they are basically picking the NetScaler platform instead of other ADCs and mobile operators is the most spend in telco from an ADC standpoint.</p><p>So that's wrapping up what I wanted to convey today around the four key markets that we serve. So thank you for your time. And with that, I'll transfer it over to Carlos Sartorius, who is our SVP of Sales and Services.</p><p>CARLOS SARTORIUS, SVP, WORLDWIDE SALES &amp; SERVICES, CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.: Thank you. Good afternoon. A great opportunity to be here with you. As David mentioned before, I recently took over this role for worldwide sales in January, coming from 3 1/2 years leading the EMEA team.</p><p>What I want to talk to you this afternoon is a bit from a sales organization perspective. What have we been doing last year, where are we going, what are the results, what are we trying to focus on? What's the overall strategy? You heard a lot about the product strategy. And how do we in sales bring all of these together? How do we sell them to our partners and to our customers and how we position the overall solution?</p><p>So one of the first things that we are looking, if you look at it from a focus perspective is the product piece. And then the second part will be more the organization. From a product perspective, we basically know that we have a fantastic customer base with our app delivery product, with XenApp, XenDesktop. One of the issues that we are facing there is that basically we see a lot of our customers buying it, but we want them to basically not just adopt but really roll it out. So we are working very close with their customers to understand, providing the proper consulting engineering support in order for them to really deploy it across their organization.</p><p>Obviously, having such a great customer base, what we are also trying to do is upsell and cross sell some of our other products -- networking, mobility, data, and trying to get them to the Mobile Workspace. I mentioned before that we see that our services and the services of our partners bring us significant value. So we are trying to package, as we sell the solutions to our customers, our services in order for them to have a much smoother rollout and be very successful in the implementation.</p><p>And what are we doing from our sales side to basically support that is basically we did a lot of work looking into 2014 based on the strategy that we put in place. What other markets that we want to go after? What are the segments that we want to address? What are the structures that we need both from our partners' perspective as well as from ours to properly cover those markets, those segments, those customers, and really dedicate the time that we need for many of them, in particular in the enterprise space. Why do we want to dedicate time? I will tell you a little more about it, but the idea is really to expand opportunities with them and make sure that they lever from our products.</p><p>So this is why we came up in 2014 with these imperatives -- very simple. Basically, the first one, selling the <person><nameText>Citrix; </nameText></person>expanding the customer relationship; and the third one, increase partner engagement leverage. If we look into what it means and what were the results, you will see why we were going in that direction. Selling the <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>journey is basically sitting down with the customer and selling them the value of leveraging of all of our different solutions and products, and making sure that there is a roadmap that they can follow and they understand where they want to get to.</p><p>If you look into the results of 2014, you can see from the numbers basically we have been able to work with these customers to really, number one, increase the size of the deal and the relevance of those deals. And you see those on the numbers. But what we have also seen is the penetration that we have. 98% of the Fortune 500s and 87% of the Fortune 2000s. And I will share you another table later on.</p><p>Expand customer relationships is all about those customers that we know that we have worked with before is how can we find other buyers, other people that would be interested in our technologies, in our solutions, and be able to do upsell and cross sell, and how can we create this customer satisfaction? How can we make sure that they are satisfied?</p><p>If you look into the multiproduct, customers increased 32%; NetScaler license, 12%, established XenMobile as the leader in EMM. And then, obviously, the CSP -- this is a subscription business that we are doing through some of our partners -- as you see, a very phenomenal 57% growth.</p><p>This, backed up by customers basically telling us that they see the benefits of our support and the MPS was at a record high at 72%. So the services that we are attaching to it and the work that we are doing with them is providing the value for them to see the benefit of the products.</p><p>If you look into the enterprise account penetration, you will see everything that's green is good news. We are present, we are touching it, we are working with them. Everything that's blue is an opportunity. But it's not just being present in these accounts. It's also making sure that we expand that account. And that's a lot of the work that we are doing now with some of these initiatives that I mentioned to you before.</p><p>Partners -- we have always worked with partners. Most of our business is done and transacted through partners. What we want to make sure is that based on the work that we did that I mentioned to you, as far as understanding what's the segment we want to go after, what's the market, how do we work together with a partner, what's the role that the partner works, how do we partner together. And as you can see, we continued seeing growth on the CSC, <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>solution advisor -- that's the reseller. Probably we could do better, and that's what we did discuss with them yesterday -- how can we energize, how can we get more momentum? But as you can see, with the systems integrators we are seeing a very significant business.</p><p>It was mentioned a number of times before that we are working on specialization on the partners. What we want them to be is not just platinum, gold, or silver. What we want to make sure is that they are very specialized, and they go through a rigorous training certification in order to be able to say that they are specialized in virtualization, networking, mobility. It gives them value you to them, profit. It gives value to our customers and we have that ability, as you can see, to really verify, validate a lot of the work that they are doing as part of the certification.</p><p>So basically what are we trying to do? Our sales strategy continues to focus on the revenue growth, the lower cost of sales, leveraging our installed base and our customers, and also using all the routes to market that we have. This provides you an example of what I was talking about. We actually spend the time to try in one chart to show you, to show our partners how we are working together. The pyramid to show the different segments. On the left side you can see the <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>sales team, the global account manager, the enterprise relationship manager, corporate account manager, the field specialist, the specializations that we have that Brian Dye was talking about. And on the right side, you basically have how we interact with our partners and our distributors. And the gray area on the side basically also shows you in which segments we basically joined forces, in which segments we lead the effort, and on which segments we expect them to lead. The idea here is to make sure there is a clarity on the engagement to the customer. But we are also looking for them to drive a lot more business in the midmarket on the SMP.</p><p>From a customer perspective, why do we win? What are the challenges? And what are we doing as far as the self-execution? On the XenApp, XenDesktop, our main products, we are leaders in the virtualization and it's recognized. I think that Bill Burley spent a lot of time talking about lots of the benefits why our customers buying from us. But at the end of the day, if you sit down with a customer -- and when I joined the company it was a very, very strong message. It's all about what we call the experience. It's all about security, it's all about flexibility. They are all extremely happy, once they implement our systems, to be able to work from any location, anywhere, with any device, and have this very rich experience. And it goes without saying for them it becomes second nature. Wherever they are, they open a lap top, a tablet, a phone, a thin client, it works and they have that rich experience.</p><p>If anyone of you were at the keynote, you also see how we can even do it 3D and get this rich experience where people can work maybe even better if they would have a PC in front of them. We can scale. We have done very, very, very large companies, enterprises. But with the CSP program, we can also do small and midmarket companies. So we have proven that we have that scalability. We have companies change the way they work. Think about Aer Lingus. I was talking to [Eric] this morning -- they have basically changed completely the way they used to do things. And that's the benefit that we bring and that's why they buy, because it's reliable, it works, it's there.</p><p>What are the main challenges that we face? I mentioned one of them to you is basically the cost and integration. This is why we want to work with the customers because many times, if they don't follow the proper blueprint, the proper architecture that is recommended, it can be a complex integration, a complex rollout. We see a lot of competition, a lot of competition. And in many cases it's around software as a service.</p><p>And last and not least, our main competition is the old traditional thick client big PC that sitting on the desk. This is the conversation with the customer of the benefits versus the costs.</p><p>So what are we doing? Basically, we have the relationships. Like I mentioned before, we're trying to leverage from those relationships, to talk to the customers to drive our business. We are really driving the verticals. And you've heard Mark talk about -- Bill Burley also talked about it. We are very good at some of them already. But what we want to do is really be open about it, talk about it, have the packaging, have the messaging, be able to be [pear-end] shaped, be able to tell someone in the healthcare industry we know what you need, we know how to do it. We have those killer apps, we have the understanding, we have the knowledge.</p><p>In the airline industry we have been certified. In the railways industry we have been certified in certain countries so they can roll it out with the trust and confidence that it works. And obviously, what we want to do is use our services organization as well as what the partners can do for our customers.</p><p>NetScaler market share continues to grow in the enterprise, and it's the market leader in cloud and dotcom. I think it's a well-kept secret. To be very honest with you, I think that our biggest challenge is really getting everyone to know that we do networking and that it's a very, very good product. But those that understand, those that know basically are buying from us because they see all the advantages that Klaus mentioned before -- the scalability, the innovation of VPX, the ability to consolidate with SDX like Klaus talked about, the savings in power, the saving in cost, the saving in space, obviously the air conditioning and everything else.</p><p>So those, basically, they find out about us are buying from us. So the first thing that we need to do is really how can we get the brand out? The competition is very tough. If you look into EMEA, we invested in EMEA to create a very specialized networking team, had lots of very good success at the beginning and then suddenly we saw the competition come up. But we are fighting and we are winning. We are really winning. The concern, obviously, is the price erosion, the bids. But what we are trying to do is differentiate by attaching to our products and driving it has a solution, and that gives us an opportunity not to have just a stand-alone fight.</p><p>We're also bringing partners from Cisco on one side, as Klaus mentioned, but also our CSAs and our distributors. We are enabling, we're training them, we're making sure that they understand the technology conversation and can go into this fight with an [F5]. Again, we have a customer base and we are trying to touch, to every XenMobile, to every XenApp, to every XenDesktop -- networking, networking, and more networking. We talked about the specialized program for networking partners, which is very successful. We are looking into clouds, we're looking into the service providers, the telco, as Klaus mentioned before. And obviously, we need to talk about brand, brand, brand. We need to get everyone to know that we have a very strong product.</p><p>XenMobile is an EMM market revenue leader. I think that Brian spent a lot of time talking to us about why. And obviously, this is a new acquisition. We have learned a lot about it since we acquired it. We have developed a phenomenal product. XenMobile 10 is very, very good -- a lot of very good feedback from customers that have rolled it out and also for our partners because they see the simplicity of the architecture and the benefits. But we need to really sell those benefits. If we just get stuck into the first part, the MDM part, it's a very tough battle. But when the customer sees the benefits of EMM -- and, like Brian talked about, not just those productivity secure applications like mail and web but you look into basically what we can do for them from a business perspective, it's a very, very strong message. And obviously, we leverage from the whole suite the CWS.</p><p>What are the main challenges? We had a bumpy road at the beginning. I think that with the last release we have a very strong product, very strong positioning. I think the competition is extremely tough, and this is why we need to move the value from just an MDM to really the enterprise solution, and in many cases bundle it with our XenApp, ShareFile, and other products and propositions. When we do that, we win and we win all the time.</p><p>What are we doing as far as going forward? Again, from a partner perspective, and Brian mentioned that, we're doing a lot of the virtualization training, making sure our partners know that we have the right product with the right features and the right architecture for them to be able to sell, that they understand how to position and how to lever it. We are leveraging our accounts. We are selling it as part of our solution. It's a CWS offer.</p><p>Going into 2015, in January we basically talked about these priorities. They are not much different than the ones in 2014, but I think they make a very significant emphasis on one thing. We want the salesforce and our partners to focus on those three in the middle. We want them to be very, very focused on those -- growing Windows application delivery, capture the enterprise mobility market, accelerate networking. We want them to know that's where we want to go and stay focused. On the left side, obviously, we want to make sure we take care of our customers. And the last, on the right side, is basically everything about service providers, cloud, consumption-based model.</p><p>So what are we doing in 2015 to ensure that we are successful? Well, drive customer success -- it's all about making sure that customers are satisfied, customers understand the <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>story, that we have the right go-to-market model that we can surround and work together with the customer. So a little bit of what we had before is the one and two. Right? How do we really understand the customer? How really sell them a solution; how do we really understand the need? how do we make sure that, like we have done in many countries, once we start working with the customer we can sell them one of each of our products? And we've seen this -- enterprise financial sector, recently even mission critical. In Europe, we have a customer that want 65,000 of every one product that we have and has rolled it out because they believe in the product and they have seen the advantages and the benefits that it brings to all the employees that use the technology.</p><p>So we are working on the go to market, as I explained to you, most of it has been done now. It's just being adjusted and rolled out, how David talked about it in the beginning. We want to continue offering all of our support services attached to the products. We want to make sure that the channel organization is trained, enabled. So we have developed a lot of tools for them to be successful. From our <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>sales conversation, how do we expect them to go and see a customer? How do they position the products, how do they understand the needs, how do they find that there's a compelling story, how to find who is going to be the supporter within the organization? So we are spending a lot of time trying to make sure that, once we understand the customer, once we penetrate a customer, once we are working with the customer, we follow really a process.</p><p>On the mobility side, we have created a mobility scorecard that enables our people, our technical people, and our channel people to understand all the application and understand how they make the mobile. If you look into -- will grow Windows app delivery, I mentioned about it. We have a very large market share. What we are trying to do now is expand, make sure that they roll it out, make sure that they adopt and that it is standard within the organization.</p><p>We also talked about the verticalization. And that's something that customers ask, because if you were to ask us what are the segments where you are very strong -- financial sector, government, education, healthcare. And what we are doing now is putting together the right packages, the right messaging, from a marketing perspective, from a pricing and offering perspective, from a training perspective so that we can sit down with these customers and talk about the specific needs that they have and why we are so good.</p><p>This partner specialization and then obviously we are driving a lot of the SMB, what I talked. How can we go down in the curve and have the right product, be it through the CSPs, like a mentioned before, where we have 28 of our CSA partners, SCSPs and they are addressing a market that we didn't address before.</p><p>Capture enterprise mobility -- all about selling our enterprise offer, making sure that customers understand there is more than just the security through MDM, that there is a lot of value in what we are providing to them. Partner specialization -- we want the partners to be able to give the same message. We don't want them to get caught in the competition. And like I mentioned before, we are creating a lot of tools that will enable our salesforce, our technical people, and our partners to basically be able to sit down, have a conversation with a customer, understand the apps that they have and how they make those mobile.</p><p>Networking -- I think it's all about the branding, as we talked. We have dedicated sales teams, was part of what I explained in the pyramid, where we have specialists driving that business. We want to make sure that they understand what's the business and how to drive it, how to address the different customers, in particular when you look into the telcos, the Internet, the dotcoms.</p><p>Partner specialization -- we are trying, obviously, to leverage through some of the Cisco partners that we work with, but also we are creating a distribution strategy.</p><p>And the last one is all about promoting clouds and consumption-based services, where we basically want to continue the success, the big growth, 57% that we talked about in 2014, of the CSPs -- make sure we enable them, make sure that they are successful, make sure we help them with blueprints, with the story. They are driving this business. And obviously, we heard all about <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>Workspace Cloud today and how do we prepare to make sure that that's a very successful proposition, which many of our customers are looking for. We have been asked, can you provide me with the consumption model instead of a perpetual or MMR.</p><p>I talked a lot about the productivity and the work that we are doing. So probably this is a summary of what we have been discussing today. Obviously, there is a lot of focus into making sure we have the proper solutions, the proper integration, the proper packaging in order to easily deploy our technologies. We want to make sure that we support customers and partners with our services organization, that they attach the software maintenance, that they use the pre-sales people that we have for consultants to make sure that the blueprints are correct and workout. We want to stay focused on those products that I said to you. We want to make sure that we drive the business towards that direction. And obviously, from a sales perspective, from a structure of the organization, we want to deploy all the work that we've done in order to ensure that our salesforce is addressing the right markets, the right customers, that they have the right number of accounts in an enterprise so that they can really work through the enterprise, the customers, the accounts, the understanding of how to penetrate.</p><p>We also want to make sure that we have the right partnerships with all of our partners, not just the CSAs, the [DCs] but also the alliances, the systems integrators, in order to be successful and increase our coverage, which then makes us a lot of product.</p><p>So in summary, we are in the right markets; we have the right products and the right market leadership. We have a great customer base, and you saw that in the chart that I showed you. You can go to most any customer and ask about <person><nameText>Citrix. </nameText></person>And they will tell you yes, I know, I have the little logo on the right side of the computer. I know what you are talking about.</p><p>We believe that we have the right market strategies. We are very clear with the sales organization as far as where do we want to go, how do we want to do it. For that, we've put together the right structures for our sales force but we also are partnering with the right partners. They were here, they are here. You might even be able to talk to them. Yesterday we had a very good meeting with them. They are very enthused of what they are seeing, and I believe that we are enabling them to be successful.</p><p>We have one of the best services organization, and we are trying to leverage as much as we can out of it. Why? To make sure that the customers are successful and deploy the right way. And as we discussed today, we have the right basis, we have the right experience with the work we've done with CSP's for our consumption-based model.</p><p>So with that, I believe that <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>has the right opportunity, has the right products, has the right strategy. We have the right teams, and it's all about execution and making sure we are successful.</p><p>With that, I thank you very much for your attention and bring the last presenter on stage. So Chris Hylen, SVP and GM, mobile apps business unit. There you go.</p><p>CHRIS HYLEN, SVP AND GENERAL MANAGER, MOBILITY APPS, CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.: Thank you. Thanks, Carlos. All right, I have about 14 slides. Most our numbers are pictures, so I will try to go through them pretty quickly. We started this journey two years ago in July. For those of you who don't know, this business with GoToMeeting and a number of other products in it, more of our subscription-based businesses. And what I want to go through is our strategy and then some of our outcomes over the last couple years. I want to walk you through the product. We've invested a lot in the product over the last two years, and you will see that outcomes from that. And then I've got one leading indicator that I can share with you in terms of net new business so that we can -- as you see the trajectory the last couple years, my hope is you will leave this seeing the trajectory we think we can get on in the future, without making any forward-looking statements.</p><p>Strategy and outcomes -- it's a pretty simple strategy. Mark outlined it today. We are the mobility apps division, on the right-hand side there. We work on apps and we put the apps into the system. From a divisional perspective, we've got three things we're trying to do. One is we want to drive the mission critical. One of the challenges in this business was with GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToTraining, we were used a couple times a month or three, five, six times a month rather than every day. So we want to get to the point where you can't run your business without our services.</p><p>The second is we want to have great, beautiful, and amazing experiences in terms of crating the software-defined workplace. And we have put a lot of time and effort into design, and you will see the impact of that in some of the Net Promoter scores I'll share with you. And then last is, as we started this thing, this journey and continue the journey in this business, a couple years ago was pretty much -- it wasn't really integrated in terms of products and offerings. And now with Workspace you are seeing more and more sharing of capabilities in terms of things like single sign-on, storage capabilities, audio, video. And I will walk you through that as well.</p><p>So what do we do as a division? We software define meeting rooms in terms of GoToMeeting. We software define filing cabinets in terms of ShareFile, and we software define service calls in terms of things like GoToAssist. Recently we've added a couple of things. We've acquired Grasshopper, which is an audio phone system that's an overlay on top of your cell. so I'll go through it, but it's a great BYOD system for small business. And we also bought a company called RightSignature which, when you look inside of the document workflows, we store a lot of documents. This gives us the ability to have legal and binding signatures on those, and I'll share that with you as well.</p><p>So if you look at this chart, our revenues increased about $140 million over the last three years. That's the good news. The bad news is our rate of growth has decelerated over those last three years. But the good news inside of this chart is two years ago we had a 5% drop. This year it's a 2% drop. And you can see the trend, and we are trying to bottom that out for a business this size and get to that kind of a flattening out. And we feel good about the future. We think it's a pretty strong accomplishment. And we did that by improving, to a large degree, investing in the product and improving retention. So retention for the last three years you can see was flat for two and we had a four-point increase this year. There are certain offerings we have a much higher increase than that. And so, we are seeing bottom line improvements in retention, which has helped us slow that growth rate while we fix the products in terms of go-forward revenue.</p><p>We invested a lot in the meeting products and making the experience better. If you look at what we call transactional Net Promoter score, which is at the end of a service call or a transaction how do you rate us at the end of a meeting, we are up 6% for GoToMeeting. We are up 26% for GoToWebinar, and up 5% for GoToTraining over the last year. And so, relative to our competition, we are either number one or number two in every one of those categories now as we measure it.</p><p>If you specifically go to GoToMeeting, we have broken it out by the organizer, the person that calls the meeting, the person that attends on the desktop, and the person that attends on mobile. And we are up on the organizer 15 points. So the person actually calls the meeting is up to 15 points over the last year. The desktop attendees up 58%. So we were down in the 20%s, and we have been able to get the desktop experience to be much, much better. And our mobile attendees are up 62%. In some instances, on our mobile attendees we had a negative Net Promoter score when we started this. You see dramatic turnarounds in terms of experience. That leads into the product. This last year we did the first GUI refresh on GoToMeeting in a very long time. It's now out on the Windows. We are still working on the Mac. The response has in positive. When you launch these things, you get a little dip in Net Promoter but it has come back really strong and people really seem to like it.</p><p>On mobile, our mobile apps are all now five-star mobile apps. And we've got everything is on mobile. Again, we started about 18 months ago. I think we had two mobile apps, and they didn't work very well. So we have made a big improvement there.</p><p>And then one of the things I'm most excited about is we are starting to unify up a lot of our experiences, what we call GoToMeeting meeting rooms. And that's not going to be the rollout name, but that's what we are calling it right now. But what we want is we want dedicated spaces for meetings. So think about, if you have a staff meeting every week or if you have an update meeting every week we want to create a dedicated space where only certain people can get into that meeting. And it's at a certain point in time every week or every month you schedule it.</p><p>We then want you to be able to upload and share things like agendas, files, and action items with those participants. So if you have an agenda, it goes right into that meeting space. People can go in and they can look at it.</p><p>And then we use the ShareFile capabilities to actually store those documents. So you know how some -- you have meetings. Like in our staff meeting we give a presentation one week and then next we go to another series of presentations. What we are working through is carrying those presentations with that set meeting agenda so it becomes a place you have to come back to every week and a place that's not event driven but is more of a process and inside of your workflow.</p><p>Now, there are some challenges with this. We have to figure out who are the regular attendees, who gets special access, those kinds of things. But we are going to launch this, this quarter, and we will experiment and test our way through to figure out how to do it really, really well.</p><p>And then the last piece, which is, again, related to One <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>is we've developed a <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>single identity service that now is available between GoToMeeting and ShareFile; it's going to be on Receiver. And so you saw it this morning with Workspace services. So we've developed a utility now where you get a single sign-on across all <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>products and services, and that will be on this as well. So you can begin to see us, evidence of us taking the pieces of <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>together for a better experience for our customer.</p><p>We are doing a lot with Worx. If you look inside of Worx we've got ShareFile folders. You can get in with a single sign-on and you can send links with WorxMail. If you look at it from a file, you can download, edit, and attach files to WorxMail. So you can actually get a file. It's in a container. You can send it to people and share it and people can open it. With what we call quick edit you can actually go in and edit these documents as well inside of the flow. So again, you can see we are starting to weave all of our technologies together to create a really great experience for the users across the company.</p><p>If you look at ShareFile, one of the beauties and curses of dealing with Gartner -- it's great to know you are in the top right-hand quadrant. But they have to approve every slide. Just trust me, if you look at that top right one where one of the highest-rated leaders in the share file space. ShareFile is one of the leaders in this space and actually in what they call the Magic Quadrant. So we are getting recognized not only by our customers but by industry experts as well.</p><p>And then we've made two acquisitions in the last year, both of which are ripe for integration across all <person><nameText>Citrix. </nameText></person>The first one is Grasshopper. So Grasshopper -- you download an app on your mobile phone. It leverages your existing -- you come in as an employee, you bring your phone to work. You download an app on your mobile phone, and it gives you a brand-new phone number for business calls. And as a business owner I can control that number; I can control the list of people you call. I have access to all your contacts, and when you leave I can delete that application. And so it really plays into the bring your own device strategy. The second piece is it's now mission critical because you use voice every day.</p><p>And so we begin to integrate this capability. While they have been targeted traditionally at SMBs, you can see a situation where you see a situation where you can take this to the enterprise and begin to have an enterprise phone app included inside Worx where the enterprise can now give you a phone number, but they can pull it back if and when they want to put back, along with all the call records and everything else. So you can begin to see containerized cell phone usage because it leverages your current plan.</p><p>The other thing that we did was buy RightSignature. It allows you to fill out and sign documents on any device, and they are legally binding. And we are beginning to integrate that into all of our ShareFile applications and all of the PDFs and everything we send within our services. And again, those same applications, whether they resell them standalone to customers or integrated in capabilities or we sell them as part of Worx, they all work together. We are all using the same backend, making development pretty efficient.</p><p>And finally, you saw the demonstration that [Jess] made today with Mark. There's a number of pieces of this. You will see more tomorrow where the technologies that we've had and mobility apps are now being weaved into the enterprise experience. Particularly as the enterprise experience becomes more consumer like, we have a big role in playing in there and making sure that we deliver capabilities and experiences for those customers.</p><p>And I've got one leading indicator I want to share with you. And I've got a bet with somebody that you will understand it. They said you wouldn't, so here goes. One of the leading indicators in recurring revenue businesses is a metric we watch called net new business. Okay? So net new business -- we measure it every day. It's the new sales we bring in plus or minus any price adjustments minus the losses. And what that gives is an indicator of that revenue -- say it's $100. We know we're going to get that $100 every month for the remaining months, and it's net new. Does that make sense? And what I wanted to share with you was an indexed perspective of our net new business over the last six quarters for year-over-year growth. If you take Q4 of 2013 and you say that we did $100 in that quarter, every quarter now sequentially we have been able to grow that at minimum of 16%. And you can see in some it's 58% year over year.</p><p>Sorry? Do you have a question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Why is the growth rate decelerating, then?</p><p>CHRIS HYLEN: Well, it takes a long -- when you have a really big base of recurring revenue it takes -- we know coming into the year what 80% to 90% of our revenue is going to be because of attrition and retention. But you have to add on top of that -- just by running those numbers it takes a while for it to turn the ship. So what you are seeing is the deceleration in growth. And with this kind of thing we can at least -- we hope, going forward, that we have flatten that out moving forward, if not move it forward.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: So when does the model say it turns?</p><p>CHRIS HYLEN: You will have to run your own models. We are not giving any futures. Is that correct? That's correct.</p><p>But I wanted to give you some idea of past performance. Now, again, this is a short-term trend. But we are encouraged that the changes we are making in our product, the changes we're making in our retention are leading to increase in net new revenue over time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible)?</p><p>CHRIS HYLEN: No. Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: [Bill says] most of the GoToMeeting business models training.</p><p>CHRIS HYLEN: Yes, almost all of our -- we only have one product that bills other than monthly at this point. We have one usage-based product called OpenVoice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: And the grand question -- what is multi-billing (inaudible) on the base? If you are net businesses [less] what you are losing is growing, it doesn't make sense for the churn to take that long.</p><p>CHRIS HYLEN: It still takes a while. It's a ship to turn. You got to remember it's an $800 million base. So if you take $800 million and you lose 10% you go to $720 million. Right? To grow 10% back you got to make up $180 million. To get $180 million in current year you've got to sell $360 million worth. So it becomes -- it's a big number. I'd be happy to walk through you -- with that math with you one-on-one.</p><p>Anything else? Okay, I'm going to turn it -- just a summary. We have strategic alignment across <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>in this business. This is not a standalone. It's fully integrated into everything we're doing at this point in time, particularly as we move more to the cloud and the infrastructure we build and the infrastructure we service. Run an $800 million business. We've seen a lot of improvements in our core metrics in terms of retention, in terms of Net Promoter Score. And we got some encouraging performance indicators going forward. But we still have a lot of work to do, and we are not counting anything before we get there.</p><p>With that, I'll turn it over to David, who I think wants to do a summary before we go to Q&amp;A.</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: So first off, let me just say thanks to everyone. I know we've been talking and a lot of granularity for about three hours now without a break, so we appreciate everybody staying engaged and staying focused.</p><p>So as a companion event to Synergy, obviously each year we tried to go down a couple of clicks. And this is a very granular look at individual piece parts. Right? So I really encourage everyone to, if you haven't already, watch the keynotes, understand the broader strategic message that helps frame and put a lot of this in context. The big takeaway is obviously that there's a tremendous amount of change going on at <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>right now. At the end of last year, we initiated a broader restructuring focused on simplifying the strategy, simplifying the org model, involving the leadership team, and putting in place the cost structure that is appropriate for the business right now that also allows us to focus on a multiyear expansion of margins going forward. Clearly, there's a ton of innovation going on across the individual product areas, as you are seeing today. And really they all focus in three main themes, of course, around experience, security, and flexibility for customers, all focused on helping them transform their businesses, mobile enable their businesses, as we talked about earlier.</p><p>And so that's the common theme that you will see more and more throughout the show over the next couple of days. Our ability to bring together these market-leading technologies where you are seeing lots of innovations across the board and combine those into true differentiated and leading solutions is providing a tremendous amount of visibility and value for customers. And so that's the big, big takeaway right now. We are focused on a lot. We are innovating rapidly. And we've got a number of changes that we initiated the balance of last year and we are working our way through right now.</p><p>So what we're going to do for everyone on the webcast is take about 10- or 15-minute break, give everybody chance to refresh your coffee, take a bathroom break, etc., and we will come back and we will do a Q&amp;A panel with the presenters from this morning plus Mark Templeton. So right now, I'm not wearing a watch, but let's plan on about 10, 15 minutes. We'll come back, do a live Q&amp;A.</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: So we are going to go ahead and get started here for Q&amp;A. So a couple of things.</p><p>First, you have the earlier speakers from today. Also want to welcome Mark Templeton, who everyone knows; and Robson Grieve, whom you might not know, our new Chief Marketing Officer. So we'll get everybody up here. (Conference Instructions)</p><p>So with that, let's jump right in. Questions in the room.</p><p>BHAVAN SURI, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY: It's Bhavan Suri, William Blair. One of the themes from the keynote and this afternoon has been a focus on security. And as you look at the potential drivers for growth, and as you reposition the product, is that where you are seeing the demand come from? Is it less of mobility and is less of virtualization, which have been the themes for the last couple of years? And is it all being driven by security? And then I have a quick follow-up for David.</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.: Okay. A number of us can take this. Let me just say a few short things.</p><p>First of all, we've always been seen as strong in security but not a security tool. Number one. Number two, we think that as a result we haven't told that security story and used it to drive demand the way we can and will. Tomorrow Geir is actually going to have a talk on security.</p><p>GEIR RAMLETH: I talked to them earlier.</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: You heard some of it today. And I think that in the traditional sectors, like banking, they sort of understand the security aspects of what we do. But I think -- in the others, I think there's plenty of upside to driving demand based upon a security message.</p><p>BHAVAN SURI: So just as you look at some of those drivers, you know, sort of the BYOD -- the number of devices. David put up we've now got three devices, on average. Those have all sort of happened, and we haven't seen growth sort of along those trajectories, I would say, in the last year, year and a half. So I guess my question is more: as you look and pivot toward security, or focus in, or rethink the message, do you think it drives acceleration in the core license business?</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: Yes, absolutely, because I think it allows us to be seen through the security lens and have a direct conversation with a CSO and to have a security-centric conversation. For example, I'd say right now in our sales force, if you said DLP, they would say, is that a new rapper? (laughter)</p><p>They wouldn't know what DLP really was. So speaking the language of security, because we probably have one of the best DLP solutions in the world. When you never transmit data, it can't leak. So there are a number of terms, and DLP is a line item on a budget, and CSOs speak that language. But we've got to get way better at speaking the language and driving demand on that dimension.</p><p>BHAVAN SURI: Great. And then for David: you broke out the gross margins by the various product categories. Any color on sort of that contribution margin on -- maybe on the operating margin line or something by those various product categories, to help us understand the margin implications as, potentially, gross margins improve slightly?</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: We haven't broken out contribution margin in a public way across our business units. And we are probably not going to be moving into full segment reporting. Maybe in 2016 or 2017 we will.</p><p>But I would say at a high level, the way to think about it is consistent with our statements over the last couple of quarters, or the last couple of years, frankly. Workspace services -- very high profit, especially around Windows App Delivery. That's been sort of the base of business right now. It's a little over 1.6. It's all software license, got a huge installed base of license updates and maintenance. So that business carries significant profitability.</p><p>Mobile App Delivery is still dilutive to the bottom line as we have been ramping that business. Very consistent with the statements we've made before. And then networking is kind of the other piece in that pie -- a little bit below the corporate average, but growing faster. Regarding our mobility apps business, that business has been historically running right around 20 points of overall profit, and it's pretty much in that ballpark right now.</p><p>KATHERINE EGBERT, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: It's Katherine Egbert from Piper Jaffray. If I could scope up a little bit. So you talked about an archaeological dig, Dave, and clearly you are part of that archaeology historically. Right? You are down in those layers in client/server and -- I guess not mainframe, but mainly client/server. And now you are trying to use your relationships, your technology, to bridge yourself into the cloud world. And you have a whole portfolio of products to do that. Is that fair? And meanwhile you are rationalizing costs with the existing and spending on the growth areas. Is that fair?</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: Yes.</p><p>KATHERINE EGBERT: And the question is: as you went through the portfolio today, I counted a large number of large companies that you are starting to compete with, right? Microsoft, EMC, F5, DocuSign, various security vendors. So how do you feel about your ability as you are trying to capture this cloud opportunity and the shift to compete in all these areas with, frankly, what are some really big companies?</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: I think it's a great question. And, frankly, if we are looking at our [op] right now and it's measured in $20 billion, $25 billion, over the next few years, of course you're going to have large-scale competitors. And the thing that's going to differentiate <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>not only the ability to compete in individual product categories -- and you've seen where we are maintaining a number one or number two market share in all of those major products -- but more specifically, to kind of take that up a click and look at it horizontally; be able to deliver solutions that really are differentiated.</p><p>We are not a platform. We're not looking at being a ubiquitous platform, the way some of the folks that you mentioned are. But we can deliver solutions that allow us to interoperate with (technical difficulty) solve specific problems but, more specific to us, to allow companies to do this transformation that we've been talking about.</p><p>We are part of the archaeological dig, if you will. But that's because customers are looking at a fundamental way to simplify that whole process. And if we can give them a common delivery vehicle -- and we've used different metaphors and analogies over the years -- but if you think about just transforming IT infrastructure, whether that's apps, data, desktops, etc., into a delivered service, that abstracts away all the complexity from the end user in particular and makes the actual construction end -- or IT, if you will -- that much more easy to manage going forward.</p><p>So that's been the broader approach. We are always going to compete with companies that are larger than ours. We have for the history of the business. We built a number of big businesses around that as well. So I feel pretty good about it. And I think that one of the key takeaways is that going into this year, we were simplifying the strategy to make sure that it's more crisp and clear and coherent to the types of problems that our customers are trying to solve.</p><p>We have been refining the product offerings in certain ways to make sure that we are focused on fewer and fewer things and doing those extremely well. We saw lots of ideas and elements of innovation across those individual product areas today, and you heard a number of us talk about how we are bridging those together to really create those differentiated solutions so that we are not effectively competing with a platform -- or, when we are competing with a really targeted point product vendor, we can just totally change the conversation. You think about what we did from MDM to EMM -- allowed us to go from nothing to a leader in that market in just a couple of years. And so I think that's the broader summary of the strategy.</p><p>KATHERINE EGBERT: Just one quick follow-up on that. The mobility apps area was the only area where you gave out incremental financial metrics if I listened fully today. So can you just talk about that area? Obviously there's been some chatter. And why give out those metrics in one area but not in the others? Thanks.</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: There's nothing intended there. There is no hidden message behind that. We've talked a lot about those businesses, and they've been aggregated into just a really high level of revenue for the most part and then, occasionally, units.</p><p>And so giving a bit more context and color into the operation of what is largely a SaaS business just helps you better understand. We have given lots of incremental details in terms of the other businesses at the same time -- whether it's unit volume; some of the subsegments around the individual market categories, like Klaus going through the individual segments within NetScaler, talking about the segments within Windows app delivery; so there is more granularity we are talking about across the Company. So nothing intended specifically around mobility apps.</p><p>CHRIS HYLEN: And just to reinforce that, the same metrics -- there was only one new metric this year from what we showed last year. We showed the same thing. We showed revenue retention, Net Promoter last year. So nothing -- there wasn't anything different.</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: I think you'll see us talk more and more about SaaS-type metrics as we go forward, right? So we run SaaS-delivered software at roughly $0.75 billion right now. When you include that with some of our other recurring revenue businesses, you get that 70% that I talked about. As we look into 2016 and 2017 and beyond, and you start seeing more and more of our technologies being delivered via a SaaS model, we will start talking about the types of metrics that are more -- that are more related to that, whether those are customer acquisition costs, retention, etc., etc. So that will be a more gradual evolution.</p><p>JOHN RIZZUTO, ANALYST, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY: John Rizzuto, SunTrust. If I look -- I'm going to follow-up on that question about the competitive landscape. But if I think about the messaging as I perceive it, and to correct me if I'm wrong here, what you're laying out there is not really evolutionary at all. You might say the market David was being evolutionary, but what you're doing is actually changing the rules of engagement, it seems.</p><p>It's pretty hard to pull it off but everybody has this natural evolution. GoToDesktop as a service, grow into it, and you are saying -- ignore all that; skip that step. Come to where we want to take you, which is get everything from us as this new, real vision of integrating all the things you want to do for mobility.</p><p>You can call it mobility, call it the new Workspace. Bring it with you anywhere you want to go. You'll need all these components to do it. We're the only one who can deliver it, whereas everybody else is delivering a piece of it.</p><p>But the biggest problem that I see to that perception, if it seems to be going to that place -- the market isn't ready for this. The end-user base is used to buying a lot of their products piecemeal. They are used to buying it in these fragmented silos and on a feature/function type of thing. So there's this whole education process that you need to bring them through before you can even convince them to buy <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>to do it. So a little bit about -- first of all, what it is about the thoughts of going that direction; and those difficulties of getting a customer base that doesn't seem ready for it.</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: John, I'd say a couple of things. First of all, for us to get to -- you know, to double again, we have to be selling business outcomes, not the piece parts. And we believe that's what customers want. They want to buy -- you know, in the old joke about the person that goes to the hardware store. They want a hole, and they get sold a drill.</p><p>So customers want to buy the outcome, and they have had to put the piece parts together. And our partners have had to put the piece parts together for them. So what we are simply saying is: you can put it together faster and simpler. You can put it together all cloud or, you know, in a hybrid sense. And you can do it with our partners piecemeal or you can do it end-to-end with us as an intermediary.</p><p>And I think that if you look at what we did -- what we're doing with the test drive, and I hope you all will get on the test drive, we are opening up the whole idea of being a publisher to anyone who wants to have that experience so that we can create a viral aspect of the outcome. And that is being able to pick up any device: a Chromebook, I don't care who makes it; a big screen or a tablet, I don't care who makes it; or a smartphone, I don't care who makes it -- and get the -- go to an HTML5 browser or get the native app and get the experience.</p><p>And having the apps to actually populate that is important. And we think that when customers see the experience, that's what they want to buy. And then it's a matter of then a partner being able to put those pieces together. And you saw in the demo how simple we are making it to do. I'd say that's the premise.</p><p>And it's a classic end-to-end strategy where, yes, can we put an F5 ADC in there? You can, but you're not going to get the kind of insights into the traffic, into the analytics, and all that kind of stuff on our protocols that you will when you put NetScaler in. So it won't be an all-or-nothing. It will be -- and we'll give choices. We want more wallet share, and this is how we will get it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is about growth versus profitability. Maybe talk -- just given the challenges you guys have had on growth, and you've cut costs, but just philosophically, as we look ahead next year, how that view in terms of growth versus continuing to expand margins -- obviously, internally, you have a lot of different initiatives. Just talking about curtailing that and just continued focus on margin expansion. So, yes, I'd just be interested in that.</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: I think at a high level we've talked a lot about the restructuring that we initiated late last year and really launched in earnest in Q1. Through that, it was about like -- and you heard me talk about initiating multiyear expansion of margins. And that is an important element of what we're doing.</p><p>We're also reallocating a tremendous amount of cost behind the scenes so that we can continue to invest aggressively in those things that will drive future revenue growth. And so from our perspective, the fastest way to drive earnings in the current period of time is to continue to optimize execution.</p><p>And then, as we have put investment behind some of those areas that are actually delivering very strong growth right now, we can just provide that much faster return to the bottom line. So it's a balance. It's always been a balance for us.</p><p>I think we are very realistic about the growth rates of the business and where they are today. That's the primary reason why we're optimizing profit. And we are taking a multiyear outlook on that right now.</p><p>GREGG MOSKOWITZ, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen. David, I wanted to go back to the Workspace Cloud. And I think you said that it would not have an impact in 2015, and it will be gradual in 2016 and beyond. So the question is: why not move faster?</p><p>Why not, for instance, deemphasize perpetual, where XenApp and XenDesktop product revenues are clearly in decline, and then also look to take your maintenance customers and potentially convert them to a little bit of the higher value-add subscription-type offering, along the lines of what you do with CFT?</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: Yes, it's a great question, actually. Longer-term, if you would imagine, the idea is simply you create a platform you can -- you know, you can migrate existing customers to incremental services over time and just uplift the ARR and, certainly, customer lifetime value.</p><p>I think in the short term the simple answer is: we haven't announced pricing or packaging right now. We are just moving through a customer beta program into more of a public test drive, if you will. And so once we get some experience with real customers, and real scale, real partners, etc., then we can make that determination downstream.</p><p>And so right now I think it's just the most prudent thing to do to be measured about it and engage that reaction we get. And then if we are having this conversation a year from now, we feel like we are at that position that makes sense for the business, then we can always move the accelerator in a different direction. But that's where we are as of right now.</p><p>Remember, the product is not live. We announced this morning that we'll be publicly announcing packaging, pricing, and availability in Q3 time frame. And so let's get through that first and get a few quarters of experience under our belt. And then we'll figure out how quickly to make that evolution.</p><p>GREGG MOSKOWITZ: Then just a follow-up for Mark. So Microsoft with Azure -- I would say, literally, almost every chance they get, they are highlighting EMS; and what it's doing for them; and how it's driving, again, higher-margin-type opportunities within Azure. So is that something where it is -- I know it's not a full solution offering, but that's something that is encroaching somewhat on your mobility opportunity? And if you could also just more broadly talk about the relationship with Microsoft in terms of competitive dynamics, coopetition, etc.?</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: Okay. I would say that in the mobile area, it's probably a rub point. We don't really love device management. It's sort of table stakes, ticket to the dance. And they love device management. So we are not -- I mean, so that's -- we have never relied on that being a core part of our strategy other than to offer a full solution.</p><p>When it comes to, then, the Mobile App Delivery and security, etc., I think that's an area where we think we can build on and leverage their MDM. But they have to make it a platform; they have to make it open, etc. Lots of conversation about that.</p><p>Still tremendous love for what we do around RDS, and Windows Server, and all that licensing. Lots of love around what we're doing in Azure. We are all-in on Azure. I think we are one of the top 10 customers of Azure.</p><p>So they are loving that. They are loving what we are doing with Office 365 in terms of integrations, etc. You see us in the various announcements, especially with ShareFile. And we just have too much content. But we are using all of the Microsoft Cloud-enabled editing tools, as well, if you want to edit out of ShareFile in the cloud.</p><p>So all of that is going great, because right now the way to get love at Microsoft is drive O-365 and Azure consumption, period. And then they are great customer for NetScaler, so -- we are building on Azure. So it's just one of those things where, like, when we meet, we talk about the good things; and we talk about the things that we are not agreeing on.</p><p>And the problem is that all the cookies have been licked. So you can't bite a cookie that hasn't been licked already. You know? And by the way, we licked that cookie first. All right? So we should be upset about you guys biting our cookie. You just can't do that.</p><p>And so we accept it. And you find the places to agree, and move forward, and know that there are, quote, Microsoft shops. But more than ever we are in a world that is the antithesis of the past in terms of winner-takes-all. So that's one of the reasons I feel great about our position in spite of the bigger guys and so forth, because I think that we use our size to our advantage, because we can focus on verticals. We can focus on segments.</p><p>If you look at what Chris's team has been doing in that area, that's one of the great growth opportunities for ShareFile and GoToMeeting. What we are doing to turn the ship there, especially in the virtualization area, where the security and experience and flexibility are paramount. And so that's how I'd answer your question, if it helps.</p><p>MICHAEL TURITS, ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES &amp; ASSOCIATES, INC.: Michael Turits from Raymond James. Dave, everything has decelerated a bit recently. And as you go forward now, how do you think about the growth opportunities from different segments, including Windows App Delivery, which is the subsegment, at least directionally? And a follow-up question to that is: when you think about investing, given that you are going to expand margins, how do you think about prioritizing those investments across different growth opportunities?</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: Let me take the second part of the question first. As a team we talk a lot about where the opportunity is long-term -- what businesses need to have incremental investment to drive growth over a multiyear period of time, and what businesses, frankly, are just in more mature markets. And we are optimizing for greater profit.</p><p>And then that takes on a number of different flavors. In some cases we take the common developments, and we move some of it into lower-cost locations. And that's one way to bring down costs while maintaining the base.</p><p>In other cases we'll take technologies, and we'll just fold them into others to be able to optimize the cost envelope, but leverage the core capabilities into something larger. That just reduces the number of moving parts. So it's a little bit of all of the above.</p><p>When we think about the growth opportunity -- and I talked a little bit about the TAM size -- the aggregate TAM of the categories we are participating in right now is somewhere north of 10%. It depends on where you look at it and how much weight you want to put on the categories, but it's north of 10% growth in the underlying opportunity for where we are participating right now.</p><p>Specific to Windows App Delivery, the best data that we get from industry analysts shows that it's a flat to low growth market overall. So our business has been on a new license basis clearly in transition. It's been decelerating in a couple of categories and declining in a couple of categories. And then we talked about this underlying shift towards new, more consumption-based, and whatnot.</p><p>You might not have caught it, but I had actually said that last quarter we actually delivered a year-on-year increase in licenses. It was a double-digit growth in licenses year on year, even though total revenue decelerated. And that's just a statement about the mix, because a CSP license, for example, would take a little over two years to be the same in-period financial impact as, obviously, a new perpetual license of one of those.</p><p>So it's a little bit of both. I think that the investments that we've made in things to really focus on -- whether it's midmarket VDI, vertical attach, project-based use cases -- that type of segmentation is going to be important going forward, because there's places where we just haven't competed.</p><p>And so when we talk about things like WorkspacePod, Workspace Cloud, and others, really, the idea there is how do you extract away complexity from customers to allow them to go faster? Changing the cost and complexity profile is really, really important. So we are going to do a little bit of both of all those.</p><p>But I think that probably the last thing I would say is as a team, we are much more focused and clear around segments and understanding within each of our businesses -- where we are not selling more of a solution approach, there is individual market segments that have different ways to differentiate, different growth rates, different opportunities, different go-to-market -- and being more specific about the areas that we definitely want to compete in and doing those end-to-end.</p><p>And the places that we don't think we have inherent leverage, we're just not going to participate in that. And that's just more of the evolution around clarity that you are hearing over the course of the restructuring and beyond. Anything you would add to that, Mark?</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: Really not much beyond -- just to say that I think that when markets mature, the first thing you have to do is segment them, because they will grow like mad on a horizontal basis until they get to a maturity, where the only way to keep the primary demand going is to segment them, and -- with demographics, psychographics, all of those kinds of methodologies.</p><p>So what we've done in the Windows App Delivery space, in fact, is say: okay, where is the value proposition that's attached to the long tail of Windows and Windows apps and desktops. Where is that? And that is in government, healthcare, banking, and engineering-related areas. And the reason is some combination of security of IP, lack of control of endpoints, and lack of control of the workforce that's at that endpoint. Maybe contractors, maybe employees, etc.</p><p>So by using our -- what we call our relationships and combining what we call hero apps, hero devices, and hero use cases, that's how we can actually attack these verticals without having a vertical sort of oriented organization and business.</p><p>And then when Bill is prioritizing the feature set for the next feature pack or the next release of XenApp, he knows exactly which segments those things are feeding. And we know exactly how to drive demand with those features. That's very different from how we got here.</p><p>How we got here was by being the primary driver of demand in a market that we invented from scratch, all right, and approaching it in a horizontal way. In sort of a mea culpa, I believe that I -- we as a company, but I as being accountable for it, missed the turn from the horizontal to much more of a vertical and long-tail kind of a turn.</p><p>And then I think if you look at the commodity end of the marketplace, it's being more and more served by a Windows server, which -- you know, it always has been; it's just that it's served, I think, more robustly and more directly today. And I think we have opportunity to do products that can enhance the commodity end of the marketplace and serve as a land-expand kind of process that, frankly, is what got us here.</p><p>We met with our partners on Monday, and they talked extensively about their experience around how we would sell a customer a small solution, and it worked. They wanted to expand it with more users or more apps, and then got invited back to make it -- to put it in more places or expand the number of use cases. And I think we have -- I think that's where our opportunity is in the so-called Windows App Delivery space.</p><p>KIRK MATERNE, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI: Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Maybe to expand on that a little bit, Mark, just from a channel perspective -- obviously, when you -- I'd say some of the feedback from the channel the last couple of years has been that -- alienate is maybe not the right word, but there's been some give-and-take between you and the channel. And perhaps it was this idea that you were looking at things horizontally, and perhaps you should have been focusing more on the channels to go to vertical.</p><p>I guess, when you try to sort of catch up in that regard, how long does that take? Meaning -- you guys have a big product set, but to get them really focused on a more vertical market, that's a little bit more solution-oriented. There will be some channel partners that could probably make that jump; there's some that can't.</p><p>What should we expect from the channel over the next 12 months from you guys? And if they are able to make that leap, should we see your actual professional services revenue maybe level off a little bit? Because the professional services revenue has gone up really nicely, but I'd say in some respects you probably want to be handing off more of that revenue to your channel partners, if you are getting more strategic with some of your customers. So could you just talk about that a little bit? How key is that to making your top-line goals for the next year or two?</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: So I think if you look at our classic channel partners, the platinum partners, I think they feel loved. They feel profitable. They will ebb and flow with changes in policies and programs, and we don't always get it right.</p><p>I think the gold and silver partner community, we have not shown the kind of incentives and love for. And part of that is because of the more -- the greater focus we have had on strategic selling. So I think that, again, it's in conjunction with the opportunity we talked about in Windows App Delivery: being more use-case-oriented, doing some things that can fill the more commodity end of the marketplace. That's how we can engage with them and reengage with them.</p><p>Certainly Workspace Cloud has a partner-centric message around it, and we think that's going to be a big incentive for them to reengage. We will have to do some re-incentivizing. Fernando -- who's not here, but I'm sure Carlos talked about the reorganization that he did in the Americas that really separated out the direct touch from the channel-centric organization. I think that makes a big difference, and I think it will take us kind of all year to see that.</p><p>I also would say, Kirk, that every one of these partners -- very few of them are, like, fully horizontal. That's how they make their money, by repeating. So they are already there. It's just that we don't feed them that way, all right?</p><p>CARLOS SARTORIUS: No, no -- that's correct. As a matter of fact, I think the platinum gave us a lot of feedback -- that we needed to verticalize, and that we needed to support them with the solutions, with the marketing, with the collateral, with some of the specific features that they need.</p><p>I think that if you look into more, like Mark was saying, the silver and gold, we are doing a lot of work around enabling them, working together with them, and reinvigorating the channel by -- in the case of Americas, the way Fernando did it, as well as in EMEA. We have now a very much concentrated effort on organization that's working with them. And it's part of the structures that I talked about. If you remember, in the pyramid, we have a CDM FSMs that are working together with the channel to develop customers, to develop opportunities, and really drive that market.</p><p>So I think you're going to be hearing a lot more from us as far as making sure we have the right products for them to be successful, the right enablement, the right support. And also, you mentioned about the services -- I think as we continue to support the enterprise global accounts and drive the top of the pyramid, you will still see our services growing. But we also won't, in certain countries and in certain places, enable them for them to be able to do the services, because we might not even have the presence, or we are working on opening emerging countries. If you look in EMEA, Russia, Turkey, Israel -- a number of different countries that we've seen potential, and we are doing it through the channel.</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: If there's one thing that I would like to change as fast as possible, it's to have the products -- and you saw some of them today -- that can be bought and not sold. Okay? And by the way, those are the products that channel partners love the most, because they become the most profitable.</p><p>So I think what we've done is take the complexity bar and radically lowered it. So I think that's going to change the economic model for the partners we already have -- doing the things they already do, but also we'll open up the engagement of the silvers and golds in a whole new way.</p><p>And we didn't talk about WorkspacePod today, but we're not going to really spend any time on it here at the conference. But just stay tuned on that, because that's another way to make this really simple and get greater reach --</p><p>KIRK MATERNE: The partners.</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: Yes. It's very partner-friendly.</p><p>KARL KEIRSTEAD, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Karl Keirstead at Deutsche Bank. David, you talked about some of the main elements of the restructuring. It feels like many of them are behind you, at least started and well underway.</p><p>The one that isn't yet, though, is the portfolio streamlining, which you mentioned is, quote, in process. I thought it might be a good idea for you and Mark maybe to use this occasion to hit refresh on that process. How comprehensive will it be? And generally, what's the framework you're going to use to approach those decisions?</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: Yes. I'd say, without going into granular detail, the highest or the tops-down view of that would be understanding with clarity what markets are critical to delivering the strategy; what products are critical to be able to compete, both on a category basis and as elements of solutions; and then being very thoughtful about everything that doesn't fall cleanly into those buckets.</p><p>The second click on that from a go-to-market point of view-- and we did this going into this year -- is understand: what is truly core? What products do we want to have a defined go-to-market motion against -- things that will include everything from demand gen out through enablement, etc.? What products that we'll we want to be sold purely as an attach motion versus trying to go after a red ocean market, and then what things would we just have as opportunistics?</p><p>And so the things that don't fall cleanly into those areas have either been end-of-lifed, and that's happened in a number of smaller products; there are cases where we've taken products and made them into just feature elements, where the technology becomes embedded -- so it's no longer a name, a brand, a go-to-market motion, etc. And then in some cases they would fall into those categories that I just mentioned.</p><p>So that's the process that -- it's soft. You can't just do this overnight, simply because you've got customers that are on a lot of these technologies, products that we've sold in the past. If it's an integration solution, that takes time to do that thoughtfully.</p><p>So it's not just another technology in the box, if you will. And because of that, that process is multi-quarter in nature. Part of the question about the larger business units -- I think we tried to articulate that today, just to help understand: here are the primary product lines within the business units -- how they operate independently and interdependently across the organization. And I think that overlap is -- you can quantify that differently depending on which product you are talking about. I mentioned a couple of examples around, like, data platform and mobility.</p><p>The data fabric is really what differentiates mobility from an EMM vendor to a large degree. The fact that we have integrated collaboration makes the Worx family a truly productive suite of tools. 20% to 30% of NetScaler comes from attaching to a virtualization sale. And on and on and on.</p><p>And that's the interdependence piece. And I think that actually gets much more pronounced as you look forward into the Workspace Cloud era, where things are becoming delivered as more a la carte services, if you will, and just giving customers that ability.</p><p>So there's still work to do, because not everything fits cleanly into that definition. And that's why it's ongoing. There are things that we are continuing to look at.</p><p>KARL KEIRSTEAD: So just to be clear, when you talk about portfolio streamlining, are you talking about individual products? Or are you also giving consideration to broader and larger business units, as well? Or is it both?</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: Well, I think it's -- there's a little bit of a tactical and a strategic answer to that. When we talk about it, it's more of a product technology standpoint up; but as you would imagine, from a governance standpoint, we are always thinking about it with the Board on a tops-down basis to really understand the markets and the categories we are in. And so those are conversations that happen on a regular basis.</p><p>KARL KEIRSTEAD: Okay. Thanks for the update.</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: Yes. And I'd say that we talk about streamlining, like, on the conference call, etc., the quarterly call, we really are talking about the technology, the products, etc., and how to actually put them in the right state -- off the SKU list or on the shelf.</p><p>You'll see, for example, there are some of the products that we think are better sold at the cloud service, but we haven't had a vehicle to sell into cloud service. And so they become -- they will become Workspace Cloud services that can be bought kind of all by themselves and will be easier to offer that way than as a premise-based service.</p><p>So I think we have -- so a lot of the work that we have done is to reduce the investment in those products to the point where they are -- we're readying them to be plugged into CWC, to be offered. And what you will see -- I don't know how many of you have AWS or Azure accounts, but if you do, you see there is a constant flow of communications around new services and use cases for existing services.</p><p>So everyone that logs in, and gets a test drive, and gets a <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>ID in Workspace Cloud -- they are going to be a great channel for driving demand on existing services and introducing new services very efficiently as well. So you will see that as well. So it's streamlining, but it's also -- it's streamlined in terms of the number of things, but also to go to market on some of them, as well.</p><p>STEVE ASHLEY, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; COMPANY, INC.: Steve Ashley, Robert Baird. I wanted to go back to the <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>Workspace Cloud. If we look down the road to when a company were to adopt it, if we were to look at the IT administration -- the number of people who today are working to deliver MDM, to deliver XenApp, to deliver all the separate pieces -- once this is all allocated and put together, how does that change? Is there an element of operational efficiency that comes with this story?</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: Yes. It's about 20 to 1. So the testing that was done in the form of screen time -- that's how we have measured it, all right? So the same --</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: Some of the material that got pulled from the notes this morning. (laughter)</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: So think of it that way, Steve, on certainly a XenApp or a XenDesktop basis. So an hour of screen time to do it on Workspace Cloud versus 20 hours of screen time to do it in the traditional way.</p><p>BILL BURLEY: It will also reduce the level of the person who can administer. So it starts to broaden our ability to have more customers taken care of, and then your high-end folks can be doing different things in the company.</p><p>STEVE ASHLEY: Then I just wanted to go back to be installed base of XenApp. And I know you guys are working to get even stronger and more automated tools out there. What is the prospects for getting more powerful tools into the market and helping the customer base migrate? And what is your expectation about the timing of when we might see them be coming over to 7.6?</p><p>BILL BURLEY: As I said earlier, I think we're doing a few things to help that. And some of it are tools, as you said, like our Project Serenity, and then automating it with our lifecycle management technology. I think I said earlier, we've had 36,000 apps already migrated. And then we are able to add what I'll call the automation on top of that.</p><p>So this is before we even got to the recipes or the blueprints. So we have got a combination of these tools, and they're services. So they are not, like, things I have to download, and it's always here -- services I can use to migrate or upgrade. And you combine that with our StoreFront 3 strategy, I could start to layer in multiple versions and move people over at my pace.</p><p>And that was one of the reasons why we extended the 6.5 through 2017. Because now, customers have a way to migrate at their pace in an efficient, predictable way. Sometimes migrations -- you lose predictability when the human element isn't always exact. But now, with the recipes and the blueprints and the migration services, you are going to get a lot more predictable migrations. And then they move at a rate they can consume versus this forklift concept.</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: Just one thing to add, Steve, and that is -- and this sort of ties back to the last question, as well -- is one of those technologies that has been tougher to go to market with in terms of the cost of sale, etc., is this technology we acquired a few years ago called AppDNA. And so tomorrow -- I don't know if you all are going to come to the keynotes tomorrow -- you will hear Juan Rivera, who is on Bill's team, talk about something called AppDisks.</p><p>DAVID HENSHALL: We talked about it earlier.</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: Okay, you did. Good. So there's an example of pulling several technologies together, turning them into a cloud service, and accelerating a customer's ability to move apps to the virtual infrastructure. So I'm particularly excited about what we are doing there. And there's a competitive aspect of that, you know, with VMware, but also there's a big customer aspect in terms of the cost and speed of moving from physical to virtual.</p><p>BILL BURLEY: Then your ability to manage many less images. And so combining AppDNA, which can validate how it should get delivered with AppDisk, which is one desktop image, and be able to insert the apps that matter to the users based upon who they are, is just going to be vastly better and accelerate adoption on that side.</p><p>RAIMO LENSCHOW, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. So we are seeing a lot of product innovation coming out and a lot of change at your organization. If you think about where are you in terms of -- let's do a baseball game -- in terms of innings? In terms of having the right portfolio in place to kind of be able to reaccelerate the growth?</p><p>And then a question for Carlos as well: at the moment -- when you kind of started your job, how much was -- was there a sales issue? And how much was there a product issue? So when you went in there, were you the problem solver? Or is it at the moment predominantly on the product side? Thank you.</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: What inning are we in? It depends on which element you are talking about, I think. From a pure restructuring point of view, we are through the announcements. All the players are on the field, and we just need to play out the rest of the game. That will take the balance of this year. I think we progressionally get better over that period of time.</p><p>In terms of a portfolio of products, I think the portfolio at a high level is in place. I think we have got the capabilities that we need. There's always innovation, integrations, things that we can do to make it better, more integrated, easier to consume, etc. And that's the journey that we will always be on. But in terms of the larger elements and the big pieces, I think we've got -- I think we really have those pieces in place right now.</p><p>CARLOS SARTORIUS: My side? So basically, I think that if you look into what's the difference between the priorities that we had in 2014 to 2015 as the focus, and I think that both on the sales side as well as on the channel side, we're trying to be very, very clear where we want people to focus; what's the strategy; how we want to get it done.</p><p>Because I think that there was a lot of attention paid to a number of other products. We were doing many different things. And what we wanted to do is be very, very clear: this is the strategy. We are going to be focusing on those three specific areas that I showed.</p><p>We want to put the structures behind it so that we are sure we understand what our sales force will do, what the expectations are, right -- how we are going to compensate them at the same time with the channel. And this is why you are seeing the specialization with the channel, all the enablement work that we are doing with the channel.</p><p>So I think it's -- to make sure that we all know strategy, those products, go after it, what's the structure, how we measure success. And then just measure and drive it. That's basically what we are trying to do.</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: Right.</p><p>CARLOS SARTORIUS: And it was a lot of work last year to set it up, and this year it's in place.</p><p>JERRY MAJETICH, ANALYST, DREXEL HAMILTON: Jerry Majetich, Drexel Hamilton. You were talking about global expansion, and the cloud pretty much covers the globe. Are there any countries or regions that may cause problems with regulations or policies and make operations difficult and/or a security concern?</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: Well, let's see. Maybe I can try to take that one. So the answer is -- you know, we are under the same sort of geopolitical environment that everyone that is of any size as an American tech company is, especially in China and in Russia today. We've been, I think, pretty clear about that. I don't think there are security issues there; I just think there are realities to the geopolitics in those countries -- that we have seen our business change. Because, frankly, we -- like in Russia, we've done a fair amount of business with government agencies. Like, big rail system runs on <person><nameText>Citrix.</nameText></person></p><p>So then from a cloud perspective, as we talked about this morning, the control plane doesn't really contain the kind of persistent data that anyone cares about. I mean, that's the only way you can actually make a strategy like that work. And the resource zone is where the persistent data is. Now, so you can basically point Workspace Cloud at any hypervisor, basically, if you saw the list that came up, or cloud -- you know, kind of acknowledged Cloud Platform.</p><p>And so to the degree that in those countries where there are security and IP concerns, or whatever they are, everything can be located on a geographic-specific basis. And we think we are doing the right things to allow the monitoring and measurement, etc., for compliance.</p><p>And that, I think, is a universal issue across all countries. And so I don't think there's anything particularly unique around security in any of these markets. It's more a geopolitical issue, I'd say.</p><p>And there, I think we are, like a lot of companies, trying to figure our way through it. What do we do in Russia? What do we do in China? How long will these things go on? I think we have to assume that this kind of environment is going to go on for a long time. So we are rethinking our partnering and how we do partnering in those countries right now -- assuming that this is going to go on for a while.</p><p>CARLOS SARTORIUS: If I just add -- it's not just those countries. In some other countries where we have implemented mission-critical systems, we have been working very close with the regulatory entities there to ensure that that's the case. And in particular, I mentioned about some examples -- I cannot say the name, who they are; but nationwide, mission-critical systems, either for a Minister of Interior, for public safety, for a number of different uses.</p><p>And we have been able to work with the legislation and with the regulatory entities to actually be able to do it. So I think as long as the architecture, as Mark described, allows them to achieve the way they would like to see the protection of data or the protection or control of the architecture in the system -- I think that we should be all right.</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: I think we have time for one more question.</p><p>SANJIT SINGH, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Sanjit Singh, Morgan Stanley. I wanted to get your thoughts on how you are thinking about the delivery networking business -- NetScaler, maybe the non-NetScaler part of the business? You talked about the three segments: enterprise, telco, and your cloud customers being quite lumpy.</p><p>Do you see the trajectory of growth as something that can accelerate from current levels? It has come down over the last couple of years. Some of that is the market. But if you do see that as at a potential of accelerating from current levels of growth, where in those segments -- enterprise, cloud -- do you expect to gain traction? Is it more from the sales force expansion that you are planning out with the investments? Or is it moving to lower parts of the market? How do you see that trajectory of growth?</p><p>KLAUS OESTERMANN: So I think if you look at -- take cloud service providers. There the plan is to expand the number of bigger providers that we have. So basically get revenue from all bigger partners instead of the current concentration we have.</p><p>On the telco side, it's simply a matter of our market share has been very small in telco. With the Bytemobile products, as I said, we've gotten into a lot of telcos and started getting quite a few projects. And now it's a matter of expanding with those telcos. And again, there's not that many telcos. So again, if we get -- the bigger telcos start really spending more wallet share with us on the ADC front, we will add -- so if you take the cloud and telco providers, the big guys are really big. So basically, adding more and bigger logos is part of the expansion strategy across those two segments.</p><p>For the enterprise space, it's a continued effort on really getting customers to start taking on and standardizing on STX. And there we are in a situation where F5 is the incumbent. And they've trained a lot of people that are running ADCs that they are the standard. They have a special language they like, and so forth.</p><p>So oftentimes that's an economical discussion, where it's like, well, how much money do you want to spend on this? And as you as you see that market or that budget grow for you, wouldn't it be smarter to do it this way? What we're seeing is oftentimes it's a tops-down decision, and then it gets implemented.</p><p>So we believe that in enterprise, there's quite a bit of growth for us in the core, head-on competition. And then when you look at Workspace delivery controllers, we can keep increasing the attach rates with the Workspace solutions. I think with what I talked about with NetScaler universal gateway -- that in and of itself is a pretty big -- if you look at the gateways that's been accumulated over time, per the analysts, that's probably a $400 million, $500 million spend a year. But now we believe there's actually going to be an acceleration, because people will be replacing a lot of products that they might not be betting on. They will be consolidating on fewer. So that market will grow.</p><p>So I think across the board, there's quite a bit of opportunity. And then as Carlos and I have alluded to, we are also looking at specific -- from a geocoverage model, where to expand. And then in the service provider market, where to expand the coverage as well. So plenty of opportunity.</p><p>CARLOS SARTORIUS: Just drive to it -- channel, channel, and more channel. That's one of the big initiatives that we have that we discussed yesterday with our partners is to really drive a lot of the networking business through our CSAs and distribution. Because we believe we have a great opportunity. We have put in place the specialization plus certain incentives for them to really drive it. And we believe that they will see that it's very interesting, and they will help us grow it.</p><p>MARK TEMPLETON: So I think we're out of time right now. But before we wrap up, I just want to say, again, on behalf of the Company, thank you very much for participating in this event today. Thanks for coming to Orlando for <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>Synergy 2015. Special thanks to everyone who stuck with us on the webcast for the last five hours or so.</p><p>As I said a little bit earlier today, there's a lot going on in the organization right now. We are optimizing; we're streamlining; we're focusing. We are also innovating at the same time. And we're balancing those two main objectives pretty efficiently.</p><p>So we are working our way through the amount of churn in the organization right now. We feel pretty good about all the decisions we have made, and we are focused on execution from here on out. A lot of exciting news. Hopefully, those of you that are here in person, you spend the time -- go down to the exhibit floor. Talk to partners. Talk to customers. Talk to other employees. And just give you a much broader context into <person><nameText>Citrix </nameText></person>the business and how we are focused going forward.

This is definitely -- sometimes you save the best for last. And we're -- this is going to be a fireside chat, and it's just something different here. But it's going to be a fireside chat. So Eduardo and I will sit up here and we'll talk about Citrix and how it's been evolving and how its markets have evolved. And we'll certainly open up to questions. And so be prepared in -- for the last 10 minutes or so, we'll open it up for Q&amp;A.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p>JOHN STEPHEN DIFUCCI: So Eduardo, the first question I have -- and as you know, Synergy just happened 2 days ago. And the Analyst Day was in Anaheim, right? And Zach from my team was there, and Zach, we just had -- we had somebody reporting again tonight right now throughout -- so he's working on that. But Zach came -- he called me from there and we put out a note and then he said, \"Something seems a little different this year.\" One of the things is it, it's just logical what Citrix is saying this year, is they're bringing the products together, now they fit together. So Eduardo, I'll let you expand on that. We wrote a note on it, and you can see the note. But just sort of it would have sort of a summary of what Citrix is doing right now. And it's not happening right now, but your approach to the market or maybe the approach that's happening.</p><p>EDUARDO FLEITES, VP OF IR, CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.: Good afternoon. So Synergy is our partner, our annual partner conference. And this year we had it in Anaheim. Normally, we have our Analyst Day on the first day of our Synergy conference, which actually ends today. It's a 3-day event. So we have our Analyst Day usually at the conference because part of the issue is, don't listen to what we have to say directly, listen to what the customers are saying and do the demos, et cetera. So one of the biggest difference between this year's Synergy and previous 3, 4, almost every other Synergy, probably is that Synergy, historically, were a lot more visionary in terms of talking about what we will be building over the next 5 years. And we've always been great on vision and probably a bit slow on execution, if we had a fault. What's interesting about this year's Synergy is that everything we've been talking about for the past 4 or 5 years is already being sold today, or some of the features will be out over the next 60, 90 days. So the headwind on Citrix over the past few years is simply we've played in the virtual plain compute market. That market's growing in the low to mid-single digits. And again, it was always mostly a legacy app delivery type of conversation which is always hard because it's not a very fast-growing market, and the apps were moving in a different direction. Well, what we announced over the past 2 days is that everything we have done historically in terms of delivery, securely delivering legacy applications in terms of policies, whatnot, we're actually now doing it also for its assets. So now the conversation is not only about old, but how can we support a customer who still has plenty of old legacy applications that are expensive to rewrite but allowing for a user to sign on directly to all their apps, through the Workspace app, but at the same time, IT could not run policies across, not only the legacy apps but SaaS-based apps. And to give you an example, imagine a user, being Concur, Workday and Salesforce, and historically, you have to probably get every single SaaS app to create policies in terms of what type of employee from where, what location, which device can do download and not download or open certain information or whatnot. You can now actually put policies across all SaaS apps uniformly to save a lot time from an IT perspective. It can create watermarks in certain documents. There's been vendors who can do some of this, but then you'd been dealing with so many different vendors and you still have your legacy install base to deal with. So as of Tuesday, we officially do it for all apps. So the days of only talking about the past are all ended. And frankly, it's a much bigger TAM, it's a faster-growing TAM, and we are still -- we have a nice moat with our installed base and just we're talking basically based on about $100 a day -- a year per user. So just getting our installed base, a decent chunk of our install base, to get there it's a massive opportunity for Citrix. So basically, that's what we've been announcing over the past few days. We've looked at our website. We have the Analyst Day webcast and all the press releases regarding these products.</p><p>JOHN STEPHEN DIFUCCI: I guess the question coming up with -- in my mind, anyway, on your description, I'm trying to think of the application of the technology you're talking about. And previously, as you said, the number one use case was, hey, listen we have this legacy. When I say legacy, it doesn't mean mainframe. It means legacy client/server app like FileNet, something like that. And like an example that I knew of was the New York State lottery and filed it as a server-based technology. One person would have to access the app, and they wanted the whole department to access it. So they use Citrix to do that. That's the primary use case of Citrix. You all have probably used it as remote access, but really that's the prior use case. So now...</p><p>EDUARDO FLEITES: I noticed number one is Chromebook, which you all use, that's all being delivered by -- produced on Citrix.</p><p>JOHN STEPHEN DIFUCCI: But now you're saying, okay, we're going to expand that and you can use it for everything. But I guess my -- a question that comes in my mind is why would I even -- why would I need to do that? Like why do I -- like -- for a SaaS app, I just access the Internet and I connect to the Internet and I can connect to whatever -- Salesforce.com or whatever that is.</p><p>EDUARDO FLEITES: Yes. That's the problem because now IT doesn't know what you're doing. We have all -- you probably have regulatory issues, whether it's a SaaS app or not a SaaS app, okay? So the issue is about securing, controlling regulations -- that seems to be the equation -- we've always done but Citrix -- the conversations already -- probably are in remote access. The reality is, yes, that's what we do but it has to comply with all the innovations out there. So the issue is, do you want an employee who is disgruntled download all the files from Salesforce without you knowing, number one? In some cases, that's going to become a privacy issue, especially in Europe nowadays. So how are you addressing all those use cases?</p><p>JOHN STEPHEN DIFUCCI: Okay. That makes sense, and that also makes sense why you probably won't want to do any more dinners with the kids eventually. Actually just real quickly too, I was -- I remember after September 11, my employer at the time was certainly dislocated and everybody was remotely working or even we were working from other offices. But we're using VPN technology, and we went from one VPN to another. And then finally, we said, let's just go to Citrix because they actually provide better security than the VPN we were using, and it gives us more flexibility, and that's what we did. So that makes a ton of sense to me. Okay. That sounds really interesting. Sticking with sort of the Workspace Services world, and it's something I always ask you because we had a call on Citrix a while ago when the world brought the vision, which about desktop virtualization, which is going to be this huge market. It's certainly a market. It just probably didn't evolve to what people thought it would at that time. And the reason why we didn't think it would is not because it didn't make sense. It does make sense. But because the world just wasn't ready for it. We were like, listen, it's just too hard to do, and once you do it, the experience isn't that great for the users. So it's probably not going to see the kind of broad deployment that some people expected. And that sort of seems like what happened. The rules changed, right? So networking technology is, number one, cheaper and better; and storage technology is, number one, cheaper and better; and those are 2 of the things that were issues. And I just wonder I'd love to make the other call too. And you know what, this market is going to take off now because the world's ready for it and Citrix is -- there's more competition than it used to be, but you're still a leader, if not the leader. So I guess, how do you think about that market? I think it's smart not to, like, talk about it because that would turn investors off because we'll read their memories, but I still wonder on that. Like I don't want to miss that.</p><p>EDUARDO FLEITES: It's interesting, and obviously, I love to joke that when you look at industry analyst reports, when talking about the companies that have been in business 5 years or greater, talking about the size of the market, and they're pretty spot on in terms of the 3-, 4-, 5-year growth rates. When it's something totally new, they tend to be totally off. Desktop was one, and the mobility one was the other one that was going to be a massive market in 5 years. And then you look historically, nothing has sort of grown that quickly. So I just get very cynical with age, I guess. The desktop thing was interesting. It was great because everybody was bringing their iPads. You had all these tablets coming out, iPhones, Android devices. And then how do you use your legacy apps, opening it up and get your full desktop, it's great. So we started playing with it internally, and then you realize your finger is too big to do a full desktop on these devices. The reality is you just want to open up one app at a time, just like you do now with iTunes whatnot, and you do your work, close it, open up another app. The reality within desktop at Citrix, when I open it up, it depends how you configure it. The way we configure internally at Citrix is you can look at it -- do you want to look at your favorite apps or do you want to look at it the full desktop. Obviously, when I open up certain devices, I look at the apps. And then when I have my full desktop, I just open a full desktop. Unfortunately, not everybody would configure XenDesktop that way. So then they're like, I'm getting a full XenDesktop on my iPhone. It's crazy. It doesn't work. Can you read it, right? And to think, finally, it was so expensive in terms of the storage standpoint, client devices. You still didn't even have $80 dollars in clients back then. Storage was still very expensive. So the conversation was only with a CCO, which is not the greatest conversation you want to have when you sell. As all those devices started coming down, a lot of people started writing different types of applications, SaaS apps. So that kind of convoluted the conversation as well. We started growing a little faster. However, the conversation is moving to non-legacy type of applications. So well, basically, we were going -- we were missing probably a year or 2 years behind the curve. The market finally caught up to where we want it to be. Our technology finally caught up where we want it to be in terms of SaaS apps, et cetera. And even analytics, like one of the plays obviously has to be -- we've always had security features in products with Citrix, but we're not -- we don't call ourselves a security -- we're not a network security company, but we were one of the largest SWPM in terms of sales and Android units for many, many years. We've bundled it with our networking so we never sold it separately anymore. We've always set out firewalls. So in that area, we're always pretty invested from an R&amp;D perspective. The one piece that we have now with analytics is with all these workloads and all these touch points you have which are filed -- and actually you have that in mobile, and all that flows through and [that's gave a ready feed,] and now we have an SD-WAN, and with that access, we look at the traffic management. We have a ton of information to do analytics, and to give you one example, are we necessarily a pure-play private security company? No. But -- so let me give you an example, with the new products that we have with the Workspace app, you can actually tell -- so if you put policies across, say, Concur, Workday and Salesforce, whatever, you know somebody used Concur to do their work, travel, and they're supposed to be here at the Jefferies conference. Yet you figured that somebody is logging in from the Miami office. Well, I'm supposed to be here, who's using my name to log in? Right there, you can do it. You're putting policies across several SaaS apps, use the information and look at how do I log in all the time, what do I use, what files do I download, and then you can realize whether, hey, should I look into this person or not -- there's something weird, did they lose their phone or whatnot? So this is -- all that data flows to Citrix. And by the way, it's encrypted by Citrix, so we can actually look into the encryption to see what's happened. So there is a security play, an analytics play that can be used in many, many different ways. And now if you can do it for all SaaS and legacies, that's a lot of information we can use, or the company will use on the other hand.</p><p>JOHN STEPHEN DIFUCCI: Okay. That's interesting. That's actually really interesting. I'm going to ask one more and then I'm going to open it up to the audience. And I'm going to now go to NetScaler, the networking business. That performed really well from late 2015 and most of 2016. And then it didn't perform as well, and it's been evolved for business and primarily because there's -- some of the large Internet companies that you sell to and were made by it. I guess should we start to think of that any differently going forward? Is there any way to smooth that business out? Or is that just it is what it is, and that's what we live with or you live with?</p><p>EDUARDO FLEITES: I live with the questions. There is a way of smoothing it out, and the way to smooth it out is to make the enterprise a bigger chunk of it. The SSD is probably where they are and they tend to buy about a little about a few million every quarter. They'll buy $40 million in one quarter a year. Last year, it didn't happen. They -- one of them might be -- some of them overbought the last Q4 prior, and they're building up. They use -- probably used capacity and they buy again. What we did do 2 years ago is we hired another 60, 70 salespeople focusing on the enterprise of the business. And that keeps the business growing materially. Last year, and even in Q1, it grew at 20% in terms of bookings year-over-year. Now the SSPPs (sic) [SSP], the large onetime buyers, also grew 20% in Q1 but it's very lumpy. Now I would argue it almost derisked the year because it happened in Q1 instead of Q4 this year. So it's not something -- now you have to wait to see what happens. But yes, our Q2 is always very lumpy because of that percentage. Now the SSP lumpy piece of the business of NetScaler ADC is usually about 30% of bookings. So what we're really talking about is 30%. The other 70% is growing just as fast and becoming a bigger piece. So while it'll still be lumpy, it is becoming less lumpy as our enterprise business grow. Now we also have NetScaler SD-WAN. We have NetScaler Analytics. Though there's a lot of our networking products now, the focus is still ADC. What's interesting in the ADC front is that we are -- on the enterprise side, we also have a new model on selling, which is a full capacity model. So basically, even though some of -- we do have a pure software version only, but the one that comes in appliance, you can pick the appliance and then you take per usage capacity and you still have the software piece. So if you have multiple data centers, you're only paying on the capacity since you cost from data centers. So it's almost like we're also selling the subscription version of NetScaler now. We can create some headwinds in terms of recognized revenue as well.</p><p>JOHN STEPHEN DIFUCCI: That's in appliance form.</p><p>EDUARDO FLEITES: It's -- we have a pure software, but there's also -- yes, there's a download for that, but it's appliance form.</p><p>JOHN STEPHEN DIFUCCI: Because most people would have a hard time getting there with an appliance. Okay. And how's the adoption of customers? You've said about how much of that business is...</p><p>EDUARDO FLEITES: We had 2 very large deals last year, and because of those deals, we realize that there's a demand for it. So really only one quarter this year but there are very large customers who are buying. So they're not small deals, they're $100 million deals.</p><p>JOHN STEPHEN DIFUCCI: So are these the Internet service providers?</p><p>EDUARDO FLEITES: No. These are other big tech companies.</p><p>JOHN STEPHEN DIFUCCI: Okay, interesting. Any questions from the audience? Okay.</p><p>EDUARDO FLEITES: That's what happens when you have the last meeting.</p><p>JOHN STEPHEN DIFUCCI: I have 2 more. So Citrix has seen a lot of change in the last couple of years, and you guys have an (inaudible) investor involved. And some of -- the stocks done pretty well. And some of it was probably things that needed to be done at the company as far as more tactical things. But when we start to think from here, because it seems like there's less of, I'll call it, cleanup stuff that needs to get done at Citrix at this point, from here, I'm just curious as -- how do I ask a question about -- what else can be done? Is there anything else that can be done, just the issue with dividend? These are really interesting too. Can you talk a little bit about that? Those -- are there any other things that can be done to return value to shareholders other than just growing the business?</p><p>EDUARDO FLEITES: So we've had several instructions over the past 2 years. You want to go back to the history of Citrix? It was a one-product company. Everybody said, you have one product. A large software company is going to take you out because they're going to sell that product and you're going to disappear. I still sometimes get that question, but we (inaudible) to an M&amp;A. We brought in an M&amp;A team and they built an amazing portfolio. They went a little overboard on building this massive portfolio of which certain products and businesses were not growing. So basically, we cleaned the portfolio, focused only on what's really focusing on the strategy, which is delivery apps and data security. We flattened the R&amp;D organization as well and engineering and the product side in terms of longer systems but actually you're building a full solution. We finalized most of the integration of the entire portfolio this week, in the announcements we made. So basically now, our R&amp;D investment is getting a lot more output on newer things versus supporting old platforms. The -- and now we're doing the final transition to a subscription model of our legacy to a more hybrid and cloud type of model, which brings more multi-tenancy, which again lowering the cost of R&amp;D, and it just continues to accelerate. There is still room and needs attention, things from R&amp;D. There's going to be more room from sales and marketing as well. Think of it in terms of we're still selling some of the old and new. In 2, 3, years, maybe you can start culling some of the tech support in the old platforms. And as you start getting more scale on the cloud, it becomes more of a repetitive sales motion, not necessarily an expensive sales motion. So I still think we have room to go in terms of efficiency. And it just depends from the time of the transition to a subscription model.</p><p>JOHN STEPHEN DIFUCCI: Okay. Because this year, I believe, your guidance is for flat margins for 2018. But at the same time, the guidance is -- and I don't know if it's very specific, but it's moved to more subscription, which will have a suppressive effect on...</p><p>EDUARDO FLEITES: Correct. What we're seeing is this year is -- and maybe into Q1 next year, is a headwind of the new subscriptions. So for all those who don't know, basically, if you get a perpetual deal and now you're selling a subscription, there's a 2.5-year breakeven. So you now have a headwind from a revenue perspective. Gross margins, you might have a headwind of 50 to 100 bps because you're supporting now both the old and the new. And as you scale, and obviously, you more than make up the difference on the OpEx side.</p><p>JOHN STEPHEN DIFUCCI: Okay. Any questions in the audience? Okay. You mentioned some earnings proficiencies and you mentioned R&amp;D, that sales and marketing is the area that, I think, was where the most churn was at one time. And Citrix is also very channel focused, sales and marketing go-to market. Can you talk a little bit about that? Because there always seems to me, anyway, that you were paying a channel and paying the salespeople as if they weren't working with the channel? So -- and is that kind of at the -- from a high level, is that kind of what you fixed? Because it's improved tremendously, but -- and where would those -- where would the room be beyond that?</p><p>EDUARDO FLEITES: So yes, we're mostly indirect channel reseller type of motion supported by sales engineers. And then we have our direct in certain market segments and certain customers. The biggest chunk was actually -- since it's a general sales force, they're selling 25, 30 products but really only 6 matters. So that sort of productivity, and that was one of the biggest gainers in terms of going from high 30s of the percentage of sales or the marketing now to low to mid-30s. As you move to more subscription, it becomes more of an automated motion. There's still savings there. There will have to be, I'm sure, an evolution on our partner front. We already have many that are focused to become more MSPs, selling the CSP type of motion, so managed service providers to add more value to customers. We have other flattening-type resellers who are learning how to move customers up to the cloud and manage the cloud for them. But over time, yes, the traditional reseller motion is going to have to change because less value means lower commission checks. So there's still room there as you go through this transition. This is a multi-year issue here. You're not going to -- there's still an uplift that we need, specialization to move people up to the cloud. But once we -- or once you start adding, I mean, I need 10 more people licensed, it's actually be something that should be easily transacted on our website.</p><p>JOHN STEPHEN DIFUCCI: Okay.

Following similar announcements by Ryanair and British Airways, the low-cost airline on Thursday said it would shortly launch a consultation to reduce staff numbers by up to 30 per cent. Last year it employed 15,000 people. </p><p>The aviation industry has been adjusting to what looks like a slow recovery in passenger traffic. EasyJet said on Thursday that, in line with projections from the International Air Transport Association (Iata), it didn\u2019t expect 2019 levels of demand to return until 2023 and would operate a smaller fleet to reflect that. </p><p>Travel companies\u2019 shares have rallied sharply in recent days after signs lockdowns were lifting and travel restrictions eased. EasyJet said on Thursday that between July and September, it plans to operate at around 30 per cent capacity compared to the same time last year. Its first flights resume on June 15 on mainly domestic UK and French routes. So far, booking trends on resumed flights had been encouraging, it added. </p><p>Briefly</p><p>On Wednesday, our <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2577785f-5bc5-4012-b132-5ff3a8c0bab4\"> colleagues on Lex</url> warned about fast fashion outlet <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boohoo</emphasis> that \u201cany overpriced buyout of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PrettyLittleThing</emphasis> [a brand it part-owns, run by the Boohoo co-founder\u2019s son] would now attract loud criticism\u201d. On Thursday, Boohoo has announced it is buying out the minority shareholders, for a price of up to \u00a3324m. It follows a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b29e0766-19b8-431e-a40c-375170460e83\"> short-seller report</url> on Boohoo that centred on the PLT stake, published earlier this week. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cineworld </emphasis>has secured agreement from its lenders to amend the covenants on its credit facility to give it extra headroom, as well as securing another $110m in liquidity through an increase in its revolving credit facility. The changes should give it enough headroom to cope even if cinemas remain closed to the end of the year, Cineworld said \u2014 but if everything goes to plan, all its cinemas should reopen in July. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daily Mail and General Trust </emphasis>said revenues had fallen by an underlying 23 per cent in April, and the group had made a small adjusted operating loss of \u00a33m in the month. The consumer media, UK property information and events and exhibitions businesses have been particularly hard hit, though other units still continue to deliver growth. </p><p>On Wednesday <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IWG</emphasis>, the serviced office group formerly known as Regus, announced a placing and retail offer to raise \u00a3320m.

The lay-offs, which will start this week, will be a mixture of voluntary and involuntary departures and will include operations in Australia, New Zealand and Canada as well as its home US market. In a memo to staff David Calhoun, chief executive, said a reduction in the number of orders from its airline customers meant \u201cfewer jobs on our lines and in our offices\u201d were needed. He did say, though, that there were some \u201cgreen shoots\u201d for the aircraft maker, with customers reporting more bookings than cancellations over the US holiday weekend.</p><p>Big technology companies are hunting for deals at their fastest pace in years, racking up acquisitions and strategic investments despite increased regulatory scrutiny during the coronavirus-led market turmoil. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> have announced 19 deals this year, according to Refinitiv data from May 26, representing the fastest pace of acquisitions to this date since 2015. \u201cThis crisis threatens to further entrench the power of Big Tech,\u201d said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director at the Open Markets Institute, a think-tank that studies corporate concentration. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04a62a26-42aa-4ad9-839e-05d762466fbe\"> Read more</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bill Ackman</emphasis> has sold his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9340161e-3fbd-4eeb-8876-c730d95a4e20\"> $1bn stake in Berkshire Hathaway</url>, the sprawling conglomerate controlled by legendary investor Warren Buffett. \u201cWe can be much more nimble\u201d, Mr Ackman told investors in his Pershing Square hedge fund on Wednesday.

But <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wm Morrison</emphasis> is the latest to underline the costs in doing so. While like-for-like sales excluding fuel and VAT were 8.7 per cent higher year-on-year during the six months to the start of August, profits fell 28 per cent to \u00a3145m. </p><p>Covid-19 added \u00a3155m in costs for Morrisons as the grocer recruited 45,000 new staff and ramped up its online offering. Some of those extra expenses \u2014 \u00a393m \u2014 were offset by the business rates holiday, though. Higher sales had also been biased towards online sales and lower margin products, the company said, while plunging fuel sales during lockdown and caf\u00e9 closures meant revenues fell 1 per cent overall.</p><p>Morrison\u2019s raised its interim dividend payout despite the profit decline: up 5.7 per cent, though the decision on a special dividend remains deferred. </p><p>Briefly</p><p>Insurance market <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lloyd\u2019s of London</emphasis> said it expected to pay out up to \u00a35bn in Covid-19 claims.

The claims pushed the group to a \u00a3400m loss. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IAG </emphasis>formally launches its \u20ac2.7bn rights issue on Thursday, and discloses some more detail about recent trading. There was a surge in bookings during June, the British Airways parent said, but those had levelled off since. Like other airlines, IAG has trimmed the amount it expects to fly for the rest of the year as a result of the lower than anticipated demand \u2014 and said that it is now planning to fly less than previously thought next year too. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Saga</emphasis>, the cruise company-cum-insurer, also launches its expected cash call on Thursday alongside a strategy update and half-year results. Roger De Haan, part of the Saga founding family, is investing \u00a3100m of the \u00a3150m equity raise. The fundraising should reduce leverage and improve the group\u2019s resilience.

And while their work represents the largest intentional demolition in New York City's history, it has come to signify much more than that.<br/>City officials have hailed the replacement of the more than 60-year-old tower with a new glass and steel headquarters for the banking giant as the culmination of years-long planning. And preservationists have condemned it as the wasteful destruction of a recently renovated building.</p><p><br/>\u00a0<br/>Now, in the wake of a devastating pandemic, the former Union Carbide building is also a symbol of mounting uncertainty.<br/>\"Way back when, I thought Midtown East was a great model. [Now] I think of 270 Park, and JPMorgan Chase tearing down that building for something even larger, when a lot of their people are going to be working from home.\"<br/>Peg Breen, Landmarks Conservancy\u00a0<br/>The spread of coronavirus has pushed companies, including Twitter and Facebook, to rethink their physical office footprints and consider letting employees work remotely long-term. JPMorgan has even floated having employees rotate working from home after the pandemic subsides.<br/>\u00a0<br/>At the same time, the bank is moving forward with its plans to build a new 2.5 million- square-foot headquarters on Park Avenue, which is more than 1 million square feet larger than its existing tower and is intended to accommodate up to 15,000 employees.<br/>And the massive project is part of an even larger goal: The surrounding neighborhood was rezoned in 2017 with the explicit aim to create 6.5 million square feet of new class A office space over the next two decades.<br/>\"Way back when, I thought Midtown East was a great model,\" said Peg Breen, president of the Landmarks Conservancy. \"[Now] I think of 270 Park, and JPMorgan Chase tearing down that building for something even larger, when a lot of their people are going to be working from home.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>Several monumental events of the past three months - from the global health crisis and strict shutdown orders to forecasts of a long-term economic fallout - have raised questions about the future of office markets across the country. Of course, landlords, developers and their brokers remain optimistic that tenants' retreat from physical office space will be short-lived, that the lure of company culture and visible brand identity will ultimately win out.<br/>But the pandemic, which underscores the innate risk in relying on specific asset classes and tenant types to transform a neighborhood, could reshape how cities work to encourage new development in the future.<br/>\"This is a situation where we can't afford the regulations to lag behind the market,\" said Mitch Korbey, who chairs the law firm Herrick Feinstein's land use and zoning group.\"We need to be sure that as we come out of this crisis, we're aggressive and creative.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>Density dilemmas?<br/>On paper, the rezoning of Midtown East could be seen as disastrous - if read solely in the context of the pandemic. The zoning change banked on demand for massive new office towers, with proximity to Grand Central Terminal serving as a main selling point.<br/>But some believe the ongoing spread of coronavirus, which has started to subside in recent weeks, will have few long-term impacts on development in the district.<br/>\"The goals of the rezoning are still spot on,\" said Dan Garodnick, the former New York City Council member who shepherded the district's rezoning through the land use review process.\"People are social animals, and I expect there will still be demand for commercial space. But perhaps with slightly different design parameters to accommodate the moment.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>The rezoning incentivized tearing down the neighborhood's aging office stock, while also requiring improvements to nearby infrastructure and the creation of more public space. The city projected that the creation of 6.5 million square feet of new office stock would take two decades to come to fruition.<br/>That timeline could play in the neighborhood's favor.<br/>Former Department of City Planning chief Carl Weisbrod said New York's office market may be in a fluid state for the next year to year-and-a-half. \"In the short run, there's going to be a hiccup for sure,\" he said.<br/>But Weisbrod, who's now a senior advisor at the real estate and economic development consulting firm HR&amp;A, added that the city has historically recovered from crises \"surprisingly well and in new directions that we haven't anticipated.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>He said he also thinks Midtown East is especially well positioned. Within less than a year of the rezoning, JPMorgan announced that it would tear down its headquarters. The bank received approval in late May to demolish down to the 41st floor of the building, according to the DOB.<br/>At least three other massive office projects, including developer Harry Macklowe's planned 1,556-foot-tall skyscraper at 5 East 51st Street, have been announced since. Macklowe didn't return requests for comment on the project.<br/>RXR Realty, which is planning a $3 billion office tower near Grand Central with TF Cornerstone and MSD Capital, has continued discussions that started before the pandemic with tenants in the technology and finance sectors who are interested in anchoring the property, CEO Scott Rechler said. The project isn't expected to be delivered until 2026.<br/>Still, until there's a vaccine for Covid-19, many employees will continue to avoid mass transit and employers may not be eager to upgrade to larger spaces when they can only operate at 50 percent capacity.<br/>In the short term, as construction sites begin to reopen, owners of projects that haven't started or were early stages of development will have to carefully consider if and when they can restart work, said Linda Foggie, senior vice president and head of Turner &amp; Townsends' New York office.<br/>But longer-term, the crisis could change how developers and planners think about density. Tenants will likely need more office space per employee, reversing the trend of cramming workers per every 125 square foot, Rechler said. For larger, well-funded companies that could mean a bigger footprint, with some employees working remotely. For less-established businesses, it could translate to a smaller workforce.<br/>More than ever, planners should be thinking about how to build out other regions with access to mass transit, Rechler said.<br/>\"We need to densify where density belongs,\" he said. \"Sprawling is not the outcome you want to have.\"<br/>By design<br/>\"I feel even more strongly that that is a flaw in the Midtown East rezoning, and it's one we should revisit. Midtown East should adopt the goal of creating a truly mixed-use neighborhood.\"<br/>Mary Ann Tighe, CBRE\u00a0<br/>Long Island City and Downtown Brooklyn were rezoned to spur commercial development, but instead resulted in condo towers that far outnumbered new office space. Midtown East already has the built-in infrastructure and surrounding residential communities to accommodate office growth, Weisbrod noted.<br/>\"Could growth be delayed somewhat because of what has happened over the past three months? Yes, I think that's a real possibility,\" he said. \"But I think the fundamentals are very strong.\"<br/>Mary Ann Tighe, CEO of CBRE's New York tri-state region, said she doesn't believe there's any danger of office development in Midtown East outpacing demand. She argued that tenants will likely favor new office buildings post-Covid due, in part, to large open floor-plates and better air quality.<br/>But the pandemic highlights the rezoning's singular focus on office use. Tighe said air rights in the district should be made available for some residential space.<br/>\"I feel even more strongly that that is a flaw in the Midtown East rezoning, and it's one we should revisit,\" she said. \"Midtown East should adopt the goal of creating a truly mixed-use neighborhood.\"<br/>Outside Manhattan, Korbey said, the pandemic has emphasized the need for more mixed-use development, specifically more flexibility in zoning regulations in residential districts in the outer boroughs to allow for other uses.<br/>Former Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen argued a similar point and said the city needs to focus more on building out a five-borough economy, through actions like the rezoning of Gowanus in Brooklyn. \"These are long-term plans that require consistent political leadership and being responsive to what's happening on the ground,\" Glen said during a recent video panel hosted by The Real Deal.<br/>\"Stopping spending on housing or schools or not moving forward with things like Sunnyside Yards would be incredibly irresponsible in respect to a long-term plan for recovery,\" she added.<br/>Breen said she'd like to see some of the existing, older office buildings in Midtown East repurposed for housing and other uses.<br/>\"I know they wanted it to be a business district, but look at Lower Manhattan,\" Breen said. \"There's plenty of business, but there's also plenty of residential. Nobody could've seen that happening.\"<br/>Forever bullish<br/>Plans to transform a neighborhood often hinge on the arrival of powerful brands.<br/>Amazon's planned headquarters in Long Island City, though ultimately abandoned, set off a year's worth of speculation over how a single company could dramatically alter housing, transportation and demand for commercial space.<br/>Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco attracted other tech companies and inspired residential development in an otherwise vacant and blighted area. Cond\u00e9 Nast's move to One World Trade Center in 2011 is considered the catalyst for a wave of so-called TAMI (technology, advertising, media and information) tenants migrating to Lower Manhattan - previously considered the exclusive domain of financial firms.<br/>So, when Big Tech companies announce dramatic changes in their office plans, it sends shockwaves through the commercial real estate industry. Though commercial landlords and brokers have dismissed the idea that such announcements pose an existential threat to physical office space, many acknowledge that more businesses are warming up to allowing their employees to work from home part-time.<br/>\"I think people will work differently,\" Rechler said. \"This becomes more likely a scenario where people know that they can use technology.\"<br/>Ultimately, though, he and others believe most professionals will still want some face time in the office, giving companies a reason to keep their space. Recent leasing activity also shows promise for the office market once the pandemic subsides.<br/>Late last month, TikTok committed to taking more than 230,000 square feet in the Durst Organization's One Five One tower in Times Square. Facebook also still seems poised to lease 740,000 square feet at the renovated Farley Post Office. Downtown Alliance President Jessica Lappin said she was encouraged by the news that Uber affirmed last month that it still planned to move into 3 World Trade Center, despite company layoffs and office closures throughout the country.<br/>\"I don't think people will want to work permanently from home,\" she said. \"Setting aside productivity, it's hard to build culture, it's hard to build teams if no one meets in person.\"<br/>Downtown Brooklyn could see an uptick in interest, as company's look to shorten commutes for their employees, said Ted Koltis, president of Colliers International's eastern region. But he views the push to work from home a temporary feature of the city's office market.<br/>\"Companies chose to be there because the brand of the company is tied so strongly to where they are,\" he said. \"If they don't have a physical office footprint, there is something lost.\"<br/>Ariel Property Advisors' Howard Raber said an important thing to watch will be rent rates: If office rents drop in Manhattan, that could negatively impact demand in the outboroughs. Lower rents in Brooklyn and other areas outside have been a major draw for businesses opting out of Manhattan.<br/>Investment in housing and economic development over the next fews years will be crucial, Dan Doctoroff, CEO of Sidewalk Labs, told TRD this month.<br/>\"I'm pretty optimistic, assuming we don't blow it over the next several years, and do not make these investments, watch people leave because the quality of life declines, and we don't give people confidence in the future, and then we're in bad shape,\" he said.<br/>\"The risk is over the next several years where we've got to inspire confidence in the future of this city, and we've got to retain people to the extent that we can,\" Doctoroff added.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDREN-M1101215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDREN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605J-DJY1-DYDW-73YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428655</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2069\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Real Estate News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6244\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 19, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002FAH</classCode><className>BANK OF THE OZARKS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Even more challenging, they also take on thorny issues that executives elsewhere tend to avoid, like economic disparities and racial discrimination.</p><p>Think of it as The Establishment 2.0: more diverse than the nearly all-white and male establishment of old, to be sure, but every bit as powerful, and just as invisible when need be.</p><p>''Itasca operates behind the scenes,'' said Tim Welsh, a senior partner at the consulting firm McKinsey&amp; Company, which hosts the weekly breakfasts at its offices in the IDS Center here. ''We all know each other, but we are clearly not recognized as the people of Itasca.''</p><p>Itasca's impact is very real, however. And its consensus-oriented approach offers an alternative path at a time when politics nationally - and in many state capitols - seems hopelessly divided along partisan lines.</p><p>While Itasca would just as soon stay out of the limelight, the levers of power in the Twin Cities are within easy reach. The guest list for the weekly breakfasts downtown includes the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, as well as local legislators, school superintendents and university officials.</p><p>So when a proposal to raise the gasoline tax in 2008 to help rebuild roads and transit systems was vetoed by the Republican governor at the time, Tim Pawlenty, phone calls from Itasca's business leaders helped persuade enough Republican legislators to cross the aisle and override the veto.</p><p>More recently, pressure from Itasca helped secure increased funding for Minnesota's college and university system. Itasca also spearheaded the creation of a new regional agency to attract companies looking to move or expand, as well as an effort to encourage procurement chiefs at local giants like Target and Xcel Energy to buy more goods and services locally.</p><p>Itasca's work is among the reasons that the Twin Cities region has emerged as an economic powerhouse. At 2.9 percent, the metropolitan area's unemployment rate is well below the national level of 5 percent.</p><p>At the same time, Minnesota has excelled in creating the kinds of higher-paid, knowledge- and skills-based jobs that provide entree into the middle class today. With that in mind, Itasca has drawn interest from leaders in American cities and abroad who would like to emulate its success.</p><p>That will not be easy. Part of what makes Itasca work is also what has helped Minnesota prosper: a long history of progressive and engaged business leaders, a largely homogeneous population with a low poverty rate and a consensus-driven Midwestern culture where egos are checked at the door, or at least not displayed too openly.</p><p>''Sometimes it doesn't serve anybody to take credit,'' said Jennifer Ford Reedy, president of the Bush Foundation, a major philanthropy here, and a former McKinsey consultant who advised the Itasca group. ''The people who need to know what Itasca is doing are the participants. That's it.''</p><p>In fact, Itasca has no building, budget or full-time staff, other than two McKinsey consultants who coordinate research and logistics for Itasca members.</p><p>Business establishments, of course, are hardly unique to Minnesota. Most big cities - and many smaller towns - have chambers of commerce, not to mention economic development offices and the like.</p><p>What makes Itasca unique, participants say, is a commitment to hard data and McKinsey-style analysis, as well as a willingness to depart from the script that drives many private sector lobbies.</p><p>''We're not just asking for lower taxes and less regulation,'' said David Mortenson, the current chairman of the Itasca Project. ''If we're taking on education or income disparity as a group of business leaders, we want to be able to break some eggs.''</p><p>That's different from what happens in most other cities, said Mr. Mortenson, who this year took over M.A. Mortenson, a nationwide construction firm founded by his grandfather.</p><p>In Seattle, where Mr. Mortenson lived for nine years before moving back to Minneapolis in 2012, ''most of the big tech companies viewed the city as a convenient location to house some of its workers,'' he said. ''They didn't engage unless it affected their business.''</p><p>''Tech leaders are very philanthropic,'' he added, ''but they disconnect it from their business.''</p><p>That has never been a problem here: The Pillsbury family and other members of the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce helped pay for the construction of the railroad to move grain and flour in the 1800s. And the current governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton, is a scion of the family that founded the Dayton Dry Goods Company, which grew into a retail giant and more recently morphed into Target Corporation.</p><p>But by the beginning of the 21st century, that paternalistic, locally minded model of capitalism was fading, said James R. Campbell, a local banker who served in top positions at Norwest Banks and Wells Fargo before retiring in 2002.</p><p>In 2001, Target rebranded the iconic Dayton's store downtown as Marshall Field's, the Chicago chain it had acquired in 1990. (Marshall Field's was later sold to Macy's.)</p><p>Also in 2001, 3M, a pillar of the old business establishment based in St. Paul, brought in an outsider as chief executive for the first time in its 100-year history: W. James McNerney Jr. of General Electric.</p><p>''We were concerned that this flyover land was not organized,'' said Mr. Campbell, who oversaw the creation of Itasca in 2003 with other local business chiefs along with the leaders of major philanthropies. They took the name from Itasca State Park in northern Minnesota, where business leaders had met annually in the 1950s and 1960s to discuss issues facing the state.</p><p>Existing groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the Minnesota Business Partnership were focused ''on lower taxes and less regulation,'' he said.</p><p>''We were not addressing other issues like income disparities,'' said Mr. Campbell, who served as chairman of Itasca from 2003 to 2008, and helped initiate the Working Team breakfasts on Friday mornings in conjunction with the McKnight Foundation and Mr. Welsh.</p><p>Nor was the business community focused on areas that were crucial to long-term economic development, like transportation and infrastructure. ''What were we going to do about job growth?'' Mr. Campbell said he wondered at the time. ''What about marketing ourselves?''</p><p>The question of self-promotion helped inspire the creation of Greater MSP, an economic development agency that has put the region on the radar of corporate site selectors while overcoming Minnesotans' traditional reluctance to brag about themselves.</p><p>A bigger test of Itasca's reach - and of the willingness of the local establishment to go outside their comfort zone - came in 2008, when Governor Pawlenty vetoed a proposed increase in gas and sales taxes to fund $6.6 billion in transportation improvements.</p><p>A rush-hour bridge collapse over the Mississippi River in downtown Minneapolis the year before had killed 13 people and galvanized worries about aging infrastructure nationwide. But there was fierce opposition to what would be the first gas tax increase in 20 years.</p><p>At the same time, Governor Pawlenty was considering a White House run and had made a no-new-taxes pledge. None of the governor's previous vetoes had been overridden, but Itasca's members helped move the debate beyond the usual left-right dynamic.</p><p>Mr. Campbell donned a hard hat and a vest and stood with union leaders on the capitol steps to rally support. He and other business executives privately made the case to Republican legislators that traffic jams and long commutes were not good for employees or employers.</p><p>In the end, six Republican legislators defied the governor, and the veto was overridden by a two-vote margin.</p><p>''I can't overstate the importance of the Itasca Project leadership on the transportation issue,'' said Chris Coleman, the mayor of St. Paul. ''There's no question it changed the trajectory of the debate.''</p><p>As might be expected from boosters whose job it is to promote economic growth and talk up the Twin Cities' appeal, many Itasca participants express confidence that their project could be replicated elsewhere. Mr. Campbell, though, is less sure.</p><p>''My answer is maybe,'' he said. ''There's a unique willingness to trust each other here. It's kind of in our blood.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-2088263</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HR4-VPR1-JC85-N1F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International New York Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"12\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>December 30, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002F32</classCode><className>MCKINSEY &amp;

The reporting crew consists of: Wade McCune - Creative DirectorBrian Kratkiewicz - Director of Media and Innovation Chris Ho - Director of Digital and Interactive Services Katherine Vasilos - Account ExecutiveJosh Walker - CJRW Digital Content Writer  It's our third day at SXSW, and if you've watched the news this week, you already know that the conversation is getting serious. Facebook \u2014 the world's largest social platform with more than a billion monthly users \u2014 is having a rough week, and it isn't alone. </p><p>Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren made an appearance and called for the social media monolith, along with Google and Amazon, to undergo a mandatory breakup. Others are calling for regulations on how personal data is collected and used across the industry. We also heard a great discussion on the value and usefulness of user data. Here's the best of SXSW Day Three. ZUCKED: HOW FACEBOOK HAS UPENDED THE WORLD WE LIVE INRoger McNamee wants to break up big tech. As the author of the new book 'Zucked' and early mentor to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, McNamee criticizes Facebook for its lack of data privacy and warns consumers about the dangers of companies claiming ownership of our personal data. So, what does McNamee want? Big change. In fact, he's building momentum to make data privacy and big tech key issues in the 2020 presidential election. That reform movement includes some key ideas: \u2022 Bring regulation and antitrust law reform to the table. McNamee says private data should not be used without permission. 'This is a right vs. wrong issue.' \u2022 Clear space for start-ups, innovation and alternative business models by dismantling big tech companies and acquisitions - Facebook, Google, Apple, etc. Ultimately, he wants to change the dialogue to be about bringing values back to tech. Companies should take note. Reform could alter the way tech platforms reach consumers through advertising. Advertisers are also demanding more transparency to protect their customers. 'This is a trust business,' he said, 'Once people lose trust, you're screwed.' DROWNING IN DATA, STARVING FOR INSIGHTSData is everywhere, but the value and usefulness of that data can at times be elusive. Jared Feldman, CEO ...under of Canvs AI, said that marketers need to advance how they understand human emotion. Marketers need to be focused on taking modern dialogue across all media and then code how passionate consumers are or how much they love brands, things, anything. Ads need to elicit an emotional response. Marketers need to connect the power of words with the behavior that takes place because of it. Michael Shields, SVP, Sales Strategy ...siness Development of Fox Networks Group, stated that the emotional engagement is the future metric. He said, 'It's all about eliciting an emotional response from consumers for both advertising and programming.' Shields added that data and insights may drive the media to charge on an emotional metric in the future as opposed to normal GRPs and CPMs. They might charge advertisers based on connection and engagement rather than reach. Igor Vaks, Founder ...O at Creator IQ, added that reach and engagement are two vastly different metrics and elements of the marketing plan, but both are important as they hit different parts of the purchase funnel\u2014initial awareness and the end purchase.

The reporting crew consists of: Wade McCune - Creative DirectorBrian Kratkiewicz - Director of Media and Innovation Chris Ho - Director of Digital and Interactive Services Katherine Vasilos - Account ExecutiveJosh Walker - CJRW Digital Content Writer  It's our third day at SXSW, and if you've watched the news this week, you already know that the conversation is getting serious. Facebook   the world's largest social platform with more than a billion monthly users   is having a rough week, and it isn't alone. </p><p>Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren made an appearance and called for the social media monolith, along with Google and Amazon, to undergo a mandatory breakup. Others are calling for regulations on how personal data is collected and used across the industry. We also heard a great discussion on the value and usefulness of user data. Here's the best of SXSW Day Three. ZUCKED: HOW FACEBOOK HAS UPENDED THE WORLD WE LIVE INRoger McNamee wants to break up big tech. As the author of the new book 'Zucked' and early mentor to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, McNamee criticizes Facebook for its lack of data privacy and warns consumers about the dangers of companies claiming ownership of our personal data. So, what does McNamee want? Big change. In fact, he's building momentum to make data privacy and big tech key issues in the 2020 presidential election. That reform movement includes some key ideas:   Bring regulation and antitrust law reform to the table. McNamee says private data should not be used without permission. 'This is a right vs. wrong issue.'   Clear space for start-ups, innovation and alternative business models by dismantling big tech companies and acquisitions - Facebook, Google, Apple, etc. Ultimately, he wants to change the dialogue to be about bringing values back to tech. Companies should take note. Reform could alter the way tech platforms reach consumers through advertising. Advertisers are also demanding more transparency to protect their customers. 'This is a trust business,' he said, 'Once people lose trust, you're screwed.' DROWNING IN DATA, STARVING FOR INSIGHTSData is everywhere, but the value and usefulness of that data can at times be elusive. Jared Feldman, CEO Founder of Canvs AI, said that marketers need to advance how they understand human emotion. Marketers need to be focused on taking modern dialogue across all media and then code how passionate consumers are or how much they love brands, things, anything. Ads need to elicit an emotional response. Marketers need to connect the power of words with the behavior that takes place because of it. Michael Shields, SVP, Sales Strategy Business Development of Fox Networks Group, stated that the emotional engagement is the future metric. He said, 'It's all about eliciting an emotional response from consumers for both advertising and programming.' Shields added that data and insights may drive the media to charge on an emotional metric in the future as opposed to normal GRPs and CPMs. They might charge advertisers based on connection and engagement rather than reach. Igor Vaks, Founder CEO at Creator IQ, added that reach and engagement are two vastly different metrics and elements of the marketing plan, but both are important as they hit different parts of the purchase funnel initial awareness and the end purchase.

You might recall that in the early aughts, former FCC boss Michael Powell (now the top lobbyist for the cable industry) engaged in wholesale deregulation of the broadband sector, insisting it would usher forth all manner of intense competition. Powell had claimed at the time that a new technology known as broadband over powerline (BPL) would come in as a layer of added competition, justifying his decision to free the sector from regulatory oversight. </p><p>Due to interference issues, BPL never worked out[2], and you may have noticed that Powell's promised deregulation-triggered wave of competition never happened[3]. Powell's decision effectively involved classifying cable providers as an \"information service\" instead of a \"telecommunications service,\" thereby freeing it from significant oversight under Title II of the Communications Act. In telecom, this mindless deregulation is always delivered alongside promises of intense new competition (see net neutrality). But with the broadband industry, a sector dominated by a handful of powerful \"too big to fail\" monopolies all but fused to the NSA, it never quite works that way. With neither competition nor oversight to keep them in line, regional monopolies like Comcast and AT...sually just double down on anti-competitive behavior. It's a lesson we refuse to learn. Regardless, Powell's decision triggered a massive legal fight that began when a company named Brand X Internet sued, because the regulatory shift blocked it from accessing the networks of incumbent cable providers. The battle reached all the way to the Supreme Court, who in a 6-3 decision[4] supported Powell's deregulation of the cable sector. But the ruling had a catch: it didn't lock cable into being classified as an \"information service\" permanently. It allowed the FCC to shift the definition back and forth, just as long as it provided some fairly basic justification for the move. It's a major reason FCC policy has shifted so sharply back and forth as partisans have jerked the reins from \"yes, we'd like some modest oversight of telecom\" to \"letting the industry do whatever it wants results in Utopia\" policy patty cake. This week Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas issued a dissent in an unrelated case[5] (pdf, hat tip Ars Technica[6]) in which he suggested some regret for his original \"Brand X\" ruling:\"\"Regrettably, Brand X has taken this Court to the precipice of administrative absolutism,\" Thomas wrote. \"Under its rule of deference, agencies are free to invent new (purported) interpretations of statutes and then require courts to reject their own prior interpretations.\"That's of course what happened with net neutrality, with the 2015 FCC passing some modest net neutrality rules, and the 2017 Ajit Pai FCC then scuttling them on behalf of industry. So instead of a set of consistent rules, we get whiplash. Thomas continued:\"Although I authored Brand X, \"it is never too late to 'surrende[r] former views to a better considered position.'\" Brand X appears to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and traditional tools of statutory interpretation. Because I would revisit Brand X, I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.\"Ideally, you'd want federal lawmakers to pass legislation that enshrines some basic net neutrality consumer protections into law. But because Congress has been wholly corrupted by telecom industry campaign cash, that's simply not happening without a major shakeup in the Senate. So while it's nice Thomas may have seen the error of his ways fifteen years on, the epiphany comes far too late to be of actual help to US consumers or the uncompetitive broadband markets Powell's original ruling helped cement. Meanwhile Michael Powell, who started this entire mess on behalf of the cable sector, is now the top lobbyist for the NCTA, the cable industry's biggest lobbying and policy organization. The last two years he's been advocating for massive new regulation of Silicon Valley[7] and virtually no oversight whatsoever for telecom. It's gambit that's paying off handsomely so far, thanks to myopic lawmakers who haven't yet figured out that the problems with \"big tech\" and \"big telecom\" are in many ways one and the same. And in some ways (thanks in large part to natural monopolies fused to the NSA) the problems with telecom are worse.Permalink[8] | Comments[9] | Email This Story[10] [ 1]: <url

Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court immediately after Labor Day. The nomination is mired in controversy after Republicans insisted in 2016 that it was improper to consider a nominee so close to an election and are now trying to push the nomination through without permitting a proper vetting of his record. The EFF's Camille Fischer, Corynne McSherry and Shahid Buttar recently published 'Questioning Kavanaugh About Digital Privacy and Net Neutrality[6].' Camille Fischer joins us to talk about the Kavanaugh nomination which the San Jose Mercury has called Kavanaugh's nomination a 'disaster for thetechnology industry and the users of tech products.' SeeIs Judge Kavanaugh a 'Disaster' For Tech?</p><p>[7], Cyber Report. Now, with Michael Cohen's guilty plea implicating President Trump and raising questions about the legitimacy of the Trump presidency, Democrats have found a new line of attack against the nomination. I have cancelled my meeting with Judge Kavanaugh. @realDonaldTrump[8], who is an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal matter, does not deserve the courtesy of a meeting with his nominee\u2014purposely selected to protect, as we say in Hawaii, his own okole. \u2014 Senator Mazie Hirono (@maziehirono) August 22, 2018[9] CAMILLE FISCHERElectronic Frontier FoundationWebsite[10] / Twitter: @CamFisch[11] Camille Fischer is a Frank Stanton Fellow working on EFF's free speech and government transparency projects.

Matthew was co-counsel in the Wayfair case.LISTEN VIA THESE CHANNELS [1][2][3][4][5] The Road to Wayfair1992: Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U. S. 298 (1992)Adopts a bright-line rule that a state may not tax out of state retailers without a physical presence in the state. 2008:New York passes 'Amazon' or 'Affiliate Nexus Tax'Move launches Amazon Tax Wars as other states follow suit. </p><p>2013:New York court upholds Amazon Tax,Supreme Court denies the petition for cert. 2015:Direct Marketing Associationv.Brohl,135 S.Ct. 1124 (2015)Justice Kennedy's concurrence states 'it is unwise to delay any longer a reconsideration of the Court's holding in Quill.. . . The legal system should find an appropriate case for this Court to reexamine Quill'. 2018: South Dakota v. Wayfair,135 S.Ct. 2080 (2018)Justice Kennedy writes 5-4 opinion overturning Quill. The Commerce Clause must not prefer interstate commerce only to the point where a merchant physically crosses state borders. Rejecting the physical presence rule is necessary to ensure that artificial competitive advantages are not created by this Court's precedents. Roberts dissent: E-commerce has grown into a significant and vibrant part of our national economy against the backdrop of established rules, including the physical-presence rule. Any alteration to those rules with the potential to disrupt the development of such a critical segment of the economy should be undertaken by Congress. The Court should not act on this important question of current economic policy, solely toexpiate a mistake it made over 50 years ago.Matthew P.

Electricity supply from coal is naturally decreasing due to the age of plants and the gap is being met by cheap gas (from fracking) and wind and solar<br/><br/>2. Further coal retirement is expected from the federal Clean Power Plan<br/><br/>3. Fuel economy standards will be expanded to include trucks<br/><br/>4. States such as California, New York and much of New England taking more substantive action<br/><br/>About 30 states have a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which is like a renewable energy target, and inter-state cooperation is huge in the US.<br/><br/>Approximately 11 states are now capping and trading emissions among themselves in different groupings. States are free to join or leave the groupings based on their government's leanings.<br/><br/>Research and development funding is strong and has bipartisan support. This has made the US a leader in the development of electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells and more.<br/><br/>System resilience in a post-Hurricane Sandy New York state<br/><br/>When Hurricane Sandy swept across the country, power outages lasted up to a week in some places and many lives were tragically lost.<br/><br/>But rather than another round of the renewable energy blame game which we saw recently following a short-lived blackout in South Australia, the state of New York set about trying to build an energy system that was smarter, cleaner, more resilient and affordable.<br/><br/>The solution set out in New York's Reforming the Energy Vision was a series of microgrids, where battery storage and distributed renewable energy generation combine to help keep essential services running in the event of a catastrophe.<br/><br/>The state ran a competition, inviting communities to submit ideas for microgrids, and is in the final phases of selecting a winning project from a shortlist of finalists. The vision also sets out legislated targets such as 50 per cent renewable energy and emissions reduction of 40 per cent by 2030. The state's 'Energy Czar' Richard Kauffman believes that avoided infrastructure spend and more efficient regulation and energy efficiency means the initiative could be cost neutral.<br/><br/>Corporations directly purchasing renewable energy<br/><br/>Last year major tech companies like Google, Apple and Yahoo announced 3 GW of renewable energy projects between them. They have three major motives for moving beyond simply paying utility bills and into the renewable energy purchasing world:<br/><br/>1. Price certainty. Big tech companies with big data centres come with big power bills, and they are having a hard time predicting what direction future electricity prices will take. Renewable energy has proven to be a great way to provide proactive control over costs and long contracts mean that companies can plan for their futures knowing what they'll be paying for power - a smart hedging move.<br/><br/>2. Supply certainty and diversification. The most reliable grid can occasionally experience failures, and every minute a data centre is down means huge losses to tech companies. As a result, some are using on-site solar and fuel cells to ensure an incredibly reliable local fuel supply, where the grid is just the back-up power source.<br/><br/>3. Branding. These companies know that Americans want to see more renewable energy, and they want to see clean, modern companies using clean, modern power. These sorts of future-looking investments can be a great opportunity to position a company as a leader.<br/><br/>The challenge for these companies is convincing their chief financial officers to diversify away from core business and into renewable energy investment. Two years ago the Rocky Mountain Institute, a renewable energy organisation in the United States set up the Business Renewables Centre (BRC) to start creating financing products aimed at large companies getting into the renewable energy business.<br/><br/>They get large companies, financiers and wind and solar developers together to figure out innovative ways for them to team up, all while speeding up the transformation of the electricity sector and cutting emissions across the country.<br/><br/>Utilities becoming more customer-focused<br/><br/>Utilities operate slightly differently in each US state but the general model is that they operate as a monopoly electricity retailer with some network ownership and in some cases some power plant ownership as well.<br/><br/>Large energy customers such as datacentres and even Las Vegas hotels are seeking ways to contract directly with renewable energy suppliers as a way of managing big power bills. Amazon for example has signed a deal with its utility where the utility procures renewable energy and builds a transmission line to Amazon's datacentre.<br/><br/>A group of utilities have set up a research centre and are finding ways to be more customer-focused to meet demand for innovation.<br/><br/>The Green Mountain Power utility in Vermont is experimenting with leasing Tesla Powerwalls to customers and retaining the right to remotely drain the battery into the grid if required for system stability or peak demand. They are also leasing energy efficient heating systems to customers who pay lower bills immediately.<br/><br/>Despite all these advances, there are obviously still many challenges to address, including costs, community sentiment and variable output. I will be watching with interest and looking for new developments that might be useful in Australia to drive our own energy transition.<br/><br/>Contact:<br/><br/>Tel: +61 3 9929 4100<br/>Fax: +61 3 9929 4101<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KYT-WC71-JD3Y-Y4TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1041\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>October 18, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Yet these tech giants also have one; the internet infrastructure that delivers their services to millions.</p><p>Google made use of Unlockd's single point of failure to achieve its commercial aims in closing us down, and I would suggest NBN and the government uses the tech giants' single point of failure as leverage in solving its clear commercial problems with the NBN.</p><p>The speed at which the internet operates with their website or online service is critical to the commercial viability of the likes of Google, Facebook, Netflix and others ... so why not make them pay to ensure it?</p><p>During my time running Unlockd, I was fortunate enough to meet telco CEOs, governing bodies and executives from all around the world, and they all have the same problem.</p><p>They are investing massively and competing against themselves and other telcos to build the \"highway\", which is then being used by the tech players, streaming services and app providers for free, as they generate huge revenue and profits.</p><p>If you look as an analogy from another sector - building roads - then you see that usage fees is central to a successful model. Transurban with a $41 billion market cap, isn't going to build new tunnels, roads and ways for people to access what they want for free. You get a freeway trip of 20 minutes or sit in traffic for an hour ... you decide if that's worth the $7 toll.</p><p>I know the telco model is a lot more complex, with many moving parts, but it would be unthinkable in transport infrastructure for a company to spend tens or hundreds of billions because it's a nice thing to do to help Ford, Holden and BMW sell more cars, and then to just hope that some of the population are happy to pay for their roads as a business model.</p><p>I'm not naive enough to think there is a silver bullet to solving global telco infrastructure affordability, but what if telcos changed their strategy towards these online services?</p><p>Instead of offering Netflix, Spotify or other services for free to drive their own subscribers (and in turn help their real competitors get consumers hooked on their products), why not use the \"single point of failure\" that they control? There are clearly concerns around net neutrality in all of this, but I am not proposing throttling back the speeds to all other websites. We know who the OTT and online giants are - Netflix, Amazon and the big tech companies - they are the ones making big money off the infrastructure, so why not put a fee on the speed of the product for them?</p><p>Ten million Australian consumers won't want to watch Netflix on slow internet speeds buffering away every two minutes, or have songs interrupted halfway through on Spotify.</p><p>Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and all these platforms can't afford to lose subscriptions or daily active users, as it is one of the single metrics that investors look to other than revenue and profit. They won't like it, but they will pay \"internet speed access fees\" to ensure that doesn't happen ... What's their alternative? We can see that the current broadband market structure in Australia is not going to work sustainably as it stands, so it should be changed to match markets that do work.</p><p>Paying for a certain level of service is no different to any other business model I've seen that has tiered products from start-ups, to enterprise software to consulting companies to infrastructure companies. It is the cornerstone of commercial pricing strategies. Maybe it's time to turn the tables on the single point of failure for the internet giants, without high functioning internet connectivity, what business do these companies really have left?</p><p>If media companies had presented a strong united front and charged the likes of Google and Facebook for displaying and monetising their content from the get go then they would not have ended up in such a weak position in dealing with their huge market power.</p><p>Similarly telcos and NBN should start working together, rather than against each other in this area, before they, too, face structural challenges and the tech giants can buy them, and their infrastructure for pennies on the dollar, to control the whole eco-system.</p><p>Matt Berriman was the founder and CEO of advertising tech start-up Unlockd and is now a start-up investor and board adviser.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc76j1cx3putjqo6bi5pm</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRH-SXY1-JD34-V005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"880\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Clear Path to Foggy Bottom: Secretary of State nominee <person><nameText>Mike Pompeo </nameText></person>clears the Foreign Relations panel and has enough votes for Senate confirmation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. Late May Markup: The Senate Armed Services panel will hold its closed markup of the fiscal 2019 defense authorization bill two weeks later than originally planned. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3.

Foreign Relations Endorses Pompeo After Paul Backs Nominee</p><p>A last-minute reversal on Monday by Sen. Rand Paul spared <person><nameText>Mike Pompeo </nameText></person>the embarrassment of becoming the first nominee for secretary of State in history not to receive the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's endorsement.</p><p>In a narrow partisan vote, the committee voted 11-9 to approve Pompeo's nomination, sending it to the Senate floor. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., switched his \"no\" vote to \"present\" out of respect for Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., who was not present because he was attending a friend's funeral. Isakson could then vote \"yes\" by proxy because he was not a tie-breaking vote.</p><p>Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., was visibly moved by Coons' gesture.</p><p>\"It demonstrated what he is, a statesman,\" Corker told CQ after the vote.</p><p>In March, Paul became the first senator to declare his opposition to Pompeo's nomination on the basis of the nominee's past support for the 2003 Iraq War and past comments supporting military strikes on Iran's nuclear program.</p><p>In a Monday evening Twitter post, the Kentucky Republican explained why he was now backing Pompeo.</p><p>\"After calling continuously for weeks for Director Pompeo to support <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>belief that the Iraq war was a mistake, and that it is time to leave Afghanistan, today I received confirmation the Director Pompeo agrees with\" the president, Paul wrote.</p><p>CQ's Rachel Oswald has more here.</p><p>2. Senate Panel Delays NDAA Markup by Two Weeks</p><p>The Senate Armed Services Committee will consider its version of the fiscal 2019 defense authorization bill, or NDAA, the week of May 21, two weeks later than previously planned, a senior committee aide said Monday.</p><p>The Senate panel will now have the benefit of knowing how the House Armed Services Committee will write its version of the sprawling bill, which authorizes spending and sets policy for national security programs, mainly at the Pentagon and Energy Department. </p><p>House Armed Services subcommittees plan to hold their markups of the bill (HR 5515) on April 26. The full House committee intends to conduct its daylong markup of the measure on May 7.</p><p>The Senate panel's markup is expected to be led this year by James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., in place of Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., who is undergoing treatment for brain cancer and has not been in Washington since late last year.</p><p>CQ's John M. Donnelly has more here. </p><p>3. RSA Roundup: Big Tech Promises More Attention to Cybersecurity</p><p>New European privacy rules, Facebook's role in the 2016 elections and the potential that cyberattacks could target home devices are propelling the tech industry to question its security practices and prompting executives to promise to make amends. </p><p>During five days at the RSA Conference last week in San Francisco, top executives from the world's largest technology companies, including Google, Microsoft, IBM, Cisco, McAfee, Symantec and others, said they took the new rules and increasing scrutiny over security seriously -- and would step up to make their own devices and software safer and urge thousands of vendors worldwide to do the same. </p><p>A handful of government officials showed up at the conference to cajole as well as scold the companies. Congressional aides said lawmakers were likely to push for new legislation. And security experts said that everything from medical devices to cloud data servers continue to be vulnerable.</p><p>\"GDPR is the first indication that something is going on ... and if we don't take control of our destiny it's going to be controlled for us,\" said John Stewart, chief trust officer at Cisco, the maker of networking hardware and telecom equipment. Technology companies \"need to talk to governments and one another\" about the security of computers and devices, he said. </p><p>CQ's Gopal Ratnam has more here. </p><p>4. Service Secretaries to Testify on Budget, Posture</p><p>Air Force and Navy leaders will testify today on Capitol Hill to update Congress on the state of their forces and defend their fiscal 2019 budget requests. </p><p>Air Force Secretary Heather A. Wilson and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein will testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Navy Secretary Richard Spencer and Chief of Naval Operations Gen. Robert B. Neller will defend the Navy's spending proposal before the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.</p><p>Spencer and Neller won't need to make a hard pitch for funding, though, as a February budget agreement (PL 115-123) paved the way for defense spending at the Pentagon's desired level of $716 billion. Of that total, the Navy is poised to spend $6 billion to procure three DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, $7.4 billion for two Virginia-class submarines, $1.3 billion for one Littoral Combat Ship, and $1.8 billion as a payment for an aircraft carrier.</p><p>Senators will likely question Wilson and Goldfein on the Air Force's pilot shortage. A year ago, the Air Force told Congress that the service is short 1,555 pilots, including 1,211 fighter pilots.</p><p>As of November, Armed Services Committee members were concerned that the dearth of Air Force pilots could be exacerbated by Vietnam War veterans flying for commercial airlines retiring soon. That would open numerous positions that not only pay more than the military, but offer more predictable schedules and guaranteed flight time. </p><p>-- Patrick Kelley</p><p>5. Spending Bill, Tariffs Drive Lobbying Against Election Backdrop</p><p>An omnibus appropriations package, steel tariffs, regulatory work on the new tax law and general uncertainty about the nation's direction on policy and governing fueled K Street business during the first three months of this year.</p><p>The politics of the November midterm elections will consume the Capitol for much of the rest of 2018, as lawmakers debate a farm bill, possible new disclosures for social media companies and federal spending beyond Sept. 30.  </p><p>\"There's a lot of uncertainty with this current administration about which direction we're going to be headed, so we've been very clear with our clients and potential clients that people need to stay vigilant and engaged,\" said Elizabeth Gore, who leads Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck's government relations department. \"We're in an election year, so that always has an influence over what the floor agenda looks like in the House and Senate.\"   </p><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, along with its affiliated Institute for Legal Reform, kept its reign as the biggest spender on federal lobbying, shelling out more than $22.9 million in the first quarter, according to lobbying reports filed with Congress. The disclosures, due late Friday night, cover lobbying activity from January through March.</p><p>CQ's Kate Ackley has more here. </p><p>Bullets &amp; Bombs</p><p>1. The Trump administration will not lift any sanctions on North Korea until \"we see concrete actions toward denuclearization\" by Kim Jong Un's government, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.</p><p>2.

Brad Hoylman who are displeased with the work of the controversial facial recognition company Clearview AI. Now, even other tech companies \u2013 like Facebook and LinkedIn \u2013 are demanding that the New York-based startup stop scraping photos from their platforms to fuel the facial recognition database that law enforcement agencies across the country have been using to help solve cases. Twitter and YouTube, too, have sent Clearview AI cease-and-desist letters, telling it to stop using data collected from their platforms.</p><p>Clearview AI is still relatively small and young, but the app that founder Hoan Ton-That helped create has been used by more than 600 law enforcement agencies to match faces to public images it collects from the internet. While the New York Police Department has denied any official relationship with the company, some officers have been accused of using the app on their personal smartphones to assist in cases. The NYPD has its own facial recognition database \u2013 which has come under intense scrutiny too \u2013 but the magnitude of Clearview AI's use of public images from sites like Facebook and other social media platforms has caused privacy advocates to call for banning the software. While the images it scrapes are public, companies like Facebook have told Clearview AI that the practice violates their policies.</p><p> While Clearview AI's app may be beneficial for difficult tasks like identifying child victims of sexual abuse, critics say the unregulated, untested app could also end up causing unintended consequences. Facial recognition itself has been criticized for biases and lacking accuracy in identifying non-white and non-male faces.</p><p> Last month, Hoylman announced a bill that would prohibit law enforcement from using facial recognition and most other biometric surveillance technologies. The announcement \u2013 while not specifically aimed at Clearview AI \u2013 came a week after the company's activities were detailed in an investigation by The New York Times. \"Facial recognition technology threatens to end every New Yorker's ability to walk down the street anonymously,\" Hoylman said at the time. \"New York must take action to regulate this increasingly pervasive and dangerously powerful technology before it's too late.\"</p><p> For the rest of today's tech news, head over to First Read Tech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facial recognition technologies are receiving criticism.

Facebook collects your clicks, likes and reactions to posts and ads. Google records everything from what you search and what you watch to what you say to your Android devices. Amazon registers what you like to buy and peruse from its store. Gathering hoards of information about customers is a business model that, up until recently, has been incredibly profitable for companies like Facebook, which garnered upward of $80 per person last year for each of its 207 million American users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It might seem baffling to consider how companies like Facebook are managing to make so much money while providing free services to their users.</p><p>Turns out, it's not all that free, said Paul Eggert, a senior computer science lecturer at UCLA. Facebook and other companies, such as Google and YouTube, harvest valuable information from their users, usually without users' knowledge. These companies are then able to sell that information to advertising companies, who can, in turn, reach more specific demographics. This practice is promising for the advertising industry because it allows advertisers to personally tailor ads.</p><p>But this data gathering model is dangerous to consumers. Data is constantly up for grabs by unknown groups, and breaches are becoming increasingly common. This is why Californians for Consumer Privacy, a group advocating for consumer privacy, is pushing for the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, a November ballot measure that would hold tech firms and companies that hoard consumers' information accountable if users' data is compromised as a result of a security breach.</p><p>The ballot measure is an important step toward transparency and accountability regarding data collection. However, it falls short of doing what some consumers want most: stopping\u00a0tech firms from collecting consumer data without their consent. The act's supporters would do well to push for provisions that put restrictions on the data collection process - the cause of the problem in the first place.</p><p>Under current California law, tech companies are responsible for protecting the data they gather, but consumers often have difficulty determining what data has been gathered - or compromised, for that matter. Unlike in Europe, where there are stricter regulations concerning whose data can be collected and how the process must be disclosed to customers, consumers in the U.S. aren't always able to request that the companies disclose what data has been gathered or to whom that data is being sold to.</p><p>And high-profile tech breaches, like the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the voter profiling firm took the data of millions of Facebook users without their permission, are opening a dialogue about a deeper concern for privacy within the U.S.</p><p>Recent security breaches are starting to concern consumers. Some are realizing they should be paying more attention to the sites they're using and the information companies might have shared without letting them know, said Inez Kaminski, a spokesperson for the California Consumer Privacy Act.</p><p>\"People are surprised they don't have (data privacy) rights already,\" Kaminski said.</p><p>The California Consumer Privacy Act would make the shady business of information-gathering companies more transparent. Under the ballot initiative, companies would be required to disclose the information they gather about a consumer if the consumer requests it and provide information about whom they sell it to. It would also permit users to opt out of the selling of their data and prevent companies from punishing those who opt out of the selling of their data by charging for an otherwise free service or upping costs on paid services.</p><p>But under the current text, there is no way for a consumer to prevent companies from gathering their data in the first place, except to entirely disconnect from a company's services. While that sounds like an easy fix - and one that would really only cost you the use of Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms - it's not that simple. Companies gather data on consumers nearly every time they access the internet, whether it be typing out a message on Tinder, searching the symptoms of an illness or making a purchase online. Preventing your data from being collected would require pulling out of an overwhelming number of online services.</p><p>While these\u00a0companies might be financially responsible for breaches of data, the onus is still on the consumer to be knowledgeable about what's going on behind their screens. These tech companies also have immense power and money to defend their questionable antics: It's doubtful these firms will back down from their lucrative business model without a significant legal fight - something your everyday consumer may not be able to engage in.</p><p>As such, the California Consumer Privacy Act shouldn't just force tech companies to show their hand, but also stop these organizations from gathering data on consumers who want to maintain privacy.</p><p>Certainly, it might seem the bill would threaten California's economy. Silicon Valley is no small contributor to the California job market, after all. In fact, major tech companies such as Google and AT&amp;T Inc. support an opposing campaign called the Committee to Protect California Jobs.</p><p>But big tech companies like Verizon, AT&amp;T, Comcast Corp. and Google already face stringent data privacy regulations in Europe - regulations that are largely similar to what the California Consumer Privacy Act prescribes. Meeting policies already required overseas shouldn't be that big of a concern, Eggert said.</p><p>Absolute data privacy may seem like an impossibility in the modern world, but when it comes to protecting consumer's rights, we shouldn't stop trying just because tech companies say so. The California Consumer Privacy Act provides a means to preserve users' privacy - if it's given the teeth to do so.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-3421651</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S42-CSS1-JBSN-3430-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1013\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Bruin: University of California - Los Angeles</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 12, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (LOS ANGELES)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Los Angeles</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">Sir Nick Clegg has urged policymakers to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/04/breaking-tech-giants-america-finally-ready-take-action-against/\">abandon threats to break up Facebook</url> and instead unite against Chinese censorship of the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook's head of global affairs\u00a0and Britain's\u00a0former deputy prime minister called on Europe and the US to \"turn off the white noise and begin to work together\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a speech in Berlin on Monday, he argued that\u00a0a failure to do so could cause the West to \"sleepwalk into a new era where the internet is no longer a universal space\".</p><p>Instead, he said it would be a series of silos where different countries set their own rules and authoritarian regimes collect\u00a0citizens' data while restricting their freedom.</p><p>The former leader of the Liberal Democrats said that we are in a \"critical moment\" where others, like China, are writing the \"new rules of the internet themselves\".\u00a0</p><p>\"The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/04/breaking-tech-giants-america-finally-ready-take-action-against/\">Great Firewall of China</url> means great swathes of what we think of as the internet - Facebook,\u00a0Instagram and WhatsApp included - are unreachable by its citizens and much of the content they can access is heavily censored,\" he claimed.</p><p>He added that Russia is increasingly\u00a0following China's lead,\u00a0trying to force companies to store data on national soil.</p><p>The comments follow remarks earlier this year by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/04/breaking-tech-giants-america-finally-ready-take-action-against/\">Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes</url>, who called\u00a0for the social media network to be broken up in order to rein\u00a0in the\u00a0\"staggering\" power wielded by Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/04/breaking-tech-giants-america-finally-ready-take-action-against/\">Facebook's profits have been cut in half</url></p><p>However\u00a0last month\u00a0 Margrethe Vestager, Europe's competition commissioner, \u00a0said that breaking up Facebook - which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/04/breaking-tech-giants-america-finally-ready-take-action-against/\">should be considered only as a \"very last resort\" because it would involve\u00a0years of legal battles.</url></p><p>\"We need to work together to rewrite the rules [of the internet],\" said Sir Nick, who\u00a0used his speech to claim\u00a0that Facebook \"has changed\" and reiterate his belief that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/04/breaking-tech-giants-america-finally-ready-take-action-against/\">increased regulation of tech firms</url> can not be done solely by the internet companies themselves.</p><p>He said it should not be left to a private company to \"decide who is or isn't a legitimate participant in an

overreacting to the bad,\" he argued.\u00a0</p><p>\"If you listened to some of our more breathless critics you could be forgiven for thinking that we are single-handedly dismantling western democracy: collaborating with the Russians, the Iranians, the Bilderberg Group, the Illuminati and the guys who faked the moon landings to manipulate our citizens, rig elections and tear down our democratic institutions.\"</p><p>The former deputy prime minister has said the social network plans to set up an independent oversight board to which people can appeal against content decisions made by Facebook.</p><p>He also defended the company, saying it was the victim of a \"tech lash\".</p><p><url

4's Today programme</url> there was \"absolutely no evidence\" that Russia influenced the EU referendum result using Facebook.</p><p>He also dismissed claims that\u00a0Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy\u00a0which is believed to have harvested personal Facebook data via a third party app,\u00a0swayed people's decision to vote Leave in 2016.</p><p>But the vice president for global affairs and communications at the social network did acknowledge Facebook did deserve\u00a0criticism\u00a0for some of its actions during\u00a0the 15 years since its launch.</p><p>He said that the \"company's attitude to the use of data in its early years\" was one area where criticism was fair.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The former deputy prime minister, who is now head of global affairs at the tech giant, said that countries should unite to create a \"new template for the internet\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Here's a news flash: Facebook wants to be regulated\", Sir Nick, 52, said in a speech in Berlin last night, adding that the company had found itself in a new world that required \"new rules\".</p><p>He said that there was a danger of Europe and America sleepwalking into an era where \"different countries set their own rules and authoritarian regimes soak up their citizens' data while restricting their freedom\".</p><p>The plea gained little support from politicians in the UK. Damian Collins, chairman of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, which has called for Facebook to be investigated by the UK's privacy and competition regulators, said the company was seeking regulation to evade wider responsibility for the problems that it was creating.</p><p>He told Today on BBC Radio 4: \"What they're saying to parliaments and governments is, 'Well you make things illegal and we'll obey your laws but other than that don't expect us to exercise any judgment about how people use our services'.\"</p><p>Sir Nick was criticised by children's groups for claiming in the same speech that studies had shown that the link between social media use and teenagers' wellbeing was \"very small\". Jim Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, an American charity, said: \"Facebook has a history of choosing growth over all else, without regard to the consequences, be they to democracies or the wellbeing of children. But ask any parent, teacher or anyone that works with kids every day and they will tell you, without any hesitation, that media and tech is definitely affecting the social, emotional and cognitive development of kids.\"</p><p>In the same speech Sir Nick said that Facebook had analysed data and found that there had been no \"significant attempt\" from Russian interference to influence the Brexit referendum result. David Lammy, the Labour MP, described Sir Nick's claims that there was no Russian meddling as \"horse manure\" and said: \"What about the disinformation spread by Russian state media, RT [formerly Russia Today] and Sputnik, on Facebook?\" Facebook's desire to be regulated comes as the company insists that it does not need to be broken up. It is the largest social network and has also bought the picture-sharing app Instagram and the instant messaging service WhatsApp. Between them they have 2.4 billion monthly users and revenue of $55.8 billion a year.</p><p>This has put the company under close scrutiny from regulators and politicians, with some Democratic presidential candidates, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, calling for Facebook to be forcibly broken up.</p><p>Sir Nick said the idea did not address underlying concerns and argued that social media was \"not going to be uninvented\".</p><p>\"Simply breaking up Facebook and other big tech companies into smaller, but still huge, companies won't address the issues that cause people the most concern, whether its privacy, or election integrity, or harmful content\", he said. \"Just because it is difficult to regulate the internet doesn't mean policy makers should jump to the alternative of wishing these companies away.\" Hugo Rifkind, page 25 Leading article, page 27</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-150482167</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDR-F8N1-DYTY-C048-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"570\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 25, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Both are powered by an inexorable sense of self-righteousness. And both have an awful lot of experience of saying sorry.</p><p>The most recent example came when Sir Nick appeared on the BBC in the wake of the furore over the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell.</p><p>It turned out, after she was found dead in her bedroom in December 2017, that she had been viewing material online relating to depression, self-harm and suicide - material which was shockingly easy to find.</p><p>As her father Ian Russell put it bluntly: \"Instagram helped kill my daughter.\"</p><p>Sir Nick, to his credit, said all the right things about how the firm was determined to do more. But he also made the striking claim that it is sometimes better for Facebook and Instagram to keep suicide images online, because it helps other vulnerable young people get support.</p><p>This after The Sun, on Saturday, found and flagged up multiple images appearing to normalise and even romanticise suicide, all within a few clicks.</p><p>Many remained published for days, and a Facebook spokesman claimed they could be beneficial to users battling mental health issues.</p><p>Sir Nick says the firm is following the advice from leading experts and charities. And it may well be doing the right thing.</p><p>But this is the latest example of Facebook - and other social media giants in general - only acting to tackle a problem once it becomes impossible not to.</p><p>Over the past decade, social media has come to dominate our lives. The latest research from Ofcom shows internet use rocketing among children and teenagers, with friendships and social lives increasingly run through screens and phones.</p><p>And it is now clear that this great move online has been accompanied, for our children, by a staggering increase in mental health problems.</p><p>The situation is particularly alarming when it comes to young women. The latest NHS data found that one in four of those aged 17 to 19 report having a mental health disorder - twice the rate among boys.</p><p>In 2017 alone, one in five US girls aged between 12 and 17 suffered a major depressive episode - one in five!</p><p>Suicide rates for teenage girls, according to academic Jonathan Haidt, have risen by 82 per cent in the US and 46 per cent in the UK in a decade. This isn't just about what happens on the internet. Those having problems online often tend to be experiencing problems offline too, such as bullying, harassment or broken families.</p><p>More broadly, Haidt believes the \"snowflake\" phenomenon reflects that \"helicopter parenting\" leaves children less prepared to cope with shocks and difficulty.</p><p>But the internet, and social media, are very clearly intensifying those problems. And the big tech firms are still playing catch-up.</p><p>The traditional argument from Silicon Valley is that it's not their job to regulate human behaviour. They add that even if they wanted to, there is simply too much out there.</p><p>They are doing their best to crack down on inappropriate content, but it's like trying to stem the tide. Behind the scenes - they insist - thousands of people are working day and night to detect and delete messages promoting terrorism, hatred, Holocaust denial and self-harm.</p><p>But this argument just doesn't wash.</p><p>It's very clear that, in the interests of their bottom lines, many of the big social media firms have long failed to put enough resources into detecting damaging content.</p><p>Researchers have shown, for example, how following the recommended links from reputable YouTube content can lead to a carnival of horrors. News reports that segue into crackpot conspiracy theories and videos for toddlers that give way to horrendous scenes of a bloodied Minnie Mouse trapped in an escalator.</p><p>Every day brings new horror stories, such as rival fans of royals Kate and Meghan using the Kensington Palace Instagram to send death threats to each other.</p><p>Increasingly, online hate is triggering real-life violence. The slaughter of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma was, The New York Times said, \"a genocide incited on Facebook\".</p><p>Part of the reason that Zuckerberg has hired Clegg is to put his house in order. Clegg has talked the right talk about changing Facebook's culture, and in particular doing more to tackle self-harm.</p><p>He even says they might start paying more tax.</p><p>But if Zuckerberg's answer to \"how to fix the internet\" is \"hire Nick Clegg\", we have still got an awfully long way to go.</p><p>Robert Colvile is the director of think tank Centre for Policy Studies.</p><p>If you are worried about yourself or someone else, the Samaritans are available free at any time on 116 123.</p><p>Tech firms still playing catch-up</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>MR FIXIT \u2026 Nick CleggBOSS \u2026 Zuckerberg</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THESUN-145970892</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THESUN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9K-VVC1-JCBW-N4YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sun (England)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31984\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 30, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
