Ebullient investors, enthused by the synchronised global economic recovery, pushed the US sharemarket to an all-time high in late January.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But then the optimism started to evaporate as investors fretted that stronger global growth would likely kindle inflationary pressures, triggering a faster pace of monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve. The market's mood was darkened further by fears that US President Donald Trump's move to slap steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports could prove a prelude to a global trade war.</p><p>This caused the US sharemarket to end the first quarter slightly lower, bringing an end to its impressive nine-quarter winning streak. In a cruel twist, this stumble occurred at a time when the US sharemarket was celebrating the ninth anniversary of its recovery from its financial crisis low of March 2009.</p><p>There were other, subtler signs of more difficult times ahead. Market volatility has flared, with the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, climbing to near 20, almost double ultra-low levels that prevailed at the beginning of the year.</p><p>More worrying was the growing disenchantment with the technology sector - particularly the former market darling FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google).</p><p>Facebook has been at the top of the list, shedding some $US75 billion ($98 billion) in stock market value since it was revealed that data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica had accessed personal information about potentially tens of millions of the social network's members.</p><p>Amazon's share price has also come under pressure as Trump's tweets blasting the company for not paying its fair share of taxes and for putting retailers out of business have spurred worries that the online retail giant could face possible antitrust action.</p><p>Worries that Big Tech stocks could be vulnerable to a fresh round of regulations or taxes have rippled through the market in the past fortnight, wiping $US61 billion off the market value of Amazon, $US62 billion off that of Alphabet (the parent of Google), and $US54 billion from Apple's market capitalisation.</p><p>This wobble by many of the high-flying FAANG stocks has only underscored the US sharemarket's reliance on the tech sector to power its rise. At the end of February, tech stocks accounted for more than 25 per cent of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.</p><p>Possibly scenting blood in the water, Wall Street's short sellers - investors who sell shares they do not own in the hope of making a profit when prices fall - are now targeting the FAANG stocks, which are now among the top 10 most-shorted US stocks, measured by market value.</p><p>Investor disillusion has also spread to Tesla, whose share price has slumped 23 per cent since mid-March. Last week, Moody's added to the woes of Tesla investors by downgrading the electric-car maker's credit rating to reflect the company's \"liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and the pending maturities\" of other debt.</p><p>Meanwhile, investors are keeping a wary watch on rising trade tensions as Trump moves to implement his \"America First\" trade policy by introducing steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. In response, China has unveiled plans to immediately impose tariffs on 128 US products, such as pork, fruit, nuts and wine.</p><p>A far greater cause for concern, however, is the Trump administration's threat to impose hefty tariffs on $US60 billion of annual imports from China and to limit China's ability to invest in the US technology sector. Trump has long argued that Beijing puts unfair pressure on US firms to transfer their technology in order to get access to the Chinese market.</p><p>In coming days, the White House is expected to release a list of potentially targeted products, which is expected to include high-tech areas such as semiconductors, communications and aerospace. Investors fear that Beijing is likely to adopt a much more adversarial stance if Washington pushes ahead with this new round of tariffs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6zj9z9x2m137zvi14x</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S11-XBG1-F0J6-J4FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The tech industry, once the darling of the market, now seems to be the black sheep. </p><p>Amazon, a favorite foe of Trump's on the campaign trail, suffered the sharpest losses. Its stock ended the day down nearly 4%. </p><p>Trump previously criticized Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos for having a \"huge antitrust problem\" and \"getting away with murder tax-wise.\" Now Amazon investors must grapple with the possibility of <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>taking aim at the company.</p><p>Apple and Google each ended the day down about 3% and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was down 2% on similar unease.</p><p>\"There are multiple factors you could point to, but obviously the tech group is seeing weakness from regulatory uncertainty,\" says James Cakmak, an analyst who covers the big Internet companies for Monness, Crespi, Hardt &amp; Co.</p><p>Trump has threatened to boycott Apple over its encryption policy and pledged to get the company to \"build their damn computers and things\" in the U.S. rather than in China. </p><p>As a candidate, Trump called out <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>founder for his immigration policies.

The firm also expects more favoritism for car manufacturers over tech companies when it comes to self-driving cars. </p><p>\"Of course big tech companies can work under a <person><nameText>Trump presidency,</nameText></person>\" says Katie Jacobs Stanton, a former Twitter and Google employee who also worked in the <person><nameText>Obama administration. </nameText></person>But she says there is \"huge cause for concern\" on Wall Street given Trump is \"reckless and unpredictable.\"</p><p>There are also clear personal tensions that need to be smoothed over between Silicon Valley and a president-elect known for holding a grudge. </p><p>Top execs from Amazon, Salesforce, Netflix, Tesla and numerous other tech companies openly criticized Trump during his campaign. They compared him to Hitler and designed a card game to make fun of him. Many actively raised money for his opponent.</p><p>Now some prominent tech execs are offering an olive branch.</p><p>\"I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country,\" Bezos tweeted on Thursday, despite having previously accused Trump of \"eroding our democracy.\"</p><p>Amazon's founder may be keeping an \"open mind\" about Trump, but it's unclear if Trump will do the same for Amazon or the rest of the tech industry. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

In the last several months alone, (1) the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) each announced major investigations into digital platforms; (2) as part of its own wide-ranging, bipartisan investigation, the House Judiciary Committee conducted another round of hearings exploring the impact of digital platforms on competition; and (3) in parallel, states have launched their own joint investigation of large technology companies in consultation with the DOJ. These developments underscore the reality that technology companies of all stripes - especially digital platforms - are operating in an increasingly complex, evolving, and fraught regulatory environment.This article discusses recent developments in the U.S. regulatory landscape, explains how they dovetail with broader antitrust enforcement trends, and explores their potential implications for technology companies.DOJ and FTC Investigations Into Digital PlatformsOn July 23, 2019, the DOJ announced[1] that the Antitrust Division has launched a broad 'review' of whether and how 'market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.' Although the announcement did not single out specific companies, it stated that the review is focused on concerns relating to 'search, social media, and some retail services online.' </p><p>In addition, the DOJ noted that it is conferring with and seeking information from various interested parties, including the public and industry participants 'who have direct insight into competition in online platforms.' On August 30, Google's parent company, Alphabet, confirmed that it had received a civil investigative demand (CID) from the DOJ requesting documents and information relating to prior antitrust investigations in the United States and abroad.The DOJ review parallels ongoing efforts by the FTC, which has made examining[2] and investigating[3] the antitrust implications of large technology companies a major enforcement priority. Earlier this year, the FTC launched a Technology Task Force (TTF), a new division of the Bureau of Competition dedicated to 'monitoring competition in U.S. technology markets, investigating any potential anticompetitive conduct in those markets, and taking enforcement actions when warranted.' In addition to examining industry practices and conducting law enforcement investigations, the TTF will coordinate and consult with staff throughout the FTC on technology-related matters, including reviewing prospective and consummated mergers in the technology sector. The TTF is already staffed by at least 17 attorneys detailed from divisions across the Bureau of Competition and will include one or more specialists from the private sector, with direct oversight by senior agency officials. Since its deployment, the TTF has been very busy, proactively meeting with Silicon Valley companies to gather information and considering potential investigations.The extent to which the FTC and DOJ are coordinating their inquiries is unclear. In June, it was reported that the FTC and DOJ reached a formal clearance agreement[4] dividing up review of major technology companies, although such an agreement has not been confirmed by the agencies. It is unusual for the agencies to formally split up 'jurisdiction' over companies. Instead, clearance is typically determined by industry or at the outset of a formal investigation, with investigative authority going to the agency with greater familiarity with the relevant product, service, or sector.State Attorney General InvestigationsFor some time, a large, bipartisan group of state attorneys general (AG) has reportedly been preparing to launch a joint investigation[5] of large technology companies. The states have been closely coordinating their efforts with the DOJ. In July, representatives of several state AGs met with senior DOJ officials and Attorney General William Barr[6] to discuss the investigation. A spokesperson for Arizona's AG noted that the meeting 'involved a discussion of online platforms and a number of concerns regarding consumer protection issues raised by the states,' adding that, '[w]hile DOJ already has an antitrust review of big tech companies underway, the states are weighing all of their available options and considering possible independent courses of action.' Commenting on collaboration between the DOJ and the states, Antitrust Division head Makan Delrahim recently stated that 'it would be a cooperative matter that benefits everybody, and all the states and their enforcement objectives as well as the [companies being investigated].' On September 9, the attorneys general of 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico announced a wide-ranging antitrust investigation of Google, initially focused on online advertising. Today, nearly every state in the United States is involved in sweeping investigations of one or more major technology companies.Congressional Investigation and HearingsIn June, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee announced[7] a bipartisan investigation focused on competition in digital markets. As part of this investigation, on July 16, 2019, the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law held a hearing[8] with representatives from several technology companies. Committee Chairman David Cicilline set a charged tone for the hearing in his opening remarks, stating that the internet has become 'increasingly concentrated, less open, and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship,' and suggesting that large technology companies are creating a 'kill zone' with respect to new competition. He took the FTC and DOJ to task for not doing enough to regulate these platforms, accusing the regulators of giving the companies 'de facto immunity.'Committee members questioned the companies on a range of topics, including their respective market positions in sectors such as e-commerce and social media; their use of terms of service and data policies; the ability of platform owners to wield market power to disadvantage rival participants and benefit their own products and services; and the targeting of nascent competitors in so-called 'killer' acquisitions. The companies' representatives responded to questions in live and written testimony, emphasizing the highly competitive, dynamic, and fragmented nature of the markets at issue and the significant procompetitive benefits stemming from their products and services. Additional Congressional hearings exploring the antitrust implications of large technology platforms will be held in September.Global Enforcement TrendsThese U.S. developments are unfolding in the context of a broader global climate of aggressive and escalating antitrust regulation of digital platforms and other technology companies. Competition authorities around the world are actively pursuing new cases, exploring novel liability theories, and reconsidering whether existing antitrust legal frameworks are equipped to regulate technology companies in the digital economy. For example, as the European Commission's (EC) preliminary investigation of Google's online job search tool continues, 23 rival job search engines recently sent a letter[9] to Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager alleging that Google is abusing its dominance by favoring its own job search results and disadvantaging competitors. Since 2017, the EC has brought several enforcement actions against Google for abuse of dominance (relating to online shopping, Android, and ad intermediation), resulting in over $9 billion in fines. Today, numerous competition authorities around the world are actively investigating technology companies in areas such as e-commerce, digital currency, parental control apps, streaming music, and travel booking, among others.Political ClimateMeanwhile, in the political sphere, an increasingly vocal chorus has been calling for extreme reforms to remedy perceived harms to competition, such as the breakup of 'Big Tech'[10] and the unwinding of consummated mergers. U.S. Senator and presidential candidate ElizabethWarren has unveiled a sweeping plan[11] that proposes 'big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition . . . .' Specifically, the plan calls for legislation classifying large digital platforms as 'utilities,' prohibited from simultaneously owning and participating in their platforms. In addition, the plan proposes to appoint regulators 'committed to using existing tools to unwind anti-competitive mergers.' Echoing this idea, FTC Chairman Simons recently remarked that the FTC would be willing to break up major technology companies if appropriate and necessary to prevent harm to competition, noting that '[i]t's not ideal because it's very messy[,] . . . [b]ut if you have to you have to.'Key Insights and TakeawaysThe scope and pace of new developments in antitrust enforcement in the tech sector are dizzying. However, several key themes are emerging from these developments, foreshadowing where enforcement might be headed. First, a new era of antitrust regulation of technology companies is well underway in the United States and abroad. Foundational antitrust principles (e.g., reliance on the consumer welfare standard and the separation of antitrust and privacy laws) are being questioned, while drastic remedies, such as the breakup of firms, are being considered by enforcers and normalized in the political discourse. Second, antitrust enforcement in this sector is gaining momentum. The foregoing developments may mark the beginning, rather than the culmination, of a long enforcement arc that could continue for many years. Third, technology companies are facing scrutiny from a multitude of sources, including federal and state law enforcement authorities, competition authorities around the world, policymakers, and political figures. Antitrust has become a hot topic in the public domain, taking on a populist dimension as the media covers new developments and fuels the antitrust debate, driving further engagement by key players. As the number of actors propelling aggressive enforcement in the technology sector continues to grow, antitrust exposure increases. Moreover, the pace of enforcement is rapidly accelerating as these entities attempt to keep up with the pace of technological innovation - and one another.In some ways, it remains unclear where these various enforcement vectors may ultimately lead and how they might intersect (e.g., collaboration, jurisdictional tensions, divergent enforcement decisions, and/or duplicative relief). Nonetheless, it is clear that recognizing and managing antitrust risk in this environment requires understanding a complex battle being waged on multiple fronts.[View source[12].] [ 1]: <url

He claimed this is done via 'false narratives linking refugees and migrants to terrorism and scapegoating them for many of society's ills.'Guterres described this groundswell of 'hate speech' as a 'menace to democratic values, social stability, and peace. It spreads like wildfire through social media, the Internet, and conspiracy theories.'Perhaps his most revealing statement of bias was when he combined \"rising anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred.\" </p><p>He neglected to note that part of the rise of anti-Jewish rhetoric has been as a direct result of mass-migration from the Islamic world.The New York Times[1] noted that in a 2013 study about Sweden's spike in anti-Jewish rhetoric and violence, '51 percent of anti-Semitic incidents in Sweden were attributed to Muslim extremists. Only 5 percent were carried out by right-wing extremists; 25 percent were perpetrated by left-wing extremists.' The Times[2] also cited similar problems in France. Guterres' statement was also revealing because anti-Christian rhetoric and terror attacks were not even included in his discussion.When Liberal authorities use terms like 'racism,' they do not mean racism in the the strict sense of racially based hatred. That's why they ignore the race-based, government supported[3] land seizures and killings of white farmers in South Africa.Guterres commented that this 'hate' has found fertile ground 'in liberal democracies and authoritarian systems alike,\" nothing that \"some major political parties and leaders are cutting and pasting ideas from the fringes into their own propaganda and electoral campaigns.'He blamed \"an insidious campaign' against the Global Compact on Migration. The UN chief noted that the campaign \"failed.\" He made his comments at the opening of the 40th session of the UN Human Rights Council on February 25.Seventeen countries either abstained from or openly voted against the compact last December, sparking fiery debate both between and within European powers.'For our part, I have tasked my special adviser for the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, to bring together a UN team to scale up our response to hate speech, define a system-wide strategy and present a global plan of action on a fast-track basis.'However this would manifest online, tech companies seem more than willing to help. Last November, The French government met with U.S. tech giants to declare the 'Paris Call' for regulation[4] of the internet to prevent hate speech. The same big tech companies that are wary of being regulated by the U.S. government in order to protect free speech, will gladly volunteer to be regulated by foreign governments so that they can restrict free speech.

He claimed this is done via 'false narratives linking refugees and migrants to terrorism and scapegoating them for many of society's ills.'Guterres described this groundswell of 'hate speech' as a 'menace to democratic values, social stability, and peace. It spreads like wildfire through social media, the Internet, and conspiracy theories.'Perhaps his most revealing statement of bias was when he combined \"rising anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred.\" </p><p>He neglected to note that part of the rise of anti-Jewish rhetoric has been as a direct result of mass-migration from the Islamic world.The New York Times[1] noted that in a 2013 study about Sweden's spike in anti-Jewish rhetoric and violence, '51 percent of anti-Semitic incidents in Sweden were attributed to Muslim extremists. Only 5 percent were carried out by right-wing extremists; 25 percent were perpetrated by left-wing extremists.' The Times[2] also cited similar problems in France. Guterres' statement was also revealing because anti-Christian rhetoric and terror attacks were not even included in his discussion.When Liberal authorities use terms like 'racism,' they do not mean racism in the the strict sense of racially based hatred. That's why they ignore the race-based, government supported[3] land seizures and killings of white farmers in South Africa.Guterres commented that this 'hate' has found fertile ground 'in liberal democracies and authoritarian systems alike,\" nothing that \"some major political parties and leaders are cutting and pasting ideas from the fringes into their own propaganda and electoral campaigns.'He blamed \"an insidious campaign' against the Global Compact on Migration. The UN chief noted that the campaign \"failed.\" He made his comments at the opening of the 40th session of the UN Human Rights Council on February 25.Seventeen countries either abstained from or openly voted against the compact last December, sparking fiery debate both between and within European powers.'For our part, I have tasked my special adviser for the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, to bring together a UN team to scale up our response to hate speech, define a system-wide strategy and present a global plan of action on a fast-track basis.'However this would manifest online, tech companies seem more than willing to help. Last November, The French government met with U.S. tech giants to declare the 'Paris Call' for regulation[4] of the internet to prevent hate speech. The same big tech companies that are wary of being regulated by the U.S. government in order to protect free speech, will gladly volunteer to be regulated by foreign governments so that they can restrict free speech.

So far at least, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to the most fervent anti-Silicon Valley activists \u2014 mostly on the left, but some on the right \u2014 who are itching to break up Big Tech or at least heavily regulate it, and are mostly coming up short.  </p><p><br/>Sure, the media and policymakers are focusing more and more on the growing societal influence of the platform companies. These are the ones that New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo has nicknamed the \u201cFrightful Five\u201d: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. (Combined stock market value: a bit more than $3 trillion.) These tech titans have been ramping up their public relations and Washington-lobbying efforts for good reason.  <br/>Yet so far it\u2019s an elites-only phenomenon. There\u2019s hardly a growing groundswell of popular opposition to the companies whose online services we all use every day and find incredibly valuable. And the activists have noticed this inconvenient disconnect. \u201cNow that Google, Facebook, Amazon have become world dominators, the questions of the hour are, can the public be convinced to see Silicon Valley as the wrecking ball that it is?\u201d writes Noam Cohen in a pleading New York Times op-ed titled \u201cSilicon Valley is not your friend.\u201d  <br/>But here\u2019s the thing: Most Americans remain pretty friendly toward the tech titans. As noted by Wired, Amazon, Facebook, and Google continue to have high favorability ratings, according to public opinion surveys. Research firm Morning Consult finds Google with an 82 percent net favorability rating, Amazon 77 percent, and Facebook 60 percent. That\u2019s not even frenemy territory. Those companies are also among the most widely admired by Americans aged 18-34. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s been no apparent change in the \u201cbrand health\u201d of Big Tech over the past year, as measured by the YouGov BrandIndex. All that despite a year of terrible headlines, whether it\u2019s Russians using Facebook to influence the U.S. presidential election, sexism at Uber, free speech issues at Google, or more existential concerns that artificial intelligence and robots will destroy the human job market.  <br/>Surely the American public will in time develop a righteous rage over the sector\u2019s \u201cextreme wealth and power,\u201d as Cohen puts it, and that will spur some old-fashioned trustbusting by Washington? If you think data is the new oil, as one tech lobbyist recently told Axios, then Jeff Bezos might be seen by regulators as the new John D. Rockefeller, whose Standard Oil refining giant was declared an illegal monopoly by the Supreme Court in 1911 and broken up.  <br/>Maybe. But consider how the political and policy responses to the 2007-2009 financial crisis and subsequent recession suggest otherwise. The federal government had to launch an unprecedented bailout of the biggest banks to prevent the total implosion of the American financial system. People hated Wall Street with such intensity that even a decade later, most Americans think the megabanks do more to hurt than help their lives.  <br/>And then what happened?

So far at least, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to the most fervent anti-Silicon Valley activists \u2014 mostly on the left, but some on the right \u2014 who are itching to break up Big Tech or at least heavily regulate it, and are mostly coming up short.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sure, the media and policymakers are focusing more and more on the growing societal influence of the platform companies. These are the ones that New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo has nicknamed the \u201cFrightful Five\u201d: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. (Combined stock market value: a bit more than $3 trillion.) These tech titans have been ramping up their public relations and Washington-lobbying efforts for good reason.</p><p>Yet so far it\u2019s an elites-only phenomenon. There\u2019s hardly a growing groundswell of popular opposition to the companies whose online services we all use every day and find incredibly valuable. And the activists have noticed this inconvenient disconnect. \u201cNow that Google, Facebook, Amazon have become world dominators, the questions of the hour are, can the public be convinced to see Silicon Valley as the wrecking ball that it is?\u201d writes Noam Cohen in a pleading New York Times op-ed titled \u201cSilicon Valley is not your friend.\u201d</p><p>But here\u2019s the thing: Most Americans remain pretty friendly toward the tech titans. As noted by Wired, Amazon, Facebook, and Google continue to have high favorability ratings, according to public opinion surveys. Research firm Morning Consult finds Google with an 82 percent net favorability rating, Amazon 77 percent, and Facebook 60 percent. That\u2019s not even frenemy territory. Those companies are also among the most widely admired by Americans aged 18-34. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s been no apparent change in the \u201cbrand health\u201d of Big Tech over the past year, as measured by the YouGov BrandIndex. All that despite a year of terrible headlines, whether it\u2019s Russians using Facebook to influence the U.S presidential election, sexism at Uber, free speech issues at Google, or more existential concerns that artificial intelligence and robots will destroy the human job market.</p><p>Surely the American public will in time develop a righteous rage over the sector\u2019s \u201cextreme wealth and power,\u201d as Cohen puts it, and that will spur some old-fashioned trustbusting by Washington? If you think data is the new oil, as one tech lobbyist recently told Axios, then Jeff Bezos might be seen by regulators as the new John D. Rockefeller, whose Standard Oil refining giant was declared an illegal monopoly by the Supreme Court in 1911 and broken up.</p><p>Maybe. But consider how the political and policy responses to the 2007-2009 financial crisis and subsequent recession suggest otherwise. The federal government had to launch an unprecedented bailout of the biggest banks to prevent the total implosion of the American financial system. People hated Wall Street with such intensity that even a decade later, most Americans think the megabanks do more to hurt than help their lives.</p><p>And then what happened? Well, Congress in 2010 passed the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Which was significant. But given the circumstances, that effort seems in retrospect a minimalist response. Despite all sorts of think tank plans on how to shrink the megabanks or even break them up, they\u2019re bigger and more powerful than ever. \u201cThe [too big to fail] problem continues to be one of the most serious long-term risks to the U.S economy,\u201d notes the Minneapolis Federal Reserve.</p><p>Washington didn\u2019t bust up the megabanks.

Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  I'm about to suggest something that sounds controversial: Maybe it's good that we keep discovering biased algorithms?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Let's rewind. A pair of articles this past week revealed that software that is used to make decisions on the behalf of humans appears to do so with gender bias.</p><p>  First, it came to light that the algorithm that calculates credit quotas for Apple's new credit card may give higher limits to men than to women. Goldman Sachs, which issues the card, said its credit decisions were ''based on a customer's creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law.''</p><p>  And my colleague Cade Metz reported that artificial intelligence services from Google and Amazon both failed to recognize the word ''hers'' as a pronoun, but correctly identified ''his.'' Other, similar algorithms ''generally don't give women enough credit'' when analyzing text, he added.</p><p>  This isn't surprising. Algorithms are written by humans, who are inherently biased -- and that can seep into the way they frame the analysis that underlies their code. Artificial intelligence software is trained on data that contains all kinds of human biases, which can then appear in its own inferences.</p><p>  ''What algorithms are doing is giving you a look in the mirror,'' Sandra Wachter, an associate professor in law and A.I. ethics at Oxford University, told me. ''They reflect the inequalities of our society.''</p><p>  That we often see inequality is troubling. If software is going to choose a credit limit, it should do so fairly. If A.I. is supposed to parse information for us, we would like it to do so objectively.</p><p>  The problem is, algorithms are everywhere, making decisions on our behalf in ways that are often opaque to us. ''How many times am I not seeing certain jobs ads? How many times do I get advertised higher prices?'' Professor Wachter asked. ''I often don't know that I'm being treated unfairly.''</p><p>  In that sense, the more often we unearth cases of bias, the better. Because not only is it one algorithm fewer left unchecked, it's more evidence to demonstrate why we must solve the problem.</p><p>  Not that that's easy, of course. Computer scientists are trying to work out how to spot and remove bias in data; others are developing ways to make algorithms better able to explain their decisions. And there are pushes to force companies to be more transparent and accountable about how they use algorithms. It's a slog, but it is happening.</p><p>  ''It's unrealistic to assume that we'll ever have a neutral system,'' Professor Wachter said. ''But with the right systems in place, we can mitigate some of the biases.''</p><p>  Banking With Big Tech</p><p>  With that Apple Card article fresh in your mind, now is a good moment to think about Big Tech's push into personal finance.</p><p>Google announced that it was teaming up with Citigroup and the Stanford Federal Credit Union to offer a ''smart checking'' account next year. Exactly what that will entail is unclear, but Google says it will help bank customers ''benefit from useful insights and budgeting tools,'' via its Pay app.</p><p>  Also, Facebook unveiled a digital payment system, called Pay, that will let users make payments across its Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms. That's alongside its separate initiative to revolutionize the world of global finance with its own cryptocurrency, Libra.</p><p>  This is all unsurprising. The companies are attracted to the prospect of a new revenue stream. The question is whether or not they can make a go of it.</p><p>  Regulators and lawmakers are already unimpressed. New York State regulators said they would investigate the potentially discriminatory algorithm used by Apple Card. Libra has come under immense criticism from all sides because people don't trust it. And Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, already said of Google's banking effort to CNBC: ''There ought to be very strict scrutiny.''</p><p>  But there's another question here: Do people even want to use Big Tech to bank? There's a lot of inertia in the world of personal finance, and persuading people to switch from their bank to Apple or Google or Facebook will require features with genuine utility, or higher interest rates, or something else stellar. Fear about financial data privacy is probably a concern for consumers, too. In other words, it's a high bar.</p><p>  Hunger for Health Data</p><p>  News surfaced that a partnership between Google and the hospital provider Ascension could allow the data of the health care company's patients -- 50 million in total -- to be uploaded to Google's cloud-computing platform. Without patients or doctors being notified, some of that data, including names, dates of birth, lab tests and diagnoses, were already being uploaded.</p><p>  Ascension said it was exploring ''machine-learning applications that will have the potential to support improvements in clinical quality'' through the deal. Google said it would provide ''tools that Ascension could use to support improvements in clinical quality and patient safety.''</p><p>  This may all be totally O.K. It's perfectly legal for health care providers to share patients' medical information with business partners like electronic medical record companies. Still, the Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services plans to seek more information about whether it complies with the law anyway.</p><p>  Nonetheless, many people found it unnerving. That's probably because of Google's motivations: According to The Wall Street Journal, Google hasn't charged Ascension for the work because it hopes to develop systems based on what it learns. It would eventually sell those systems to other health care providers.</p><p>  Again, there's nothing wrong with that. But it comes off as a little tone deaf to slurp up data as intimate as health care records without informing patients, at a time when data privacy concerns are more heightened than ever.</p><p>  Stories You Shouldn't Miss</p><p/><p>Apple plans to sell an augmented-reality headset by 2022 and augmented-reality glasses in 2023, according to a report by The Information.</p><p>Microsoft will honor California's new privacy law across the United States.

But today's tech firms are decades-old dinosaurs in Internet years. Even the youngest of the big four that testified before Congress in July--Facebook--was founded in 2004. That durability has caused concern among the public, political leaders from both parties, and even academics who are normally sure markets will evolve past any given monopolist.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some say we should break up these big tech firms. Others want to regulate parts of them (like their data) as utilities available to others. But such dramatic interventions are hard to get right and costly to get wrong. Worse, they may not solve a core problem that could reproduce concentration even if todays market leaders are split up: startups too often sell out to their rivals rather than compete with them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem traces to a surprising source: the way we fund startups. The venture capital (VC) funding model has had enormous benefits for innovation. But it has shifted the focus on getting paid from making a profit and paying debts to selling stock.</p><p>In Silicon Valley today, the most important thing to think about when starting a company is how you're going to end it. From the moment founders and funders first put time and money towards a company in exchange for stock, they begin to envision their \"exit strategy\"--how they will reap their reward by selling that stock to someone else. And increasingly, selling stock means selling the company.</p><p>In common lore, the preferred exit is a public stock sale. Countless people buy a company's stock through an initial public offering (IPO) and the company continues to compete. But in practice, IPOs are increasingly rare, dropping from 80 percent of successful exits three decades ago to less than 10 percent today.</p><p>Instead of going public, most founders and funders exit by selling the entire company. A single firm buys all of the company's stock through a private acquisition (M&amp;A) and the acquired startup often stops competing separately--or closes altogether. Today, nine in 10 venture-backed firms that exit do so by acquisition rather than IPO.</p><p>This focus on exit--and in particular on today's exit of choice, the acquisition--limits disruptive competition, cements tech monopolies, and stalls the innovation that Silicon Valley once promised.</p><p>What makes exit by acquisition so troubling for market competition and consumers is this: the buyer willing to pay the most for a startup is often the firm with the most to lose from the startup's success, and the only firm likely to buy it just to shut it down. Other buyers stand to gain a small share in a more competitive marketplace. But the incumbent buyer seeks to maintain its share in an uncompetitive market--one where it can sell fewer units, charge higher prices, impose less consumer-friendly terms (such as on user privacy), and/or forego investments on quality (such as on thoughtful, fair, and effective content moderation). That's worth a lot more.</p><p>Even if the incumbent doesn't buy a promising startup just to kill it, as a practical matter the acquisition may have the same effect. Silicon Valley is littered with the corpses of hundreds of promising companies that sold out to Google, Facebook, and the like, only to be quietly shut down a few years later, the employees leaving or being transferred to other projects the acquirer values more.</p><p>And even if none of that happens--even if the acquired company continues operating--the result of the acquisition is to co-opt a potential disruptive competitor. No wonder tech companies have become so entrenched--they have shut down the cycle of creative destruction by buying up the competitors that might have grown into threats.</p><p>The current pandemic may make this result more common--with lasting consequences. Consumer demand is depressed. Suppliers are disrupted. There is less money to invest in keeping startups going. And startups, unable to make and sell profitably, may struggle even more than usual to battle incumbents. Meanwhile, the big incumbents are sitting on vast sums of cash. As a result, even more startups than usual may seek to be acquired. And when they do, the most likely purchasers are big tech companies, among the few that are weathering the current crisis.</p><p>In our recent paper for the Stanford Law and Economics Research Paper Series, \"Exit Strategy' we describe this cycle of acquisition by incumbents and ways to break it using both carrots and sticks. Carrots can encourage innovative startups to keep competing--making alternative exits or continued operation more attractive than selling out. And sticks can stop innovative startups from selling to market leaders except when essential.</p><p>Encouraging IPOs: One set of carrots would make exiting by IPO easier than it is now. IPOs are costlier than they used to be and now require legal diligence that can take a year or more. Even after some shares start trading, securities law and private contracts typically \"lock up\" VC shares for six or more months. These seemingly trivial delays can dramatically drag down the annualized rate of return achieved through IPOs, bringing it below what VCs need and what they can achieve through acquisition (the time value of money makes an otherwise identical exit price less valuable if it comes later).</p><p>It wasn't always that way. The average time to exit by public offering is now twice what it was in the late 1990s. Once one year faster than acquisitions, time to exit by IPO is now one to two years slower on average. We could make IPOs a more attractive exit strategy by relaxing some regulatory requirements and making them faster again.</p><p>Similarly, we could make undergoing an IPO less risky. The Securities and Exchange Commission is already considering letting firms do more to \"test the waters\" before committing to an IPO.</p><p>Finally, we could make achieving an IPO more valuable by reducing some of the strictures placed upon public companies. Some were relaxed during the last recession and, where successful, those reforms could be made permanent. Right now, Postmates is simultaneously considering an IPO and an acquisition by Uber. Public policy can do more to make the IPO option more swift and attractive as an exit.</p><p>Encouraging secondary markets: Another set of carrots would make private sales of stock to other investors easier without having to go public at all. Current laws heavily limit such secondary sales. These measures are supposed to protect unsophisticated investors--generally a good thing. But supporting secondary markets could let hinders, founders, and employees cash out and reap the value they create without being forced to sell the company to a firm that might shut it down.</p><p>Tax reform: A third set of carrots would use tax policy to make all of these exits more attractive than exit by incumbent acquisition. Right now, no matter which way a startup exits, its VCs enjoy tax breaks on the income made from selling that startups stock. But different exits have different consequences for consumers and society. The tax code should treat them differently, too. The Qualified Small Business Stock exception (QSBS), for instance, is supposed to reward VCs for funding bold businesses that succeed. Selling out to the market leader isn't the kind of success society should care about. The QSBS exception should be reformed so it does not apply in those cases. The low capital gains rate, if preserved at all, should be reformed so it does not apply to income from those sales, either.</p><p>Other sources of money: Finally, we could encourage more startups to use venture debt instead of venture equity. Startups now typically raise money by selling equity, not debt. That's because startups are risky and rarely profitable early on. Selling equity generates cash for the company in exchange for an ownership claim on the firm and its future profits--putting off the need for profitability. Taking on debt, by contrast, generates cash in exchange for a future payment or stream of payments--thus requiring the near-term profitability startups rarely have. But venture debt may be a good fit in more cases than founders and hinders realize. Public policy could help more businesses take a second look at this financing. Tax policy could help. Right now, while VCs get tax benefits on income from selling startup equity, banks do not get tax benefits on income from selling startup debt. We could grant banks a qualified small business interest income or \"QSBI\" exemption to match the VCs' QSBS exemption.</p><p>Antitrust law: But those carrots need to be coupled with sticks that discourage anti-competitive acquisitions. We should change the antitrust laws to focus on who is acquiring startups. Right now, it's too easy for incumbents to buy startups that might challenge them. Mergers are now presumptively allowed. Those beneath $200 million in value are not even reviewed by the antitrust agencies. And when larger acquisitions do trigger review, the government rarely seeks to block them.</p><p>Recent evidence from a paper entitled \"Killer Acquisitions,\" by Cunningham, Ederer, and Ma, suggests this system isn't working well. For one, companies appear to time and structure mergers to avoid the review threshold. For another, merging companies promise societal benefits--such as cost savings from consolidation that can be passed to consumers--that evidence suggests are not commonly realized. And especially when dominant firms are involved, merging comes at a real cost to competition.</p><p>We should presumptively ban incumbent monopolists from acquiring competitive startups of any size. And we should also worry about companies buying startups that don't directly compete with the incumbent but that contribute to a possible platform or market structure that could make the old market obsolete.</p><p>That presumption should be rebuttable. In cases where complete failure is the only alternative, acquisition by an incumbent may be the best outcome. The incumbent might continue serving the acquired startup's customers, possibly while employing its workers and improving its technology. But these cases can be hard to tell from those in which the startup could squeak by or even surprisingly expand, whether alone or by merging with a smaller rival or new entrant. So far this year, Facebook bought Giphy, a database of GIFs used widely on social media. Google is buying Fitbit. And Uber, after failing to acquire Grubhub (acquired instead by European rival Just Eat Takeaway), is now looking at Postmates.</p><p>Past periods of economic disruption have led to changes in the competitive landscape that benefited society; we don't want this period of disruption to simply lead to even more complete market consolidation.</p><p>Our carrots and sticks won't fix the problem of today's entrenched tech monopolies. But they will allow the next generation of companies that might displace the tech giants to make it to market. And by doing so, they enable the Schumpeterian \"gale of destruction\" that keeps monopolists on their toes and ensures that newer and better technologies displace their predecessors.</p><p>Silicon Valley changed the world. It did so because founders and venture capitalists wanted to win tomorrow's markets, not sell out to those who had already won yesterday's. We should make sure founders and venture capitalists keep incumbents on their feet and don't tire of the chase. And that means venture capitalists and tech companies must--as Steve Jobs urged Stanford's graduating class in 2005--\"stay hungry\"</p><p>by MARK A. LEMLEY AND ANDREW MCCREARY</p><p>Mark A.

Corleone tightened his control over organized crime while standing in church, quietly renouncing Satan.On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pulled off the Corleone strategy. She used the introduction of articles of impeachment (the baptism) as cover to secure major deals on trade, drug prices, immigration, and defense, all in the same day and at the same time. While those not distracted by the holidays fixated on the impeachment drama, Pelosi settled the fights raging among the Democratic caucus all year. </p><p>And though progressives didn't get completely rolled, there are consequences to the Pelosi blitz that will reverberate in the 2020 elections, and for decades into the future.Let's start with the successful power play from the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), who forced Pelosi to the negotiating table and won a couple long-sought changes[2] to her top priority, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act. That probably matters far more than the substance of the compromise, especially since this bill is going nowhere fast in the Senate.Pelosi was content and in fact gleeful to ignore CPC co-chairs, Representatives Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and Mark Pocan (D-WI), believing she could muscle the bill through and crush the rebellion, the same way she froze out progressives all year on drug prices. Jayapal and Pocan, ridiculed by anonymous Pelosi aides, remained firm, finding the votes necessary to tank the bill and leveraging that into a negotiation. That means something for the future; progressives must be respected in policymaking. 'This is a huge win, and it shows what we can do when we stick together and all push hard for the American people,' says Jayapal in a statement to the Prospect.All that said, even the CPC statement acknowledges, 'We didn't get everything we wanted.' The CPC had four priorities going in: Ensure that negotiated prices applied to the uninsured, strike the non-interference clause that bans government price negotiations with drug companies, increase the number of drugs negotiated every year, and restore the Jayapal amendment that caps annual drug price spikes at the rate of inflation in the employer-sponsored plans serving 150 million people. Though the amendment had passed the House Education and Labor Committee, Pelosi watered it down to a study, a common technique to kill a policy. (Incredibly, in a Dear Colleague letter on Monday, Pelosi took credit for including the study.)In the end, they got two out of four. Under the bill, the government would still negotiate a minimum of 25 drugs in year one, but that would double to 50 in year two and stay constant thereafter (this was a priority for Pocan). And the Jayapal amendment did get restored, in an even stronger fashion than when it passed the Education and Labor Committee. But help for the uninsured did not come. Last Friday I quoted Nicole Smith-Holt[3], whose uninsured son died from lack of access to insulin. The bill 'wouldn't have saved his life,' Smith-Holt told me. It still won't.Of course, the bill won't save anyone's life, because it's not going to become law. This was a messaging bill, strengthened somewhat by CPC leaders who communicated to Pelosi they wouldn't be ignored and had to be reckoned with. That alone improves the future for progressive priorities.The other three bills cemented on Tuesday all will likely become law, all with bipartisan votes. First, Pelosi got AFL-CIO president Rich Trumka to sign off[4] on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), handing Trump a political victory on one of his signature issues. Predictably, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham immediately gushed, calling USMCA 'the biggest and best trade agreement in the history of the world.'It's, um, not that. Economically, USMCA is a nothingburger; even the most rose-colored analysis[5] with doubtful assumptions built in shows GDP growth of only 0.06 percent per year. There's one good provision: the elimination of the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provision that allowed corporations to sue governments in secret tribunals over trade violations. There's one bad provision: the extension of legal immunity[6] for tech platforms over user-generated content, put into a trade deal for the first time. This will make the immunity shield, codified in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, much harder to alter in the future. Pelosi has called this deal a 'template' for future agreements, though trade reformers have called it a bare minimum floor.Pelosi tried to remove the immunity shield[7], but abandoned the request. She did succeed in removing a provision for Big Pharma[8] that extended exclusivity periods for biologics. The Sierra Club has termed the deal an 'environmental failure[9]' that will not have binding standards on clean air and water or climate goals. But the threshold question on the USMCA was always going to be labor enforcement: would the labor laws imposed on Mexico hold, improving their lot while giving U.S. manufacturing workers a chance to compete? There was also the open question of why the U.S. would reward Mexico with a trade deal update when trade unionists in the country continue to be kidnapped and killed[10].In his statement, Trumka lauds the labor enforcement, noting provisions that make it easier to prove violations (including violence against workers), rules of evidence for disputes, and inspections of Mexican facilities, a key win. But I've been told that the AFL-CIO did not see the details of the text before signing off, which is unforgivable, especially on trade where details matter. There was no vote by union leaders[11], just a briefing from the AFL-CIO.At least one union, the Machinists, remains opposed[12], and others were noncommittal until they see text. The Economic Policy Institute, which is strongly tied to labor, called the agreement 'weak tea at best[13],' a tiny advance on the status quo that will not reverse decades of outsourcing of U.S. jobs.So why did Trumka, who Pelosi gave the ability to approve or reject the USMCA, decide to support it? Labor has felt self-imposed pressure to say yes to a trade deal, to counter the Chamber of Commerce's claims that they're purely contrarian. Trumka may have seen this as minimally harmful and a good way to rebut the charge. Plus, the significant minority of labor's rank and file's supports Trump, another cross-pressure that may have been a factor.While the economics are negligible (and potentially harmful on tech policy), on the politics activists are losing their mind[14] at the prospect of a Trump signing ceremony, with labor by his side, on a deal that he will construe as keeping promises to Midwest voters. 'Any corporate Democrat who pushed to get this agreement passed that thinks Donald Trump is going to share the credit for those improvements is dangerously gullible,' said Yvette Simpson, CEO of Democracy for America, in a statement. Only a small handful of Democratic centrists[15] were pushing for a USMCA vote, based mostly on the idea that they had to 'do something' to show that they could get things done in Congress. Now they've got it, and they'll have to live with the consequences.USMCA and the drug bill weren't the only items Pelosi ticked off on Tuesday. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a perennial passed every year that always includes a vast amount of policymaking, got through a House-Senate conference committee, with a floor vote imminent. Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) called the $738 billion authorization[16] 'an bill of astonishing moral cowardice.' Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) came out in opposition[17] as well. Earlier versions included bipartisan bans on using funds for war with Iran or continuing to support the war in Yemen. Both of those were stripped out. Another measure regulating toxic PFAS chemicals as a hazardous substance in drinking water, passed unanimously in the House, also got killed.Pelosi chalked that up to 'Senate GOP obstruction' in a statement, while touting the addition of paid family leave for government employees and the end of the so-called 'widow's tax[18]' for military spouses. There's one other big win on military procurement, as negotiators kept in an amendment[19] that will allow contracting officers to demand certified cost information for parts and equipment they purchase. This will better ensure reasonable prices by giving the government the data it needs to prevent ripoffs from defense contractors like TransDigm, which according to a February inspector general report[20] received excessive profits with markups up to 4,451 percent on nearly all the products it sold to the government.Pelosi also moved forward on a controversial farmworkers bill, which will get a floor vote this week. As David Bacon explained for the Prospect[21], the bill provides a pathway to legal residency for undocumented farmworkers, but maintains and expands guest worker programs that cut down on pay. Daniel Costa of the Economic Policy Institute explains[22] that the bill would codify a Trump administration rule that would force downward wage rates for a majority of migrant guest workers. It's kind of a devil's bargain\u2014legal status for some in exchange for lower wages for many.This spray of year-end legislation comes while the political world is monomaniacally focused on impeachment. The first question Pelosi got at her press conference on USMCA was whether it was a coincidence that the deal timing overlapped with the impeachment articles. 'It's just as we get to the end of a session there have to be decisions made,' she said.That's certainly what happened. And if Trump gets re-elected, if Big Tech continues to evade accountability, if imperial adventures continue abroad, if migrant farmworkers cannot feed their families, you can trace it back to this Tuesday, and the actions a House Speaker took while nobody was paying attention.

Age-restricted videos are automatically blocked from showing up in its YouTube Kids app, the company said. The policy change follows revelations that YouTube is pointing kids to thousands of disturbing videos involving kids characters and that some of those videos are making their way to YouTube Kids. </p><p>Following revelations that YouTube is serving up to kids thousands of inappropriate and disturbing videos, the company said it will step up its efforts to prevent children from seeing such content.  YouTube will restrict access to\u00a0videos involving\u00a0children's characters that are flagged for having content that's inappropriate for kids, the company said in a statement. Users won't be able to watch such videos unless they are logged into the site and are older than 17. Such age-restricted videos are already automatically blocked from showing up in YouTube Kids, the company's app that's designed for children under 13, YouTube said. So when videos are flagged for inappropriate content, they shouldn't show up in YouTube Kids.\u00a0 \"The YouTube team is made up of parents who are committed to improving our apps and getting this right,\" the company said in a statement.\u00a0 The Verge previously reported[1] the move.\u00a0 YouTube\u00a0plans to start age-restricting such flagged videos in coming weeks. It's in the process of training its team of moderators, which review videos on its site, to recognize and flag such videos.\u00a0The company\u00a0also relies on its users to alert it to content that violates its guidelines.\u00a0 The changes follow the publication of\u00a0a popular Medium article[2]\u00a0and a New York Times story[3]\u00a0about the thousands of disturbing videos on YouTube that target young viewers.\u00a0While the videos\u00a0frequently depict[4]\u00a0popular children's characters, they're typically knockoffs made by obscure or anonymous producers, rather than by the recognized studios that own the rights to the characters.\u00a0Although the inappropriate, knockoff videos depict those characters in lewd, violent,\u00a0or disturbing scenarios, YouTube often lists them alongside benign official videos from the characters' owners. The videos\u00a0are primarily found on YouTube's main site and service and can generally be viewed by anyone visiting the site. But The Times reported that some of them have shown up even in YouTube Kids.\u00a0 The move to restrict access to the flagged videos was not a direct response to the recent press reports but has been in the works for some time,\u00a0YouTube told The Verge[5]. The policy update is YouTube's second move this year to discourage the proliferation of disturbing videos featuring family-friendly characters. In August, the company updated its advertising policy to bar such videos from including ads. NOW WATCH: Here are the most important differences between the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X[6]See Also: Sen.

For example while Hawley and the Trump FCC/DOJ have made an endless stink about the power of \"big tech,\" that's largely for performative political reasons[1], namely to perpetuate the utterly false[2] claim that Conservatives are being \"censored,\" to bully tech giants away from encryption, or to frighten them away from finally doing something about the (profitable) bigotry and disinformation problems that plague their networks. Oddly, this performative, sometimes vindictive nonsense is often conflated with actually caring about monopoly power and reforming antitrust. You only need to look at the DOJ and FCC's mindless rubber stamping of every fleeting whim of the US telecom industry, one of the most heavily monopolized (and widely despised) sectors in technology. </p><p>While T-Mobile was getting the red carpet rolled out for its competition and job killing merger with Sprint[3], Bill Barr's DOJ was busy hassling small cannabis companies[4], or filing empty-headed \"antitrust\" lawsuits against automakers[5] for agreeing to limit emissions. Studies from the likes of the Antitrust Institute[6] (pdf) have made it very clear: the Trump administration's interest in \"antitrust reform\" is utterly and completely hollow. During an era when lagging antitrust enforcement needed to be meaningfully improved and reformed, the Trump administration instead began wielding antitrust as a political bludgeon to gain leverage over its enemies and dole out favors to its allies. It's mindless theater and an abuse of the law, yet it's often portrayed as serious adult policy making by many experts and the press. Despite ongoing whistleblower investigations of Barr's politicization of antitrust[7], his DOJ is now rubber stamping the merger between native advertising platforms Taboola and Outbrain[8]. EU and UK regulators have been scrutinizing the deal[9], arguing it will erode competition in the native advertising (read: clickbait) space, resulting in notably worse terms for already struggling publishers who face getting an even smaller share of advertising revenue:\"The Competition and Markets Authority said it has concerns the merger will result in a substantial lessening of competition and that it will investigate further unless the businesses take steps to address them...Many national and local news websites in the UK use one of the two services and the CMA said a 'large proportion' of the publishers it contacted as part of its initial investigations were concerned about the potential impact of the deal.\"More specifically, UK regulators say[10] the combined companies would enjoy an 80% market share for the clickbait online recommendations market:\"Taboola and Outbrain are the 2 largest providers of content recommendation services to publishers in the UK, with a combined market share of over 80%. They supply very similar services and are each other's main competitor. In particular, the companies' internal documents and information received from publishers showed the strong competition between the companies. If the merger were to go ahead, the CMA is concerned that publishers in the UK will have a reduced choice of supplier for content recommendation services. This could result in a worsening of terms for publishers and a reduction in their share of advertising revenue. A large proportion of the publishers contacted by the CMA were concerned about the impact of the deal if it goes ahead.\"Many in the marketing sector have echoed those sentiments, stating the only thing the merger really accomplishes is creating a \"gigantic vortex of crap\": A @Taboola[11] and @Outbrain[12] merger would create a gigantic vortex of crap -- a black hole that would suck everything decent out of the internet and replace it with clickbait, misinformation, and propaganda. It would almost be as bad as Facebook. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co\">https://t.co</url> /DAQYXqi0fS[13] \u2014 Samuel Scott (@samueljscott) June 26, 2020[14]In contrast there's been little to no serious scrutiny by the Barr DOJ[15], which apparently didn't spend too much time thinking about the deal's potential pitfalls:\"The Taboola-Outbrain merger had been proposed by the companies' executives as way for publishers to monetize digital content outside of Big Tech's monopolies. But some publishers Adweek has been talking to question how the merged company would be structured and what sort of terms it would offer publishers. 'What will be interesting is what happens to yield?' a publishing source told Adweek. 'Will this be an improvement? Will the joined forces allow more yield to flow through to publishers? Or does this actually remove some competition in such a way that yield suffers? I don't know.'Now, maybe the Trump DOJ seriously looked at this deal intelligently and greenlit it based on adult policy making (they've yet to explain the approval). But based on what we've seen in the last year or two (like DOJ antitrust boss Delrahim using his personal phone and text message accounts[16] to personally guide T-Mobile to merger approval, something, it should go without saying, antitrust enforcers should not be doing), that's giving them too much credit. It could really be as simple as the fact that Taboola execs told the DOJ this might potentially challenge \"big tech,\" and that was enough for them. That's the problem when you start abusing legal authority with reckless abandon--you lose any trust or faith in the idea that your decisions are actually being based on the data.

We were up, we were down, essentially, we're flat. Today is Wednesday, September 5th. Under oath, Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey get grilled about foreign influence on Facebook and Twitter. A warning from a former Mexican President who tells me abandoning the NAFTA deal will only make the situation at the US border worse; and an honest day's work, the former \"Cosby\" star has a message for those who tried to bring him down. I am Paula Newton and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey under oath before Congress admitting they haven't done enough to shut down fake accounts and curb election interference. Now all the parties came into the room with their own set of priorities. For Democrats, a look back at Russian interference in the 2016 US election, for the Republicans alleged bias against conservatives. Progressives want controls on hate speech and the tech companies want to avoid new regulations that would harm their businesses, but the beginning of the hearing was as much about the issues as who was and remember, who wasn't there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You solemnly swear to give this committee the truth, the whole truth and nothing but t truth, so help you God.</p><p>MARK WARNER, US SENATOR, VIRGINIA, DEMOCRAT: I am deeply disappointed that Google, one of the most influential digital platforms in the world chose not to send its own top corporate leadership to engage in this committee because I know our members have a series of difficult questions about structural vulnerabilities on a number of Google's platforms that we will need answers for.</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK: Russia used social media as part of, and I quote, \"A comprehensive and multifaceted campaign to sow discord, undermine Democratic institutions and interfere in US elections and those of our allies.\" We were too slow to spot this and too slow to act. That is on us.</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER: We must ask the question, \"What is Twitter incentivizing people to do or not do and why?\" The answers will lead to tectonic shifts in Twitter and our industry operates.</p><p>SANDBERG: We don't think it is a question of whether regulation, we think it's a question of the right regulation that supports users is transparent and doesn't squash innovation and we are happy to work with you on the proposal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: OK, now shares of tech companies - not sure if it even had to do with the hearings - fell sharply. Twitter down about 6 percent, Facebook and Google were less affected though as you could see there. Now, CNN's senior media and tech correspondents are covering it all, Brian Stelter and Laurie Segall are here. Laurie first to you, the nuts and bolts of it. For how many years you've actually been covering where deregulation could or count be applied. Did they really get into that today?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR MEDIA AND TECH CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they didn't actually get into it as much as I thought they would. They came with the idea that we have to have an honest conversation about regulation. You have Sheryl Sandberg saying what we've heard her say before, which is, it is not regulations, it is the right kind of regulation, but you didn't hear the nuts and bolts of it.</p><p>I will say today, having been in the room for Mark Zuckerberg's testimony, it felt a lot more civil despite the fact that Alex Jones - before Alex Jones came in and crashed the testimony a bit. It did have a more of a - we're happy that you are doing this. We're happy that you two showed up, not Google, but we're happy that you're here having this conversation and it's to look for what have you done to protect us and what have you already done ahead of the midterms. It was a very different feel.</p><p>And the other hearing right now with Jack Dorsey is currently going on and that is more nuts and bolts. That's more how do these algorithms work? That's also a lot of conservatives saying are you suppressing our voice? There's been rumors that they have been doing that. There has been criticism around that.</p><p>So all in all, a really interesting and informative day; not as much explosive stuff as I know --</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA AND TECH CORRESPONDENT: No, and the senators actually seemed more knowledgeable than they did a few weeks ago, a few months ago or a few years ago.</p><p>NEWTON: Thank goodness, they were briefed. They did some research --</p><p>STELTER: I was relieved to see that there was a better level of knowledge on the part of these elected officials than there have been before.</p><p>NEWTON: Brian, I want to ask you as well, in terms of when we talk about where this could go once we hear the hearings - a lot of people are asking why aren't they regulated the way we are, for instance? The way media is in general? It is an open question still.</p><p>STELTER: But I think the answer is that because historically, Republican governments have been loose about regulations. The Trump administration has been all about deregulation and the tech industry is one of the caveats there. Trump has been talking in vague confusing terms about wanting to see actions taken against big tech, and nobody really knows what he means and I'm not sure he knows what he means.</p><p>So for now, I don't see any real practical proposals on the table. What I see are a lot of people huffing and puffing about the concerns of alleged censorship. It really means companies are stuck between really two different positions. On the one hand, folks mostly on the right saying you are censoring me, you are suppressing my free speech; and then on the other side, from the left and from media companies, and from all sorts of critics --</p><p>[16:05:14]</p><p>STELTER: -- people are saying what are you doing about misinformation? And hoax as in fake news on their platforms? It's a really difficult position for these companies to be in.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and Jack Dorsey was asked you know basically, shouldn't you be letting people that use your platform know when perhaps they've been duped by some kind of an --</p><p>STELTER: I was blown away by what Sheryl Sandberg said about the number of fake accounts that they are dealing with on Facebook, more than a billion. At any given time, 3 percent or 4 percent of the accounts on Facebook are inauthentic and they are having to take them down every day. So every day, Facebook is fighting these battles trying to delete misinformation and hoaxes and spammers, but it is a battle.</p><p>SEGALL: And I will say, and Twitter has a whole separate problem, and that's what you heard Jack Dorsey today talk about, it was Senator Warner, who asked, do people have the right, and I thought this was such a fascinating question - do, us, users have a right to know if we are being contacted by a human or a machine? And by machine they're talking about a bot, an automated account that Twitter has this bot problem.</p><p>And what Jack Dorsey said is, we have been thinking a lot about this and it's something we are looking into, informing people and I think transparency and context were the two words they kind of pulled out from a lot of this stuff today, but we don't exactly know. You've mentioned this before, we don't exactly know what this looks like, but users need more context about what they are seeing online because we've now entered this place where we don't know where truth is, what disinformation is and I think that's a really hard place for these tech entrepreneurs and that's a really hard place to regulate.</p><p>NEWTON: And you had been saying earlier that Jack Dorsey has this concept, it's a very nice concept that really cleaves to the First Amendment right in this country which are different than it is around the world, the fact that this digital town square has to be preserved.</p><p>SEGALL: Sure, it was so fascinating to me because he keeps talking about this digital town square, I want to play you the sound and then I'm going to get to a larger point. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DORSEY: We don't believe that we can create a digital public square for people if they don't feel safe to participate in the first place. And that is our number one and singular objective as a company is to increase the health of this public space.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEGALL This idea of a town - this public square, this was the promise and I've been covering tech for almost a decade. You interviewed Evan Williams, the founder of Twitter; you've interviewed Jack Dorsey. They all talk about this town square, we could all come - and we can --</p><p>STELTER: It sounds so nice.</p><p>SEGALL: And we could speak our truth and the Internet promised to be this place where we could all come and we could have discord, we could - you could have all sorts of people. And the idea was that the smart would win through, or it would be a place for anyone, but then there's this idea of the tragedy of the commons, where if you don't have the proper structure in place, that that part gets crowded that people can't even get there, so now fast forward to the concept of the internet and social media now, you don't have good voices being able to win through, you have bots and trolling and there haven't been the proper structures in place.</p><p>You had one senator asking Jack Dorsey about women being able to use Twitter, which I was very grateful for this comment, how it's very different for women to be on Twitter --</p><p>NEWTON: It becomes so --</p><p>STELTER: -- with the amount of harassment.</p><p>SEGALL: Yes, and that idea of the tragedy of the commons. And I think that's the part 0 that's where we are right now when it comes to social media and taking a step back and looking at what's ahead.</p><p>STELTER: It's great to have a Central Park, it's great to have a garden, but the garden has been overrun by weeds and you can see these executives struggling to figure out how to clean up the garden.</p><p>NEWTON: And listen, before we go, we just had something break in the \"New York Times,\" Brian, I am just going to read the headline of an op-ed that is anonymous right now that the \"New York Times\" just dropped. It is, \"I am part of the resistance inside the Trump administration,\" and again, it's anonymous. This is someone from the inside.</p><p>STELTER: This is breathtaking that the \"New York Times\" has published an anonymous op-ed from a senior Trump administration official. Someone - we don't know the identity, but the \"New York Times\" does know the identity. Someone who is trying to blow the whistle and say, the president is a danger and yet there are many people in the White House trying to protect the country from the President. Now, that's the theme of the Bob Woodward book, but here you have a senior official writing it in their own words. We don't know if it's a man or a woman. We don't know their title, but the \"New York Times\" knows and the \"New York Times\" worked with this person to blow the whistle.</p><p>NEWTON: But the point is, the person also says, there are more of us. It's not just me.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, describing it as a resistance and if I can quote one line, the person says, \"It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room. We fully recognize what is happening.\"</p><p>NEWTON: Wow.</p><p>STELTER: This sounds like something out of a thriller, something out of a drama that these White House aides feel like they have to protect the country from the President. There's even one other detail that I think is going to be important in the days to come. It says that there were Cabinet officials in the early days of the Trump administration that talked about invoking the 25th Amendment, meaning to begin the process of removing Trump from power.</p><p>[16:10:01]</p><p>STELTER: If you have enough Cabinet officials together to vote on that, you can remove a US President from power. Now, this White House official says, the Cabinet decided not to do that because they didn't want to provoke a Constitutional crisis. So instead, they are trying to do what they can from inside.</p><p>NEWTON: The op-ed is chilling. We will continue to cover that here on CNN. Laurie, thank you so much to the both of you, actually for continuing to follow the tech hearings. Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, it was you know, one of those strange trading days on Wall Street. Volume was low as well. Now, the Dow managed to close relatively flat, I would call that. The NASDAQ though, it suffered its worst one day decline in months as tech companies like Netflix, Twitter, and Amazon all fell sharply. Now, earlier on \"QUEST EXPRESS,\" I asked, SilverBear Capitals, Alan Valdes what's driving the tech route?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALAN VALDES, SENIOR PARTNER, SILVERBEAR CAPITALS: Please don't go to the stocks. So eventually even these stocks have to kind of plateau at some point. They don't keep going up forever, but what worries a lot of people down here is, if you weren't into techs, your 401K is flat, so the techs come in, you could see this market capitulate --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Now, investor concerns were compounded by collapse in emerging market currencies: Mexico, Russia, India, and Argentina have all suffered steep drops this year. Now, earlier, our emerging markets editor, John Defterios explained it this way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: The common theme though, Paula, there has been seven economies that for the last 12 months have been running very high current account deficits, and it has all come home to roost here. They are very vulnerable. I'm kind of using the analogy of a heat-seeking missile. If you have a high current account deficit, investors are testing you right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Now Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee says if he is confirmed, he will owe his loyalty to the US Constitution, not the President. Brett Kavanaugh is facing his second day of confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill and he was asked directly if he would have trouble ruling against a President who appointed him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: No one is above the law in our constitutional system. Federalist 69, Hamilton makes clear all the ways that the executive branch as designed by the framers of the Constitution was different from the monarchy. Under our system of government, the executive branch is subject to the law, subject to the court system and that is an important part of Federalist 69, it's an important part of the Constitutional structure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: OK, listening in was our Congressional Correspondent, Phil Mattingly. So, glad to see you. Good to see you. In terms of what happened out there. Let's just remind everyone what is at stake. This is a man who will likely be the swing vote in the Supreme Court, and when we're talking about what is going on in the White House now, his words matter, right, in terms of who he will side with?</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, no question at all and it took just a few minutes in today's hearing to recognize that President Trump was moved to the forefront. Specifically, his potential legal issues. He was asked by Democrats whether or not a President should have to comply with subpoenas, whether or not the President could pardon somebody, whether or not the President could pardon somebody in exchange for a bribe.</p><p>Now on each of those issues, Paula, he declined to answer. Saying - citing past President for nominees, that he wasn't going to address hypotheticals of potential cases he may face, but there was a reference to a past case that wasn't very subtle. Paula, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAVANAUGH: You think about United States versus Nixon, which I've identified as one of the greatest moments in American judicial history where Chief Justice Burger who had been appointed by President Nixon brought the court together in a unanimous decision to order President Nixon in response to a criminal trial subpoena to disclose information.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTINGLY: Obviously, referencing US versus Nixon as he talked about there, basically, the Supreme Court ruling unanimous at the time that the Nixon White House would have to turn over those tapes that became so central to President Nixon ending up resigning from office.</p><p>The interesting element about all of this is not only do you have executive power issues, you also have issues of healthcare, of abortion rights, of regulation. And you make the key point. He will most likely make up the fifth vote of a conservative block in a nine-person court. This will totally swing the pendulum away from where Anthony Kennedy was who was considered more of a swing vote towards more of a conservative bend. That is why you see the fight as partisan as it is, that's why you've seen it as fierce as it is.</p><p>But Paula, as you know very well, at this moment, Republicans need only stay together and they have the votes to confirm him. That's where it looks like it's heading right now, no question. There's two more days of hearings. This one - today is supposed to go through 9:00 p.m. or maybe even later, mercifully, hopefully not. The fight is going to continue and rage on for the next couple of days.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and a lot of people obviously have commented as well that you have some Democrats there that might have a little bit of an ambitious political future and that's another reason why these hearings are going the way they are. Phil, I can't let you go without asking you about the op-ed in the \"New York Times\" right now. We just discussed it with Brian Stelter, but I wanted to get your take in terms of how people on Capitol Hill will feel about this.</p><p>[16:15:06]</p><p>NEWTON: The criticism has always been that the GOP just does not stand up to the President and that - just is not worried really in the way other people are about the President's policies or behaviors.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Yes, publicly, and I think that is the most interesting element at least the thread that I have taken from the op-ed that I've read up to this point is what you see in that op-ed reflects a lot of what I hear privately from Republican members in the sense of they don't feel like it helps them in any way, shape or form to publicly castigate the President, to publicly attack the President or to call him out for doing things that they believe break traditional norms.</p><p>They believe kind of twofold. First and foremost, if you want to get his attention, you work behind the scenes. That's how he responds best. I've had the Speaker of the House tell me that. I've had the Majority Leader of the Senate tell me that, but perhaps more importantly and there is a thread of this in the op-ed, is the idea that there it is a Republican in the White House and there is a graph or two in that op-ed where it talks about the things that they have accomplished up to this point, which is essentially what members of Congress have said.</p><p>With a Republican in the White House, regardless of who that Republican is, they have gotten the 2017 tax law. You've seen the administrative agencies cut back on decades of regulations that Democrats put into place that Republicans have long opposed. You see a number of significant policy achievements that Republicans on Capitol Hill have been working for years to get, and it's one of those things where this is the trade-off essentially.</p><p>If they have somebody that will sign these things whether legislatively or via regulatory fiat then they will support him, at least publicly. That said, it does not mitigate in any way the concerns you hear behind the scenes about how the President has run the office, how the President operates via 280 characters particularly how he operates on foreign policy, but it's the trade-off that you constantly see.</p><p>I know it frustrates a lot of people, frankly, it frustrates some Republicans, but the viewpoint up here is if you want to get stuff done, particularly with a Republican in the White House, you just have to go along to get along and that is why if you watch Speaker Ryan's press conference today, or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's conference today, they were asked about the Woodward book, they were asked about tweets related to whether Jeff Sessions should be favoring Republicans in his prosecutions and they didn't weigh in. That's all the evidence you need.</p><p>NEWTON: That is all the evidence we need and we take it right back to Brett Kavanaugh because they are getting what they want, well, likely get what they want in that nomination as well. Phil, we will point out to everyone, that so far the White House is saying that they have no response, no comment yet on that \"New York Times\" editorial.</p><p>Phil, really good to see you. Appreciate it. Coming up on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, the former Mexican President tells me why dropping NAFTA could backfire for Donald Trump, and the case of the quarantined plane. This is so interesting and a bit alarming why health officials met this flight at the airport.</p><p>[16:20:56]</p><p>NEWTON: Canada's Foreign Minister for one isn't giving up on striking a new NAFTA deal with the United States. Chrystia Freeland says trade talks remain constructive despite missing several key deadlines. Now, President Trump is raising the pressure on Canada threatening to strike a separate agreement with Mexico. Earlier, I spoke to the former Mexican President Felipe Calderon who told me he believes Canada absolutely should be included in any deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>FELIPE CALDERON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF MEXICO: I want to be very respectful about my own government, but the point is, that's the fact right now. I would rather have Canada with us. But in any case, good news is we can have a deal saving the trade with the United States which is very important the for both countries.</p><p>However, the devil is in the details and I don't know the details, honestly. Somebody is talking about there is some kind of (inaudible) or secret agreement related with establishing a cap with Mexican exported vehicles. And honestly, if that is true, it is good in the sense that it saves the industry for any blocking limitation.</p><p>But also, it is bad because it is going to prevent the most successful business story in Mexico. The industry of cars are creating a lot of jobs, and paradoxically, if you block export from Mexico to the United States, you will have more Mexican workers trying to migrate to the United States which is a bad idea, honestly.</p><p>NEWTON: That is a very interesting point. So you are saying that this could end up in a loose situation. They think that they are moving jobs to the United States, but they could also end up with a problem on illegal immigration.</p><p>CALDERON: Completely. It is a bad story for both. For the United States, because even the American cars will be more expensive for the consumers in the United States and it's going to be - they are going to be - for those cars out in the competition. You know in the middle of the crisis in 2009, the three big companies of the United States -- Chrysler, Ford Motors Company and General Motors -- they saved the companies from bankruptcy with their plants in Mexico because they were able to create incredible, fancy competitive cars. It's a story of integration.</p><p>NEWTON: President Trump would totally take you on with that and say that was at the expense of American jobs. That's what they are negotiating --</p><p>CALDERON: That's on the contrary. On the contrary, this integrated way to work saved millions of jobs in the United States. Actually, there are more - 1.2 American families depending directly in the export towards Mexico and even more, we are estimating at least six million families of American workers dependent on the trade with Mexico including the car industry. Because, when you see the level of integration we have, a car crosses the border six or seven times. So, a lot of American jobs are now under threat I would say if we cancel the trade or we reduce the trade with Mexico, honestly. It is not only a Mexican story.</p><p>NEWTON: You know I can't let you go without talking to you about the wall.</p><p>CALDERON: Which wall, I'm sorry. Wall Street? We can talk about that.</p><p>NEWTON: The wall, President Trump continues to say it will be built and Mexico will pay for it. At the end of the day, do you think it will die with any --</p><p>CALDERON: Well, you know, I don't know what happened in the States, but we, the Mexicans takes the words of the President of the United States every day less seriously, with all due respect. So maybe there will be a wall, you want to put a wall in your garden, your landscape. You want it to be an ugly monument in your garden, you can do that. But we are not going to pay for it. It's your own decision and your public work.</p><p>I don't care about that. But the wall is a solution of probably before Middle Age. China tried a wall long centuries ago and it is completely useless. What China doing today? It is the One Belt One Road project, which is investing massively in Asia and Africa, and that will be quite smart strategy. I think that will be the solution for the 21st Century, not a wall.</p><p>But I don't want to be trapped in the discussion of the wall. I know there are a lot of political feelings and strategies behind that, I respect that of the President of the United States, but it is still, that is not going to work for the United States and definitely, we are not going to pay any single cent of that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: OK, Felipe Calderon talking about these ongoing negotiations. The dairy industry in those negotiations has become a predictable sticking point in those trade talks between the US and Canada. Now, President Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Canada for what he says are 249 percent tariff on US dairy products, but levies on agricultural products are actually quite common.</p><p>[16:25:11]</p><p>NEWTON: In fact, the US imposes 350 percent tariff on some tobacco products. Now, giving in to the United States' demands could leave Prime Minister Justin Trudeau very vulnerable politically. Canada's dairy region makes up a crucial part of his voter base. He is going into an election later next year, President Trump though isn't giving up the fight.</p><p>He is repeating his calls to end dairy tariffs and this was in a press conference earlier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have to make a fair deal with Canada. As you know, they charge tariffs of 300 percent on dairy products which a lot of people never understood. They have walls up against us doing business in Canada and yet, they come and do business with us, and we can't let that happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Tom Vilsack is President and CEO of the US Dairy Export Council and he was also a former Secretary of Agriculture. He joins me now from Des Moines, Iowa. Thanks so much. I cannot think of a better person to put this pointed question to. Would you leave Canada out of it especially if they do not budge on dairy. Just keep the bilateral deal with Mexico, thank you very much.</p><p>TOM VILSACK, PRESIDENT AND CEO, US DAIRY EXPORT COUNCIL: The reality is Canada needs to take care of the dairy business in this negotiations. It's an absolute must. We are not going to have a NAFTA agreement that is satisfactory to dairy producers, unless two things happen. One, Canada eliminates Class 7 pricing system, that's the story of the powder market, and two, it opens up its markets.</p><p>Absent those two things, I don't think it is an agreement that dairy producers will be particularly excited about.</p><p>NEWTON: Meaning dairy producers want Canada involved? They want to move on this. They want that trilateral deal.</p><p>VILSACK: They would like to see a NAFTA agreement where we modernize our relationship with both Mexico and Canada. We see a removal of the retaliatory tariffs on our Cheeses in Mexico and an opening up of the Canadian market. It has been closed for far too long. There is no question their supply management system has caused them not to do right by American producers, but more importantly, from a political perspective in Canada, not to do right by their consumers. Their consumers are paying significantly more for their dairy products than they need to if we had a more open, fair trade relationship with Canada.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, Mr. Vilsack, that's milk I buy usually every week, if not every day, and you have a point there in terms of consumer prices. I just want to get to what some American farmers have told CNN though even in Wisconsin and saying, \"Look, what is wrong with the supply management system?\" Because quite frankly, US farmers sometimes are not that happy with the kind of prices they get for their own dairy.</p><p>VILSACK: Well, the problem is that they don't basically solve problems within the supply management system that's caused by the supply management system. That's why they created Class 7, a pricing system that has distorted the powder market. They couldn't get rid of the powder within their own market because of the supply management, so they are dumping in on the world market causing significant pain for producers not just in the United States, but around the world.</p><p>If you have a supply management system, then solve the problems that it creates within that system. Don't export those problems to the rest of the world.</p><p>NEWTON: In terms of exporting problems to the rest of the world, the Trump administration has caused problems for US dairy exports to China. Your organization has been vocal in terms of really trying to fight this. What do you have to say to the Trump administration if this escalates any further in terms of the cost to that dairy industry in the United States?</p><p>VILSACK: We have done a study and there is no question that the tariffs will have an impact on the dairy industry with reference to China. We had momentum building in that market. This tariffs could potentially eliminate that momentum and it could result in as much as $12 billion of lost revenue over the next five years.</p><p>Our message to the Trump administration is fairly clear, don't escalate on the tariffs. Get to the negotiating table. Try to get this thing resolved before the end of the year, otherwise, there is going to be significant pain to the dairy producers in this country at a time when we're losing dairy producers because of low prices.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and it will be important for us to follow that story as China becomes an issue in the coming weeks. Mr. Vilsack, I invite you back. Please come back and talk to us because this will continue to be an issue in the weeks to come. Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, it is 4:29, in fact, do you know where your data is? As Congress weighs new regulation., one company is promising to get your data under your control.</p><p>[16:32:00] NEWTON: Hello, I'm Paula Newton and there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment. When I talked to the CEO of a new app that's promising to help to take control of your digital life. Health officials in the meantime meet an A380 after a number of passengers turned up sick. Before that though, the headlines this hour.</p><p>British prosecutors have charged two Russian nationals with attempted murder in the nerve agent poisoning of a former spy and his daughter back in March. Russia denies any involvement, but the British Prime Minister says the suspects are Russian military intelligence officers.</p><p>President Trump is sending a new message to Syria not to cross the line in Idlib. Government troops are believed to be preparing to attack the last major rebel stronghold after a meeting with the leader of Kuwait Wednesday. Trump had these words for Syria's government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And these are innocent -- you have 3 million at least innocent people there, and you have to be very careful and the world is watching and the United States is watching very closely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: In Iraq, at least six people have been killed and dozens more injured after a third straight day of protests in the southern city of Basra. Unemployment, power cut and a lack of basic services have all contributed for its extent of a rising fury.</p><p>Museum officials in Brazil are hopeful that some of those ancient relics can be salvaged after this week's devastating fire. Some of the items recovered so far includes ceramic pieces, meteorite and human skull, the cause of the fire has not yet been determined, but government's funding cuts and years of neglect are being blamed.</p><p>Tech executives admit they didn't do enough to curb Russian interference in the U.S. election. Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, committee members blasted Google for failing to even send anybody from their top leadership.</p><p>Now as we were just discussing Congress is working out how to police your social media. One company wants to give you control over your data right now.</p><p>[16:35:00] If you're like me, you use a range of online services, I am on Twitter and Instagram, but there are a few others too, and Digi.me, promises to put all of that data from all of your services. We're talking financial, health, social and more in one place.</p><p>And get this, you can search it all and decide who can see it and who can use it. Joining me now is Shane Green; the CEO of Digi.me U.S. Shane, thanks so much for joining us. Now, help me out, explain to me how this works because at this point, it's sounding a bit too good to be true.</p><p>SHANE GREEN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DIGI.ME: Hi Paula, and thanks for having me today. So Digi.me does exactly what you said. It allows individuals to plug in more than 15,000 different sources of data about themselves, aggregated in one private and secure place that they control and then set permissions on which apps or services get access to it.</p><p>And that's exactly what we're focused on, is putting that control back in the hands of individuals.</p><p>NEWTON: And in putting it back in the hands of individuals though, how all encompassing is this, because I still assume that whatever data I willingly give to Twitter or Facebook or Instagram, that they can still use exactly the way they want to.</p><p>GREEN: Well, we hear that a lot, and that is an obvious question. Of course, that data is going to continue to exist in other places out there, but it's living in all of these different silos. When you get your arms around all of that data in one place, it gives you as an individual sort of that unique competitive advantage to decide which other services get access.</p><p>And that really gives you the differentiation in empowering those apps. Your data combined in that way really lets any of those apps leave private competition.</p><p>NEWTON: And can you explain that to me a little bit further in terms of, well, we've been used to hearing places like Facebook selling your data on, that's still going to happen though as well, isn't it?</p><p>GREEN: Well, it will happen, but I think increasingly, you're going to see app developers and companies choose solutions like ours. And you're already starting to see this in a big way in Europe, where they have new laws and just generally a whole different view on privacy and consent and transparency.</p><p>And so what we're doing right now is basically, you know, firing the starting gun in a race to the top among developers, to not only create the best apps and the move value for your from your data, but also showing at the same time a good steward they can be of your data.</p><p>NEWTON: And do you think they'll be able to continue to do it for free?</p><p>GREEN: Well, absolutely, we do get paid by the developers who build apps and who ask for data from the users, and we're very transparent about that to everyone involved. We are not selling data or even able to touch, hold or see data, so we really are just like a credit card company and that we get paid every time that data gets delivered faithfully to another app that abides by these new rules and respect your ownership and control of your data.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, unfortunately, we've had problems with that before with other companies, so we'll put that on hold for a second. You know, we had raised the possibility that, you know, this seems like it's important to people when other times you see a lot of people don't have any problems with their data going to these companies.</p><p>Because they kind of believe, you know what? There's a way to get it anyway, and they kind of don't trust the entire system as it is.</p><p>GREEN: Well, I think that's been true historically, but that's also because people haven't had easy tools to use other options. And so, that's why the app developers are building another platform, they're doing -- they're creating very easy to use, compelling apps that maybe even do some of the things other apps you're already using to do, like help you with your -- managing your personal finances.</p><p>But when they tell you, we will do this with complete respect for your privacy, complete control over their data and we will never do anything with that data that you don't know about.</p><p>That's very different, I think we're starting to find that people, you know, they listen up and they say, yes, I want to try that, and when they see that they can actually experience that in a way that's, you know, transparent and clear, unlike most of the current services, it does start to change their gratitude towards this.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and it is a fair point as all of us become a little bit more savvy about what's going on with our data out there. Shane, thanks so much, really appreciate it.</p><p>GREEN: Thanks for having me.</p><p>NEWTON: Now, coming up, dozens of people on board this plane right here said they felt unwell. Now, health officials met them on that JFK runway, just a few hours ago, we will bring you the very latest after the break.</p><p>[16:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON: A major new UN report claims bold action on climate change could deliver 26 trillion in economic benefits through 2030. By taking action on energy, food and land-use and industry, the report says more than 65 billion -- sorry, pardon me, million new low-carbon(ph) jobs could be created by 2030.</p><p>Now, more than 700,000 premature deaths are now due to climate change and those could be avoided. And subsidy and reform and carbon pricing alone are capable apparently of generating 2.8 trillion in revenues for governments around the world by 2030.</p><p>Earlier, former Mexican President Felipe Calderon told me he's actually convinced by the report claims.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FELIPE CALDERON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF MEXICO: It's a good economic argument for people. People thinking about jobs -- one example, solar and wind energy, renewable energy already has in the United States more jobs, almost 500,000 jobs in the United States, more than coal and natural gas combined.</p><p>So it's a new story about economic growth and clean growth. And talking about business, let's talk about profits, you can get the businessmen a lot of profits doing the right thing. Just getting for instance energy efficiency in your industry, you can get even more productivity, which means more money, more revenues, more profit.</p><p>So these are -- this is a successful story about profits and about jobs and about economic growth.</p><p>NEWTON: What do you think the barriers are to getting to that point? And I mean, it's OK to talk about it in the United States or Germany, to name one, but what about in developing countries? In places like -- in countries like Africa. And I know a lot of Asian countries complain about this as well.</p><p>They are just starting to get some momentum in their economies, and I think sometimes they cannot afford this.</p><p>CALDERON: Actually, it's the other way around. Because for instance, there are 1 billion people mainly in Africa that are -- they don't get access to electricity for instance. So they don't need to repeat the model we have in the past. So very -- polluting greens and a lot of stuff.</p><p>For instance, lift-trolling all the way to removable energy could be a process, quite similar for instance to the phone lines, fixed phone lines. You remember -- when I was --</p><p>NEWTON: I remember, believe me --</p><p>CALDERON: No, you don't, you don't remember, but I --</p><p>NEWTON: Oh, no, I remember --</p><p>CALDERON: Went --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>The whole idea is to have a fixed line everywhere --</p><p>NEWTON: Absolutely --</p><p>CALDERON: And suddenly India and a lot of developing countries, yes, leap frog, the point, that's -- yes, modern phones and renewable energy could be like that. So in order to provide electricity for all those families, we can do in a very modern, efficient, productive and of course clean way, and instead to repeat the mistakes we did in the past.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: OK, a number of passengers reported feeling ill on a flight from Dubai to New York's JFK Airport. The flight, again, from Dubai to New York was on an Emirates flight it was quarantined at JFK Airport and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 11 people were taken to hospital for treatment.</p><p>[16:45:00] Our Rene Marsh has been following all of this. I mean, this is a little bit alarming when you think about it. Have they gotten to the bottom of exactly why and how this happened?</p><p>RENE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATION &amp; TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so we are hearing some late words from the CDC, and according to a source there at the CDC, respiratory illnesses like influenza are among what's been considered as far as what caused these passengers to get sick.</p><p>We're talking about a flight, as you mentioned, it was from Dubai to New York's JFK, there were more than 500 passengers on board. That plane was isolated once it landed at JFK Airport as multiple passengers reported feeling sick. Passengers and health officials say that people were coughing, some had fevers.</p><p>Both the CDC and sources with the New York port authority which controls JFK Airport said as many as 100 passengers reported feeling sick. But the airline says only 10 passengers were sick. So the latest information that we have from Emirates is that three passengers and seven crew, they were taken to the hospital for further medical evaluation.</p><p>All the other passengers though, they were released and allowed to continue with their travels. But again, the late words from the CDC is that they're looking at possibly illnesses like influenza as well as MERS which stands for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome which is essentially a viral respiratory disease that they first identified in 2012.</p><p>So they're just trying to get to the bottom of it, but right now, it does not look like anything nefarious involved as far as why these people looking sick --</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, which is a relief on the one hand, but this --</p><p>MARSH: Yes --</p><p>NEWTON: Is an A380, you know, you're talking about 500 passengers, relieved to know that the vast majority were released. And yet, we actually have quite a few of the crew members that seem to be the ones that were ill here.</p><p>MARSH: Right, and again, you know, we all know that on those aircrafts, that there's that air that's circulated and most times, the crew who have to work in these conditions, they're there, they're exposed to so many people on a daily basis with that recycled air.</p><p>So if it is indeed a case of influenza, that makes sense, because again --</p><p>NEWTON: Right --</p><p>MARSH: Traveling, we all know that sometimes you just get exposed to so many people in such a short period of time. But to your point, Paula, the good news, you know, obviously, when we heard about so many people being sick on a commercial aircraft, it raises a lot of red flags --</p><p>NEWTON: Oh, yes --</p><p>MARSH: But at this late hour, we're now beginning to learn that the CDC at least at this point, they do not believe --</p><p>NEWTON: OK --</p><p>MARSH: Anything nefarious at this --</p><p>NEWTON: And that is good news, Rene, thanks so much, appreciate it. Now, on honest days, work for honest day's pay, that's what they're saying -- says. After the break, overwhelming support for a former TV star photographed working in a grocery store, we'll hear from the man at the center of it all.</p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON: European markets closed in the red are right across the board as investors track those international trade tensions. Paris, as you can see there, suffered the greatest losses, closing down over 1.5 percent. Staying in Europe, a short, bad-tempered conflict between French and British scallop fishermen has thankfully come to an end.</p><p>The truce in the so-called scallop wars was called after the French and British governments reached a deal. British fishermen will respect a French closure period in a section of water in exchange for compensation. Now, a former \"Cosby Show\" star who was really wrapped by the press working for -- at the cash register.</p><p>And the paparazzi's got him on this one in a store and he told CNN that afterwards, the outpouring really affected him because he at first was in fact devastated by being photographed as you see there at Trader Joe's; a grocery store here in New Jersey.</p><p>Now Geoffrey Owens was pictured bagging those groceries, he says it was an apparent attempt to job-shame him. Now you remember him starring as Alvin in the \"Cosby Show\", he went on to play various roles on stage and on screen. He is still a working actor after this \"Daily Mail\" article came out and a similar piece in Foxnew.com.</p><p>Fellow actors and fans rushed to his defense. Our Chloe Melas tells us that he really was put in an impossible situation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: What is the most upsetting though, although he's been getting some really positive reinforcement, people like Tyler Perry have been offering him jobs in the wake of this. It's the fact that he actually knew that the \"Daily Mail\" was going to be publishing a story with photos of him.</p><p>And that they said, look, you better talk to us, because we're going to run this story with or without you. Well, he now has a very strong message for the \"Daily Mail\" and \"Fox News\", both of which he says job-shamed him.</p><p>GEOFFREY OWENS, FORMER ACTOR: They set out to exploit the fame in us in a public that wants to see stories about people who were once great or celebrated, now fallen, fallen from grace. There's something in us that is titillated by that, that's what those news outlets are exploiting.</p><p>But hey, this is what I think of it, you know, \"Fox News\", if I'm in \"Fox News\", then I must be a fox. I hope you learned your lesson, I hope that you see that people are better than you think they are. That people don't want to celebrate people's downfalls, they want to lift people up again.</p><p>And as I quote, \"great is the temptation to do good\", our better natures will prevail, and that might mean that you sell a few less papers, et cetera. But people are better than what you're giving them credit for.</p><p>MELAS: I have to tell you though in light of all the media scrutiny and these outlets, publishing these stories, he's had to quit his job at Trader Joe's now. So currently, he's out of a job and looking for work.</p><p>NEWTON: And I find the nuts and bolts to this so interesting. We have to say this is an incredibly talented, articulate man, he is still an actor, he still works as an actor, it just doesn't make enough money for him right now --</p><p>MELAS: Exactly --</p><p>NEWTON: This is a Yale graduate --</p><p>MELAS: That's what I was going to say --</p><p>NEWTON: I think -- I think other than him saying that people want to celebrate downfall, I think a lot of -- you know, what I immediately thought of is they're by the grace of God go, and I give him so much credit. Why did that not happen in these publications.</p><p>This is an everyman. This is a man that's out there trying to put food on the table. Some interesting that we spoke about is that what people don't realize is that it's been over two decades since the \"Cosby Show\" was on the air. And he actually touched me about the fact that he hasn't had steady work in that time.</p><p>OWENS: The \"Cosby Show\" ended 26 years ago. And in the past 26 years, I have hardly ever had an acting job that lasted more than 10 weeks. And most of those jobs were theater jobs which pay a lot less than television and film. So basically, for the last 26 years, I haven't had steady employment.</p><p>The article was negative, the article was from a kind of a shaming slants, oh, look at him now, isn't that sad? You know, under the guise of, oh, I feel bad for him. But it was really kind of like, you know, isn't this -- you know, isn't this interesting how the -- you know, mighty television star is now just bagging groceries at a grocery store.</p><p>[16:55:00] So that was the initial thing, and that stung, that was definitely hurtful especially, you know, the picture they chose to use and stuff like that. You know, it seems like they kind of went out of their way to use like the very worst image, it was all designed to look as bad as possible.</p><p>But the good thing was it lasted a very short time before all the positive supportive responses started coming in from around the world. So there's initial shocking, and ever since I kind of forgot when the story is going to come out, I kind of played it out like what would be the worst case scenario like how bad is it going to be?</p><p>And it was worse. When it came out, it was like -- I was like, oh, my gosh, this is worst than I ever imagined. But that lasted a very short time before all the support started coming in and just overwhelming the bad stuff.</p><p>MELAS: Well, look, he also spoke to me about the fact that when Bill Cosby, the star of the \"Cosby Show\" started being accused of rape by multiple women, a network society to pull the \"Cosby Show\" off the air, that that impacted him financially because he wasn't making royalties off of the re-runs anymore.</p><p>Now, Tyler Perry and others have come forward and offered him jobs now, and he says he doesn't want anybody to feel sorry for him, he doesn't want anybody giving him a handout just because he has this new found notoriety. He wants to get more auditions though because of this and compete with his peers.</p><p>NEWTON: And hopefully he will because we all miss him on TV, I don't know, and we all did and we miss him on TV --</p><p>MELAS: Yes --</p><p>NEWTON: I thought it was so incredible too, when he said no job should be valued among another. And for those of us who come from incredibly modest backgrounds, we all believe that, right? I mean, this is great that he was out there --</p><p>MELAS: How anybody could criticize somebody for just working to make a living is just absurd and really offensive --</p><p>NEWTON: And on Labor Day.</p><p>MELAS: Definitely --</p><p>NEWTON: I know, so we will continue, I hope now to follow his career, and thanks so much --</p><p>MELAS: You're welcome --</p><p>NEWTON: Really appreciate bringing the story too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Now, if you want to keep on top of the day's business headlines in just 90 seconds, then try our daily briefing podcast, it's updated twice a day before and after the bell rings on Wall Street, and you can just ask Alexa or your Google home device for your, quote, \"CNNMoney flash briefing\", and that is every weekday.</p><p>And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for today, I can tell you for those viewers waiting for him, Richard Quest will be back. Now, you can see I have no bell here, I can ring no bell, Richard doesn't let me ring the bell. I have my own bell to ring, can tell him that I did it when I come back, OK? Richard will be right in the chair.</p><p>Thanks for joining me, the news continues right here on CNN.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018090501cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6H-D191-DXH2-61YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8538\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 5, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We were up,  we were down, essentially, we're flat.  Today is Wednesday, September 5th.  Under oath, Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey get grilled about foreign  influence on Facebook and Twitter.  A warning from a former Mexican   President who tells me abandoning the NAFTA deal will only make the  situation at the US border worse; and an honest day's work, the former  \"Cosby\" star has a message for those who tried to bring him down.  I am  Paula Newton and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tonight, Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey under oath before Congress  admitting they haven't done enough to shut down fake accounts and curb  election interference.  Now all the parties came into the room with their  own set of priorities.  For Democrats, a look back at Russian interference  in the 2016 US election, for the Republicans alleged bias against  conservatives.  Progressives want controls on hate speech and the tech  companies want to avoid new regulations that would harm their businesses,  but the beginning of the hearing was as much about the issues as who was  and remember, who wasn't there.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You solemnly swear to give this committee the truth,  the whole truth and nothing but t truth, so help you God.  </p><p> MARK WARNER, US SENATOR, VIRGINIA, DEMOCRAT:  I am deeply disappointed that  Google, one of the most influential digital platforms in the world chose  not to send its own top corporate leadership to engage in this committee  because I know our members have a series of difficult questions about  structural vulnerabilities on a number of Google's platforms that we will  need answers for.  </p><p> SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK:  Russia used social media as part of, and I  quote, \"A comprehensive and multifaceted campaign to sow discord, undermine  Democratic institutions and interfere in US elections and those of our  allies.\"  We were too slow to spot this and too slow to act.  That is on  us.  </p><p> JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER:  We must ask the question, \"What is Twitter  incentivizing people to do or not do and why?\"  The answers will lead to  tectonic shifts in Twitter and our industry operates.  </p><p> SANDBERG:  We don't think it is a question of whether regulation, we think  it's a question of the right regulation that supports users is transparent  and doesn't squash innovation and we are happy to work with you on the  proposal.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> NEWTON:  OK, now shares of tech companies - not sure if it even had to do  with the hearings - fell sharply.  Twitter down about 6 percent, Facebook  and Google were less affected though as you could see there.  Now, CNN's  senior media and tech correspondents are covering it all, Brian Stelter and  Laurie Segall are here.  Laurie first to you, the nuts and bolts of it.   For how many years you've actually been covering where deregulation could  or count be applied.  Did they really get into that today?  </p><p> LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR MEDIA AND TECH CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, they didn't  actually get into it as much as I thought they would.  They came with the  idea that we have to have an honest conversation about regulation.  You  have Sheryl Sandberg saying what we've heard her say before, which is, it  is not regulations, it is the right kind of regulation, but you didn't hear  the nuts and bolts of it.  </p><p> I will say today, having been in the room for Mark Zuckerberg's testimony,  it felt a lot more civil despite the fact that Alex Jones - before Alex  Jones came in and crashed the testimony a bit.  It did have a more of a -  we're happy that you are doing this.  We're happy that you two showed up,  not Google, but we're happy that you're here having this conversation and  it's to look for what have you done to protect us and what have you already  done ahead of the midterms.  It was a very different feel.  </p><p> And the other hearing right now with Jack Dorsey is currently going on and  that is more nuts and bolts.  That's more how do these algorithms work?   That's also a lot of conservatives saying are you suppressing our voice?   There's been rumors that they have been doing that.  There has been  criticism around that.  </p><p> So all in all, a really interesting and informative day; not as much  explosive stuff as I know --  </p><p> BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA AND TECH CORRESPONDENT:  No, and the  senators actually seemed more knowledgeable than they did a few weeks ago,  a few months ago or a few years ago.  </p><p> NEWTON:  Thank goodness, they were briefed.  They did some research --  </p><p> STELTER:  I was relieved to see that there was a better level of knowledge  on the part of these elected officials than there have been before.  </p><p> NEWTON:  Brian, I want to ask you as well, in terms of when we talk about  where this could go once we hear the hearings - a lot of people are asking  why aren't they regulated the way we are, for instance?  The way media is  in general?  It is an open question still.  </p><p> STELTER:  But I think the answer is that because historically, Republican  governments have been loose about regulations.  The Trump administration  has been all about deregulation and the tech industry is one of the caveats  there.  Trump has been talking in vague confusing terms about wanting to  see actions taken against big tech, and nobody really knows what he means  and I'm not sure he knows what he means.  </p><p> So for now, I don't see any real practical proposals on the table.  What I  see are a lot of people huffing and puffing about the concerns of alleged  censorship.  It really means companies are stuck between really two  different positions.  On the one hand, folks mostly on the right saying you  are censoring me, you are suppressing my free speech; and then on the other  side, from the left and from media companies, and from all sorts of critics  --</p><p> [16:05:14]  </p><p> STELTER:   -- people are saying what are you doing about misinformation?   And hoax as in fake news on their platforms?  It's a really difficult  position for these companies to be in.  </p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, and Jack Dorsey was asked you know basically, shouldn't you  be letting people that use your platform know when perhaps they've been  duped by some kind of an --  </p><p> STELTER:  I was blown away by what Sheryl Sandberg said about the number of  fake accounts that they are dealing with on Facebook, more than a billion.   At any given time, 3 percent or 4 percent of the accounts on Facebook are  inauthentic and they are having to take them down every day.  So every day,  Facebook is fighting these battles trying to delete misinformation and  hoaxes and spammers, but it is a battle.  </p><p> SEGALL:  And I will say, and Twitter has a whole separate problem, and  that's what you heard Jack Dorsey today talk about, it was Senator Warner,  who asked, do people have the right, and I thought this was such a  fascinating question - do, us, users have a right to know if we are being  contacted by a human or a machine?  And by machine they're talking about a  bot, an automated account that Twitter has this bot problem.  </p><p> And what Jack Dorsey said is, we have been thinking a lot about this and  it's something we are looking into, informing people and I think  transparency and context were the two words they kind of pulled out from a  lot of this stuff today, but we don't exactly know.  You've mentioned this  before, we don't exactly know what this looks like, but users need more  context about what they are seeing online because we've now entered this  place where we don't know where truth is, what disinformation is and I  think that's a really hard place for these tech entrepreneurs and that's a  really hard place to regulate.  </p><p> NEWTON:  And you had been saying earlier that Jack Dorsey has this concept,  it's a very nice concept that really cleaves to the First Amendment right  in this country which are different than it is around the world, the fact  that this digital town square has to be preserved.  </p><p> SEGALL:  Sure, it was so fascinating to me because he keeps talking about  this digital town square, I want to play you the sound and then I'm going  to get to a larger point.  Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DORSEY:  We don't believe that we can create a digital public square for  people if they don't feel safe to participate in the first place.  And that  is our number one and singular objective as a company is to increase the  health of this public space.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SEGALL  This idea of a town - this public square, this was the promise and  I've been covering tech for almost a decade.  You interviewed Evan  Williams, the founder of Twitter; you've interviewed Jack Dorsey.  They all  talk about this town square, we could all come - and we can --  </p><p> STELTER:  It sounds so nice.  </p><p> SEGALL:  And we could speak our truth and the Internet promised to be this  place where we could all come and we could have discord, we could - you  could have all sorts of people.  And the idea was that the smart would win  through, or it would be a place for anyone, but then there's this idea of  the tragedy of the commons, where if you don't have the proper structure in  place, that that part gets crowded that people can't even get there, so now  fast forward to the concept of the internet and social media now, you don't  have good voices being able to win through, you have bots and trolling and  there haven't been the proper structures in place.  </p><p> You had one senator asking Jack Dorsey about women being able to use  Twitter, which I was very grateful for this comment, how it's very  different for women to be on Twitter --  </p><p> NEWTON:  It becomes so --  </p><p> STELTER:   -- with the amount of harassment.  </p><p> SEGALL:  Yes, and that idea of the tragedy of the commons.  And I think  that's the part 0 that's where we are right now when it comes to social  media and taking a step back and looking at what's ahead.  </p><p> STELTER:  It's great to have a Central Park, it's great to have a garden,  but the garden has been overrun by weeds and you can see these executives  struggling to figure out how to clean up the garden.  </p><p> NEWTON:  And listen, before we go, we just had something break in the \"New  York Times,\" Brian, I am just going to read the headline of an op-ed that  is anonymous right now that the \"New York Times\" just dropped.  It is, \"I  am part of the resistance inside the Trump administration,\" and again, it's  anonymous.  This is someone from the inside.  </p><p> STELTER:  This is breathtaking that the \"New York Times\" has published an  anonymous op-ed from a senior Trump administration official.  Someone - we  don't know the identity, but the \"New York Times\" does know the identity.   Someone who is trying to blow the whistle and say, the president is a  danger and yet there are many people in the White House trying to protect  the country from the President.  Now, that's the theme of the Bob Woodward  book, but here you have a senior official writing it in their own words.   We don't know if it's a man or a woman.  We don't know their title, but the  \"New York Times\" knows and the \"New York Times\" worked with this person to  blow the whistle.  </p><p> NEWTON:  But the point is, the person also says, there are more of us.   It's not just me.  </p><p> STELTER:  Yes, describing it as a resistance and if I can quote one line,  the person says, \"It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans  should know that there are adults in the room.  We fully recognize what is   happening.\"  </p><p> NEWTON:  Wow.  </p><p> STELTER:  This sounds like something out of a thriller, something out of a  drama that these White House aides feel like they have to protect the  country from the President.  There's even one other detail that I think is  going to be important in the days to come.  It says that there were Cabinet  officials in the early days of the Trump administration that talked about  invoking the 25th Amendment, meaning to begin the process of removing Trump  from power.  </p><p> [16:10:01]  </p><p> STELTER:  If you have enough Cabinet officials together to vote on that,  you can remove a US President from power.  Now, this White House official  says, the Cabinet decided not to do that because they didn't want to  provoke a Constitutional crisis.  So instead, they are trying to do what  they can from inside.  </p><p> NEWTON:  The op-ed is chilling.  We will continue to cover that here on  CNN.  Laurie, thank you so much to the both of you, actually for continuing  to follow the tech hearings.  Appreciate it.  </p><p> Now, it was you know, one of those strange trading days on Wall Street.   Volume was low as well.  Now, the Dow managed to close relatively flat, I  would call that.  The NASDAQ though, it suffered its worst one day decline  in months as tech companies like Netflix, Twitter, and Amazon all fell  sharply.  Now, earlier on \"QUEST EXPRESS,\" I asked, SilverBear Capitals,  Alan Valdes what's driving the tech route?  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> ALAN VALDES, SENIOR PARTNER, SILVERBEAR CAPITALS:  Please don't go to the  stocks.  So eventually even these stocks have to kind of plateau at some  point.  They don't keep going up forever, but what worries a lot of people  down here is, if you weren't into techs, your 401K is flat, so the techs  come in, you could see this market capitulate --  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> NEWTON:  Now, investor concerns were compounded by collapse in emerging  market currencies: Mexico, Russia, India, and Argentina have all suffered  steep drops this year.  Now, earlier, our emerging markets editor, John  Defterios explained it this way.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  The common theme though,  Paula, there has been seven economies that for the last 12 months have been  running very high current account deficits, and it has all come home to  roost here.  They are very vulnerable.  I'm kind of using the analogy of a  heat-seeking missile.  If you have a high current account deficit,  investors are testing you right now.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> NEWTON:  Now Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee says if he is confirmed, he  will owe his loyalty to the US Constitution, not the President.  Brett  Kavanaugh is facing his second day of confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill  and he was asked directly if he would have trouble ruling against a  President who appointed him.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  No one is above the law in our  constitutional system.  Federalist 69, Hamilton makes clear all the ways  that the executive branch as designed by the framers of the Constitution  was different from the monarchy.  Under our system of government, the  executive branch is subject to the law, subject to the court system and  that is an important part of Federalist 69, it's an important part of the  Constitutional structure.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> NEWTON:  OK, listening in was our Congressional Correspondent, Phil  Mattingly.  So, glad to see you.  Good to see you.  In terms of what  happened out there.  Let's just remind everyone what is at stake.  This is  a man who will likely be the swing vote in the Supreme Court, and when  we're talking about what is going on in the White House now, his words  matter, right, in terms of who he will side with?  </p><p> PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, no question at all  and it took just a few minutes in today's hearing to recognize that  President Trump was moved to the forefront.  Specifically, his potential  legal issues.  He was asked by Democrats whether or not a President should  have to comply with subpoenas, whether or not the President could pardon  somebody, whether or not the President could pardon somebody in exchange  for a bribe.  </p><p> Now on each of those issues, Paula, he declined to answer.  Saying - citing  past President for nominees, that he wasn't going to address hypotheticals  of potential cases he may face, but there was a reference to a past case  that wasn't very subtle.  Paula, take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> KAVANAUGH:  You think about United States versus Nixon, which I've  identified as one of the greatest moments in American judicial history  where Chief Justice Burger who had been appointed by President Nixon  brought the court together in a unanimous decision to order President Nixon  in response to a criminal trial subpoena to disclose information.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MATTINGLY:  Obviously, referencing US versus Nixon as he talked about  there, basically, the Supreme Court ruling unanimous at the time that the  Nixon White House would have to turn over those tapes that became so  central to President Nixon ending up resigning from office.  </p><p> The interesting element about all of this is not only do you have executive  power issues, you also have issues of healthcare, of abortion rights, of  regulation.  And you make the key point.  He will most likely make up the  fifth vote of a conservative block in a nine-person court.  This will  totally swing the pendulum away from where Anthony Kennedy was who was  considered more of a swing vote towards more of a conservative bend.  That  is why you see the fight as partisan as it is, that's why you've seen it as  fierce as it is.  </p><p> But Paula, as you know very well, at this moment, Republicans need only  stay together and they have the votes to confirm him.  That's where it  looks like it's heading right now, no question.  There's two more days of  hearings.  This one - today is supposed to go through 9:00 p.m. or maybe  even later, mercifully, hopefully not.  The fight is going to continue and  rage on for the next couple of days.  </p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, and a lot of people obviously have commented as well that you  have some Democrats there that might have a little bit of an ambitious  political future and that's another reason why these hearings are going the  way they are.  Phil, I can't let you go without asking you about the op-ed  in the \"New York Times\" right now.  We just discussed it with Brian  Stelter, but I wanted to get your take in terms of how people on Capitol  Hill will feel about this.  </p><p> [16:15:06]  </p><p> NEWTON:  The criticism has always been that the GOP just does not stand up  to the President and that - just is not worried really in the way other  people are about the President's policies or behaviors.  </p><p> MATTINGLY:  Yes, publicly, and I think that is the most interesting element  at least the thread that I have taken from the op-ed that I've read up to  this point is what you see in that op-ed reflects a lot of what I hear  privately from Republican members in the sense of they don't feel like it  helps them in any way, shape or form to publicly castigate the President,  to publicly attack the President or to call him out for doing things that  they believe break traditional norms.  </p><p> They believe kind of twofold.  First and foremost, if you want to get his  attention, you work behind the scenes.  That's how he responds best.  I've  had the Speaker of the House tell me that.  I've had the Majority Leader of  the Senate tell me that, but perhaps more importantly and there is a thread  of this in the op-ed, is the idea that there it is a Republican in the  White House and there is a graph or two in that op-ed where it talks about  the things that they have accomplished up to this point, which is  essentially what members of Congress have said.  </p><p> With a Republican in the White House, regardless of who that Republican is,  they have gotten the 2017 tax law.  You've seen the administrative agencies  cut back on decades of regulations that Democrats put into place that  Republicans have long opposed.  You see a number of significant policy  achievements that Republicans on Capitol Hill have been working for years  to get, and it's one of those things where this is the trade-off  essentially.  </p><p> If they have somebody that will sign these things whether legislatively or  via regulatory fiat then they will support him, at least publicly.  That  said, it does not mitigate in any way the concerns you hear behind the  scenes about how the President has run the office, how the President  operates via 280 characters particularly how he operates on foreign policy,  but it's the trade-off that you constantly see.  </p><p> I know it frustrates a lot of people, frankly, it frustrates some  Republicans, but the viewpoint up here is if you want to get stuff done,  particularly with a Republican in the White House, you just have to go  along to get along and that is why if you watch Speaker Ryan's press  conference today, or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's conference  today, they were asked about the Woodward book, they were asked about  tweets related to whether Jeff Sessions should be favoring Republicans in  his prosecutions and they didn't weigh in.  That's all the evidence you  need.  </p><p> NEWTON:  That is all the evidence we need and we take it right back to  Brett Kavanaugh because they are getting what they want, well, likely get  what they want in that nomination as well.  Phil, we will point out to  everyone, that so far the White House is saying that they have no response,  no comment yet on that \"New York Times\" editorial.  </p><p> Phil, really good to see you.  Appreciate it.  Coming up on QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS, the former Mexican President tells me why dropping NAFTA could  backfire for Donald Trump, and the case of the quarantined plane.  This is  so interesting and a bit alarming why health officials met this flight at  the airport.  </p><p> [16:20:56]  </p><p> NEWTON:  Canada's Foreign Minister for one isn't giving up on striking a  new NAFTA deal with the United States.  Chrystia Freeland says trade talks  remain constructive despite missing several key deadlines.  Now, President  Trump is raising the pressure on Canada threatening to strike a separate  agreement with Mexico.  Earlier, I spoke to the former Mexican President  Felipe Calderon who told me he believes Canada absolutely should be  included in any deal.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> FELIPE CALDERON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF MEXICO:  I want to be very respectful  about my own government, but the point is, that's the fact right now.  I  would rather have Canada with us.  But in any case, good news is we can  have a deal saving the trade with the United States which is very important  the for both countries.  </p><p> However, the devil is in the details and I don't know the details,  honestly.  Somebody is talking about there is some kind of (inaudible) or  secret agreement related with establishing a cap with Mexican exported  vehicles.  And honestly, if that is true, it is good in the sense that it  saves the industry for any blocking limitation.  </p><p> But also, it is bad because it is going to prevent the most successful  business story in Mexico.  The industry of cars are creating a lot of jobs,  and paradoxically, if you block export from Mexico to the United States,  you will have more Mexican workers trying to migrate to the United States  which is a bad idea, honestly.  </p><p> NEWTON:  That is a very interesting point.  So you are saying that this  could end up in a loose situation.  They think that they are moving jobs to  the United States, but they could also end up with a problem on illegal  immigration.  </p><p> CALDERON:  Completely.  It is a bad story for both.  For the United States,  because even the American cars will be more expensive for the consumers in  the United States and it's going to be - they are going to be - for those  cars out in the competition.  You know in the middle of the crisis in 2009,  the three big companies of the United States -- Chrysler, Ford Motors  Company and General Motors -- they saved the companies from bankruptcy with  their plants in Mexico because they were able to create incredible, fancy  competitive cars.  It's a story of integration.  </p><p> NEWTON:  President Trump would totally take you on with that and say that  was at the expense of American jobs.  That's what they are negotiating --  </p><p> CALDERON:  That's on the contrary.  On the contrary, this integrated way to  work saved millions of jobs in the United States.  Actually, there are more  - 1.2 American  families depending directly in the export towards Mexico  and even more, we are estimating at least six million families of American  workers dependent on the trade with Mexico including the car industry.   Because, when you see the level of integration we have, a car crosses the  border six or seven times.  So, a lot of American jobs are now under threat  I would say if we cancel the trade or we reduce the trade with Mexico,  honestly.  It is not only a Mexican story.  </p><p> NEWTON:  You know I can't let you go without talking to you about the wall.  </p><p> CALDERON:  Which wall, I'm sorry.  Wall Street?  We can talk about that.  </p><p> NEWTON:  The wall, President Trump continues to  say it will be built and  Mexico will pay for it.  At the end of the day, do you think it will die  with any --  </p><p> CALDERON:  Well, you know, I don't know what happened in the States, but  we, the Mexicans takes the words of the President of the United States  every day less seriously, with all due respect.  So maybe there will be a  wall, you want to put a wall in your garden, your landscape.  You want it  to be an ugly monument in your garden, you can do that.  But we are not  going to pay for it.  It's your own decision and your public work.  </p><p> I don't care about that.  But the wall is a solution of probably before  Middle Age.  China tried a wall long centuries ago and it is completely  useless.  What China doing today?  It is the One Belt One Road project,  which is investing massively in Asia and Africa, and that will be quite  smart strategy.  I think that will be the solution for the 21st Century,  not a wall.  </p><p> But I don't want to be trapped in the discussion of the wall.  I know there  are a lot of political feelings and strategies behind that, I respect that  of the President of the United States, but it is still, that is not going  to work for the United States and definitely, we are not going to pay any  single cent of that.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p> NEWTON:  OK, Felipe Calderon talking about these ongoing negotiations.  The  dairy industry in those negotiations has become a predictable sticking  point in those trade talks between the US and Canada.  Now, President Trump  has repeatedly lashed out at Canada for what he says are 249 percent tariff  on US dairy products, but levies on agricultural products are actually  quite common.  </p><p> [16:25:11]  </p><p> NEWTON:  In fact, the US imposes 350 percent tariff on some tobacco  products.  Now, giving in to the United States' demands could leave Prime  Minister Justin Trudeau very vulnerable politically.  Canada's dairy region  makes up a crucial part of his voter base.  He is going into an election  later next year, President Trump though isn't giving up the fight.  </p><p> He is repeating his calls to end dairy tariffs and this was in a press  conference earlier.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have to make a fair deal  with Canada.  As you know, they charge tariffs of 300 percent on dairy  products which a lot of people never understood.  They have walls up  against us doing business in Canada and yet, they come and do business with  us, and we can't let that happen.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> NEWTON:  Tom Vilsack is President and CEO of the US Dairy Export Council  and he was also a former Secretary of Agriculture.  He joins me now from  Des Moines, Iowa.  Thanks so much.  I cannot think of a better person to  put this pointed question to.  Would you leave Canada out of it especially  if they do not budge on dairy.  Just keep the bilateral deal with Mexico,  thank you very much.  </p><p> TOM VILSACK, PRESIDENT AND CEO, US DAIRY EXPORT COUNCIL:  The reality is  Canada needs to take care of the dairy business in this negotiations.  It's  an absolute must.  We are not going to have a NAFTA agreement that is  satisfactory to dairy producers, unless two things happen.  One, Canada  eliminates Class 7 pricing system, that's the story of the powder market,  and two, it opens up its markets.  </p><p> Absent those two things, I don't think it is an agreement that dairy  producers will be particularly excited about.  </p><p> NEWTON:  Meaning dairy producers want Canada involved?  They want to move  on this.  They want that trilateral deal.  </p><p> VILSACK:  They would like to see a NAFTA agreement where we modernize our  relationship with both Mexico and Canada.  We see a removal of the  retaliatory tariffs on our Cheeses in Mexico and an opening up of the  Canadian market.  It has been closed for far too long.  There is no  question their supply management system has caused them not to do right by  American producers, but more importantly, from a political perspective in  Canada, not to do right by their consumers.  Their consumers are paying  significantly more for their dairy products than they need to if we had a  more open, fair trade relationship with Canada.  </p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, Mr. Vilsack, that's milk I buy usually every week, if not  every day, and you have a point there in terms of consumer prices.  I just  want to get to what some American farmers have told CNN though even in  Wisconsin and saying, \"Look, what is wrong with the supply management  system?\"  Because quite frankly, US farmers sometimes are not that happy  with the kind of prices they get for their own dairy.  </p><p> VILSACK:  Well, the problem is that they don't basically solve problems  within the supply management system that's caused by the supply management  system.  That's why they created Class 7, a pricing system that has  distorted the powder market.  They couldn't get rid of the powder within  their own market because of the supply management, so they are dumping in  on the world market causing significant pain for producers not just in the  United States, but around the world.  </p><p> If you have a supply management system, then solve the problems that it  creates within that system.  Don't export those problems to the rest of the  world.  </p><p> NEWTON:  In terms of exporting problems to the rest of the world, the Trump  administration has caused problems for US dairy exports to China.  Your  organization has been vocal in terms of really trying to fight this.  What  do you have to say to the Trump administration if this escalates any  further in terms of the cost to that dairy industry in the United States?  </p><p> VILSACK:  We have done a study and there is no question that the tariffs  will have an impact on the dairy industry with reference to China.  We had  momentum building in that market.  This tariffs could potentially eliminate  that momentum and it could result in as much as $12 billion of lost revenue  over the next five years.  </p><p> Our message to the Trump administration is fairly clear, don't escalate on  the tariffs.  Get to the negotiating table.  Try to get this thing resolved  before the end of the year, otherwise, there is going to be significant  pain to the dairy producers in this country at a time when we're losing  dairy producers because of low prices.  </p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, and it will be important for us to follow that story as China  becomes an issue in the coming weeks.  Mr. Vilsack, I invite you back.   Please come back and talk to us because this will continue to be an issue  in the weeks to come.  Appreciate it.  </p><p> Now, it is 4:29, in fact, do you know where your data is?

Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey  testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, committee members  blasted Google for failing to even send anybody from their top leadership. </p><p> Now as we were just discussing Congress is working out how to police your  social media.  One company wants to give you control over your data right  now.</p><p> [16:35:00]  If you're like me, you use a range of online services, I am on  Twitter and Instagram, but there are a few others too, and Digi.me,  promises to put all of that data from all of your services.  We're talking  financial, health, social and more in one place.  </p><p> And get this, you can search it all and decide who can see it and who can  use it.  Joining me now is Shane Green; the CEO of Digi.me U.S.  Shane,  thanks so much for joining us.  Now, help me out, explain to me how this  works because at this point, it's sounding a bit too good to be true.</p><p> SHANE GREEN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DIGI.ME:  Hi Paula, and thanks for  having me today.  So Digi.me does exactly what you said.  It allows  individuals to plug in more than 15,000 different sources of data about  themselves, aggregated in one private and secure place that they control  and then set permissions on which apps or services get access to it.</p><p> And that's exactly what we're focused on, is putting that control back in  the hands of individuals.</p><p> NEWTON:  And in putting it back in the hands of individuals though, how all  encompassing is this, because I still assume that whatever data I willingly  give to Twitter or Facebook or Instagram, that they can still use exactly  the way they want to.</p><p> GREEN:  Well, we hear that a lot, and that is an obvious question.  Of  course, that data is going to continue to exist in other places out there,  but it's living in all of these different silos.  When you get your arms  around all of that data in one place, it gives you as an individual sort of  that unique competitive advantage to decide which other services get  access. </p><p> And that really gives you the differentiation in empowering those apps.   Your data combined in that way really lets any of those apps leave private  competition.</p><p> NEWTON:  And can you explain that to me a little bit further in terms of,  well, we've been used to hearing places like Facebook selling your data on,  that's still going to happen though as well, isn't it?</p><p> GREEN:  Well, it will happen, but I think increasingly, you're going to see  app developers and companies choose solutions like ours.  And you're  already starting to see this in a big way in Europe, where they have new  laws and just generally a whole different view on privacy and consent and  transparency.</p><p> And so what we're doing right now is basically, you know, firing the  starting gun in a race to the top among developers, to not only create the  best apps and the move value for your from your data, but also showing at  the same time a good steward they can be of your data.</p><p> NEWTON:  And do you think they'll be able to continue to do it for free? </p><p> GREEN:  Well, absolutely, we do get paid by the developers who build apps  and who ask for data from the users, and we're very transparent about that  to everyone involved.  We are not selling data or even able to touch, hold  or see data, so we really are just like a credit card company and that we  get paid every time that data gets delivered faithfully to another app that  abides by these new rules and respect your ownership and control of your  data.</p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, unfortunately, we've had problems with that before with other  companies, so we'll put that on hold for a second.  You know, we had raised  the possibility that, you know, this seems like it's important to people  when other times you see a lot of people don't have any problems with their  data going to these companies.</p><p> Because they kind of believe, you know what? There's a way to get it  anyway, and they kind of don't trust the entire system as it is.</p><p> GREEN:  Well, I think that's been true historically, but that's also  because people haven't had easy tools to use other options.  And so, that's  why the app developers are building another platform, they're doing --  they're creating very easy to use, compelling apps that maybe even do some  of the things other apps you're already using to do, like help you with  your -- managing your personal finances.</p><p> But when they tell you, we will do this with complete respect for your  privacy, complete control over their data and we will never do anything  with that data that you don't know about.  </p><p> That's very different, I think we're starting to find that people, you  know, they listen up and they say, yes, I want to try that, and when they  see that they can actually experience that in a way that's, you know,  transparent and clear, unlike most of the current services, it does start  to change their gratitude towards this.</p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, and it is a fair point as all of us become a little bit more  savvy about what's going on with our data out there.  Shane, thanks so  much, really appreciate it. </p><p> GREEN:  Thanks for having me. </p><p> NEWTON:  Now, coming up, dozens of people on board this plane right here  said they felt unwell.  Now, health officials met them on that JFK runway,  just a few hours ago, we will bring you the very latest after the break. </p><p> [16:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> NEWTON:  A major new UN report claims bold action on climate change could  deliver 26 trillion in economic benefits through 2030.  By taking action on  energy, food and land-use and industry, the report says more than 65  billion -- sorry, pardon me, million new low-carbon(ph) jobs could be  created by 2030.</p><p> Now, more than 700,000 premature deaths are now due to climate change and  those could be avoided.  And subsidy and reform and carbon pricing alone  are capable apparently of generating 2.8 trillion in revenues for  governments around the world by 2030.</p><p> Earlier, former Mexican President Felipe Calderon told me he's actually  convinced by the report claims.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> FELIPE CALDERON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF MEXICO:  It's a good economic argument  for people.  People thinking about jobs -- one example, solar and wind  energy, renewable energy already has in the United States more jobs, almost  500,000 jobs in the United States, more than coal and natural gas combined.</p><p> So it's a new story about economic growth and clean growth.  And talking  about business, let's talk about profits, you can get the businessmen a lot  of profits doing the right thing.  Just getting for instance energy  efficiency in your industry, you can get even more productivity, which  means more money, more revenues, more profit.</p><p> So these are -- this is a successful story about profits and about jobs and  about economic growth.</p><p> NEWTON:  What do you think the barriers are to getting to that point? And I  mean, it's OK to talk about it in the United States or Germany, to name  one, but what about in developing countries? In places like -- in countries  like Africa.  And I know a lot of Asian countries complain about this as  well.</p><p> They are just starting to get some momentum in their economies, and I think  sometimes they cannot afford this.</p><p> CALDERON:  Actually, it's the other way around.  Because for instance,  there are 1 billion people mainly in Africa that are -- they don't get  access to electricity for instance.  So they don't need to repeat the model  we have in the past.  So very -- polluting greens and a lot of stuff.</p><p> For instance, lift-trolling all the way to removable energy could be a  process, quite similar for instance to the phone lines, fixed phone lines.   You remember -- when I was -- </p><p> NEWTON:  I remember, believe me -- </p><p> CALDERON:  No, you don't, you don't remember, but I -- </p><p> NEWTON:  Oh, no, I remember -- </p><p> CALDERON:  Went -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> The whole idea is to have a fixed line everywhere -- </p><p> NEWTON:  Absolutely -- </p><p> CALDERON:  And suddenly India and a lot of developing countries, yes, leap  frog, the point, that's -- yes, modern phones and renewable energy could be  like that.  So in order to provide electricity for all those families, we  can do in a very modern, efficient, productive and of course clean way, and  instead to repeat the mistakes we did in the past.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> NEWTON:  OK, a number of passengers reported feeling ill on a flight from  Dubai to New York's JFK Airport.  The flight, again, from Dubai to New York  was on an Emirates flight it was quarantined at JFK Airport and the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 11 people were taken to  hospital for treatment. </p><p> [16:45:00]  Our Rene Marsh has been following all of this.  I mean, this is  a little bit alarming when you think about it.  Have they gotten to the  bottom of exactly why and how this happened?</p><p> RENE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATION &amp; TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT:  Yes,  so we are hearing some late words from the CDC, and according to a source  there at the CDC, respiratory illnesses like influenza are among what's  been considered as far as what caused these passengers to get sick.</p><p> We're talking about a flight, as you mentioned, it was from Dubai to New  York's JFK, there were more than 500 passengers on board.  That plane was  isolated once it landed at JFK Airport as multiple passengers reported  feeling sick.  Passengers and health officials say that people were  coughing, some had fevers. </p><p> Both the CDC and sources with the New York port authority which controls  JFK Airport said as many as 100 passengers reported feeling sick.  But the  airline says only 10 passengers were sick.  So the latest information that  we have from Emirates is that three passengers and seven crew, they were  taken to the hospital for further medical evaluation.</p><p> All the other passengers though, they were released and allowed to continue  with their travels.  But again, the late words from the CDC is that they're  looking at possibly illnesses like influenza as well as MERS which stands  for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome which is essentially a viral  respiratory disease that they first identified in 2012.</p><p> So they're just trying to get to the bottom of it, but right now, it does  not look like anything nefarious involved as far as why these people  looking sick -- </p><p> NEWTON:  Yes, which is a relief on the one hand, but this -- </p><p> MARSH:  Yes -- </p><p> NEWTON:  Is an A380, you know, you're talking about 500 passengers,  relieved to know that the vast majority were released.  And yet, we  actually have quite a few of the crew members that seem to be the ones that  were ill here.</p><p> MARSH:  Right, and again, you know, we all know that on those aircrafts,  that there's that air that's circulated and most times, the crew who have  to work in these conditions, they're there, they're exposed to so many  people on a daily basis with that recycled air. </p><p> So if it is indeed a case of influenza, that makes sense, because again -- </p><p> NEWTON:  Right -- </p><p> MARSH:  Traveling, we all know that sometimes you just get exposed to so  many people in such a short period of time.  But to your point, Paula, the  good news, you know, obviously, when we heard about so many people being  sick on a commercial aircraft, it raises a lot of red flags -- </p><p> NEWTON:  Oh, yes -- </p><p> MARSH:  But at this late hour, we're now beginning to learn that the CDC at  least at this point, they do not believe -- </p><p> NEWTON:  OK -- </p><p> MARSH:  Anything nefarious at this -- </p><p> NEWTON:  And that is good news, Rene, thanks so much, appreciate it.  Now,  on honest days, work for honest day's pay, that's what they're saying --  says.  After the break, overwhelming support for a former TV star  photographed working in a grocery store, we'll hear from the man at the  center of it all.</p><p> [16:50:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> NEWTON:  European markets closed in the red are right across the board as  investors track those international trade tensions.  Paris, as you can see  there, suffered the greatest losses, closing down over 1.5 percent.   Staying in Europe, a short, bad-tempered conflict between French and  British scallop fishermen has thankfully come to an end.</p><p> The truce in the so-called scallop wars was called after the French and  British governments reached a deal.  British fishermen will respect a  French closure period in a section of water in exchange for compensation.   Now, a former \"Cosby Show\" star who was really wrapped by the press working  for -- at the cash register.</p><p> And the paparazzi's got him on this one in a store and he told CNN that  afterwards, the outpouring really affected him because he at first was in  fact devastated by being photographed as you see there at Trader Joe's; a  grocery store here in New Jersey.</p><p> Now Geoffrey Owens was pictured bagging those groceries, he says it was an  apparent attempt to job-shame him.  Now you remember him starring as Alvin  in the \"Cosby Show\", he went on to play various roles on stage and on  screen.  He is still a working actor after this \"Daily Mail\" article came  out and a similar piece in Foxnew.com. </p><p> Fellow actors and fans rushed to his defense.  Our Chloe Melas tells us  that he really was put in an impossible situation.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  What is the most upsetting  though, although he's been getting some really positive reinforcement,  people like Tyler Perry have been offering him jobs in the wake of this.   It's the fact that he actually knew that the \"Daily Mail\" was going to be  publishing a story with photos of him. </p><p> And that they said, look, you better talk to us, because we're going to run  this story with or without you.  Well, he now has a very strong message for  the \"Daily Mail\" and \"Fox News\", both of which he says job-shamed him.</p><p> GEOFFREY OWENS, FORMER ACTOR:  They set out to exploit the fame in us in a  public that wants to see stories about people who were once great or  celebrated, now fallen, fallen from grace.  There's something in us that is  titillated by that, that's what those news outlets are exploiting.</p><p> But hey, this is what I think of it, you know, \"Fox News\", if I'm in \"Fox  News\", then I must be a fox.  I hope you learned your lesson, I hope that  you see that people are better than you think they are.  That people don't  want to celebrate people's downfalls, they want to lift people up again.</p><p> And as I quote, \"great is the temptation to do good\", our better natures  will prevail, and that might mean that you sell a few less papers, et  cetera.  But people are better than what you're giving them credit for.</p><p> MELAS:  I have to tell you though in light of all the media scrutiny and  these outlets, publishing these stories, he's had to quit his job at Trader  Joe's now.  So currently, he's out of a job and looking for work. </p><p> NEWTON:  And I find the nuts and bolts to this so interesting.  We have to  say this is an incredibly talented, articulate man, he is still an actor,  he still works as an actor, it just doesn't make enough money for him right  now -- </p><p> MELAS:  Exactly -- </p><p> NEWTON:  This is a Yale graduate -- </p><p> MELAS:  That's what I was going to say -- </p><p> NEWTON:  I think -- I think other than him saying that people want to  celebrate downfall, I think a lot of -- you know, what I immediately  thought of is they're by the grace of God go, and I give him so much  credit.  Why did that not happen in these publications.</p><p> This is an everyman.  This is a man that's out there trying to put food on  the table.  Some interesting that we spoke about is that what people don't  realize is that it's been over two decades since the \"Cosby Show\" was on  the air.  And he actually touched me about the fact that he hasn't had  steady work in that time.</p><p> OWENS:  The \"Cosby Show\" ended 26 years ago.  And in the past 26 years, I  have hardly ever had an acting job that lasted more than 10 weeks.  And  most of those jobs were theater jobs which pay a lot less than television  and film.  So basically, for the last 26 years, I haven't had steady  employment. </p><p> The article was negative, the article was from a kind of a shaming slants,  oh, look at him now, isn't that sad? You know, under the guise of, oh, I  feel bad for him.  But it was really kind of like, you know, isn't this --  you know, isn't this interesting how the -- you know, mighty television  star is now just bagging groceries at a grocery store.</p><p> [16:55:00]  So that was the initial thing, and that stung, that was  definitely hurtful especially, you know, the picture they chose to use and  stuff like that.  You know, it seems like they kind of went out of their  way to use like the very worst image, it was all designed to look as bad as  possible.</p><p> But the good thing was it lasted a very short time before all the positive  supportive responses started coming in from around the world.  So there's  initial shocking, and ever since I kind of forgot when the story is going  to come out, I kind of played it out like what would be the worst case  scenario like how bad is it going to be?</p><p> And it was worse.  When it came out, it was like -- I was like, oh, my  gosh, this is worst than I ever imagined.  But that lasted a very short  time before all the support started coming in and just overwhelming the bad  stuff.</p><p> MELAS:  Well, look, he also spoke to me about the fact that when Bill  Cosby, the star of the \"Cosby Show\" started being accused of rape by  multiple women, a network society to pull the \"Cosby Show\" off the air,  that that impacted him financially because he wasn't making royalties off  of the re-runs anymore.</p><p> Now, Tyler Perry and others have come forward and offered him jobs now, and  he says he doesn't want anybody to feel sorry for him, he doesn't want  anybody giving him a handout just because he has this new found notoriety.   He wants to get more auditions though because of this and compete with his  peers.</p><p> NEWTON:  And hopefully he will because we all miss him on TV, I don't know,  and we all did and we miss him on TV -- </p><p> MELAS:  Yes -- </p><p> NEWTON:  I thought it was so incredible too, when he said no job should be  valued among another.  And for those of us who come from incredibly modest  backgrounds, we all believe that, right? I mean, this is great that he was  out there -- </p><p> MELAS:  How anybody could criticize somebody for just working to make a  living is just absurd and really offensive -- </p><p> NEWTON:  And on Labor Day. </p><p> MELAS:  Definitely -- </p><p> NEWTON:  I know, so we will continue, I hope now to follow his career, and  thanks so much -- </p><p> MELAS:  You're welcome -- </p><p> NEWTON:  Really appreciate bringing the story too.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> NEWTON:  Now, if you want to keep on top of the day's business headlines in  just 90 seconds, then try our daily briefing podcast, it's updated twice a  day before and after the bell rings on Wall Street, and you can just ask  Alexa or your Google home device for your, quote, \"CNNMoney flash  briefing\", and that is every weekday. </p><p> And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for today, I can tell you for those  viewers waiting for him, Richard Quest will be back.  Now, you can see I  have no bell here, I can ring no bell, Richard doesn't let me ring the  bell.  I have my own bell to ring, can tell him that I did it when I come  back, OK? Richard will be right in the chair. </p><p> Thanks for joining me, the news continues right here on CNN.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Since last year, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been bearing the brunt of a nationwide effort to crack down on questionable privacy practices by Big Tech. Now, Zuckerberg says he's taking another crack at self-regulation with a new \"privacy-focused vision\" for his scandal-prone company \u2013 and for social networking at large.</p><p>New York has been at the forefront of the privacy push: former state Attorney General Barbara Underwood launched an investigation of Facebook that focused on the company's data-sharing practices with other corporations following the Cambridge Analytica controversy in March 2018. More recently, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced in February that two state agencies would probe another aspect of Facebook's privacy features after a report surfaced that Facebook had access to users' personal data from other apps.</p><p> In a blog post on Wednesday, Zuckerberg laid out a six-pronged approach to privacy, with much of the strategy being devoted to shifting social media posts to private, end-to-end encrypted interactions, rather than the public, forum-like shared posts that were a hallmark of early Facebook.</p><p> The New York state probes are hardly at the top of the social networking giant's list of concerns \u2013 a multibillion-dollar fine being considered by the Federal Trade Commission surely ranks higher \u2013 but Zuckerberg's latest announcement does indicate the company is making what could be last-ditch efforts to self-regulate while actual privacy legislation in Congress lingers in the discussion stages.</p><p> For the rest of today's tech news, head over to First Read Tech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

It did not go well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hearing, held by a House Judiciary Committee panel, featured almost five hours of sharp criticism by lawmakers of shockingly anti-competitive practices allegedly deployed by Amazon and three other dominant technology companies - Alphabet, Facebook and Apple. Although Republicans at the hearing seemed more concerned about instances of alleged bias against conservatives, members from both parties hammered Bezos and his counterparts for seeming to use their positions as gatekeepers of crucial platforms to advance their own interests, harm competitors and abuse the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The panel has been gathering information for more than a year about the companies' possible violations of U.S. antitrust law. The hearing gave the four leaders the chance to rebut evidence the panel collected from internal company documents and testimony from their competitors and customers. They were not persuasive.</p><p> The four companies' products and services overlap, but each has a near-chokehold over one or more multibillion-dollar markets. Amazon is responsible for about 40% of e-commerce in the United States and holds a similar lead in the market for hosting internet-based services. Alphabet's Google handles more then 90% of the world's internet searches, and its YouTube user-generated video platform is the most popular in the United States. Facebook is the world's largest social network and, along with Google, dominates online advertising. Apple doesn't corner the market on any products or services, but the only way to sell software and services to the roughly 1 billion iPhones and iPads in use worldwide is to pass through Apple's App Store.</p><p> The CEOs insisted that they face rigorous competition and are focused on delivering the best possible products and experiences for consumers. But lawmakers offered example after example of the companies appearing to use their market power to distort the competitive landscape, and the answers offered by the CEOs were singularly unsatisfying. Bezos, for instance, acknowledged that Amazon used data aggregated from other sellers on its platform to develop competing products. Alphabet's Sundar Pichai struggled to explain what his company's data policies were and whether it adjusted its search engine to favor its own products and harm competitors.</p><p>Apple's Tim Cook sought to defend the company's practice of demanding 30% of the revenue app developers collect from their sales as an enormous discount from the software distribution costs of yore, as opposed to a toll that it forced developers to pay. And Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg had to admit that yes, his company has a history of buying up companies that it perceived as threats to its business.</p><p> One potential hurdle for Big Tech's critics is that U.S. antitrust law is uniquely focused on preventing harm to consumers, not to competitors. And because many of the products and services that Big Tech companies offer are free to use, it isn't automatically clear how consumers are harmed when the companies compete unfairly. That's an issue for Congress to explore.</p><p> In the meantime, though, the panel is assembling a powerful case for regulators to pursue. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have launched investigations into multiple Big Tech companies, as have many state attorneys general. If Wednesday's hearing is any guide, the companies have much to answer for.</p><p>           Los Angeles Times    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-5291741</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28984B082CD046 NWBKMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JF-X0F1-DXVP-V0FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"598\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Marshfield Mariner<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It did not go well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hearing, held by a House Judiciary Committee panel, featured almost five hours of sharp criticism by lawmakers of shockingly anti-competitive practices allegedly deployed by Amazon and three other dominant technology companies - Alphabet, Facebook and Apple. Although Republicans at the hearing seemed more concerned about instances of alleged bias against conservatives, members from both parties hammered Bezos and his counterparts for seeming to use their positions as gatekeepers of crucial platforms to advance their own interests, harm competitors and abuse the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The panel has been gathering information for more than a year about the companies' possible violations of U.S. antitrust law. The hearing gave the four leaders the chance to rebut evidence the panel collected from internal company documents and testimony from their competitors and customers. They were not persuasive.</p><p> The four companies' products and services overlap, but each has a near-chokehold over one or more multibillion-dollar markets. Amazon is responsible for about 40% of e-commerce in the United States and holds a similar lead in the market for hosting internet-based services. Alphabet's Google handles more then 90% of the world's internet searches, and its YouTube user-generated video platform is the most popular in the United States. Facebook is the world's largest social network and, along with Google, dominates online advertising. Apple doesn't corner the market on any products or services, but the only way to sell software and services to the roughly 1 billion iPhones and iPads in use worldwide is to pass through Apple's App Store.</p><p> The CEOs insisted that they face rigorous competition and are focused on delivering the best possible products and experiences for consumers. But lawmakers offered example after example of the companies appearing to use their market power to distort the competitive landscape, and the answers offered by the CEOs were singularly unsatisfying. Bezos, for instance, acknowledged that Amazon used data aggregated from other sellers on its platform to develop competing products. Alphabet's Sundar Pichai struggled to explain what his company's data policies were and whether it adjusted its search engine to favor its own products and harm competitors.</p><p>Apple's Tim Cook sought to defend the company's practice of demanding 30% of the revenue app developers collect from their sales as an enormous discount from the software distribution costs of yore, as opposed to a toll that it forced developers to pay. And Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg had to admit that yes, his company has a history of buying up companies that it perceived as threats to its business.</p><p> One potential hurdle for Big Tech's critics is that U.S. antitrust law is uniquely focused on preventing harm to consumers, not to competitors. And because many of the products and services that Big Tech companies offer are free to use, it isn't automatically clear how consumers are harmed when the companies compete unfairly. That's an issue for Congress to explore.</p><p> In the meantime, though, the panel is assembling a powerful case for regulators to pursue. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have launched investigations into multiple Big Tech companies, as have many state attorneys general. If Wednesday's hearing is any guide, the companies have much to answer for.</p><p>            Los Angeles Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-5291744</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28984CE426E578 NWBKMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JK-D3X1-DXVP-V3FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Pembroke Mariner and Express<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It did not go well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hearing, held by a House Judiciary Committee panel, featured almost five hours of sharp criticism by lawmakers of shockingly anti-competitive practices allegedly deployed by Amazon and three other dominant technology companies - Alphabet, Facebook and Apple. Although Republicans at the hearing seemed more concerned about instances of alleged bias against conservatives, members from both parties hammered Bezos and his counterparts for seeming to use their positions as gatekeepers of crucial platforms to advance their own interests, harm competitors and abuse the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The panel has been gathering information for more than a year about the companies' possible violations of U.S. antitrust law.</p><p> The hearing gave the four leaders the chance to rebut evidence the panel collected from internal company documents and testimony from their competitors and customers. They were not persuasive.</p><p> The four companies' products and services overlap, but each has a near-chokehold over one or more multibillion-dollar markets.</p><p>Amazon is responsible for about 40% of e-commerce in the United States and holds a similar lead in the market for hosting internet-based services.</p><p> Alphabet's Google handles more then 90% of the world's internet searches, and its YouTube user-generated video platform is the most popular in the United States. Facebook is the world's largest social network and, along with Google, dominates online advertising.</p><p>Apple doesn't corner the market on any products or services, but the only way to sell software and services to the roughly 1 billion iPhones and iPads in use worldwide is to pass through Apple's App Store.</p><p> The CEOs insisted that they face rigorous competition and are focused on delivering the best possible products and experiences for consumers. But lawmakers offered example after example of the companies appearing to use their market power to distort the competitive landscape, and the answers offered by the CEOs were singularly unsatisfying.</p><p> Bezos, for instance, acknowledged that Amazon used data aggregated from other sellers on its platform to develop competing products. Alphabet's Sundar Pichai struggled to explain what his company's data policies were and whether it adjusted its search engine to favor its own products and harm competitors.</p><p>Apple's Tim Cook sought to defend the company's practice of demanding 30% of the revenue app developers collect from their sales as an enormous discount from the software distribution costs of yore, as opposed to a toll that it forced developers to pay.</p><p> And Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg had to admit that yes, his company has a history of buying up companies that it perceived as threats to its business.</p><p> One potential hurdle for Big Tech's critics is that U.S. antitrust law is uniquely focused on preventing harm to consumers, not to competitors. And because many of the products and services that Big Tech companies offer are free to use, it isn't automatically clear how consumers are harmed when the companies compete unfairly. That's an issue for Congress to explore.</p><p> In the meantime, though, the panel is assembling a powerful case for regulators to pursue. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have launched investigations into multiple Big Tech companies, as have many state attorneys general. If Wednesday's hearing is any guide, the companies have much to answer for.</p><p>           Los Angeles Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-5291745</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28980915BDBB30 NWBKMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JD-M0H1-JBCN-43GJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cohasset Mariner<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It did not go well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hearing, held by a House Judiciary Committee panel, featured almost five hours of sharp criticism by lawmakers of shockingly anti-competitive practices allegedly deployed by Amazon and three other dominant technology companies - Alphabet, Facebook and Apple. Although Republicans at the hearing seemed more concerned about instances of alleged bias against conservatives, members from both parties hammered Bezos and his counterparts for seeming to use their positions as gatekeepers of crucial platforms to advance their own interests, harm competitors and abuse the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The panel has been gathering information for more than a year about the companies' possible violations of U.S. antitrust law. The hearing gave the four leaders the chance to rebut evidence the panel collected from internal company documents and testimony from their competitors and customers. They were not persuasive.</p><p> The four companies' products and services overlap, but each has a near-chokehold over one or more multibillion-dollar markets. Amazon is responsible for about 40% of e-commerce in the United States and holds a similar lead in the market for hosting internet-based services. Alphabet's Google handles more then 90% of the world's internet searches, and its YouTube user-generated video platform is the most popular in the United States. Facebook is the world's largest social network and, along with Google, dominates online advertising. Apple doesn't corner the market on any products or services, but the only way to sell software and services to the roughly 1 billion iPhones and iPads in use worldwide is to pass through Apple's App Store.</p><p> The CEOs insisted that they face rigorous competition and are focused on delivering the best possible products and experiences for consumers. But lawmakers offered example after example of the companies appearing to use their market power to distort the competitive landscape, and the answers offered by the CEOs were singularly unsatisfying. Bezos, for instance, acknowledged that Amazon used data aggregated from other sellers on its platform to develop competing products. Alphabet's Sundar Pichai struggled to explain what his company's data policies were and whether it adjusted its search engine to favor its own products and harm competitors.</p><p>Apple's Tim Cook sought to defend the company's practice of demanding 30% of the revenue app developers collect from their sales as an enormous discount from the software distribution costs of yore, as opposed to a toll that it forced developers to pay. And Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg had to admit that yes, his company has a history of buying up companies that it perceived as threats to its business.</p><p> One potential hurdle for Big Tech's critics is that U.S. antitrust law is uniquely focused on preventing harm to consumers, not to competitors. And because many of the products and services that Big Tech companies offer are free to use, it isn't automatically clear how consumers are harmed when the companies compete unfairly. That's an issue for Congress to explore.</p><p> In the meantime, though, the panel is assembling a powerful case for regulators to pursue. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have launched investigations into multiple Big Tech companies, as have many state attorneys general. If Wednesday's hearing is any guide, the companies have much to answer for.</p><p>           Los Angeles Times    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-5291743</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28981B1BC7B710 NWBKMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JD-M0H1-JBCN-43GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"598\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Hingham Journal<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It did not go well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hearing, held by a House Judiciary Committee panel, featured almost five hours of sharp criticism by lawmakers of shockingly anti-competitive practices allegedly deployed by Amazon and three other dominant technology companies - Alphabet, Facebook and Apple. Although Republicans at the hearing seemed more concerned about instances of alleged bias against conservatives, members from both parties hammered Bezos and his counterparts for seeming to use their positions as gatekeepers of crucial platforms to advance their own interests, harm competitors and abuse the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The panel has been gathering information for more than a year about the companies' possible violations of U.S. antitrust law. The hearing gave the four leaders the chance to rebut evidence the panel collected from internal company documents and testimony from their competitors and customers. They were not persuasive.</p><p> The four companies' products and services overlap, but each has a near-chokehold over one or more multibillion-dollar markets. Amazon is responsible for about 40% of e-commerce in the United States and holds a similar lead in the market for hosting internet-based services. Alphabet's Google handles more then 90% of the world's internet searches, and its YouTube user-generated video platform is the most popular in the United States. Facebook is the world's largest social network and, along with Google, dominates online advertising. Apple doesn't corner the market on any products or services, but the only way to sell software and services to the roughly 1 billion iPhones and iPads in use worldwide is to pass through Apple's App Store.</p><p> The CEOs insisted that they face rigorous competition and are focused on delivering the best possible products and experiences for consumers. But lawmakers offered example after example of the companies appearing to use their market power to distort the competitive landscape, and the answers offered by the CEOs were singularly unsatisfying. Bezos, for instance, acknowledged that Amazon used data aggregated from other sellers on its platform to develop competing products. Alphabet's Sundar Pichai struggled to explain what his company's data policies were and whether it adjusted its search engine to favor its own products and harm competitors.</p><p>Apple's Tim Cook sought to defend the company's practice of demanding 30% of the revenue app developers collect from their sales as an enormous discount from the software distribution costs of yore, as opposed to a toll that it forced developers to pay.

Even when wrongdoing is clear, DPAs hesitate to use powers because they can't afford the cost of legally defending their decisions.'If the GDPR is at risk of failing, the fault lies with national governments, not with the data protection authorities', said Brave's chief policy and industry relations officer Dr Johnny Ryan.'Robust, adversarial enforcement is essential. GDPR enforcers must be able to properly investigate 'big tech', and act without fear of vexatious appeals. But the national governments of European countries have not given them the resources to do so. </p><p>The European Commission must intervene.'The issues are exclusively the fault of national governments, Brave insists, although the report does single out the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)[3] for dedicating just 3% of its 680 staff focus on tech privacy issues. This is despite the ICO being Europe's largest regulator, and the most expensive to run.Advertisement - Article continues belowThe budget and headcount of Ireland's Data Protection Commission, meanwhile, which is the 'lead authority'[4] on probes against major companies like Google and Facebook, is not growing fast enough to keep up with its rising caseload[5].With regards to staff count, the report revealed the German data regulator has dedicated the most specialists to examine tech issues, 101, which accounts for 29% of Europe's experts.The German authorities are followed by Spain's regulator, which recruits 36, and the French authorities that recruit28. The UK's ICO recruits just 22 tech experts, despite, as mentioned, being the largest and most expensive DPA to run.The ICO's budget has doubled between 2018 and 2020, from \u20ac30 (26.2 million) to \u20ac61 million (53.3 million). The German DPA has a budget of \u20ac58.9 million (51.4 million) for 2020, with the next best-funded regulator, the Italian authorities, enjoying a budget of almost half these two DPAsat \u20ac30.1 million (26.3 million).Advertisement - Article continues below'The ICO recognises the vitally important role of technical specialists in addressing data protection and privacy concerns, and this is reflected in our priorities and technology strategy,' a spokesperson told IT Pro. Related Resource Don't just collect data, innovate with it.Removing the barriers to the experience economy Download now[6] This was in response to the claim that, should it make a modest investment in tech specialists in proportion to its budget, the ICO could make a significant impact on its capacity to properly engage with tech-related issues.'While we are not yet at the level of capacity and capability we are planning for,' the spokesperson added, 'we will continue to invest significantly in this area.'To save GDPR[7], Brave has recommended that governments invest far more in tech specialists, and pay competitive salaries to attract the best talent. Governments, meanwhile, should provide financing to allow DPAs to pursue enforcement, and defend decisions against expensive legal appeals by major tech companies.The EU, meanwhile, should urgently establish a tech investigative unit to support national DPAs, with substantial permanent staff and a small rotating temporary staff capacity from national DPAs.The European Commission should also launch an infringement procedure against EU countries that fail to implement Article 52(4) of the GDPR, which states member states should ensure each DPA is provided with the human, technical and financial resources, premises and infrastructure required to perform their tasks.

The struggle of consumer education has long been an uphill battle for the agricultural industry. However, when agriculturalists look to themselves for an even deeper understanding of today's modern agriculture, even the most astute farmer might struggle with identifying some key terms that represent some incredible advancements in the industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dating even farther back than Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin, agriculture has and continues to be, forever evolving. With this evolution come some phrases or \"buzz words\" that are important to acknowledge and understand.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HYDROPONICS</p><p>Many agree that the trend for hydroponic farming will only continue upward as resources used in traditional farming become more scarce and expensive. In its simplest form, hydroponic farming is the methodof growing crops one of two ways--in a medium (often gravel, sand orrockwool) or in a liquid only nutrient mixture.</p><p>Hydroponic farming can either be done inside a climate-controlled environment like a greenhouse, or outside where plants are susceptible to everyday elements. Regardless of the growing condition, hydroponic plants use an average of 90% less water than traditional in-groundsystems, because water and nutrients are directly administered to the individual plants without the cause to irrigate and fertilize massive amounts of land.</p><p>PRECISION AGRICULTURE</p><p>Once limited to luxury automobiles and NASA, Global Positioning System (GPS) has exploded into the lives of the common, everyday person.</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>With advances in GPS and the concept of precision agriculture, tractors can now drive themselves in a multitude of capacities includingplanting, furrowing/cultivating and even harvesting. All a farmer has to do is press a few buttons inside their tractor cabs and sit backwhile the machines literally drive themselves in sync with their pre-installed electronic maps--producing nearly perfect results done in a fraction of the time.</p><p>Even monitoring systems use GPS to highlight areas of a field thatneed more or less attention from the farmer related to factors such as irrigation, chemical applications and pest problems--again saving time and money by cutting waste.</p><p>GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS</p><p>Often farmers joke about knowing their fields better than they know the back of their own hands, but imagine the ability for farmers tosee their properties from a perspective like never before.</p><p>Through the use of computer software, analytical methods and a whole lot of patience, today's scientists can actually map out a given area with so much detail that farmers are able to see a three dimensional view of their fields including rises and dips, terrain types and a multitude of items that could completely change their farming dynamics.</p><p>Harnessing the power of geospatial analysis gives farmers the upper hand to increase efficiencies in their fields that could never be attained with just the human mind. Through the combination of geospatial analysis and GPS technologies, significant improvements can be made to the farming process resulting in better yields with far less inputs.</p><p>BIOFUELS</p><p>While the concept of biofuels has been around since the turn of the 19th century, oil shortage concerns in recent decades have sparked a new interest in these renewable energy sources.</p><p>Today most people associate biofuel with ethanol, a fuel source derived from corn, however, the scope of biofuels has progressed to a point that it includes a wide range of fuels that derive from biomass.From sugar cane to vegetable oils, wood chips to animal fats, new supplies of biofuels are being developed and improved every day.</p><p>Agriculture has the opportunity to embrace this movement as many crops and crop byproducts can be used in the biofuels creation processwhile creating an additional stream of revenue for a farming operation.</p><p>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</p><p>\"Going Green\" has become a hot topic in society today with concerns stemming from climate change and other environmental impacts that humans have on earth.</p><p>Within the green movement exists the idea of sustainable agriculture. Though hard to narrow down to a specific way of farming or production, sustainable agriculture takes from various practices to sustainthe economic viability of a farm operation while ensuring that farmers take steps to preserve resources through improved farm efficiencies.</p><p>Such practices include, but are not limited to: long-term crop rotations; returns to natural flooding cycles to replenish lost nutrients; low or no-tillage cultivation; modified irrigation systems vs. traditional flood irrigation; natural fertilizers instead of synthetics,and appropriate urban planning which calls for more densely populated city areas in order to preserve more usable farmland.</p><p>INTEGRATED FARMING/AGRICULTURE</p><p>Integrated agriculture practices stem from the idea of a holistic approach to farming.</p><p>Traditionally, farmers have had a monoculture method to production, meaning that they focus on one aspect of production, i.e. growing acrop, without creating a \"cycle\" within the operation. For a simple example, a farmer who grows corn will do so using external inputs--i.e. purchased fertilizers and other items not produced from the farm.</p><p>With an integrated farming approach, that same farmer would investin a flock of chickens who would produce fertilizer for his corn andin turn, the finished corn product would feed the chickens and so on, therefore creating a cycle environment that makes the farm more sustainable.</p><p>While not yet wildly popular and somewhat difficult for larger scale operations, integrated agriculture is showing promising signs of success.</p><p>ORGANIC FARMING</p><p>Among the newest phrases in modern agriculture, organic has been ahighly talked about and debated topic. In its simplest form, organicagriculture is a system of producing a crop using standard methods set forth by the United States Department of Agriculture and certifiedby a third party organization. Since organic farming is labeled and marketed to consumers as organic, its production practices are heavily monitored and regulated as opposed to sustainable or integrated agriculture which, at this time, do not have a standardized process although there are shared concepts among all three.</p><p>The use of organic farming methods has historically translated to lower crop yields versus conventional farming. However, given the higher price point of organic products either method of farming producesroughly the same amount of profit margin.</p><p>A large deterrent from the transition to organic farming is the certification process which takes, at minimum, three years to complete during which time farmers have to adhere to organic farming practicesbut are still subject to receiving conventional pricing.</p><p>BIOTECHNOLOGY IN AGRICULTURE</p><p>Biotechnology as an industry has boomed during the last 20 years, rarely falling prey to economic downturns.</p><p>Fundamentally, biotechnology is the science of modifying living organisms according to human purposes. In agriculture, biotechnology has taken on the term \"genetically modified food\" and has led the way toward vast improvements in crop production and efficiencies that offer multiple benefits. These benefits include, but not limited to: higher crop yields; drought tolerant plants, increases in nutritional values; improved taste or appearance, and the decreased need for inputs (fertilizers, pesticides).</p><p>Though somewhat controversial, through its history with continuingdiscussions both for and against the technologies, the benefits haveso far appeared to outweigh the criticisms.</p><p>OPPORTUNITIES</p><p>These technological advances bring agriculture to the forefront ofproviding new, innovative career opportunities for people who might not otherwise consider a job in agriculture.</p><p>With so many avenues of career options, and a better understandingof how those options integrate with the industry, students and job seekers alike can better plan how their skill sets and abilities will put them in a position that is a perfect fit.</p><p>The computer engineer is no longer limited to the big tech companies and the chemist isn't tied down to a research lab--in agriculture,there truly is something for everyone.</p><p>by Brandon Souza, AgCareers.com Western Account Manager</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Every country's regulatory framework was born out of and developed in its unique situation and context. In India, the regulatory state emerged as an unavoidable outcome of the economic crisis and international pressures. Against the backdrop of this crisis, in a country with huge inequalities, the regulations were designed to depoliticise certain decision-making processes, maximise welfare, prevent monopolies, and still try to accomplish the unattained goal of distributive justice.</p><p><br/><br/>Almost two decades after the watershed 1991 reforms, the book under review, true to its title, undertakes a much-needed analysis of regulation in India and its design, capacity, and performance. In the absence of a comprehensive study of the foundations, and how regulations have evolved and performed over time and in different sectors, this book is the first major study encompassing these aspects and is a critical contribution to existing literature.<br/><br/>Even though there are common objectives for regulations across sectors, they have differed in design (architecture of the regulatory bodies, their jurisdiction, and powers) and in the amount of external influence (such as political interests, judicial interference) they experience, resulting in significant differences in functioning and performance. This is exemplified by Amit Kapur in his chapter, where he observes that there is little in common in the infrastructure sector, as regulations in industries developed in verticals, each evolving its own policy at different stages of market development. The ability to find distinctive features and patterns in the diverse manifestation of Indian regulations is perhaps one of the biggest strengths of the book. Further, the inquiry into administrative law contributes to our understanding of governance and the underlying principles and context of the regulatory state. Given that this has, so far, received very little attention in scholarship, it is a significant strength of the book.<br/><br/>Current State of Regulations<br/><br/>The 16 chapters are arranged in four parts covering various themes. Devesh Kapur and Madhav Khosla in the introduction write about the reality of Indian regulations. Their premise is that the study of the regulatory state is necessary to address issues of inequality, accountability, and economic growth because of the legal ambiguities and institutional weaknesses that plague it. Unlike the work of scholars like Chandrashekhar and Ghosh, they do not delve into the run-up to the 1991 reforms or the normative aspects of regulations (Chandrashekhar 2011; Chandrashekhar and Ghosh 2002). Instead, they concern themselves with examining the current state of Indian regulations and their defining and distinctive features.<br/><br/>The authors identify five themes. The first is regarding the doctrinal incoherence and uncertainty of regulations. The chapters on this topic make a case for greater focus to be given to understanding and reforming the underdeveloped administrative law of the country, which forms the basis of regulation. Together, they posit that the judiciary is largely responsible for this underdevelopment because of their excessive reliance on judicial review, judicial oversight, and their preference for a case-by-case application of common law over systematic legislative reforms. The institutional changes required for an effective regulatory state have not been achieved due to this piecemeal development of regulatory jurisprudence. This observation establishes a foundation to look at the incapacities of the regulatory state, and we can see that this is the sectoral examination conducted in subsequent chapters.<br/><br/>The second theme central to regulations is about their incapacity and structural weaknesses, and the lack of incentives to address it. The authors find several common factors responsible for this: the lack of domain experts, technically incompetent staff and leaders, a large number of vacancies, and inadequate investment in building staff capacity, domain expertise, and infrastructure like laboratories. Every sector faces this problem, be it in relatively successful securities regulation (Securities and Exchange Board of India) or in pollution control where there is woeful incompetence; or in the established regulations in traditional banking or the nascent sector of data protection. The authors observe that this could be because the elected representatives see a little electoral gain in investing in capacity building, or that it is a deliberate strategy to ensure political dominance.<br/><br/>The third theme deals with the independence of the regulators. The design of the regulators' power and structure is ambiguous, and suffers from jurisdictional overlap and turf wars. Often, the state exercises control over regulators' decision-making to give state-run enterprises an unfair advantage, resulting in an uneven playing field and a regulator with no real powers. Further, there is ineffective coordination and fragmentation of power. This can be observed in the electricity sector, with tension at various levels between agencies in the central government, between the centre and states, and between states. With decision-making moving outside the elected legislature to an unelected regulator, not building in adequate consultative processes and accountability towards its stakeholders is a notable design flaw that keeps out citizens and industries affected by regulations.<br/><br/>The fourth aspect afflicting regulators in India is their inability to deal with new and disruptive technology. This is especially true in sectors like telecom, banking, and big data where regulators are constantly playing catch-up because of rapid changes. With the rise of big tech such as GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple), their role in retail, food delivery, social media, and internet or even transportation (Uber and Ola) raises multiple issues about competition laws, data localisation, content moderation, algorithmic decision-making, ethical advertising on the platform and more. The cross-sectoral nature of it makes it tougher to regulate. For example, the rise of electric vehicle sharing platforms cuts across sectors of data and technology, transportation, and renewable energy. As the authors have acknowledged, the scope of this problem is not adequately addressed in the book. While this could be due to the lack of existing regulation, discussing these issues in the Indian context and how they are currently addressed along with possible solutions would be a useful addition.<br/><br/>The fifth theme looks at how international regulations have guided the formation of domestic policy. This has particular relevance in Vikramaditya Khanna's chapter on food regulation where he talks about the inadequacies of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and their reliance on global food standards as benchmarks. This becomes problematic considering the regulator's lack of expertise and inability to handle the sheer scale and immense diversity of local food. This theme also emerges from Shibani Ghosh's chapter on environmental regulation where there is a failure to adopt international standards, resulting in unscientifically set standards that fail to control pollution in India.<br/><br/>Diverse Themes Covered<br/><br/>Apart from this, across chapters, the book engages with several other themes. The conflict between environmental goods and industrial development comes across in chapters on renewable energy and the environment. Akshay Jaitley writes about the incoherence in policies, where a developing country like ours would like to simultaneously import cheap solar cells with claims of \"make in India.\" There is also the tussle between affordability and viability, as it plays out in the electricity sector where regulators need to have low tariffs and also manage the financial health of distribution companies (discoms). It is from negotiations like this, where regulators face conflicting, and sometimes incompatible objectives of efficiency and distributive justice, that Kapur and Khosla draw the conclusion that regulations in India are \"intrinsically political.\"<br/><br/>The book is especially relevant because the topics it addresses give us a lens through which we can holistically understand several ongoing and pressing issues that continue to arise in the regulatory state. The recent Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) bank collapse exposed the weaknesses of having two regulators: the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government. Cooperative banks are registered under and partially regulated by the Co-operative Societies Act, 1912 and their management is not supervised by the RBI. Rather they are overseen, rather inadequately, by the government, resulting in oversights (Rebello and Nayak 2019). This issue of multiplicity of regulators in banking is raised by Suyash Rai, and can also be seen in the securities market and the telecom sector. This poses a choice between the dangers of fragmentation versus the dangers of consolidation by a super-regulator.<br/><br/>Ananth Padmanaban and Anirudh Rastogi, in their chapter on big data, note that the expert committee constituted to design the Data Protection Bill in India placed considerable regulator focus on data-breach notifications. If this provision existed and was enforced, the response to the WhatsApp hack targeting journalists and activists in India would have had lesser ambiguity (Bhattacharji 2019).<br/><br/>Susan Ostermann observes that the judicial strategy of imposing bans is a blunt and intentional response to perceived weak state capacity. The recent ban on stubble burning to counter severe air pollution in Delhi and northern India by the Supreme Court reflects this (Ellis-Petersen 2019). However, as Ostermann points out, this reactionary response in extant circumstances does little to build state capacity. Pollution continues to recur every year despite previous bans on diesel vehicles and firecrackers, and stubble burning continues to happen because of the inability of the state to provide alternatives to farmers.<br/><br/>Kapur and Khosla undertake this study by adopting expert opinion as a research method. With a structure in mind, they have carefully selected experts, academicians, and practitioners who have the competence to comment on key substantive areas of regulations. This method has allowed the editors to take a broader look at the topic from different angles, and to use the heuristic knowledge of experts in order to understand the challenges, promises, and limitations of regulations in India. As editors of this book, they bring together 22 experts to write 16 chapters to cover topics ranging from the foundations of the Indian regulatory state to the form of regulation across different sectors to regulation in practice. The book includes contributions from luminaries such as retired Justice B N Srikrishna, Ajay Shah, and Vikramaditya Khanna, among others.<br/><br/>Capturing a vast and constantly evolving topic like regulation is a challenging task. Kapur and Khosla have achieved this by identifying the key topics and laying the foundation to enable comparison. However, it would be interesting to know more about regulations in social sectors like education, health, media, film censorship, and broadcasting. While judging the performance of regulations, a data-backed discussion on the cost of regulating, cost of complying with regulations, and the cost of misregulation or failing to regulate will also be interesting. This book also makes one curious about the future of regulation in India and the direction in which it would evolve.<br/><br/>Overall, this book provides an excellent overview and analysis of the state of regulations in India, as it is today. The series of chapters by the contributing authors are very informative and rich with examples taken from their domain. It is a must-read for anyone wishing to get a holistic understanding of the topic.<br/><br/>References<br/><br/>Bhattacharji, S (2019): \"WhatsApp Hacks: Lessons to be Learnt on Digital Snooping,\" Business Line, 5 November, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/whatsapp-hacks-lessons-to-b\">https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/whatsapp-hacks-lessons-to-b</url>....<br/><br/>Chandrashekhar, C (2011): \"Rethinking Regulation: International Banks in Asian Emerging Markets,\" PSL Quarterly Review, Vol 64, No 258, pp 24966.<br/><br/>Chandrashekhar, C and J Ghosh (2002): The Market that Failed: A Decade of Neoliberal Economic Reforms in India, New Delhi: LeftWord Books.<br/><br/>Ellis-Petersen, H (2019): \"Delhi Pollution: Farm Fires Set to Continue Despite Court Ruling,\" Guardian, 5 November,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/india-top-court-orders-hal\">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/india-top-court-orders-hal</url>....<br/><br/>Rebello, J and G Nayak (2019): \"The Collapse of PMC Exposes the Fault Lines in the Financial System,\" Economic Times, 2 October,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/th...s\">https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/th...s</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EPWKLY-0053193983</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EPWKLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YWF-PBS1-JB5M-W4J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365197</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2205\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Economic &amp;

Politicians simply lack the technical sophistication necessary to provide oversight to any self-imposed remedy the online giant may offer.</p><p>\u201cThey need to be broken up,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you have to sell the old DoubleClick unit, and I realize that\u2019s untangling some spaghetti, and I think you have to spin [off] YouTube. \u2026 I just think their engineers are smarter than our regulators.\u201d</p><p>Professor Scott Galloway was speaking at Adweek\u2019s NexTech 2020 Virtual Summit.

Mounds of personal data are flowing to political consultants attempting to influence your vote, government agencies trying to find lawbreakers and scammers trying to trick you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the way most people feel the results day to day is through marketing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Christopher Day knows better than most how intrusive technology can be.</p><p>He's the founder of an Indianapolis tech company, DemandJump, that uses artificial intelligence to help companies identify customers and send them the right messages to procure sales.</p><p>But Day has also been a victim of what he calls annoying and even creepy cyber-marketing--strategies that are different from those employed by DemandJump.</p><p>Late last year, Day was thinking about buying a Peloton, a popular indoor exercise bike. He had never searched for nor discussed Peloton online or in emails. He had never contacted the manufacturer or a retailer about the product.</p><p>But with his smartphone in his pocket, Day discussed the bike with friends at a holiday party. And he believes his phone--either through the operating system or an app he installed--was listening.</p><p>Suddenly, he began receiving digital ads for Peloton across his devices.</p><p>\"That feels too invasive,\" Day said. \"That made me not want to buy the product. And I didn't.\"</p><p>But despite the marketing fail with Day, many advertisers are relying on these and other cyber tactics to get their products in front of customers--repeatedly.</p><p>Everything you do with your electronic devices is monitored, tracked, reported and stored. And all that information is saved indefinitely, ready to be rolled out at a moment's notice to help a company make a sale.</p><p>While consumers can take some steps to stem the peeping, it's tough to stop the data gathering completely without going off the grid--a difficult move given that the tools that make life convenient today are the very ones marketers exploit.</p><p>Cookie monster</p><p>Companies build profiles about customers and track them in a number of ways. But the most important ingredient might be cookies--and not the edible kind.</p><p>Cookies are bits of programming that operate in the background of a website, app or device.</p><p>The name is derived from the term \"magic cookie,\" which is what programmers in the late 1970s called a packet of data a program picks up from a user's computer and sends elsewhere for identification purposes. Cookies grab what's called an IP address, an identifying number assigned to every device on an internet-connected network. But cookies don't necessarily know the user or owner of that device (although, as you'll see, those dots aren't difficult to connect).</p><p>Cookies have some important, practical functions. For example, they let web servers know whether someone is logged into a site, and which account they are logged in with. IBJ uses cookies, for example, to help determine whether a reader on its website is a subscriber.</p><p>But programmers have discovered even more valuable marketing uses for cookies. Ever wonder how you can leave an online store--or close your browser or turn off your computer entirely--and come back a few minutes, hours or even days later to find the contents in your shopping cart still there? Or how an airline knows about a reservation you started but didn't complete?</p><p>That's information the web browser deposited on your computer with a cookie. When you go back to the site, the computer reads the cookie and distills the information from your previous visits.</p><p>And that's just the first crumb of what cookies can track. They can tell a site what pages you looked at and for how long, what items you clicked on and even where you put your cursor. Some can even track--through your webcam--where you trained your eyes.</p><p>But not every cookie is created--or accessed--equally.</p><p>Cookies deposited on your computer by a website operator are called first-party cookies. Generally, first-party cookies can be read--in their entirety--only by the website that deposited them.</p><p>Website developers say those kinds of cookies help them customize content to suit you. Think ESPN.com, which uses cookies to track your browsing, reading and viewing, then recommends other stories.</p><p>Third-party cookies are another story entirely. They are deposited by ads, online quizzes, games and other content users download or visit. So if you click on, say, a Nike ad and then go to the Nike website, the site will retrieve that cookie to get a better idea of who you are and how you like to shop.</p><p>Tracking your every move</p><p>But why, after you search for a product or click on an ad, do ads for those and related products begin popping up--no matter where you surf?</p><p>Enter data brokers and trackers--a vast and growing network of companies that are not only depositing cookies but also selling that information to a wide range of retailers, service providers and websites. A national or global company might subscribe to a dozen or more data brokers and others services to track current and potential customers.</p><p>Say you go to a car dealer's website and then surf to a news site. If those two sites subscribe to the same ad network--or network of networks--then, voila, you'll see an ad for the very vehicle you were researching, even though the story you're reading has nothing to do with cars.</p><p>\"It's like you once stopped in a car dealership, but now you're at the grocery store and someone is chasing you around the grocery store yelling at you to see if you want to buy a car,\" said DemandJump's Day. \"In real life, internet marketing methods might be considered harassment.\"</p><p>DemandJump doesn't rely on cookies, Day said. It uses math and artificial intelligence to make sure companies have access to consumers in the \"buying mode\" of their product. It's a complicated business that relies on programing to recognize the precise wording of search queries.</p><p>But thousands of companies use cookies, and so, as you travel from website to website, you are taking on cookies like a well-traveled ship takes on barnacles.</p><p>\"Your IP address is being collected by every single network you pass through, and that includes services like Netflix,\" said Warren Sifre, principal consultant for Moser Consulting, an Indianapolis-based information technology company that specializes in business intelligence and advanced analytics.</p><p>Free software and apps are huge data-gathering tools.</p><p>\"There is a reason why things are free,\" Sifre said. \"It wouldn't make much business sense to develop an application that had zero return on investment, whether it be directly or indirectly.\"</p><p>The combination of millions of cookies and huge data brokerages means retailers and other companies can divine within a second of your landing on their website where else you've been on the internet and everything you've clicked on, read, viewed or listened to--sometimes for years, even a decade or more.</p><p>\"People don't appreciate the permanence of this data,\" said Brian McGinnis, a partner in the local law office of Barnes and Thornburg and a cybersecurity expert. \"There's a reason why some companies are building massive data centers. The internet doesn't forget.\"</p><p>Getting personal</p><p>Combine cookies with personal data--your name, birthdate, hometown and more--and the outcomes become very personal.</p><p>Among the ingredients is Facebook--and its forerunner, MySpace.</p><p>When the first major social network, MySpace, came along in 2003, it seemed like a great way for people to stay connected to family and friends. But marketers--and social media sites themselves--quickly realized the value of the information it was gathering. Then came Facebook, with its worldwide reach, which took personalized marketing to a new level.</p><p>Social networks have induced people to voluntarily cough up the information marketers have long coveted: name, residence, age, occupation, nationality, dating status, hobbies, vacation destinations, you name it. And all that information can be easily attached to the IP address of your laptop, tablet or, increasingly, your smartphone.</p><p>And Facebook has made a tidy bundle of cash selling that data. Though the company won't disclose the amount, multiple tech sources estimate the world's biggest social media network makes $10 billion annually selling data.</p><p>Through your device's IP address, data brokers, trackers and ad networks can not only know all about you, but also where your device is at any given time--almost down to the square foot. More on that later.</p><p>But this treasure trove of data doesn't all come from Facebook.</p><p>There is another cadre of companies whose sole mission is to scrape every imaginable piece of your personal information--even some you might not imagine--from online public records and sell it to the highest bidder.</p><p>These trackers collect property records, court filings, driver's license and motor vehicle records, census data, birth certificates, marriage licenses, divorce records, state professional and recreational license records, voter registration information, bankruptcy records, and on and on.</p><p>They also collect or buy information from commercial sources, snatching up people's purchasing histories, including the dates, dollar amounts, payments used, loyalty cards and coupons used, as well as warranty registration information from retailers and catalog companies.</p><p>And, of course, they also exchange or purchase information from one another, then merge the data. Most data brokers have profiles on millions of people, each with thousands of characteristics.</p><p>\"Some would say those companies know you better than you know yourself,\" McGinnis said. \"And with predictive analytics becoming increasingly sophisticated, they're getting much better at predicting your next move.\"</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission took a hard look at the shadowy world of data brokers seven years ago and released a 110-page report in May 2014. But it stopped short of instituting any sweeping regulations--or even requiring data brokers to reveal what they are collecting about whom and with whom they share it.</p><p>It is possible for consumers to opt out of some data collection on some sites, but the process is time-consuming, difficult and needs to be regularly repeated because data brokers keep collecting more. Some brokers pull data from other sites and update automatically. And some data brokers don't remove information even when asked.</p><p>People still struggle to understand the nature and scope of the data collected about them. In a recent Pew Research Center study, half of all respondents said they don't know why their data is being gathered and 9% said there's nothing they can do to control it.</p><p>\"Most have no idea who these companies are and how they got their data on them, and they would be very surprised to know the intimate details that these companies have collected on people,\" said Amul Kalia, an analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a global digital rights group based in San Francisco.</p><p>The big four</p><p>The biggest data gatherers in the game--Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google--are not in the shadows at all.</p><p>The reach of those four behemoths is dizzying. And to expand their reach, the companies have made a multitude of acquisitions.</p><p>Collectively, they own websites, operating systems, devices, cloud storage systems and more that gather truckloads of data abcat you every day.</p><p>Google has made more than one acquisition a month for the last decade. In 2014 alone, it purchased a staggering 34 companies. Its acquisitions include You-Tube and DoubleClick, companies that expand its reach far beyond its ubiquitous search engine.</p><p>Google likely knows everything you've ever searched for on the internet, all the apps you use or have ever used, the You-Tube videos you've watched dating back to 2008, many of the events you attended and when, every image you've ever searched for and saved, every location you've ever searched and clicked on, and every news article you've searched for and read. It also has a five-year history of the photos many people have taken with their cell phones.</p><p>And all that information is being constantly monitored, stored and backed up in massive data centers.</p><p>It's not clear how all the data is used--even among data collectors and buyers. Some in the tech sector say the companies collecting the data don't yet have a use for all the information, but are saving it in perpetuity assuming that technological advances such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive analytics will someday give even the tiniest piece of information value.</p><p>The data Google has on most individuals can fill millions of virtual dump trucks. A data collection file on a single person can easily be 5.5 gigabytes, which is 3 million Word documents.</p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, collects data on and stores your login location, time and the device used; data on where you are and where you've been; what apps you've installed (plus when you use them and what for); all the devices you've ever used to log in to your account,; all the apps you've ever connected to your Facebook account; and every (audio and digital) message, file, emoji and sticker you've sent or been sent.</p><p>Facebook also collects and stores all the contacts in your phone, what it thinks you are interested in based on the things you have liked and--maybe most eerie--what you and your friends talk about.</p><p>The social network monitors and stores information on the games you play; your photos and videos, music, search and browsing history; radio listening habits; and your emails, call history and files you download.</p><p>The company also can access your webcam and microphone.</p><p>Facebook data on a single person who uses a computer and social media a moderate amount can exceed 600 megabytes, which is 400,000 Word documents.</p><p>Many marketing tech companies--a number of which are in Indianapolis--sit on the shoulders of the Facebooks of the world, said Mark Clerkin, vice president of data science for local venture studio High Alpha.</p><p>With the vast tech empires controlled by Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, chances are that, most of your waking hours, you're using a device, operating system or website owned or operated--in part or in whole--by one of them.</p><p>\"If you are using a computer or the web, it's difficult to get beyond their reach,\" McGinnis said.</p><p>Listening in</p><p>Apple's 2010 acquisition of Siri Inc. took data gathering to a new level, one that has been elevated by a proliferation of smart speakers and televisions that are always listening.</p><p>Introduced in 2011, Siri was touted as an efficient and fun way to search for information. Siri (which has been incorporated into iPhones, iPads and other Apple devices) is a keen listener--even when it's not being addressed. The same is true for Amazon Echo and Google Home.</p><p>\"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the makers of those devices say, and what those devices actually do,\" McGinnis said. \"The makers of the devices say they don't track the information.\"</p><p>DemandJump's Day isn't buying it. \"How else are they reaching out to you when you are not searching online for something?\" he said.</p><p>He's not alone in his skepticism.</p><p>\"I'm 100% convinced companies are listening to people through devices, including smart speakers and phones,\" said Chris Rodgers, a search engine optimization expert based in Denver.</p><p>\"It's becoming increasingly common that companies are taking audio and translating that into data and storing it,\" said Rodgers, founder and CEO of Colorado SEO Pros. In addition to programming on the devices themselves, he said, many apps can trigger your gadget's listening device.</p><p>\"Most of this information is in the privacy policy people agree to,\" Rodgers said. \"But do most people read those agreements? No.\"</p><p>There's good reason companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook would want to listen. According to Virginia-based media research firm Corn-score Inc., 50% of all searches will be done by voice by the end of this year.</p><p>\"The technology is certainly there to allow detailed listening-in,\" McGinnis said. \"This is not science fiction.\"</p><p>In fact, it would take only seconds, he said, for a smart-speaker maker to pull up audio from a specific hour--even minute--and replay the discussions and other sounds that occurred in your home or office or wherever you have a speaker.</p><p>Devices are even talking to one another. TV programmers and advertisers have been quick to enter audio code designed to reach out and message your smart speaker and phone, so they can send you messages or influence searches on your phone or speaker later.</p><p>It's not difficult for a company like Apple, Google or a data broker to figure out which devices are owned by the same person. So when you search for a product with your speaker, you could easily get ads for that or a like product the next time you surf the web on your laptop, tablet or phone.</p><p>Location technology</p><p>Thanks to global positioning systems--or GPS--and other increasingly sophisticated location technology, big tech companies already know where you are at almost any given time--and with surprising precision. Signals are sent back and forth between one of 27 satellites orbiting the Earth 12,000 miles away and the devices you carry.</p><p>Now, technology is in development that is expected to use 3-D models to hone in on where you are within a building.</p><p>Google and other companies, tech experts said, will have the capability within a year to know when you're sitting in bed watching TV. And 5G, with its antennas everywhere, will supercharge the power.</p><p>Although GPS data can be and is used to locate you in an emergency, location data is also a valuable commodity. It tells marketers if you are in their area. It also lets them know what you might be doing and what you might be in the mode to buy.</p><p>According to a report published by India-based research firm Marketsand-Markets, the location analytics market is estimated to grow from $8.2 billion in 2016 to $16.3 billion by 2021. And keep growing.</p><p>Companies like Google and Apple have their own location systems, using information from satellites, cell towers, wireless data points, and even weather and barometric pressure. Users can turn off their location devices by app or through a master control on their phone or device. But even then, Apple, Google and Facebook can gather location data. That's spelled out in the phone's privacy policy--which most people never read.</p><p>Researchers at Princeton recently discovered a way to track a smartphone's location--using time zones, air pressure readers and public information from maps--even when all the apps and the master location function are turned off and the phone is disconnected from WiFi.</p><p>Lawmakers in parts of Europe and California recently have passed regulations to try to rein in data collectors by adding a level of transparency, requiring companies to disclose how data is collected and how it's shared.</p><p>One result is that people often get a message asking them to allow a website to use cookies. Most quickly click \"yes.\" If they chose \"no,\" they often lose some functionality of the site.</p><p>But those laws are a long way from becoming widespread. And it's unclear how data collection will be policed globally.</p><p>\"It's not easy to understand how a lot of this works, even for some in the tech sector, and that leads to some of the worries with data collection,\" said Peter Lazarz, vice president of marketing for SupplyKick, an Indianapolis-based firm that helps companies set up shop, sell their goods and maintain their inventories on Amazon.</p><p>Still, McGinnis said it's important for consumers to have a basic understanding of data collection and to do what they can to control it.</p><p>\"People need to think about the technology they use and how they use it, and try to understand how it can be used to collect personal data--and what kind--and weigh the positives and negatives of that before just charging in,\" he said.</p><p>McGinnis does not use a smart speaker and uses web browsers such as Firefox and search engines such as Duck-DuckGo--neither of which collect the reams of data other providers do. He also steers clear of Google whenever possible and closely checks the settings on his electronic devices to limit data collection.</p><p>\"The legal aspects and regulations are beginning to catch up with this technology, but people shouldn't wait,\" he said. \"This is not completely out of the sphere of consumers' control.\"</p><p>By Anthony Schoettle <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:aschoettle@ibj.com\">aschoettle@ibj.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INBUJO-616456744</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 616456744</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCC-8731-JCBJ-K0G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433198</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3438\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Indianapolis Business Journal Corp.

But Facebook has avoided that trap deftly, by moving faster than its competitors to mollify conservatives.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020070458315421</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:608R-5X91-JBTY-W1TW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"677\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 4, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A plusieurs \u00e9gards. Jamais les quatre PDG des GAFA - l'acronyme d\u00e9signant Google, Amazon, Facebook et Apple - n'avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unis en m\u00eame temps pour \u00eatre interrog\u00e9s par des \u00e9lus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jamais non plus Jeff Bezos, le fondateur d'Amazon, n'avait fait face \u00e0 des parlementaires, comme les quinze membres du sous-comit\u00e9 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab\u00a0concurrence\u00a0\u00bb</emphasis> de la commission des affaires judiciaires de la Chambre des repr\u00e9sentants am\u00e9ricaine, organisatrice de cette audition, mercredi 29\u00a0juillet. Le format de l'\u00e9change est aussi original\u00a0: il est organis\u00e9 en visioconf\u00e9rence, pand\u00e9mie de Covid-19 oblige.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">L'audition de Sundar Pichai (Google), Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) et Tim Cook (Apple) doit permettre d'obtenir des d\u00e9positions pr\u00e9cises sur de possibles abus de position dominante de leur entreprise sur les march\u00e9s num\u00e9riques, sujet de l'enqu\u00eate parlementaire ouverte par le sous-comit\u00e9 en juin\u00a02019. Mais la session pourrait aussi \u00eatre l'occasion pour certains \u00e9lus de chercher avant tout \u00e0 afficher devant les m\u00e9dias leur hostilit\u00e9 envers le secteur de la Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Le th\u00e8me de l'audition est le respect de la concurrence ou <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab\u00a0antitrust\u00a0\u00bb</emphasis>. Mais les d\u00e9bats pourraient aussi toucher la mod\u00e9ration des r\u00e9seaux sociaux, enjeu pour la pr\u00e9sidentielle am\u00e9ricaine de novembre.</p><h>\u00ab\u00a0Trop de pouvoir\u00a0\u00bb</h><p>Apr\u00e8s l'audition, le sous-comit\u00e9 rendra un rapport et pourrait r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 des lois pour r\u00e9guler certaines activit\u00e9s de ces groupes ultrapuissants, ou limiter leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 racheter des entreprises. M\u00eame sans aller jusque-l\u00e0, l'audition pourrait influencer les enqu\u00eates antitrust ouvertes en parall\u00e8le, au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, par le d\u00e9partement de la justice contre Google et par le r\u00e9gulateur du commerce FTC contre Facebook, Amazon et Apple, mais aussi au niveau local, par les procureurs des Etats am\u00e9ricains contre Google et Facebook. Les GAFA sont en effet tous dans le viseur, pour des motifs diff\u00e9rents.</p><p>David Cicilline, l'\u00e9lu d\u00e9mocrate qui pr\u00e9side cette audition exceptionnelle, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 mercredi que les quatre g\u00e9ants am\u00e9ricains avaient <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab\u00a0trop de pouvoir\u00a0\u00bb</emphasis>. Egrenant des chiffres faramineux d\u00e9montrant la puissance de ces g\u00e9ants, M.\u00a0Cicilline a soulign\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'enqu\u00eater sur leurs pratiques aujourd'hui plus que jamais, parce qu'<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab\u00a0elles devraient \u00e9merger du Covid-19 encore plus fortes et puissantes qu'avant\u00a0\u00bb</emphasis>.</p><p>Facebook, roi des r\u00e9seaux sociaux</p><p>Fondateur de Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg a d\u00e9j\u00e0 connu ce type d'audition, notamment en mai\u00a02018, lors du scandale Cambridge Analytica, le prestataire de la campagne de Donald Trump qui a eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des millions de profils Facebook.</p><p>Les griefs contre l'entreprise sont nombreux. Du point de vue antitrust, Facebook se voit reprocher sa strat\u00e9gie de rapprochement avec ses filiales WhatsApp et Instagram, rachet\u00e9es en\u00a02014 et 2012. L'entreprise pourrait donc se voir imposer de s\u00e9parer davantage ses actifs ou de garantir le droit de migrer vers des services rivaux. En r\u00e9ponse, Facebook se d\u00e9fend d'\u00eatre un monopole et assure avoir des concurrents, notamment le Chinois TikTok. M.\u00a0Zuckerberg brandit d'ailleurs souvent la menace des g\u00e9ants num\u00e9riques de la Chine autoritaire.</p><p>Aux Etats-Unis, Facebook est aussi accus\u00e9 par les d\u00e9mocrates et des associations antiracistes de faire le jeu de Donald Trump\u00a0: le r\u00e9seau a refus\u00e9 de mod\u00e9rer comme Twitter les contenus publi\u00e9s par le pr\u00e9sident am\u00e9ricain et est jug\u00e9 trop permissif envers les discours de haine. Facebook a fait un peu \u00e9voluer sa politique, mais, de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, les r\u00e9publicains et M.\u00a0Trump l'accusent d'\u00eatre d\u00e9favorable aux voix conservatrices et menacent de changer la responsabilit\u00e9 juridique des r\u00e9seaux sociaux.</p><p>Google, central dans la recherche et la publicit\u00e9 en ligne</p><p>Sundar Pichai - devenu PDG de Google en\u00a02015, puis de sa maison m\u00e8re Alphabet - doit aussi souvent r\u00e9pondre aux soup\u00e7ons des conservateurs am\u00e9ricains, qui s'estiment d\u00e9savantag\u00e9s sur sa plate-forme de vid\u00e9o YouTube.</p><p>Mais Washington reproche surtout au groupe sa domination sur certains march\u00e9s. Google est soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 d'utiliser son moteur de recherche ou l'environnement mobile Android pour favoriser ses services, comme le comparateur Google Shopping ou le navigateur Chrome. </p><p>Dans la publicit\u00e9 en ligne, Google est montr\u00e9 du doigt car il agit \u00e0 tous les niveaux\u00a0: pour son propre compte, sur ses plates-formes comme sur son moteur de recherche, mais aussi pour le compte de tiers, par le biais d'interm\u00e9diaires techniques, comme sa r\u00e9gie DoubleClick. Faudrait-il l'obliger \u00e0 s\u00e9parer certains actifs\u00a0? Voter une loi sur les donn\u00e9es aux Etats-Unis\u00a0? Les \u00e9lus s'interrogent, bien que Google assure subir une vive concurrence.</p><p>L'entreprise pourrait \u00eatre le premier des GAFA \u00e0 faire l'objet de poursuites antitrust\u00a0: l'enqu\u00eate lanc\u00e9e par William Barr, le directeur du d\u00e9partement de la justice nomm\u00e9 par M.\u00a0Trump et tr\u00e8s critique envers la Big Tech, avance vite, selon un article du New York Times de fin juin.</p><p>Amazon, \u00e0 la fois plate-forme de vente et vendeur</p><p>Jeff Bezos, le fondateur d'Amazon, a \u00e9t\u00e9 somm\u00e9 de t\u00e9moigner en personne devant le sous-comit\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite d'un article paru dans le Wall Street Journal, fin avril\u00a0: selon le quotidien, des employ\u00e9s de la plate-forme d'e-commerce ont utilis\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es sur les ventes de certains commer\u00e7ants pour lancer des produits concurrents sous des marques d'Amazon. Or, un repr\u00e9sentant de l'entreprise avait assur\u00e9 au sous-comit\u00e9, en\u00a02019, que les donn\u00e9es des vendeurs n'\u00e9taient jamais exploit\u00e9es...</p><p>Depuis, Amazon a assur\u00e9 avoir lanc\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate interne, mais son double r\u00f4le de plate-forme de vente et de vendeur reste au coeur des interrogations des \u00e9lus\u00a0: faudrait-il l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer pour \u00e9viter qu'une activit\u00e9 favorise l'autre\u00a0?</p><p>Politiquement, les relations sont tendues entre Donald Trump et Amazon, accus\u00e9 de menacer le petit commerce ou de ne pas assez payer d'imp\u00f4ts. L'entreprise assure que Jeff Bezos est dans le collimateur parce qu'il poss\u00e8de le quotidien The Washington Post. Et Amazon n'a pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9noncer une <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab\u00a0vendetta personnelle\u00a0\u00bb</emphasis> de M. Trump, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9 du contrat JEDI d'h\u00e9bergement de donn\u00e9es du d\u00e9partement de la d\u00e9fense.</p><p>Pendant le confinement, Amazon s'est d\u00e9peint en service vital pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, mais la hausse de son cours de Bourse a renforc\u00e9 l'image d'homme le plus riche du monde de M.\u00a0Bezos.</p><p>Apple, gardien de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me iPhone</p><p>Pour Tim Cook, PDG d'Apple depuis 2011, les griefs antitrust se concentrent sur l'App Store et iOS, le magasin d'applications et le syst\u00e8me d'exploitation qui \u00e9quipent les iPhone. Apple est soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 de favoriser ses services, comme Apple Music ou Safari. Mais aussi de forcer les \u00e9diteurs d'applications, comme Spotify ou Netflix, \u00e0 utiliser son syst\u00e8me de paiement et \u00e0 payer des commissions \u00e9lev\u00e9es. En r\u00e9ponse, Apple assure avoir beaucoup investi pour cr\u00e9er sur l'iPhone un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me d'applications dynamique et en tr\u00e8s grande majorit\u00e9 gratuit.</p><p>Tim Cook s'est employ\u00e9 \u00e0 maintenir de bonnes relations avec Donald Trump, le laissant par exemple se f\u00e9liciter qu'Apple investisse dans des usines aux Etats-Unis.

In September, United Nations Special Rapporteur Leilani Farha released a report calling the crisis a \"human rights violation[2].\" Business Insider spoke with Farha about the root causes of homelessness \u2014 and what she sees as the most viable solutions. Farha doubled down on her previous comments, arguing that San Francisco's homelessness crisis suggests a \"cruelty that is unsurpassed.\"When Leilani Farha paid a visit to San Francisco in January, she knew the grim reputation of the city'shomeless encampments. In her four years as the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Adequate Housing, Farha has visited the slums of Mumbai, Delhi, Mexico City, Jarkarta, and Manila. The crisis in San Francisco, she said, is comparable to these conditions. </p><p> While New York City and Los Angeles have the highest numbers of homeless people in the US, San Francisco has the highest rate of street homelessness nationwide. On any given night, more than 4,300 citizens sleep[3]without a roof over their heads. But not even this knowledge could prepare Farha for what she witnessed in January. In the city's core, homeless residents were denied basic access to water, toilets, and sanitation facilities. There were piles of trash and scattered feces on the ground. In theneighboring camps in Oakland[4], rats dug through the mud and families huddled outside in the cold. The experience, she said, shook her to her core. \"The idea that a government would deny people those services ... when they have nowhere else to go suggests a kind of cruelty that is unsurpassed,\" Farha told Business Insider. \"It's an attempt to erase people. Worse than erase \u2014 I can only use the word annihilate. It is a denial of someone's humanity.\" The visit led toa report[5] in which she described San Francisco's crisis as a human rights violation[6]. The language may sound grave \u2014 but so is the crisis.San Francisco's homeless are often victims of hard timesAt one point on her trip, Farha encountered a young man living underneath a highway underpass, cooking quesadillas on a small stove with an open flame. Read more: UN report: San Francisco's 'cruel and inhuman' homelessness crisis is a human rights violation[7] \"The last time I had seen someone cooking on the sidewalk like that was in India, with the pavement dwellers there, and here I am in San Francisco in a state with the sixth largest GDP[8] in the world,\" said Farha. She asked the man about how he came to be homeless, and found that he had traveled from the Midwest after his mother died and his family broke down. \"I think he was in the midst of developing a psychosocial disability from the trauma of being on the streets,\" she said.While many homeless residents in California are native to the area, the man's story is relatively common. Farha said most of the homeless residents she met in San Francisco were victims of hard times. \"They were working and then their apartment building got sold to someone, the investor raised the rents, the person couldn't afford it anymore, they couch surfed for a while, and then they hit the street,\" she said. Her comments echo the understanding amonghomeless residents[9] and advocacy organizations like the National Coalition for the Homeless, which attributes homelessness[10] to \"a complex set of circumstances that require people to choose between food, shelter, and other basic needs.\"A crisis of open air drug markets, discarded needles, and poop pilesSan Francisco's crisis of open air drug markets[11], discarded needles, and piles of poop[12] on the sidewalk dates back to the nation's neo-liberal housing policies in the 1980s, according to Farha. These policies allowed the private sector to wrest control of investments[13]in the affordable housing market, while the government slowly retreated. In 1986, President Reagansigned a housing tax credit[14] that gave big corporations more oversight over low-income housing.By the 2000s, companies were selling off social housing \u2014 dubbed \"housing of last resort\" \u2014 for major profits. \"It's very hard for a city to compete against a private equity firm in terms of buying up land,\" Farha said. \"Private equity firms have such a huge amount of capital at their disposal. They call them vultures for a reason. They can go in and use their power and wealth and buy up a huge amount of property very quickly.\" After the global financial crisis in 2008, firms like Blackstone and Goldman Sachs beganpurchasing single-family dwellings and charging high rents, rendering them unaffordable for most residents. These properties were then bundled together so that shareholders effectively became landlords. In the current market,investors in cities across the country frequently buy units and flip them into short-term rentals on services like HomeAway and Airbnb. All the while, the world's wealthy billionaires are scooping up luxury apartments, creating a demand for high-end real estate. To make sense of the San Francisco crisis, Farha has had to sift through this winding history. \"I've had to get my head around all this stuff just to understand homelessness,\" she said.Resident blame tech companies like Google, Apple, and FacebookMany residentshave been quick to blame San Francisco's housing crisis on major tech companies like Google, Intel, Apple, Facebook, and Twitter. As early as 2013, San Franciscans took to protesting the private buses[15] that shuttle Google workers from their homes in the city to the company's Silicon Valley headquarters. The protestors have even come up with a name for the massive influx of high-tech firms: \"techsploitation.[16]\" In May, protestors in the Mission District \u2014 home to a number of the city's homeless residents \u2014 stood outside chanting the phrase, \"Sweep tech not tents.\"Though Farha acknowledges the stark contrast between the city's multi-billion-dollar tech firms and residents sleeping on the streets, she doesn't think techies are exclusively to blame[17]. \"I absolutely do not want to only point the finger at the big tech firms,\" she said. \"I think they actually come to the table late on this.\" Even so, she said, companies with massive amounts of wealth have a responsibility to share it.  In early November, Farha praised Salesforce chairman Marc Benioff'sdecision to support Proposition C, a controversial ballot measure[18]in San Francisco that will tax the city's largest corporations to fund services for the homeless. The measure passed on Tuesday, but was just shy of a two-thirds majority[19], meaning it could be stalled by legal proceedings for years to come. InaNew York Times editorial[20], Benioff said homelessness was an even bigger threat to his business than a \"small tax\" because \"companies can truly thrive only when our communities succeed as well.\"Housing is a human rightAt least one key player in California has taken note of Farha's concerns.After releasing her report in September, Farha received a call from Oakland MayorLibby Schaaf, who wanted to start a dialogue about addressing the Bay Area homelessness crisis. Despite the complicated nature of the issue, Farha isn't short on solutions. But first, she said, people have to understand that housing isn't a commodity \u2014 it's a human right. \"No international human rights treaty codifies the right to gold, but several codify the right to housing,\" said Farha. \"That's because housing goes to the core of what it means to live in dignity. You can't live in dignity without decent housing.\"Underinternational human rights law[21], governments are required[22] \"to apply the maximum of available resources to upgrading informal settlements\" like slums, shanty towns, and homeless encampments. For Farha, these resources include taxes like Proposition C [23]that go towardidentifying and addressing the root causes of homelessness. It also means getting rid of forced evictions from homeless camps, adopting inclusionary zoning laws[24], and offering skills training programs for homeless residents. In the past, Farha hasalsocriticized laws[25]that prohibit the homeless fromliving out of their vehicles[26]. \"It's not to say that we want to bring down capitalism,\" Farha said. Instead, she said, the human rights obligation lies with the government, which is responsible for regulating private actors.One of her dreams as Special Rapporteur is to get people to understand the role of government in homelessness. If a person is walking along the street and sees someone homeless, it's okay to think whatever you want, she said. \"But also think, 'That homeless person represents my government's failure to implement the right to adequate housing.'\"NOW WATCH: What if the most powerful nuclear bomb exploded in space[27]See Also: The 11 most dangerous volcanoes in California, ranked[28]A UN expert said San Francisco's homelessness crisis is a human rights violation.

David Cicilline (D-R.I.), ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, grilled Amazon in particular for suppressing competition by allegedly ripping off its own third-party sellers to promote Amazon-branded products. He called the e-commerce market \"unfair and unbalanced.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think we see a tremendous amount concentration of market power that is resulting in less choice and worse quality of products for working people,\" Cicilline said, addressing Amazon's Associate General Counsel on Competition, Nate Sutton. \"Retailers and manufacturers of consumer goods are relying on Amazon. Doesn't that create a conflict of interest?\"</p><p>Sutton replied that Amazon \"has been very proud\" to help its third-party sellers \"grow,\" but that didn't satisfy Cicilline.</p><p>\"You say you do not use seller data to compete with other sellers online,\" Cicilline said. \"You do collect enormous data about what's selling, where they're selling. You're saying you do not use that data in any way to promote Amazon products? And I'll remind you you're under oath.\"</p><p>\"We do not use individual seller data to directly compete with them,\" Sutton said. \"We use data to serve our customers.\"</p><p>Cicilline then described the many stories of Amazon's third-party sellers who say Amazon often creates replicas of their products in order to drive shoppers to the Amazon knockoff instead of the original brand. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), also described a constituent of hers that pays a living wage and sells products online but was \"concerned\" that Amazon duplicates products to drive shoppers away from third-party sellers.</p><p>\"Do you use consumer data to favor amazon products?\" Cicilline asked. \"Analysts estimate that between 80-90 percent of sales go to the Amazon buy box. You're not using that in anyway to change the algorithm support the sale of Amazon-branded products? The best purchase to you is an Amazon product.\"</p><p>\"No sir, that's not true,\" Sutton replied. \"If we did that, they'd go elsewhere, they have many options,\" he added, which he later clarified include Walmart, eBay, and Target, which recently launched an online marketplace for e-sellers.</p><p>Several lines of questioning focused on Big Tech's acquisitions to solidify market power.</p><p>Matt Perault, head of global policy development at Facebook, said that Facebook does buy up its competitors to help Facebook \"innovate more effectively.\"</p><p>Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.) asked if any of the Big Four use venture capital to invest in tech start-ups, but most were unsure.</p><p>Google's Director of Economic Policy Adam Cohen said, \"We do acquire some small businesses to accelerate innovation. We've probably spawned ten times as many companies from former employees, like Twitter and Pinterest and Instagram.\"</p><p>Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) then pointed out that Facebook owns four of the six largest social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp).</p><p>\"So you can understand skepticism because when a company owns four of the largest six entities, measured by active users, in the world, in that industry, we have a word for that, and that's monopoly, or at least monopoly power,\" Neguse said.</p><p>The scrutiny comes as President Donald Trump, conservatives and presidential candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) accuse Big Tech of violating antitrust laws.</p><p>Last month, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission revealed plans to investigate Apple, Amazon and Google for antitrust violations.</p><p>At a Hoover Institution event in May, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and conservative economists and experts explored the ways Facebook and Google potentially violate antitrust laws, and discussed whether antitrust litigation is the right route for regulators to take in the digital age.</p><p>Economists are somewhat divided on the issue, but the economists called to testify at Tuesday's hearing were in agreement that there are antitrust concerns in the tech industry.</p><p>Tim Wu, a lawyer from Columbia University and one of the witnesses at the hearing, believes the Silicon Valley problem has evolved beyond antitrust concerns. He told members of the antitrust committee that \"startup rates have declined dramatically across the economy\" (citing a Brookings study), and \"the solution should be a broad effort to reboot the startup economy. That can be done not through one policy or passing any single law.\"</p><p>Part of the problem, he said, is \"high- tech industries\" are \"prone\" to consolidation.</p><p>Maureen Ohlhausen, a partner with Baker Botts law firm, warned the committee against moving too hastily on antitrust investigations, to avoid discouraging competition and innovation, which, as Cicilline said, Silicon Valley has spearheaded in the last decade.</p><p>\"Competition enforcers should not intervene simply because they dislike certain market outcomes,\" she said. \"Antitrust is about protecting the process, not guaranteeing a particular result at a particular time. Our free market system rests on the conclusion that markets in which firms must endure competitive pressures will produce favorable outcomes in terms of price, output, quality, and innovation in the long run. But if some competitors seem to be winning the race at a point in time, we should not use antitrust enforcement to hamper them or to require them to compete less aggressively, as long as they are not corrupting the competitive process.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

And welcome to News Stream where news and technology meet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now days ahead of the Winter Games in Sochi, we take a closer look at the threat posed by Russia's black widows.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now rescue efforts are continuing around Indonesia's Mount Sinabung after at least 15 people were killed by the erupting volcano.</p><p/><p>And on Facebook's 10th birthday, we'll look at what's next for the world's biggest social media site.</p><p/><p>Now athletes are streaming into Sochi as the city gets ready to kick off the Winter Games in just three days time.</p><p/><p>Now the Russian President Vladimir Putin is also there to attend several IOC events. Now he has staked his reputation on the games and is keen to see them go off without a hitch.</p><p/><p>But there are concerns that the city may not be quite ready with a rush to get some hotel rooms open for business and security concerns still loom large.</p><p/><p>Now militants from the volatile Northern Caucuses region have threatened the games. And our senior international correspondent Nick Paton Walsh has uncovered a disturbing new trend among the so-called Black Widows. He joins us now live from Sochi.</p><p/><p>And Nick, what are the security preparations in light of recent threats there?</p><p/><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, in fact in the last 20 minutes or so we saw a new level of security here, three helicopters circling the Olympic venue. Now that may be some sort of an indication that Vladimir Putin, who arrived in the last few hours is heading towards the sort of center of the ring of steel around these games.</p><p/><p>But at the heart of the threat we've been hearing are the suggestion that perhaps suicide bombers have focused their sights on Sochi and behind those women often is a new radicalized ideology.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>WALSH: Medina Alyeva (ph) wanted to die the way both of her husbands had: in jihad.</p><p/><p>\"This is jihad. It's the highest thing in the world,\" she said in this address before she died, \"who fulfilled promises better than Allah. So many men are just talk and spend their time in cinemas or playing video games.\"</p><p/><p>Medina (ph) blew herself up in May last year near the police headquarters in Dagestan with over a dozen injured, ending her embrace of radicalism.</p><p/><p>Both her husbands were killed by special forces in sieges like this, the first when she was just 21.</p><p/><p>This similar siege her second husband and several other militants were also shot dead. Here she is, filmed by police coming out of the house.</p><p/><p>Medina (ph), experts worry, is part of a new kind of so-called Black Widow female suicide bomber in Russia who don't, like in the past, decide to die out of grief and vengeance for a loved one.</p><p/><p>Instead, these women in the past few years married jihadis and seek martyrdom on their own, these women in the past few years married jihadis and seek martyrdom on their own as it seems fashionable.</p><p/><p>KATYA SOKIRIANSKAYA, INTERNATIONAL CRISIS GROUP: It is a trend also. They have their own slang. These young women, they oftentimes want to die because they want to die. I have seen these women after their husband had been just killed or there were funerals and they don't mourn them. They congratulate each other.</p><p/><p>WALSH: Medina's (ph) mother Patoum (ph) in her first interview with Medina's (ph) sister and orphan by her side says police had ordered her daughter to see a psychologist and three days before she died Medina (ph) vanished.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): She's probably in heaven. I saw her in my sleep. She was there with my grandparents. They were all together in beautiful white clothes smiling. She told me how great it was there.</p><p/><p>WALSH: Medina's (ph) son thinks mom is coming home.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): He's always picking up photos of her saying mother is coming soon.</p><p/><p>WALSH: But she isn't.</p><p/><p>And, with police putting up these wanted posters we saw across the region. It's clear they think Medina (ph) is not alone in seeking a nihilistic end to her life that takes many others with her.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>WALSH: Now Moscow has made it clear they believe the games will be safe. Barack Obama has said he thinks it'll be safe for Americans to come here, but still that threat, that security issue hangs over these games simply because of the fact they're at the western edge southern Russia, a region volatile for decades.</p><p/><p>[08:04:57]</p><p/><p>Today, another example Austrian press agency saying that there has been a letter received, which perhaps originated from Russia that threatens two Austrian athletes with kidnap if they come here.</p><p/><p>Now that has, in some reports, been suggested as being a hoax. Still few details available. But really these -- these letters, these indications are doing nothing to lower anxiety levels around here, although I have to say this is a calm area behind me, apart from these helicopters circling, a calm area behind me that seems to be getting ready for the games ahead -- Kristie.</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Yeah, yeah. And regards to that Austrian security threat, hoax or not, very worrying development. And in the face of all these threats, Nick, I mean just how prepared is Russia to truly secure and safeguard these games?</p><p/><p>WALSH: This has been a year's long operation for the Russians. They've been pressing on various militant hotspots across southern Russia for a long time, since they knew this was coming using all resources at their disposal, many of them heavy-handed -- blunt instruments.</p><p/><p>But the finer point has been the ring of steel they put around here, a lot of that high tech. There are two blimps, they're known as, security camera devices held up by hot air balloons, cameras everywhere, but above all 37,000 Russian police and security officers coming here to secure the games.</p><p/><p>That, in many ways, is the big card Moscow is playing, the sheer manpower resources they're throwing at this. But of course one problem with Russian police as many Russians know is their corruption, their ineptitude. So they could be holes for people to slip through. But I think most people believe the games themselves here, the area around them, will be secure. This will probably pass without incident. It's just that can't be said for all of southern Russia, particularly Dagestan of the far east of where I'm standing where, as I say, violence is a weekly occurrence as militants target police officers or those they consider loyal to the Russian federal government -- Kristie.</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Nick Paton Walsh reporting live from Sochi. Thank you, Nick.</p><p/><p>Now a number of hotels in Sochi are still putting the finishing touches on the rooms even as the guests arrive. Now CNN's Amanda Davies and her crew arrived at their accommodations only to find that their rooms were not ready.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: So with all the stories doing around about hotels in Sochi not being finished we now get to experience it firsthand. We've just landed from Moscow about an hour ago now. We arrived at our Hotel, the Amiga (inaudible) Hotel where lots of media representatives are staying. And we've been told our rooms aren't ready. The actual phrase that's been used is that we are waiting for our rooms to be ready.</p><p/><p>While we've been sitting here for the last hour or so, there's been representatives of other media who have been going up to the desk saying that their rooms haven't been clean for a week and the radiators aren't working, there's no lou paper.</p><p/><p>I had a wander around outside. There's still plants being put in place in some places. There's one building you can hear the banging and construction still going on.</p><p/><p>We might be being a little bit unfair, I have to say. We haven't seen any evidence, but equally we haven't seen any rooms yet. So, an hour and counting.</p><p/><p>OK, so we've been here just over an hour-and-a-half. We've got one room, which we went to see. And to be fair it was quite decent. It was very new, the carpet obviously had just been laid. There were a few cables and wires hanging out. But there's three of us in our crew and crews need to stick together. The other two rooms weren't going to be ready today.</p><p/><p>So we've checked in to another hotel down the road, which has been ready. A big chain hotel has been ready for awhile.</p><p/><p>And we're going to come back hopefully with better luck tomorrow.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: All right, good luck there.</p><p/><p>Now Amanda Davies' producer Harry Reiki (ph), he posted this photo on his Twitter account a little bit earlier. Now this is the one room that they were given as you can by the collapsed curtain railing it looks like there are still a few issues to be sorted out.</p><p/><p>Now the International Olympic Committee has urged organizers to get their act together and make sure that all accommodations are ready for the guests.</p><p/><p>Now meanwhile in Indonesia, our rescuers have resumed their search and recovery efforts. They are looking for the victims of a deadly volacno. At least 15 people were killed when hot ash raced down the slopes of Mount Sinabung covering a nearby village.</p><p/><p>Saima Mohsin reports.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SAIMA MOHSIN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPNDENT: Search and rescue teams are patrolling the three mile radius around Mount Sinabung searching for any survivors or people who might have come back to dangerous exclusion zone. We're right on the outskirts of it. This whole village completely deserted, a ghost village. It's eerily quiet and absolutely everywhere there is ash all over everything.</p><p/><p>Take a look at this, there's a crop of tomatoes here completely caked in the ash. And everywhere, when a breeze blows or there's a gust of wind it lists up. I can taste the ash in my mouth. I can feel it all over my skin.</p><p/><p>[08:10:00]</p><p/><p>This group of houses completely collapsed under the weight of the ash when it fell. And if you take a look at it, it's incredibly thick, really dense on top of this structure.</p><p/><p>30,000 people have forced to flee their homes. It's not know when they'll be able to come back because this volcano is still active.</p><p/><p>With 129 active volcanoes across Indonesia, the Indonesian people and government have had to learn to cope with and prepare for disasters like this. The National Disaster Mitigation Authority has now added 19 more volcanoes up the threat level from normal to alert. Add that to three others last year on high alert and this, Mount Sinabung, an active volcano on the highest threat level of all under dangerous.</p><p/><p>Saima Mohsin, CNN, Mount Sinabung, Indonesia.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Now the latest trial of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy has been postponed again. Now according to the state owned Nile TV, the case will resume on Wednesday.</p><p/><p>The ousted leader and 14 others are accused of inciting murder in the deaths of opposition protesters in 2012. In all, Morsy is facing four separate trials.</p><p/><p>He and his Muslim Brotherhood supporters have called the charges a shame.</p><p/><p>Now this is News Stream and there's plenty more coming up this hour. We get an update on the fierce winter weather sweeping across the U.S. yet again. It's affecting millions of residents and it's disrupting thousands of flights.</p><p/><p>And more on Philip Seymour Hoffman's final hours. Authorities are trying to find out where the actor bought the drugs that apparently killed him.</p><p/><p>And it has amassed millions of friends during its decade online. And now Facebook turns 10-years-old. Well find out Mark Zuckerberg's code to success for the social network. Stick around.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Now Broadway has announced plans to honor the celebrated actor Philip Seymour Hoffman. Now the theaters will dim their lights on Wednesday in tribute.</p><p/><p>Now Hoffman was found dead inside his New York apartment on Sunday from a suspected heroin overdose. And authorities are still piecing together his final hours.</p><p/><p>Now law enforcement sources say that they are trying to find out where Hoffman bought the drugs and if anyone was with him when he died.</p><p/><p>Now the medical examiner's office tells that Hoffman's autopsy is still ongoing. It has not released any results yet.</p><p/><p>Now the actor's death is already focusing attention on what authorities say is an alarming trend when it comes to drug use in the U.S. Brian Todd has more on that.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There were close to 50 envelopes in his apartment believed to contain heroin, according to law enforcement sources, along with more than 20 syringes. If he did overdose on heroin, Philip Seymour Hoffman's final hours reflect what U.S. officials say is a menacing tide.</p><p/><p>JAMES CAPRA, U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION: We have an explosion in heroin use in this country.</p><p/><p>TODD: In a 2002 survey, according to the government 166,000 Americans said they've used heroin in the past month. Now...</p><p/><p>ADMIRAL PETER DELANY, SUBSTANCE ABUSE &amp; MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ADMIN: About 333,000 people are using it every month.</p><p/><p>TODD: Heroin overdose deaths in the U.S. went up 45 percent between 2006 and 2010 according to the CDC.</p><p/><p>[08:15:02]</p><p/><p>One big reason for the rise in use? The nationwide crackdown on prescription pill abuse. Those drugs are now harder to get and more expensive than heroin.</p><p/><p>CAPRA: On the street, if it's going to cost you $80 to get a pill, some opiate type of pharmaceutical drug, versus $10 for a bag of heroin, that's what we see.</p><p/><p>TODD: The highs from prescription drugs and heroin can be similar.</p><p/><p>DELANY: It has a similar long-term effect of mellowing people out and of kind of numbing them.</p><p/><p>TODD: Though heroin tends to give people that high in a quicker rush.</p><p/><p>DEA officials and other experts say going from prescription drugs to heroin is especially dangerous, because unlike prescription drugs, heroin doses are very inconsistent and can sometimes be laced with deadly additives.</p><p/><p>Last month, at least 22 people in western Pennsylvania died after using heroin that had been mixed with fentanyl, a narcotic sometimes used to treat pain in cancer patients.</p><p/><p>This young man named Andrew was almost one of them.</p><p/><p>ANDREW, RECOVERING HEROIN ADDICT: I just finished doing, you know, the heroin, and I walked into the bathroom and I just woke up on the ground.</p><p/><p>TODD: Experts say fentanyl is mixed with heroin to enhance the high. It only takes a small amount of fentanyl to get you hooked or to kill.</p><p/><p>CAPRA: It's done in terms of micro-grams. It's so tiny.</p><p/><p>TODD: And if you mix any of that with heroin, what happens?</p><p/><p>CAPRA: It's hard to dilute it, so the heroin-user has no idea what they're getting, and they put that into their arm, laced with fentanyl and it's a deadly, it's what we call hot-shots.</p><p/><p>TODD: The DEA's James Capra says police are telling them that it's not untypical to see a user whose injected fentanyl with heroin dead with the needle still in their arm. It can kill you that quickly.</p><p/><p>Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Now just ahead, it looks like the U.S. is in store for another major winter storm. The northeast is bracing for more snow and more ice and more travel delays.</p><p/><p>[08:17:00]</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>[08:20:40]</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Coming to you live from Hong Kong, you're back watching News Stream. And this is a visual version of all the stories we've got in the show today.</p><p/><p>Now we started with the countdown to the winter games in Sochi. And now to another winter landscape. But millions of people in the U.S. are probably sick of the sight of snow. Once again, the Midwest and the northeast are getting socked.</p><p/><p>Now in New York City the mayor says it is coming down faster than the city can plow it.</p><p/><p>Our Chad Myers is there. He joins me now live. And Chad, I read it's up to 10 inches of snow in some areas. What does it look like where you are?</p><p/><p>CHAD MYERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We had about six-and-a-half as of 6:00 last night. It snowed some more. And so now we're up to eight. And that eight inches would also have been right at the stadium that the Super Bowl was played the day before exactly 24 hours later there was eight inches of snow on the field that they would have had to shovel off or play in or whatever. So it would have been a snow bowl.</p><p/><p>This is only the first storm, though, of two more to come.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>MYERS (voice-over): Millions along the east coast this morning are digging out of Monday's record breaking snowstorm.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Snow is coming down faster than we can plow it.</p><p/><p>MYERS: The winter storm transforming New York's Central Park into a winter wonderland in just hours setting a new daily record of 8 inches.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think I'm ready for the summer.</p><p/><p>MYERS: For thousands of travelers heading home from Sunday Super Bowl, the airports were anything, but a wonderland and more than 2,000 flights canceled on Monday due to the storm.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are trying to Chicago, our flights a couple hours delayed. We're just hoping it will actually take off.</p><p/><p>MYERS: Parts of New Jersey pummeled with 9 inches forcing Governor Christie to issue a state of emergency, some blaming the Super Bowl for the inability to battle the snow.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The local municipalities and the counties have been struggling to get it.</p><p/><p>MYERS: The new winter storm will pack a one-two punch tonight and into Wednesday with heavy snow and ice forecast in more than two dozens states. Kansas City bracing for 10 inches of snow.</p><p/><p>MARK THIEL, ASST. PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR, LAWRENCE, KANSAS: We're expecting this event to be pretty traumatic in terms of the amount of snowfall during rush hour in the morning and then again during rush hour later in the evening.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>MYERS: So here is the deal: we get more snow tonight, probably four to six inches, then it changes over to sleet and freezing rain by morning. People are already canceling plans for tomorrow and tomorrow is number two, there's more to come after that -- Kristie.</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Oh, that's just incredible.</p><p/><p>You know, international viewers, international travelers are watching the situation with a lot of interest as well. Give us the travel advisory. I mean, how many flights have been canceled so far?</p><p/><p>MYERS: Canceled, 2,000 flights yesterday. Now you think about that at about 120 people per plane, do the multiplication, you have a lot of people that didn't get to where they wanted to be, almost a quarter of a million seats that didn't fly yesterday, 500 planes have already been canceled today mainly out of Chicago because of the storm is going to be there, but 500 times 100 people all of a sudden you have -- I mean, you are talking about major disruptions here.</p><p/><p>But the big problem is going to be it's what called the nor'easter. The low pressure that comes out of the west is going to combine with the relatively warm air that's in the Atlantic Ocean about 45 degrees. That is going to bomb a storm, that's going to make almost hurricane force winds and still will make very heavy snow, as much as a meter of snow in some of the big cities across the northeast with winds of 60. That happens on Monday.</p><p/><p>I don't believe there will be any travel in or out of the northeast, and that's where most international planes come, whether you're Boston, New York, Philadelphia, all those international airports I believe will be almost shut down on Monday because of that big storm that's coming, Kristie.</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Thank you very much indeed for that warning.</p><p/><p>Chad Myers across all the icy conditions, the latest on that as well as the science behind this epic snow storm. Chad, thank you.</p><p/><p>Now let's get more now on this huge snow storm across the U.S. My colleague Mari Ramos joins me from the World Weather Center with that -- Mari.</p><p/><p>[08:25:00]</p><p/><p>MARI RAMOS, CNN WEATHER CORRESPONDENT: That's quite a warning from Chad there. I mean, my eyes were like this big listening to him. That's for next Monday. We still have to get through the storms that are happening right now. And great reporting there from Chad.</p><p/><p>When you look at what's coming up next, this is what we can expect over the next couple of days. So today is, what, Tuesday here so this is for Wednesday in particular. Becuase of snow, as you saw from Chad's live shot, it stopped snowing right now in New York City. So that's a little bit of good news there.</p><p/><p>But an additional 11 centimeters expected. Upstate New York could have even more than that. Boston could have 28 centimeters of snow. And even though today the cancellations are about 500, 600 cancellations compared to the 2,000 yesterday, today is a better flying day in a way across the northeast. That's going to change again as we head to tomorrow. And then as we heard from Chad as we head into the beginning of next week.</p><p/><p>Now, as far as the states right now that have those winter storm advisories or warnings or any kind of winter weather related problems, if you look over here it stretches anywhere from the northeast all the way back over there toward even areas to the west and as far south as Texas. So that's about 32 states that have some sort of an advisory or warning. So this is pretty widespread.</p><p/><p>Areas being impacted right now -- and most of the cancellations that we've seen today are actually up in the Chicago area. But also affecting areas of the Midwest and this is why. You can see the storm system beginning to come in right in through here and this is the one that will continue moving in to the northeast as we head through the day tomorrow.</p><p/><p>So, let's head to the other side of the Atlantic, you know, again here we have yet another storm system coming through. Not a lot of snow, but definitely a lot of wind and a lot of rain for the UK and Ireland and western parts of France, even Portugal and Spain getting in on the action with very high waves over the weekend. Remember that. And even yesterday.</p><p/><p>Temperatures are relatively mild on this side, but relatively colder as we head farther to the east, but not as cold, though, as they had been before. So a lot of you that were getting snow are going to get rain this time around if we get to see a little bit more of this moisture make its way across into eastern parts of Europe here.</p><p/><p>And you can see more rain across Italy, the swollen rivers across Tuscany and as we head down even into Rome, the Tiber very high again today because of all of the rain that happened over the last couple of days will be continuing to drain down from the mountains there.</p><p/><p>And then back over here, this is our next weather system coming in across the west. Unfortunately that one will bring us more rain to already waterlogged areas and very dangerous waves, more coastal flooding expected. And that rain could be heavy at times for you guys in France, Portugal, Spain, the UK and even into Ireland. More snow across the Alpine region.</p><p/><p>And look at this picture, this is from Sochi. We've been talking quite a bit, of course, as we head into the Olympic Games. Not a lot of snow. Temperatures have actually been again slightly above the average for this time of year. Over the next couple of days sunny skies expected. And partly cloudy as we head into Friday, but nothing in the way of significant precipitation.</p><p/><p>So, I guess good travel days for people that are headed that way.</p><p/><p>Average high this time of year is 10, the average low is 3. And they usually get about 135 millimeters of either rain or snow, depending on where you are and usually snow it's only about six days that they get snow during the month of February. The number of days with snow on the ground is about four. Of course that changes as we head into some of those highest elevations.</p><p/><p>And last but not least, very heavy snowfall in Iran, some of the heaviest that they've seen in quite a long time, almost 90 centimeters of snow.</p><p/><p>Back to you, Kristie.</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Yeah, heavy snowfall in Iran, but as for Sochi not quite looking like the winter wonderland just yet. Fingers crossed for the athletes.</p><p/><p>Mari Ramos there. Thank you.</p><p/><p>Now you are watching News Stream. And up next, Facebook has come a long way since its start in a Harvard dorm room. As the social network celebrates a decade, we ask what the next 10 years will bring.</p><p/><p>Plus...</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The technology sees around corners, over hills and through other vehicles.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Incredible technology that could save thousands of lives.</p><p/><p>[08:28:55]</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>[08:31:12]</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching News Stream. And these are your world headlines.</p><p/><p>Now Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Sochi as the Black Sea city prepares for the opening of the Winter Olympics on Friday. And Mr. Putin is attending IOC events, but as athletes also begin to arrive organizers are facing criticism over a number of hotel rooms that are not yet ready for visitors and some journalists.</p><p/><p>Now investors are waiting for the opening of the U.S. markets after selloffs around the world. And here is how the main indexes in Europe are doing. Meanwhile in Asia, Japan's NIKKEI lead the losses, closing down more than 4 percent off concerns about U.S. growth and stimulus plus the strength of emerging markets have all contributed to the falls.</p><p/><p>Now search and recovery teams in Indonesia have been looking for victims after Saturday's eruption of Mount Sinabung volcano. 15 people are known dead after the vocano spewed scalding ash engulfing a nearby village. About 30,000 people have been evacuated from the area.</p><p/><p>The World Health Organization says that there were 14 million new cancer cases in 2012. And within two decades that number is set to soar to 22 million. Developing countries are expected to see the biggest increases.</p><p/><p>Now if you are like a lot of people, you've probably used Facebook at some point today, but 10 years ago only students at Harvard University could use The Facebook. It all started in founder Mark Zuckerberg's dorm room on February 4, 2004. And he posted this note on Facebook of course to mark his company's 10 year anniversary.</p><p/><p>And reflecting on Facebook's success, he said this, quote, \"we just cared more about connecting the world than anyone else and we still do today.\"</p><p/><p>Now Facebook counts more than 1.2 billion monthly active users. And according to Alexa (ph) is the second most popular website in the world just after Google.</p><p/><p>Now earlier I spoke to David Kirkpatrick, he's the author \"The Facebook Effect.\" He calls his book the only journalistic history of the company. And he gained privileged access to write it.</p><p/><p>I asked him to explain Zuckerberg's role in Facebook's success.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, AUTHOR: Well, you know, there are so few leaders in business that are true visionaries. I think in technology we can name Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, maybe Larry Ellison, Andy Grove, one or two others. Zuckerberg belongs in that group. He is an extraordinary long-term thinker. And I really believe that's one of the reasons Facebook has done so well. He continues to make really long-term bet.</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: You also point out that even though Facebook is a social media company, it is at heart a tech company. How has that been a factor for its success?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well, if you look back at the early days, you know, there were earlier social networks that were quite sizable when Facebook came along. There was MySpace and Friendster in particular. Both of them got very large and essentially collapsed under their own weight because they just couldn't manage their own tech, because they basically thought of themselves as cool places for people to hook up, you know.</p><p/><p>But unfortunately that led to their demise.</p><p/><p>Zuckerberg, on the other hand, an engineer, a guy who always thought about the programming side of things and product development looked at Facebook from the beginning as a constantly improving technology product. That allowed it to grow with much more seamless functionality and to really beat everybody else.</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: You know, there's Mark Zuckerberg, but there's also Cheryl Sandberg. How key has she been to the kind of performance we've seen from Facebook?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well, Cheryl Sandberg is an astonishingly important person in the history of Facebook.</p><p/><p>[08:35:00]</p><p/><p>You know, she came in in the spring of 2008 when they really didn't even know what business they were in. In my book \"The Facebook Effect,\" I describe that for the first months she was there all she did was have meetings that were titled \"what business are we in?\" They kept asking themselves this question over and over again. And they figured out it was advertising. She set about to implement that strategy. Here we are a few years later the company is 1.23 billion people around the world dominating increasingly in mobile advertising, just had a quarter last week that was incredibly positive. Stock is skyrocketing. She gets a lot of the credit.</p><p/><p>Zuckerberg is the tech visionary, she is the business visionary.</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Now I have to ask you about privacy. How has Facebook handled privacy the last 10 years?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well, over the last 10 years you know you might say Facebook has handled privacy intermittently well. I think actually they've made a lot of mistakes in the way they've changed their service unexpectedly and communicated it poorly to their users. But one thing many people forget is that Facebook was fundamentally founded on an idea of privacy in a way that no internet company had ever done before.</p><p/><p>Before Facebook came along, all you used on the Internet was your handle. You would never put your email address or your cellphone number online. Facebook gave people the confidence that they could do things like that, because it gave them control over who saw their data. That is the fundamental form of privacy that Facebook offers you, who you have as your friends, because your friends see everything about you.</p><p/><p>But I don't think Facebook has explained that properly. I think even though their heritage is one of privacy, they've often strayed away from that in their effort to try to get more page views, to turn themselves commercial in ways that sometimes were a little clumsy. But, you know, that was before Sandberg arrived by the way.</p><p/><p>But anyway, I think, you know, we're going to continue to see this being a fraught topic for Facebook despite Zuckerberg's commitment that he is building a service that honors privacy, because there is so much personal information there, it makes us all nervous.</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Now you met Mark Zuckerberg for the first time back in 2006. And you've said in that meeting you got a sense, and he was just in his early to mid-20s at the time, that he was a leader.</p><p/><p>How did you get that sense? What is it that he said? What did he do?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: It was funny. I was sitting at a restaurant in midtown Manhattan. This is September 2006 when Facebook was two-and-a-half years old and Zuckerberg was 22. And he walked in. And I said to myself, oh, I'm wasting my time, this guy is so young. He's like a baby. Why am I bothering?</p><p/><p>You know, I had just done it because a PR person suggested it and I thought, oh, Facebook is kind of cool. But then he opened his mouth and I started listening to the things he said. And they were so extraordinarily big picture -- like I said earlier, long-term visionary, confident. I realized I had seldom heard anyone with such a big picture, positive long- term view about what he was engaged in and it made me confident that he was going to have an extraordinary success. I started covering Facebook very closely forever after. And it led to me writing a book a year-and-a-half later and the rest is history. Zuckerberg has proven to be as extraordinary as I thought he might be.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Love that Zuckerberg flashback there. And that was David Kirkpatrick speaking to me earlier.</p><p/><p>Now Zuckerberg has not been shy about his ambitions for Facebook. He wants it to be your interface for the rest of the internet.</p><p/><p>And CNN's Laurie Segall joins us live from Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California. And Laurie, we've talked about the last 10 years, let's look at the future, what's next for Facebook?</p><p/><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: This is a big birthday for Facebook. And it's so interesting, Kristie, you hear David Kirkpatrick talk about how young Mark Zuckerberg was. I actually -- I spoke to Chris Cox who is at Facebook for the last eight years and everybody was so young back in the day, which makes 10 years later that just makes this a huge landmark.</p><p/><p>And what Chris Cox said, and he's the head of product at Facebook, he's really a visionary behind what we see and what we will see in the future. He gave me a bit of a look at the rocky history and some of those moments that kind of came to define Facebook and also what we can look for in the next 10 years. Check it out.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>CHRIS COX, VICE PRESIDENT OF PRODUCT, FACEBOOK: And the big question was, is this something that could work outside of college? And everybody said no, it's probably not going to work outside of college.</p><p/><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: In honor of Facebook's ten- year anniversary, we decided to take a walk down memory lane. Do you have some of those stories where you thought, my God, I believe we got through that?</p><p/><p>COX: I mean, the news feed launch was pretty crazy. I spent, with a bunch of people, we worked really hard on making news feed. It took us almost a year to build. And we were pretty naive around how it would be received. Obviously, people were like, this is a lot of change. And there was like a protest organizing outside, so we had to, like, go out the back entrance.</p><p/><p>SEGALL: You had to go out the back?</p><p/><p>COX: Yes. And it was just one of those things I look back on right now and it's hard to believe.</p><p/><p>MEREDITH CHIN, FACEBOOK: Since then, there have been a lot of landmarks that are hard to believe. Six billion likes per day, 7.8 trillion messages sent using Facebook, and 1.2 billion monthly active users.</p><p/><p>[08:39:54]</p><p/><p>It's a far cry from their early days. There were no chairs, no tables. They had to find like a bean bag chair. The kid interviewing me who is now a good friend, but he had bare feet. I was like what am I getting myself into?</p><p/><p>SEGALL: Over the past ten years, Facebook moved from this small office, to here and here and now to this sprawling campus here in Menlo Park.</p><p/><p>When we talk about the future of Facebook, the word we keep hearing is mobile. When did you guys know mobile is going to be big and what is the future look like when it comes to mobile and Facebook?</p><p/><p>COX: It really happen a couple of years ago. We sort of instituted all of these rules in the company, like whenever we show our product to each other, we need to start with mobile version.</p><p/><p>SEGALL: But the future of Facebook may look different. Alongside the traditional lap on your phone, you might start seeing a variety of apps created by the company.</p><p/><p>COX: We already have Facebook. We have Instagram messenger. We just announced paper, which is a more immersive way at looking at your news feed.</p><p/><p>SEGALL: Paper, Facebook's latest app, straight to your news feed based on your interest. But a challenge for the company will be continuing to grow at such a rapid pace. They are starting to saturate the internet-connected world.</p><p/><p>COX: When you just look out over the next three years, there's going to be a lot more people with their first computer and first phone and their first access to the internet. And one of the things that we're really excited about is making the access to the internet in general a lot more affordable.</p><p/><p>SEGALL: It will be a challenge and not Facebook's only challenge. The company now competes with ample of apps like Snapchat and Twitter.</p><p/><p>What do you look forward to for the company?</p><p/><p>CHIN: I think it's the next billion.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SEGALL: And Kristie, you know, getting to that next billion that a whole other question because they've got to get people access to the Internet. They already have over a billion people using this service.</p><p/><p>Now I also spoke to Chris about the idea of artificial intelligence, because there's a group at Facebook -- now he didn't give me too many details, but there's a small group at Facebook working on the idea of artificial intelligence. A lot of big companies like Google investing in this. And how to you make your service even smarter? How do you learn what we're doing and learn it even better -- Kristie.</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: So artificial intelligence and stand alone apps, two big shifts in Facebook to come in the next 10 years.</p><p/><p>Laurie Segall joining us live from Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, thank you.</p><p/><p>Now Facebook and other big tech firms they are shedding light on the secret data requests they receive from the U.S. government on national security matters. But the companies are permitted only to release ranges rather than precise numbers.</p><p/><p>Now Yahoo received requests for information for more than 30,000 accounts. That was the most. LinkedIn received the fewest with requests targeted less than 250 accounts. But they can't discuss details of the requests or the identities of the users involved.</p><p/><p>Now the NSA is often said to only collect metadata from users. But let me just explain what metadata means. Now here is a fake email that we've created for this example. Now metadata is the contextual information around this email, but not the message body itself. So in this fictional example, reading metadata means you only be able to see this information here, not the actual email itself.</p><p/><p>But it's worth pointing out that this, it's still a lot of information, you can see who someone is communicating with and the subject line can also reveal what is being discussed.</p><p/><p>Now in the United States car crashes kill tens of thousands of people each and every year, but what if your car could help you avoid potential dangers on the road? Rene Marsh reports on a new technology that could save lives.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>RENE MARSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's the vehicle of the future -- cars that talk to the driver and each other.</p><p/><p>The federal government wants it on the road soon, pushing for technology that would warn drivers of danger coming from any direction.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Coming along, the light is green, everything looks -- and all of a sudden we get that warning that says, you know, look out.</p><p/><p>MARSH: It's called vehicle-to-vehicle technology. Cars would send wireless messages to each other within about a 300 yard radius communicating information like speed, direction and GPS position ten times per second.</p><p/><p>ANTHONY FOXX, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: When cars share this information, they can account for all the vehicles around them, which means they're able to identify possible crashes.</p><p/><p>MARSH: The technology sees around corners, over hills and through other vehicles. So let's just say five cars ahead of me the driver slams on the breaks, well that car sends my car a message giving me enough time to react.</p><p/><p>33,000 Americans are killed and 2.3 million injured in car crashes every year. The Department of Transportation predicts talking cars could prevent up to 80 percent of crashes involving sober drivers.</p><p/><p>[08:45:00]</p><p/><p>Five major car companies have been working with DOT on developing and testing the technology. 3,000 cars in Ann Arbor, Michigan are already using it as part of a government pilot test.</p><p/><p>Some time after 2016, the federal government hopes your car will be able to communicate with you.</p><p/><p>Well, the DOT hopes to propose the rule by 2016, but it will still need the public to weigh in before anything is finalized. The bottom line is it's a lengthy process to get something like this mandated.</p><p/><p>Now as for privacy, the government says that data sent between cars does not record personal information. So your privacy should not be compromised.</p><p/><p>Rene Marsh, CNN, Washington.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Up next here on News Stream, just what is going on in London's Underground? It is not deep, dark and deserted. Now I'll tell you why business is thriving in these tunnels.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Welcome back.</p><p/><p>Now Edith Cooper says it took drive and tenacity to rise up the ranks at Goldman Sachs. In this week's Leading Woman talks about the unique challenges of her position with our Poppy Harlow. And she gives insight into how the firm weathered the global financial crisis.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Edith Cooper is one of the top ranking women at investment banking firm Goldman Sachs.</p><p/><p>EDITH COOPER, GOLDMAN SACHS: Just want to make sure we're connecting all of those dots. If you had asked me 30 years ago would I be on the managing committee at Goldman Sachs and be the influencer of our success of our people, oh no way.</p><p/><p>I think that, you know, I've come to expect the unexpected.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: As Goldman's head of human capital management, Cooper isn't just one of the top women, she's one of the top executives in the 30,000 member firm.</p><p/><p>COOPER: When asked the question at an event earlier do you want to be a CEO, of course, of course. You know, I'm young.</p><p/><p>My career path is not necessarily a clear straight line.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: She's one of just four women on Goldman's 29 member executive committee.</p><p/><p>Does that number need to go up?</p><p/><p>COOPER: Of course it does. I believe that we can't be the great firm that we need to be to be relevant to our clients if we don't have diversity at every level.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: You are a rare woman in this position and even more rare because you're African-American.</p><p/><p>COOPER: At times, it's been difficult. It is different for me as an African-American woman than it would be for a white male. I mean, that's just a fact. There's difficulty with respect to the subconscious bias that exists in life.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: It was a move to London, Cooper says, that was critical for her rise at the firm.</p><p/><p>COOPER: I think in today's economy, operating outside of your comfort zone is really, really important.</p><p/><p>When I arrived in Europe, I realized it wasn't the difference of being, you know, African-American it was the difference of being an American, an American. And the tools that I used to lead and to manage in the United States really were not as effective operating with people from all over the world. It was quite an extraordinary experience.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: But Cooper returned to New York with one of her greatest challenges ahead during the most recent financial crisis.</p><p/><p>COOPER: Reputationally, Goldman Sachs was really targeted as a company that was at the center of gravity, a lot of the difficulties that existed in the financial markets.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Critics were saying you were betting against your clients. They were questioning the size bonuses handed out. How did you deal with that criticism?</p><p/><p>COOPER: The most difficult thing at the time was that what people thought about Goldman Sachs was not in sync with who we knew we were.</p><p/><p>[08:50:05]</p><p/><p>HARLOW: What do you think people would be most surprised to learn about you?</p><p/><p>COOPER: I'm very tough. I'm very resilient. And the minute I think that someone believes that I can't I do.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: Stay with us. And after the break, we go deep below London's Underground train lines. A dark tunnel is home to a blooming business. We take a look at a novel solution to soaring rental prices and the demand for ecofriendly food.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: An imminent human disaster spreading across the globe -- that's how the World Health Organization is describing the cancer threat in the coming decades. It says new cases are set to rise by a staggering 70 percent in the next 20 years. And despite advances in medical care, the report predicts that there will be 22 million new cancer cases in 2034, 13 million people each year will be killed by the disease. And researchers say that the high cost of treating cancer is affecting the economies of richer countries. And it says developing nations are not equipped to deal with the crisis.</p><p/><p>Now the report says about half of all cancers could be avoided, but smoking rates need to be cut. Lung cancer is still the deadliest.</p><p/><p>And the report calls for better public health campaigns to promote prevention.</p><p/><p>Now one of the authors spoke to CNN a little bit earlier about the study. And what we can all do to help.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BERNARD STEWART, CO-EDITOR OF WORLD CANCER REPORT 2014: People giving up smoking is not just a matter of their individual choice, they're supported in that decision by restrictions on advertising, by the non-availability of the product to certain people such as children, by the price that discourages the buying of cigarettes and by the lack of advertising.</p><p/><p>Now we can't necessarily apply all of those things to every known healthy choice, but we can in different societies as the case is made opt for support from government through regulation for people to make the healthy choice.</p><p/><p>Now in respect of the involuntary exposures, those things that you literally can't avoid, the state of the air you breathe, as you point out, in many Asian cities is appalling and definitively associated with an increase risk of cancer.</p><p/><p>Lung cancer from that cause is only a small proportion of lung cancer from cigarettes, but it's still a real problem. and that is the responsibility of government. Communities deserve protection for recognized causes of cancer, particularly lung cancer, and action should and can be taken to reduce that risk, particularly has been demonstrated in the success achieved in American cities in reducing the burden of pollution.</p><p/><p>So that model can serve as a vehicle for other cities, particularly in China, for example, to achieve the same level of protection for their citizens.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>LU STOUT: And that was one of the editor of the World Cancer Report, Professor Bernard Stewart.</p><p/><p>Now health experts say that our diet can play a role in disease prevention.</p><p/><p>[08:55:56]</p><p/><p>And in London, one business has found a unique way to grow ecofriendly food right in the heart of the city.</p><p/><p>Isa Soares has that.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's another gray morning in South London and as commuters make their way to work, something deep below ground is growing.</p><p/><p>But little do they know that 33 meters below their seat in a World War II bunker, a unique horticultural endeavor is underway.</p><p/><p>Here in the dark, damp, rusty tunnels of London with a constant temperature of 16 degrees an innovative farming experiment is raising shoots.</p><p/><p>RICHARD BALLARD, FOUNDER: Having a stable environment we can create a perfect environment for the plant. So -- and we can grow to a certain time from seven days to 21 days and we can produce a crop and deliver directly into the market, which is just half a kilometer down the road.</p><p/><p>SOARES: The project is being backed by Michelin starred chief Michel Roux Jr. He tells me this is modern farming in Britian -- underground and no need for a trowel.</p><p/><p>These herbs?</p><p/><p>MICHEL ROUX, CHEF: No, these are pea shoots as well.</p><p/><p>SOARES: Oh, they're pea shoots as well.</p><p/><p>ROUX: These are fully mature. So they have -- you know, you bite into them and they have that wonderful pea taste if you want to have a little -- and they look great and they really do look great.</p><p/><p>SOARES: Where do you get the water from?</p><p/><p>ROUX: The water is -- the water at the moment is just filtered water that we're using, but we're hoping -- we're hoping that we should be able to collect rain water and filter that and various other things that will help us to be as organic as we can.</p><p/><p>And it's good for the environment.</p><p/><p>SOARES: There's so much rain at the moment, you're not shoot of water, I can tell you that much.</p><p/><p>For the time being, they have one tunnel with two-and-a-half acres of space. They're growing garlic chives, pea shoots, Thai basil among other products with a potential of course to expand.</p><p/><p>And with London's above ground property prices through the roof, this underground business has growth potential.</p><p/><p>BALLARD: Commercially it's a lot cheaper to grow in this environment than building a farm sort of outside of London.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's about eight times cheaper when you look at the cost in terms of the rent that you would have to pay for that kind of space.</p><p/><p>SOARES: Well, they're hoping this unique venture will whet the appetites of investors, they need to raise roughly a million pounds in 60 days in a crowdfunding campaign to get food on plates by late summer.</p><p/><p>Isa Soares, CNN, Underground, in London.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>LU SOTUT: And that is News Stream.

And welcome to  News Stream where news and technology meet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now days ahead of the Winter Games in Sochi, we take a closer look at the  threat posed by Russia's black widows.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now rescue efforts are continuing around Indonesia's Mount Sinabung after  at least 15 people were killed by the erupting volcano.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And on Facebook's 10th birthday, we'll look at what's next for the world's  biggest social media site.</p><p>Now athletes are streaming into Sochi as the city gets ready to kick off  the Winter Games in just three days time.</p><p>Now the Russian President Vladimir Putin is also there to attend several  IOC events.  Now he has staked his reputation on the games and is keen to  see them go off without a hitch.</p><p>But there are concerns that the city may not be quite ready with a rush to  get some hotel rooms open for business and security concerns still loom  large.</p><p>Now militants from the volatile Northern Caucuses region have threatened  the games.  And our senior international correspondent Nick Paton Walsh has  uncovered a disturbing new trend among the so-called Black Widows.  He  joins us now live from Sochi.</p><p>And Nick, what are the security preparations in light of recent threats  there?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, in fact in the  last 20 minutes or so we saw a new level of security here, three  helicopters circling the Olympic venue.  Now that may be some sort of an  indication that Vladimir Putin, who arrived in the last few hours is  heading towards the sort of center of the ring of steel around these games.</p><p>But at the heart of the threat we've been hearing are the suggestion that  perhaps suicide bombers have focused their sights on Sochi and behind those  women often is a new radicalized ideology.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALSH:  Medina Alyeva (ph) wanted to die the way both of her husbands had:  in jihad.</p><p>\"This is jihad.  It's the highest thing in the world,\" she said in this  address before she died, \"who fulfilled promises better than Allah.  So  many men are just talk and spend their time in cinemas or playing video  games.\"</p><p>Medina (ph) blew herself up in May last year near the police headquarters  in Dagestan with over a dozen injured, ending her embrace of radicalism.</p><p>Both her husbands were killed by special forces in sieges like this, the  first when she was just 21.</p><p>This similar siege her second husband and several other militants were also  shot dead.  Here she is, filmed by police coming out of the house.</p><p>Medina (ph), experts worry, is part of a new kind of so-called Black Widow  female suicide bomber in Russia who don't, like in the past, decide to die  out of grief and vengeance for a loved one.   </p><p>Instead, these women in the past few years married jihadis and seek  martyrdom on their own, these women in the past few years married jihadis  and seek martyrdom on their own as it seems fashionable.</p><p>KATYA SOKIRIANSKAYA, INTERNATIONAL CRISIS GROUP:  It is a trend also.  They  have their own slang.  These young women, they oftentimes want to die  because they want to die.  I have seen these women after their husband had  been just killed or there were funerals and they don't mourn them.  They  congratulate each other.</p><p>WALSH:  Medina's (ph) mother Patoum (ph) in her first interview with  Medina's (ph) sister and orphan by her side says police had ordered her  daughter to see a psychologist and three days before she died Medina (ph)  vanished.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  She's probably in heaven.  I saw  her in my sleep.  She was there with my grandparents.  They were all  together in beautiful white clothes smiling.  She told me how great it was  there.</p><p>WALSH:  Medina's (ph) son thinks mom is coming home.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  He's always picking up photos of  her saying mother is coming soon.</p><p>WALSH:  But she isn't.  </p><p>And, with police putting up these wanted posters we saw across the region.   It's clear they think Medina (ph) is not alone in seeking a nihilistic end  to her life that takes many others with her.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALSH:  Now Moscow has made it clear they believe the games will be safe.  Barack Obama has said he thinks it'll be safe for Americans to come here,  but still that threat, that security issue hangs over these games simply  because of the fact they're at the western edge southern Russia, a region  volatile for decades.</p><p>[08:04:57]</p><p>Today, another example Austrian press agency saying that there has been a  letter received, which perhaps originated from Russia that threatens two  Austrian athletes with kidnap if they come here.</p><p>Now that has, in some reports, been suggested as being a hoax.  Still few  details available.  But really these -- these letters, these indications  are doing nothing to lower anxiety levels around here, although I have to  say this is a calm area behind me, apart from these helicopters circling, a  calm area behind me that seems to be getting ready for the games ahead --  Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yeah, yeah.  And regards to that Austrian security threat, hoax  or not, very worrying development.  And in the face of all these threats,  Nick, I mean just how prepared is Russia to truly secure and safeguard  these games?</p><p>WALSH:  This has been a year's long operation for the Russians.  They've  been pressing on various militant hotspots across southern Russia for a  long time, since they knew this was coming using all resources at their  disposal, many of them heavy-handed -- blunt instruments.</p><p>But the finer point has been the ring of steel they put around here, a lot  of that high tech.  There are two blimps, they're known as, security camera  devices held up by hot air balloons, cameras everywhere, but above all  37,000 Russian police and security officers coming here to secure the  games.</p><p>That, in many ways, is the big card Moscow is playing, the sheer manpower  resources they're throwing at this.  But of course one problem with Russian  police as many Russians know is their corruption, their ineptitude.  So  they could be holes for people to slip through.  But I think most people  believe the games themselves here, the area around them, will be secure.   This will probably pass without incident.  It's just that can't be said for  all of southern Russia, particularly Dagestan of the far east of where I'm  standing where, as I say, violence is a weekly occurrence as militants  target police officers or those they consider loyal to the Russian federal  government -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Nick Paton Walsh reporting live from Sochi.  Thank you, Nick.</p><p>Now a number of hotels in Sochi are still putting the finishing touches on  the rooms even as the guests arrive.  Now CNN's Amanda Davies and her crew  arrived at their accommodations only to find that their rooms were not  ready.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  So with all the stories doing  around about hotels in Sochi not being finished we now get to experience it  firsthand.  We've just landed from Moscow about an hour ago now.  We  arrived at our Hotel, the Amiga (inaudible) Hotel where lots of media  representatives are staying.  And we've been told our rooms aren't ready.   The actual phrase that's been used is that we are waiting for our rooms to  be ready.</p><p>While we've been sitting here for the last hour or so, there's been  representatives of other media who have been going up to the desk saying  that their rooms haven't been clean for a week and the radiators aren't  working, there's no lou paper.   </p><p>I had a wander around outside.  There's still plants being put in place in  some places.  There's one building you can hear the banging and  construction still going on.</p><p>We might be being a little bit unfair, I have to say.  We haven't seen any  evidence, but equally we haven't seen any rooms yet.  So, an hour and  counting.</p><p>OK, so we've been here just over an hour-and-a-half.  We've got one room,  which we went to see.  And to be fair it was quite decent.  It was very  new, the carpet obviously had just been laid.  There were a few cables and  wires hanging out.  But there's three of us in our crew and crews need to  stick together.  The other two rooms weren't going to be ready today.</p><p>So we've checked in to another hotel down the road, which has been ready.   A big chain hotel has been ready for awhile.</p><p>And we're going to come back hopefully with better luck tomorrow.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  All right, good luck there.</p><p>Now Amanda Davies' producer Harry Reiki (ph), he posted this photo on his  Twitter account a little bit earlier.  Now this is the one room that they  were given as you can by the collapsed curtain railing it looks like there  are still a few issues to be sorted out.</p><p>Now the International Olympic Committee has urged organizers to get their  act together and make sure that all accommodations are ready for the  guests.</p><p>Now meanwhile in Indonesia, our rescuers have resumed their search and  recovery efforts.  They are looking for the victims of a deadly volacno.   At least 15 people were killed when hot ash raced down the slopes of Mount  Sinabung covering a nearby village.</p><p>Saima Mohsin reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAIMA MOHSIN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPNDENT:  Search and rescue teams are  patrolling the three mile radius around Mount Sinabung searching for any  survivors or people who might have come back to dangerous exclusion zone.   We're right on the outskirts of it.  This whole village completely  deserted, a ghost village.  It's eerily quiet and absolutely everywhere  there is ash all over everything.</p><p>Take a look at this, there's a crop of tomatoes here completely caked in  the ash.  And everywhere, when a breeze blows or there's a gust of wind it  lists up.  I can taste the ash in my mouth.  I can feel it all over my  skin.</p><p>[08:10:00]</p><p>This group of houses completely collapsed under the weight of the ash when  it fell.  And if you take a look at it, it's incredibly thick, really dense  on top of this structure.  </p><p>30,000 people have forced to flee their homes.  It's not know when they'll  be able to come back because this volcano is still active.</p><p>With 129 active volcanoes across Indonesia, the Indonesian people and  government have had to learn to cope with and prepare for disasters like  this.  The National Disaster Mitigation Authority has now added 19 more  volcanoes up the threat level from normal to alert.  Add that to three  others last year on high alert and this, Mount Sinabung, an active volcano  on the highest threat level of all under dangerous.</p><p>Saima Mohsin, CNN, Mount Sinabung, Indonesia.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Now the latest trial of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy  has been postponed again.  Now according to the state owned Nile TV, the  case will resume on Wednesday.</p><p>The ousted leader and 14 others are accused of inciting murder in the  deaths of opposition protesters in 2012.  In all, Morsy is facing four  separate trials.  </p><p>He and his Muslim Brotherhood supporters have called the charges a shame.</p><p>Now this is News Stream and there's plenty more coming up this hour.  We  get an update on the fierce winter weather sweeping across the U.S. yet  again.  It's affecting millions of residents and it's disrupting thousands  of flights.</p><p>And more on Philip Seymour Hoffman's final hours.  Authorities are trying  to find out where the actor bought the drugs that apparently killed him.  </p><p>And it has amassed millions of friends during its decade online.  And now  Facebook turns 10-years-old.  Well find out Mark Zuckerberg's code to  success for the social network.  Stick around.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Now Broadway has announced plans to honor the celebrated actor  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Now the theaters will dim their lights on  Wednesday in tribute.</p><p>Now Hoffman was found dead inside his New York apartment on Sunday from a  suspected heroin overdose.  And authorities are still piecing together his  final hours.</p><p>Now law enforcement sources say that they are trying to find out where  Hoffman bought the drugs and if anyone was with him when he died.</p><p>Now the medical examiner's office tells that Hoffman's autopsy is still  ongoing.  It has not released any results yet.</p><p>Now the actor's death is already focusing attention on what authorities say  is an alarming trend when it comes to drug use in the U.S.  Brian Todd has  more on that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There were close to 50 envelopes in his  apartment believed to contain heroin, according to law enforcement sources,  along with more than 20 syringes.  If he did overdose on heroin, Philip  Seymour Hoffman's final hours reflect what U.S. officials say is a menacing  tide.</p><p>JAMES CAPRA, U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION:  We have an explosion in  heroin use in this country.</p><p>TODD:  In a 2002 survey, according to the government 166,000 Americans said  they've used heroin in the past month.  Now...</p><p>ADMIRAL PETER DELANY, SUBSTANCE ABUSE &amp; MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ADMIN:  About  333,000 people are using it every month.</p><p>TODD:  Heroin overdose deaths in the U.S. went up 45 percent between 2006  and 2010 according to the CDC.</p><p>[08:15:02]</p><p>One big reason for the rise in use?  The nationwide crackdown on  prescription pill abuse.  Those drugs are now harder to get and more  expensive than heroin.</p><p>CAPRA:  On the street, if it's going to cost you $80 to get a pill, some  opiate type of pharmaceutical drug, versus $10 for a bag of heroin, that's  what we see.</p><p>TODD:  The highs from prescription drugs and heroin can be similar.</p><p>DELANY:  It has a similar long-term effect of mellowing people out and of  kind of numbing them.</p><p>TODD:  Though heroin tends to give people that high in a quicker rush.</p><p>DEA officials and other experts say going from prescription drugs to heroin  is especially dangerous, because unlike prescription drugs, heroin doses  are very inconsistent and can sometimes be laced with deadly additives.</p><p>Last month, at least 22 people in western Pennsylvania died after using  heroin that had been mixed with fentanyl, a narcotic sometimes used to  treat pain in cancer patients.</p><p>This young man named Andrew was almost one of them. </p><p>ANDREW, RECOVERING HEROIN ADDICT:  I just finished doing, you know, the  heroin, and I walked into the bathroom and I just woke up on the ground.</p><p>TODD:  Experts say fentanyl is mixed with heroin to enhance the high. It  only takes a small amount of fentanyl to get you hooked or to kill.</p><p>CAPRA:  It's done in terms of micro-grams.  It's so tiny.</p><p>TODD:  And if you mix any of that with heroin, what happens?</p><p>CAPRA:  It's hard to dilute it, so the heroin-user has no idea what they're  getting, and they put that into their arm, laced with fentanyl and it's a  deadly, it's what we call hot-shots.</p><p>TODD:  The DEA's James Capra says police are telling them that it's not  untypical to see a user whose injected fentanyl with heroin dead with the  needle still in their arm. It can kill you that quickly.</p><p>Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Now just ahead, it looks like the U.S. is in store for another  major winter storm.  The northeast is bracing for more snow and more ice  and more travel delays.</p><p>[08:17:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[08:20:40]</p><p>LU STOUT:  Coming to you live from Hong Kong, you're back watching News  Stream.  And this is a visual version of all the stories we've got in the  show today.</p><p>Now we started with the countdown to the winter games in Sochi.  And now to  another winter landscape.  But millions of people in the U.S. are probably  sick of the sight of snow.  Once again, the Midwest and the northeast are  getting socked.</p><p>Now in New York City the mayor says it is coming down faster than the city  can plow it.</p><p>Our Chad Myers is there.  He joins me now live.  And Chad, I read it's up  to 10 inches of snow in some areas.  What does it look like where you are?</p><p>CHAD MYERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  We had about six-and-a-half as of 6:00 last  night.  It snowed some more.  And so now we're up to eight.  And that eight  inches would also have been right at the stadium that the Super Bowl was  played the day before exactly 24 hours later there was eight inches of snow  on the field that they would have had to shovel off or play in or whatever.   So it would have been a snow bowl.</p><p>This is only the first storm, though, of two more to come.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MYERS (voice-over): Millions along the east coast this morning are digging  out of Monday's record breaking snowstorm.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Snow is coming down faster than we can plow it.</p><p>MYERS: The winter storm transforming New York's Central Park into a winter  wonderland in just hours setting a new daily record of 8 inches.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think I'm ready for the summer.</p><p>MYERS: For thousands of travelers heading home from Sunday Super Bowl, the  airports were anything, but a wonderland and more than 2,000 flights  canceled on Monday due to the storm.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are trying to Chicago, our flights a couple hours  delayed. We're just hoping it will actually take off.</p><p>MYERS: Parts of New Jersey pummeled with 9 inches forcing Governor Christie  to issue a state of emergency, some blaming the Super Bowl for the  inability to battle the snow. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The local municipalities and the counties have been  struggling to get it.</p><p>MYERS:  The new winter storm will pack a one-two punch tonight and into  Wednesday with heavy snow and ice forecast in more than two dozens states.   Kansas City bracing for 10 inches of snow.</p><p>MARK THIEL, ASST. PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR, LAWRENCE, KANSAS:  We're expecting  this event to be pretty traumatic in terms of the amount of snowfall during  rush hour in the morning and then again during rush hour later in the  evening.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MYERS:  So here is the deal: we get more snow tonight, probably four to six  inches, then it changes over to sleet and freezing rain by morning.  People  are already canceling plans for tomorrow and tomorrow is number two,  there's more to come after that -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Oh, that's just incredible.</p><p>You know, international viewers, international travelers are watching the  situation with a lot of interest as well.  Give us the travel advisory.  I  mean, how many flights have been canceled so far?</p><p>MYERS:  Canceled, 2,000 flights yesterday.  Now you think about that at  about 120 people per plane, do the multiplication, you have a lot of people  that didn't get to where they wanted to be, almost a quarter of a million  seats that didn't fly yesterday, 500 planes have already been canceled  today mainly out of Chicago because of the storm is going to be there, but  500 times 100 people all of a sudden you have --  I mean, you are talking  about major disruptions here.</p><p>But the big problem is going to be it's what called the nor'easter.  The  low pressure that comes out of the west is going to combine with the  relatively warm air that's in the Atlantic Ocean about 45 degrees.  That is  going to bomb a storm, that's going to make almost hurricane force winds  and still will make very heavy snow, as much as a meter of snow in some of  the big cities across the northeast with winds of 60.  That happens on  Monday.</p><p>I don't believe there will be any travel in or out of the northeast, and  that's where most international planes come, whether you're Boston, New  York, Philadelphia, all those international airports I believe will be  almost shut down on Monday because of that big storm that's coming,  Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Thank you very much indeed for that warning.</p><p>Chad Myers across all the icy conditions, the latest on that as well as the  science behind this epic snow storm.  Chad, thank you.</p><p>Now let's get more now on this huge snow storm across the U.S.  My  colleague Mari Ramos joins me from the World Weather Center with that --  Mari.</p><p>[08:25:00]</p><p>MARI RAMOS, CNN WEATHER CORRESPONDENT:  That's quite a warning from Chad  there.  I mean, my eyes were like this big listening to him.  That's for  next Monday.  We still have to get through the storms that are happening  right now.  And great reporting there from Chad.</p><p>When you look at what's coming up next, this is what we can expect over the  next couple of days.  So today is, what, Tuesday here so this is for  Wednesday in particular.  Becuase of snow, as you saw from Chad's live  shot, it stopped snowing right now in New York City.  So that's a little  bit of good news there.</p><p>But an additional 11 centimeters expected.  Upstate New York could have  even more than that.  Boston could have 28 centimeters of snow.  And even  though today the cancellations are about 500, 600 cancellations compared to  the 2,000 yesterday, today is a better flying day in a way across the  northeast.  That's going to change again as we head to tomorrow.  And then  as we heard from Chad as we head into the beginning of next week.</p><p>Now, as far as the states right now that have those winter storm advisories  or warnings or any kind of winter weather related problems, if you look  over here it stretches anywhere from the northeast all the way back over  there toward even areas to the west and as far south as Texas.  So that's  about 32 states that have some sort of an advisory or warning.  So this is  pretty widespread.</p><p>Areas being impacted right now -- and most of the cancellations that  we've seen today are actually up in the Chicago area.  But also affecting  areas of the Midwest and this is why.  You can see the storm system  beginning to come in right in through here and this is the one that will  continue moving in to the northeast as we head through the day tomorrow.</p><p>So, let's head to the other side of the Atlantic, you know, again here we  have yet another storm system coming through.  Not a lot of snow, but  definitely a lot of wind and a lot of rain for the UK and Ireland and  western parts of France, even Portugal and Spain getting in on the action  with very high waves over the weekend.  Remember that.  And even yesterday.</p><p>Temperatures are relatively mild on this side, but relatively colder as we  head farther to the east, but not as cold, though, as they had been before.   So a lot of you that were getting snow are going to get rain this time  around if we get to see a little bit more of this moisture make its way  across into eastern parts of Europe here.</p><p>And you can see more rain across Italy, the swollen rivers across Tuscany  and as we head down even into Rome, the Tiber very high again today because  of all of the rain that happened over the last couple of days will be  continuing to drain down from the mountains there.</p><p>And then back over here, this is our next weather system coming in across  the west.  Unfortunately that one will bring us more rain to already  waterlogged areas and very dangerous waves, more coastal flooding expected.   And that rain could be heavy at times for you guys in France, Portugal,  Spain, the UK and even into Ireland.  More snow across the Alpine region.</p><p>And look at this picture, this is from Sochi.  We've been talking quite a  bit, of course, as we head into the Olympic Games.  Not a lot of snow.   Temperatures have actually been again slightly above the average for this  time of year.  Over the next couple of days sunny skies expected.  And  partly cloudy as we head into Friday, but nothing in the way of significant  precipitation.</p><p>So, I guess good travel days for people that are headed that way.</p><p>Average high this time of year is 10, the average low is 3.  And they  usually get about 135 millimeters of either rain or snow, depending on  where you are and usually snow it's only about six days that they get snow  during the month of February.  The number of days with snow on the ground  is about four.  Of course that changes as we head into some of those  highest elevations. </p><p>And last but not least, very heavy snowfall in Iran, some of the heaviest  that they've seen in quite a long time, almost 90 centimeters of snow.</p><p>Back to you, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yeah, heavy snowfall in Iran, but as for Sochi not quite looking  like the winter wonderland just yet.  Fingers crossed for the athletes.</p><p>Mari Ramos there.  Thank you.</p><p>Now you are watching News Stream.  And up next, Facebook has come a long  way since its start in a Harvard dorm room.  As the social network  celebrates a decade, we ask what the next 10 years will bring.</p><p>Plus...</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The technology sees around corners, over hills and  through other vehicles.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Incredible technology that could save thousands of lives.</p><p>[08:28:55]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[08:31:12]</p><p>LU STOUT:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong.  You're watching News Stream.   And these are your world headlines.</p><p>Now Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Sochi as the Black Sea city  prepares for the opening of the Winter Olympics on Friday.  And Mr. Putin  is attending IOC events, but as athletes also begin to arrive organizers  are facing criticism over a number of hotel rooms that are not yet ready  for visitors and some journalists.</p><p>Now investors are waiting for the opening of the U.S. markets after  selloffs around the world.  And here is how the main indexes in Europe are  doing.  Meanwhile in Asia, Japan's NIKKEI lead the losses, closing down  more than 4 percent off concerns about U.S. growth and stimulus plus the  strength of emerging markets have all contributed to the falls.</p><p>Now search and recovery teams in Indonesia have been looking for victims  after Saturday's eruption of Mount Sinabung volcano.  15 people are known  dead after the vocano spewed scalding ash engulfing a nearby village.   About 30,000 people have been evacuated from the area.</p><p>The World Health Organization says that there were 14 million new cancer  cases in 2012.  And within two decades that number is set to soar to 22  million.  Developing countries are expected to see the biggest increases.</p><p>Now if you are like a lot of people, you've probably used Facebook at some  point today, but 10 years ago only students at Harvard University could use  The Facebook.  It all started in founder Mark Zuckerberg's dorm room on  February 4, 2004.  And he posted this note on Facebook of course to mark  his company's 10 year anniversary.</p><p>And reflecting on Facebook's success, he said this, quote, \"we just cared  more about connecting the world than anyone else and we still do today.\"</p><p>Now Facebook counts more than 1.2 billion monthly active users.  And  according to Alexa (ph) is the second most popular website in the world  just after Google.</p><p>Now earlier I spoke to David Kirkpatrick, he's the author \"The Facebook  Effect.\"  He calls his book the only journalistic history of the company.   And he gained privileged access to write it.</p><p>I asked him to explain Zuckerberg's role in Facebook's success.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, AUTHOR:  Well, you know, there are so few leaders in  business that are true visionaries.  I think in technology we can name Bill  Gates, Steve Jobs, maybe Larry Ellison, Andy Grove, one or two others.   Zuckerberg belongs in that group.  He is an extraordinary long-term  thinker.  And I really believe that's one of the reasons Facebook has done  so well.  He continues to make really long-term bet.</p><p>LU STOUT:  You also point out that even though Facebook is a social media  company, it is at heart a tech company.  How has that been a factor for its  success?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Well, if you look back at the early days, you know, there  were earlier social networks that were quite sizable when Facebook came  along.  There was MySpace and Friendster in particular.  Both of them got  very large and essentially collapsed under their own weight because they  just couldn't manage their own tech, because they basically thought of  themselves as cool places for people to hook up, you know.</p><p>But unfortunately that led to their demise.</p><p>Zuckerberg, on the other hand, an engineer, a guy who always thought about  the programming side of things and product development looked at Facebook  from the beginning as a constantly improving technology product.  That  allowed it to grow with much more seamless functionality and to really beat  everybody else.</p><p>LU STOUT:  You know, there's Mark Zuckerberg, but there's also Cheryl  Sandberg.  How key has she been to the kind of performance we've seen from  Facebook?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Well, Cheryl Sandberg is an astonishingly important person in  the history of Facebook.  </p><p>[08:35:00]</p><p>You know, she came in in the spring of 2008 when they really didn't even  know what business they were in.  In my book \"The Facebook Effect,\" I  describe that for the first months she was there all she did was have  meetings that were titled \"what business are we in?\"  They kept asking  themselves this question over and over again.  And they figured out it was  advertising.  She set about to implement that strategy.  Here we are a few  years later the company is 1.23 billion people around the world dominating  increasingly in mobile advertising, just had a quarter last week that was  incredibly positive.  Stock is skyrocketing.  She gets a lot of the credit.</p><p>Zuckerberg is the tech visionary, she is the business visionary.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Now I have to ask you about privacy.  How has Facebook handled  privacy the last 10 years?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Well, over the last 10 years you know you might say Facebook  has handled privacy intermittently well.  I think actually they've made a  lot of mistakes in the way they've changed their service unexpectedly and  communicated it poorly to their users.  But one thing many people forget is  that Facebook was fundamentally founded on an idea of privacy in a way that  no internet company had ever done before.</p><p>Before Facebook came along, all you used on the Internet was your handle.   You would never put your email address or your cellphone number online.   Facebook gave people the confidence that they could do things like that,  because it gave them control over who saw their data.  That is the  fundamental form of privacy that Facebook offers you, who you have as your  friends, because your friends see everything about you.</p><p>But I don't think Facebook has explained that properly.  I think even  though their heritage is one of privacy, they've often strayed away from  that in their effort to try to get more page views, to turn themselves  commercial in ways that sometimes were a little clumsy.  But, you know,  that was before Sandberg arrived by the way.</p><p>But anyway, I think, you know, we're going to continue to see this being a  fraught topic for Facebook despite Zuckerberg's commitment that he is  building a service that honors privacy, because there is so much personal  information there, it makes us all nervous.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Now you met Mark Zuckerberg for the first time back in 2006.   And you've said in that meeting you got a sense, and he was just in his  early to mid-20s at the time, that he was a leader.</p><p>How did you get that sense?  What is it that he said?  What did he do?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  It was funny.  I was sitting at a restaurant in midtown  Manhattan.  This is September 2006 when Facebook was two-and-a-half years  old and Zuckerberg was 22.  And he walked in.  And I said to myself, oh,  I'm wasting my time, this guy is so young.  He's like a baby.  Why am I  bothering?</p><p>You know, I had just done it because a PR person suggested it and I  thought, oh, Facebook is kind of cool.  But then he opened his mouth and I  started listening to the things he said.  And they were so extraordinarily  big picture -- like I said earlier, long-term visionary, confident.  I  realized I had seldom heard anyone with such a big picture, positive long- term view about what he was engaged in and it made me confident that he was  going to have an extraordinary success.  I started covering Facebook very  closely forever after.  And it led to me writing a book a year-and-a-half  later and the rest is history.  Zuckerberg has proven to be as  extraordinary as I thought he might be.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Love that Zuckerberg flashback there. And that was David Kirkpatrick speaking to me earlier.</p><p>Now Zuckerberg has not been shy about his ambitions for Facebook.  He wants  it to be your interface for the rest of the internet.</p><p>And CNN's Laurie Segall joins us live from Facebook headquarters in Menlo  Park, California.  And Laurie, we've talked about the last 10 years, let's  look at the future, what's next for Facebook?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  This is a big birthday for  Facebook.  And it's so interesting, Kristie, you hear David Kirkpatrick  talk about how young Mark Zuckerberg was.  I actually -- I spoke to Chris  Cox who is at Facebook for the last eight years and everybody was so young  back in the day, which makes 10 years later that just makes this a huge  landmark.</p><p>And what Chris Cox said, and he's the head of product at Facebook, he's  really a visionary behind what we see and what we will see in the future.  He gave me a bit of a look at the rocky history and some of those moments  that kind of came to define Facebook and also what we can look for in the  next 10 years.  Check it out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRIS COX, VICE PRESIDENT OF PRODUCT, FACEBOOK: And the big question was,  is this something that could work outside of college? And everybody said  no, it's probably not going to work outside of college. </p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: In honor of Facebook's ten- year anniversary, we decided to take a walk down memory lane. Do you have  some of those stories where you thought, my God, I believe we got through  that? </p><p>COX: I mean, the news feed launch was pretty crazy. I spent, with a bunch  of people, we worked really hard on making news feed. It took us almost a  year to build. And we were pretty naive around how it would be received.  Obviously, people were like, this is a lot of change. And there was like a  protest organizing outside, so we had to, like, go out the back entrance. </p><p>SEGALL: You had to go out the back? </p><p>COX: Yes. And it was just one of those things I look back on right now and  it's hard to believe. </p><p>MEREDITH CHIN, FACEBOOK: Since then, there have been a lot of landmarks  that are hard to believe. Six billion likes per day, 7.8 trillion messages  sent using Facebook, and 1.2 billion monthly active users. </p><p>[08:39:54]</p><p>It's a far cry from their early days. There were no chairs, no tables. They  had to find like a bean bag chair. The kid interviewing me who is now a  good friend, but he had bare feet. I was like what am I getting myself  into? </p><p>SEGALL: Over the past ten years, Facebook moved from this small office, to  here and here and now to this sprawling campus here in Menlo Park. </p><p>When we talk about the future of Facebook, the word we keep hearing is  mobile. When did you guys know mobile is going to be big and what is the  future look like when it comes to mobile and Facebook? </p><p>COX: It really happen a couple of years ago. We sort of instituted all of  these rules in the company, like whenever we show our product to each  other, we need to start with mobile version. </p><p>SEGALL: But the future of Facebook may look different. Alongside the  traditional lap on your phone, you might start seeing a variety of apps  created by the company. </p><p>COX: We already have Facebook. We have Instagram messenger. We just  announced paper, which is a more immersive way at looking at your news  feed. </p><p>SEGALL: Paper, Facebook's latest app, straight to your news feed based on  your interest. But a challenge for the company will be continuing to grow  at such a rapid pace. They are starting to saturate the internet-connected  world. </p><p>COX: When you just look out over the next three years, there's going to be  a lot more people with their first computer and first phone and their first  access to the internet. And one of the things that we're really excited  about is making the access to the internet in general a lot more  affordable. </p><p>SEGALL: It will be a challenge and not Facebook's only challenge. The  company now competes with ample of apps like Snapchat and Twitter. </p><p>What do you look forward to for the company? </p><p>CHIN: I think it's the next billion. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL:  And Kristie, you know, getting to that next billion that a whole  other question because they've got to get people access to the Internet.   They already have over a billion people using this service.</p><p>Now I also spoke to Chris about the idea of artificial intelligence,  because there's a group at Facebook -- now he didn't give me too many  details, but there's a small group at Facebook working on the idea of  artificial intelligence.  A lot of big companies like Google investing in  this.  And how to you make your service even smarter?  How do you learn  what we're doing and learn it even better -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  So artificial intelligence and stand alone apps, two big shifts  in Facebook to come in the next 10 years.</p><p>Laurie Segall joining us live from Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park,  California, thank you.</p><p>Now Facebook and other big tech firms they are shedding light on the secret  data requests they receive from the U.S. government on national security  matters.  But the companies are permitted only to release ranges rather  than precise numbers.</p><p>Now Yahoo received requests for information for more than 30,000 accounts.   That was the most.  LinkedIn received the fewest with requests targeted  less than 250 accounts.  But they can't discuss details of the requests or  the identities of the users involved.</p><p>Now the NSA is often said to only collect metadata from users.  But let me  just explain what metadata means.  Now here is a fake email that we've  created for this example.  Now metadata is the contextual information  around this email, but not the message body itself.  So in this fictional  example, reading metadata means you only be able to see this information  here, not the actual email itself.</p><p>But it's worth pointing out that this, it's still a lot of information, you  can see who someone is communicating with and the subject line can also  reveal what is being discussed.</p><p>Now in the United States car crashes kill tens of thousands of people each  and every year, but what if your car could help you avoid potential dangers  on the road?  Rene Marsh reports on a new technology that could save lives.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RENE MARSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It's the vehicle of the future -- cars that  talk to the driver and each other.</p><p>The federal government wants it on the road soon, pushing for technology  that would warn drivers of danger coming from any direction.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Coming along, the light is green, everything looks --  and all of a sudden we get that warning that says, you know, look out.</p><p>MARSH:  It's called vehicle-to-vehicle technology.  Cars would send  wireless messages to each other within about a 300 yard radius  communicating information like speed, direction and GPS position ten times  per second.</p><p>ANTHONY FOXX, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY:  When cars share this  information, they can account for all the vehicles around them, which means  they're able to identify possible crashes.</p><p>MARSH:  The technology sees around corners, over hills and through other  vehicles.  So let's just say five cars ahead of me the driver slams on the  breaks, well that car sends my car a message giving me enough time to  react.</p><p>33,000 Americans are killed and 2.3 million injured in car crashes every  year.  The Department of Transportation predicts talking cars could prevent  up to 80 percent of crashes involving sober drivers.</p><p>[08:45:00]</p><p>Five major car companies have been working with DOT on developing and  testing the technology.  3,000 cars in Ann Arbor, Michigan are already  using it as part of a government pilot test.</p><p>Some time after 2016, the federal government hopes your car will be able to  communicate with you.</p><p>Well, the DOT hopes to propose the rule by 2016, but it will still need the  public to weigh in before anything is finalized.  The bottom line is it's a  lengthy process to get something like this mandated.</p><p>Now as for privacy, the government says that data sent between cars does  not record personal information.  So your privacy should not be  compromised.</p><p>Rene Marsh, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Up next here on News Stream, just what is going on in London's  Underground?

In this week's Leading Woman talks about the unique  challenges of her position with our Poppy Harlow.  And she gives insight  into how the firm weathered the global financial crisis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Edith Cooper is one of the top ranking  women at investment banking firm Goldman Sachs.</p><p>EDITH COOPER, GOLDMAN SACHS:  Just want to make sure we're connecting all  of those dots.  If you had asked me 30 years ago would I be on the managing  committee at Goldman Sachs and be the influencer of our success of our  people, oh no way.</p><p>I think that, you know, I've come to expect the unexpected.</p><p>HARLOW:  As Goldman's head of human capital management, Cooper isn't just  one of the top women, she's one of the top executives in the 30,000 member  firm.</p><p>COOPER:  When asked the question at an event earlier do you want to be a  CEO, of course, of course.  You know, I'm young.</p><p>My career path is not necessarily a clear straight line.</p><p>HARLOW:  She's one of just four women on Goldman's 29 member executive  committee.</p><p>Does that number need to go up?</p><p>COOPER:  Of course it does.  I believe that we can't be the great firm that  we need to be to be relevant to our clients if we don't have diversity at  every level.</p><p>HARLOW:  You are a rare woman in this position and even more rare because  you're African-American.</p><p>COOPER:  At times, it's been difficult.  It is different for me as an  African-American woman than it would be for a white male.  I mean, that's  just a fact.  There's difficulty with respect to the subconscious bias that  exists in life.</p><p>HARLOW:  It was a move to London, Cooper says, that was critical for her  rise at the firm.</p><p>COOPER:  I think in today's economy, operating outside of your comfort zone  is really, really important.</p><p>When I arrived in Europe, I realized it wasn't the difference of being, you  know, African-American it was the difference of being an American, an  American.  And the tools that I used to lead and to manage in the United  States really were not as effective operating with people from all over the  world.  It was quite an extraordinary experience.</p><p>HARLOW:  But Cooper returned to New York with one of her greatest  challenges ahead during the most recent financial crisis.</p><p>COOPER:  Reputationally, Goldman Sachs was really targeted as a company  that was at the center of gravity, a lot of the difficulties that existed  in the financial markets.</p><p>HARLOW:  Critics were saying you were betting against your clients.  They  were questioning the size bonuses handed out.  How did you deal with that  criticism?</p><p>COOPER:  The most difficult thing at the time was that what people thought  about Goldman Sachs was not in sync with who we knew we were.</p><p>[08:50:05]</p><p>HARLOW:  What do you think people would be most surprised to learn about  you?</p><p>COOPER:  I'm very tough.  I'm very resilient.  And the minute I think that  someone believes that I can't I do.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Stay with us.  And after the break, we go deep below London's  Underground train lines.  A dark tunnel is home to a blooming business.  We  take a look at a novel solution to soaring rental prices and the demand for  ecofriendly food.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT:  An imminent human disaster spreading across the globe -- that's  how the World Health Organization is describing the cancer threat in the  coming decades.  It says new cases are set to rise by a staggering 70  percent in the next 20 years.  And despite advances in medical care, the  report predicts that there will be 22 million new cancer cases in 2034, 13  million people each year will be killed by the disease.  And researchers  say that the high cost of treating cancer is affecting the economies of  richer countries.  And it says developing nations are not equipped to deal  with the crisis.</p><p>Now the report says about half of all cancers could be avoided, but smoking  rates need to be cut.  Lung cancer is still the deadliest.</p><p>And the report calls for better public health campaigns to promote  prevention.</p><p>Now one of the authors spoke to CNN a little bit earlier about the study.   And what we can all do to help.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNARD STEWART, CO-EDITOR OF WORLD CANCER REPORT 2014:  People giving up  smoking is not just a matter of their individual choice, they're supported  in that decision by restrictions on advertising, by the non-availability of  the product to certain people such as children, by the price that  discourages the buying of cigarettes and by the lack of advertising.</p><p>Now we can't necessarily apply all of those things to every known healthy  choice, but we can in different societies as the case is made opt for  support from government through regulation for people to make the healthy  choice.</p><p>Now in respect of the involuntary exposures, those things that you  literally can't avoid, the state of the air you breathe, as you point out,  in many Asian cities is appalling and definitively associated with an  increase risk of cancer.</p><p>Lung cancer from that cause is only a small proportion of lung cancer from  cigarettes, but it's still a real problem.  and that is the responsibility  of government.  Communities deserve protection for recognized causes of  cancer, particularly lung cancer, and action should and can be taken to  reduce that risk, particularly has been demonstrated in the success  achieved in American cities in reducing the burden of pollution.</p><p>So that model can serve as a vehicle for other cities, particularly in  China, for example, to achieve the same level of protection for their  citizens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  And that was one of the editor of the World Cancer Report,  Professor Bernard Stewart.</p><p>Now health experts say that our diet can play a role in disease prevention.  </p><p>[08:55:56]</p><p>And in London, one business has found a unique way to grow ecofriendly food  right in the heart of the city.</p><p>Isa Soares has that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It's another gray morning in  South London and as commuters make their way to work, something deep below  ground is growing.</p><p>But little do they know that 33 meters below their seat in a World War II  bunker, a unique horticultural endeavor is underway.</p><p>Here in the dark, damp, rusty tunnels of London with a constant temperature  of 16 degrees an innovative farming experiment is raising shoots.</p><p>RICHARD BALLARD, FOUNDER:  Having a stable environment we can create a  perfect environment for the plant.  So -- and we can grow to a certain time  from seven days to 21 days and we can produce a crop and deliver directly  into the market, which is just half a kilometer down the road.</p><p>SOARES:  The project is being backed by Michelin starred chief Michel Roux  Jr.  He tells me this is modern farming in Britian -- underground and no  need for a trowel.</p><p>These herbs?</p><p>MICHEL ROUX, CHEF:  No, these are pea shoots as well.</p><p>SOARES:  Oh, they're pea shoots as well.</p><p>ROUX:  These are fully mature.  So they have -- you know, you bite into  them and they have that wonderful pea taste if you want to have a little --  and they look great and they really do look great.</p><p>SOARES: Where do you get the water from?</p><p>ROUX:  The water is -- the water at the moment is just filtered water that  we're using, but we're hoping -- we're hoping that we should be able to  collect rain water and filter that and various other things that will help  us to be as organic as we can.</p><p>And it's good for the environment.</p><p>SOARES:  There's so much rain at the moment, you're not shoot of water, I  can tell you that much.</p><p>For the time being, they have one tunnel with two-and-a-half acres of  space.

And welcome to News Stream where news and technology meet. Now days ahead of the Winter Games in Sochi, we take a closer look at the threat posed by Russia's black widows. Now rescue efforts are continuing around Indonesia's Mount Sinabung after at least 15 people were killed by the erupting volcano. And on Facebook's 10th birthday, we'll look at what's next for the world's biggest social media site. </p><p>Now athletes are streaming into Sochi as the city gets ready to kick off the Winter Games in just three days time. Now the Russian President Vladimir Putin is also there to attend several IOC events. Now he has staked his reputation on the games and is keen to see them go off without a hitch. But there are concerns that the city may not be quite ready with a rush to get some hotel rooms open for business and security concerns still loom large. Now militants from the volatile Northern Caucuses region have threatened the games. And our senior international correspondent Nick Paton Walsh has uncovered a disturbing new trend among the so-called Black Widows. He joins us now live from Sochi. And Nick, what are the security preparations in light of recent threats there? NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, in fact in the last 20 minutes or so we saw a new level of security here, three helicopters circling the Olympic venue. Now that may be some sort of an indication that Vladimir Putin, who arrived in the last few hours is heading towards the sort of center of the ring of steel around these games. But at the heart of the threat we've been hearing are the suggestion that perhaps suicide bombers have focused their sights on Sochi and behind those women often is a new radicalized ideology. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH: Medina Alyeva (ph) wanted to die the way both of her husbands had: in jihad. \"This is jihad. It's the highest thing in the world,\" she said in this address before she died, \"who fulfilled promises better than Allah. So many men are just talk and spend their time in cinemas or playing video games.\" Medina (ph) blew herself up in May last year near the police headquarters in Dagestan with over a dozen injured, ending her embrace of radicalism. Both her husbands were killed by special forces in sieges like this, the first when she was just 21. This similar siege her second husband and several other militants were also shot dead. Here she is, filmed by police coming out of the house. Medina (ph), experts worry, is part of a new kind of so-called Black Widow female suicide bomber in Russia who don't, like in the past, decide to die out of grief and vengeance for a loved one. Instead, these women in the past few years married jihadis and seek martyrdom on their own, these women in the past few years married jihadis and seek martyrdom on their own as it seems fashionable. KATYA SOKIRIANSKAYA, INTERNATIONAL CRISIS GROUP: It is a trend also. They have their own slang. These young women, they oftentimes want to die because they want to die. I have seen these women after their husband had been just killed or there were funerals and they don't mourn them. They congratulate each other. WALSH: Medina's (ph) mother Patoum (ph) in her first interview with Medina's (ph) sister and orphan by her side says police had ordered her daughter to see a psychologist and three days before she died Medina (ph) vanished. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): She's probably in heaven. I saw her in my sleep. She was there with my grandparents. They were all together in beautiful white clothes smiling. She told me how great it was there. WALSH: Medina's (ph) son thinks mom is coming home. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): He's always picking up photos of her saying mother is coming soon. WALSH: But she isn't. And, with police putting up these wanted posters we saw across the region. It's clear they think Medina (ph) is not alone in seeking a nihilistic end to her life that takes many others with her. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALSH: Now Moscow has made it clear they believe the games will be safe. Barack Obama has said he thinks it'll be safe for Americans to come here, but still that threat, that security issue hangs over these games simply because of the fact they're at the western edge southern Russia, a region volatile for decades. &lt;08:04:57 Today, another example Austrian press agency saying that there has been a letter received, which perhaps originated from Russia that threatens two Austrian athletes with kidnap if they come here. Now that has, in some reports, been suggested as being a hoax. Still few details available. But really these -- these letters, these indications are doing nothing to lower anxiety levels around here, although I have to say this is a calm area behind me, apart from these helicopters circling, a calm area behind me that seems to be getting ready for the games ahead -- Kristie. LU STOUT: Yeah, yeah. And regards to that Austrian security threat, hoax or not, very worrying development. And in the face of all these threats, Nick, I mean just how prepared is Russia to truly secure and safeguard these games? WALSH: This has been a year's long operation for the Russians. They've been pressing on various militant hotspots across southern Russia for a long time, since they knew this was coming using all resources at their disposal, many of them heavy-handed -- blunt instruments. But the finer point has been the ring of steel they put around here, a lot of that high tech. There are two blimps, they're known as, security camera devices held up by hot air balloons, cameras everywhere, but above all 37,000 Russian police and security officers coming here to secure the games. That, in many ways, is the big card Moscow is playing, the sheer manpower resources they're throwing at this. But of course one problem with Russian police as many Russians know is their corruption, their ineptitude. So they could be holes for people to slip through. But I think most people believe the games themselves here, the area around them, will be secure. This will probably pass without incident. It's just that can't be said for all of southern Russia, particularly Dagestan of the far east of where I'm standing where, as I say, violence is a weekly occurrence as militants target police officers or those they consider loyal to the Russian federal government -- Kristie. LU STOUT: Nick Paton Walsh reporting live from Sochi. Thank you, Nick. Now a number of hotels in Sochi are still putting the finishing touches on the rooms even as the guests arrive. Now CNN's Amanda Davies and her crew arrived at their accommodations only to find that their rooms were not ready. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: So with all the stories doing around about hotels in Sochi not being finished we now get to experience it firsthand. We've just landed from Moscow about an hour ago now. We arrived at our Hotel, the Amiga (inaudible) Hotel where lots of media representatives are staying. And we've been told our rooms aren't ready. The actual phrase that's been used is that we are waiting for our rooms to be ready. While we've been sitting here for the last hour or so, there's been representatives of other media who have been going up to the desk saying that their rooms haven't been clean for a week and the radiators aren't working, there's no lou paper. I had a wander around outside. There's still plants being put in place in some places. There's one building you can hear the banging and construction still going on. We might be being a little bit unfair, I have to say. We haven't seen any evidence, but equally we haven't seen any rooms yet. So, an hour and counting. OK, so we've been here just over an hour-and-a-half. We've got one room, which we went to see. And to be fair it was quite decent. It was very new, the carpet obviously had just been laid. There were a few cables and wires hanging out. But there's three of us in our crew and crews need to stick together. The other two rooms weren't going to be ready today. So we've checked in to another hotel down the road, which has been ready. A big chain hotel has been ready for awhile. And we're going to come back hopefully with better luck tomorrow. (END VIDEOTAPE) LU STOUT: All right, good luck there. Now Amanda Davies' producer Harry Reiki (ph), he posted this photo on his Twitter account a little bit earlier. Now this is the one room that they were given as you can by the collapsed curtain railing it looks like there are still a few issues to be sorted out. Now the International Olympic Committee has urged organizers to get their act together and make sure that all accommodations are ready for the guests. Now meanwhile in Indonesia, our rescuers have resumed their search and recovery efforts. They are looking for the victims of a deadly volacno. At least 15 people were killed when hot ash raced down the slopes of Mount Sinabung covering a nearby village. Saima Mohsin reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAIMA MOHSIN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPNDENT: Search and rescue teams are patrolling the three mile radius around Mount Sinabung searching for any survivors or people who might have come back to dangerous exclusion zone. We're right on the outskirts of it. This whole village completely deserted, a ghost village. It's eerily quiet and absolutely everywhere there is ash all over everything. Take a look at this, there's a crop of tomatoes here completely caked in the ash. And everywhere, when a breeze blows or there's a gust of wind it lists up. I can taste the ash in my mouth. I can feel it all over my skin. &lt;08:10:00 This group of houses completely collapsed under the weight of the ash when it fell. And if you take a look at it, it's incredibly thick, really dense on top of this structure. 30,000 people have forced to flee their homes. It's not know when they'll be able to come back because this volcano is still active. With 129 active volcanoes across Indonesia, the Indonesian people and government have had to learn to cope with and prepare for disasters like this. The National Disaster Mitigation Authority has now added 19 more volcanoes up the threat level from normal to alert. Add that to three others last year on high alert and this, Mount Sinabung, an active volcano on the highest threat level of all under dangerous. Saima Mohsin, CNN, Mount Sinabung, Indonesia. (END VIDEOTAPE) LU STOUT: Now the latest trial of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy has been postponed again. Now according to the state owned Nile TV, the case will resume on Wednesday. The ousted leader and 14 others are accused of inciting murder in the deaths of opposition protesters in 2012. In all, Morsy is facing four separate trials. He and his Muslim Brotherhood supporters have called the charges a shame. Now this is News Stream and there's plenty more coming up this hour. We get an update on the fierce winter weather sweeping across the U.S. yet again. It's affecting millions of residents and it's disrupting thousands of flights. And more on Philip Seymour Hoffman's final hours. Authorities are trying to find out where the actor bought the drugs that apparently killed him. And it has amassed millions of friends during its decade online. And now Facebook turns 10-years-old. Well find out Mark Zuckerberg's code to success for the social network. Stick around. LU STOUT: Now Broadway has announced plans to honor the celebrated actor Philip Seymour Hoffman. Now the theaters will dim their lights on Wednesday in tribute. Now Hoffman was found dead inside his New York apartment on Sunday from a suspected heroin overdose. And authorities are still piecing together his final hours. Now law enforcement sources say that they are trying to find out where Hoffman bought the drugs and if anyone was with him when he died. Now the medical examiner's office tells that Hoffman's autopsy is still ongoing. It has not released any results yet. Now the actor's death is already focusing attention on what authorities say is an alarming trend when it comes to drug use in the U.S. Brian Todd has more on that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There were close to 50 envelopes in his apartment believed to contain heroin, according to law enforcement sources, along with more than 20 syringes. If he did overdose on heroin, Philip Seymour Hoffman's final hours reflect what U.S. officials say is a menacing tide. JAMES CAPRA, U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION: We have an explosion in heroin use in this country. TODD: In a 2002 survey, according to the government 166,000 Americans said they've used heroin in the past month. Now... ADMIRAL PETER DELANY, SUBSTANCE ABUSE &amp; MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ADMIN: About 333,000 people are using it every month. TODD: Heroin overdose deaths in the U.S. went up 45 percent between 2006 and 2010 according to the CDC. &lt;08:15:02 One big reason for the rise in use? The nationwide crackdown on prescription pill abuse. Those drugs are now harder to get and more expensive than heroin. CAPRA: On the street, if it's going to cost you $80 to get a pill, some opiate type of pharmaceutical drug, versus $10 for a bag of heroin, that's what we see. TODD: The highs from prescription drugs and heroin can be similar. DELANY: It has a similar long-term effect of mellowing people out and of kind of numbing them. TODD: Though heroin tends to give people that high in a quicker rush. DEA officials and other experts say going from prescription drugs to heroin is especially dangerous, because unlike prescription drugs, heroin doses are very inconsistent and can sometimes be laced with deadly additives. Last month, at least 22 people in western Pennsylvania died after using heroin that had been mixed with fentanyl, a narcotic sometimes used to treat pain in cancer patients. This young man named Andrew was almost one of them. ANDREW, RECOVERING HEROIN ADDICT: I just finished doing, you know, the heroin, and I walked into the bathroom and I just woke up on the ground. TODD: Experts say fentanyl is mixed with heroin to enhance the high. It only takes a small amount of fentanyl to get you hooked or to kill. CAPRA: It's done in terms of micro-grams. It's so tiny. TODD: And if you mix any of that with heroin, what happens? CAPRA: It's hard to dilute it, so the heroin-user has no idea what they're getting, and they put that into their arm, laced with fentanyl and it's a deadly, it's what we call hot-shots. TODD: The DEA's James Capra says police are telling them that it's not untypical to see a user whose injected fentanyl with heroin dead with the needle still in their arm. It can kill you that quickly. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) LU STOUT: Now just ahead, it looks like the U.S. is in store for another major winter storm. The northeast is bracing for more snow and more ice and more travel delays. &lt;08:17:00 &lt;08:20:40 LU STOUT: Coming to you live from Hong Kong, you're back watching News Stream. And this is a visual version of all the stories we've got in the show today. Now we started with the countdown to the winter games in Sochi. And now to another winter landscape. But millions of people in the U.S. are probably sick of the sight of snow. Once again, the Midwest and the northeast are getting socked. Now in New York City the mayor says it is coming down faster than the city can plow it. Our Chad Myers is there. He joins me now live. And Chad, I read it's up to 10 inches of snow in some areas. What does it look like where you are? CHAD MYERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We had about six-and-a-half as of 6:00 last night. It snowed some more. And so now we're up to eight. And that eight inches would also have been right at the stadium that the Super Bowl was played the day before exactly 24 hours later there was eight inches of snow on the field that they would have had to shovel off or play in or whatever. So it would have been a snow bowl. This is only the first storm, though, of two more to come. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MYERS (voice-over): Millions along the east coast this morning are digging out of Monday's record breaking snowstorm. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Snow is coming down faster than we can plow it. MYERS: The winter storm transforming New York's Central Park into a winter wonderland in just hours setting a new daily record of 8 inches. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think I'm ready for the summer. MYERS: For thousands of travelers heading home from Sunday Super Bowl, the airports were anything, but a wonderland and more than 2,000 flights canceled on Monday due to the storm. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are trying to Chicago, our flights a couple hours delayed. We're just hoping it will actually take off. MYERS: Parts of New Jersey pummeled with 9 inches forcing Governor Christie to issue a state of emergency, some blaming the Super Bowl for the inability to battle the snow. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The local municipalities and the counties have been struggling to get it. MYERS: The new winter storm will pack a one-two punch tonight and into Wednesday with heavy snow and ice forecast in more than two dozens states. Kansas City bracing for 10 inches of snow. MARK THIEL, ASST. PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR, LAWRENCE, KANSAS: We're expecting this event to be pretty traumatic in terms of the amount of snowfall during rush hour in the morning and then again during rush hour later in the evening. (END VIDEOTAPE) MYERS: So here is the deal: we get more snow tonight, probably four to six inches, then it changes over to sleet and freezing rain by morning. People are already canceling plans for tomorrow and tomorrow is number two, there's more to come after that -- Kristie. LU STOUT: Oh, that's just incredible. You know, international viewers, international travelers are watching the situation with a lot of interest as well. Give us the travel advisory. I mean, how many flights have been canceled so far? MYERS: Canceled, 2,000 flights yesterday. Now you think about that at about 120 people per plane, do the multiplication, you have a lot of people that didn't get to where they wanted to be, almost a quarter of a million seats that didn't fly yesterday, 500 planes have already been canceled today mainly out of Chicago because of the storm is going to be there, but 500 times 100 people all of a sudden you have -- I mean, you are talking about major disruptions here. But the big problem is going to be it's what called the nor'easter. The low pressure that comes out of the west is going to combine with the relatively warm air that's in the Atlantic Ocean about 45 degrees. That is going to bomb a storm, that's going to make almost hurricane force winds and still will make very heavy snow, as much as a meter of snow in some of the big cities across the northeast with winds of 60. That happens on Monday. I don't believe there will be any travel in or out of the northeast, and that's where most international planes come, whether you're Boston, New York, Philadelphia, all those international airports I believe will be almost shut down on Monday because of that big storm that's coming, Kristie. LU STOUT: Thank you very much indeed for that warning. Chad Myers across all the icy conditions, the latest on that as well as the science behind this epic snow storm. Chad, thank you. Now let's get more now on this huge snow storm across the U.S. My colleague Mari Ramos joins me from the World Weather Center with that -- Mari. &lt;08:25:00 MARI RAMOS, CNN WEATHER CORRESPONDENT: That's quite a warning from Chad there. I mean, my eyes were like this big listening to him. That's for next Monday. We still have to get through the storms that are happening right now. And great reporting there from Chad. When you look at what's coming up next, this is what we can expect over the next couple of days. So today is, what, Tuesday here so this is for Wednesday in particular. Becuase of snow, as you saw from Chad's live shot, it stopped snowing right now in New York City. So that's a little bit of good news there. But an additional 11 centimeters expected. Upstate New York could have even more than that. Boston could have 28 centimeters of snow. And even though today the cancellations are about 500, 600 cancellations compared to the 2,000 yesterday, today is a better flying day in a way across the northeast. That's going to change again as we head to tomorrow. And then as we heard from Chad as we head into the beginning of next week. Now, as far as the states right now that have those winter storm advisories or warnings or any kind of winter weather related problems, if you look over here it stretches anywhere from the northeast all the way back over there toward even areas to the west and as far south as Texas. So that's about 32 states that have some sort of an advisory or warning. So this is pretty widespread. Areas being impacted right now -- and most of the cancellations that we've seen today are actually up in the Chicago area. But also affecting areas of the Midwest and this is why. You can see the storm system beginning to come in right in through here and this is the one that will continue moving in to the northeast as we head through the day tomorrow. So, let's head to the other side of the Atlantic, you know, again here we have yet another storm system coming through. Not a lot of snow, but definitely a lot of wind and a lot of rain for the UK and Ireland and western parts of France, even Portugal and Spain getting in on the action with very high waves over the weekend. Remember that. And even yesterday. Temperatures are relatively mild on this side, but relatively colder as we head farther to the east, but not as cold, though, as they had been before. So a lot of you that were getting snow are going to get rain this time around if we get to see a little bit more of this moisture make its way across into eastern parts of Europe here. And you can see more rain across Italy, the swollen rivers across Tuscany and as we head down even into Rome, the Tiber very high again today because of all of the rain that happened over the last couple of days will be continuing to drain down from the mountains there. And then back over here, this is our next weather system coming in across the west. Unfortunately that one will bring us more rain to already waterlogged areas and very dangerous waves, more coastal flooding expected. And that rain could be heavy at times for you guys in France, Portugal, Spain, the UK and even into Ireland. More snow across the Alpine region. And look at this picture, this is from Sochi. We've been talking quite a bit, of course, as we head into the Olympic Games. Not a lot of snow. Temperatures have actually been again slightly above the average for this time of year. Over the next couple of days sunny skies expected. And partly cloudy as we head into Friday, but nothing in the way of significant precipitation. So, I guess good travel days for people that are headed that way. Average high this time of year is 10, the average low is 3. And they usually get about 135 millimeters of either rain or snow, depending on where you are and usually snow it's only about six days that they get snow during the month of February. The number of days with snow on the ground is about four. Of course that changes as we head into some of those highest elevations. And last but not least, very heavy snowfall in Iran, some of the heaviest that they've seen in quite a long time, almost 90 centimeters of snow. Back to you, Kristie. LU STOUT: Yeah, heavy snowfall in Iran, but as for Sochi not quite looking like the winter wonderland just yet. Fingers crossed for the athletes. Mari Ramos there. Thank you. Now you are watching News Stream. And up next, Facebook has come a long way since its start in a Harvard dorm room. As the social network celebrates a decade, we ask what the next 10 years will bring. Plus... (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The technology sees around corners, over hills and through other vehicles. (END VIDEO CLIP) LU STOUT: Incredible technology that could save thousands of lives. &lt;08:28:55 &lt;08:31:12 LU STOUT: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching News Stream. And these are your world headlines. Now Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Sochi as the Black Sea city prepares for the opening of the Winter Olympics on Friday. And Mr. Putin is attending IOC events, but as athletes also begin to arrive organizers are facing criticism over a number of hotel rooms that are not yet ready for visitors and some journalists. Now investors are waiting for the opening of the U.S. markets after selloffs around the world. And here is how the main indexes in Europe are doing. Meanwhile in Asia, Japan's NIKKEI lead the losses, closing down more than 4 percent off concerns about U.S. growth and stimulus plus the strength of emerging markets have all contributed to the falls. Now search and recovery teams in Indonesia have been looking for victims after Saturday's eruption of Mount Sinabung volcano. 15 people are known dead after the vocano spewed scalding ash engulfing a nearby village. About 30,000 people have been evacuated from the area. The World Health Organization says that there were 14 million new cancer cases in 2012. And within two decades that number is set to soar to 22 million. Developing countries are expected to see the biggest increases. Now if you are like a lot of people, you've probably used Facebook at some point today, but 10 years ago only students at Harvard University could use The Facebook. It all started in founder Mark Zuckerberg's dorm room on February 4, 2004. And he posted this note on Facebook of course to mark his company's 10 year anniversary. And reflecting on Facebook's success, he said this, quote, \"we just cared more about connecting the world than anyone else and we still do today.\" Now Facebook counts more than 1.2 billion monthly active users. And according to Alexa (ph) is the second most popular website in the world just after Google. Now earlier I spoke to David Kirkpatrick, he's the author \"The Facebook Effect.\" He calls his book the only journalistic history of the company. And he gained privileged access to write it. I asked him to explain Zuckerberg's role in Facebook's success. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID KIRKPATRICK, AUTHOR: Well, you know, there are so few leaders in business that are true visionaries. I think in technology we can name Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, maybe Larry Ellison, Andy Grove, one or two others. Zuckerberg belongs in that group. He is an extraordinary long-term thinker. And I really believe that's one of the reasons Facebook has done so well. He continues to make really long-term bet. LU STOUT: You also point out that even though Facebook is a social media company, it is at heart a tech company. How has that been a factor for its success? KIRKPATRICK: Well, if you look back at the early days, you know, there were earlier social networks that were quite sizable when Facebook came along. There was MySpace and Friendster in particular. Both of them got very large and essentially collapsed under their own weight because they just couldn't manage their own tech, because they basically thought of themselves as cool places for people to hook up, you know. But unfortunately that led to their demise. Zuckerberg, on the other hand, an engineer, a guy who always thought about the programming side of things and product development looked at Facebook from the beginning as a constantly improving technology product. That allowed it to grow with much more seamless functionality and to really beat everybody else. LU STOUT: You know, there's Mark Zuckerberg, but there's also Cheryl Sandberg. How key has she been to the kind of performance we've seen from Facebook? KIRKPATRICK: Well, Cheryl Sandberg is an astonishingly important person in the history of Facebook. &lt;08:35:00 You know, she came in in the spring of 2008 when they really didn't even know what business they were in. In my book \"The Facebook Effect,\" I describe that for the first months she was there all she did was have meetings that were titled \"what business are we in?\" They kept asking themselves this question over and over again. And they figured out it was advertising. She set about to implement that strategy. Here we are a few years later the company is 1.23 billion people around the world dominating increasingly in mobile advertising, just had a quarter last week that was incredibly positive. Stock is skyrocketing. She gets a lot of the credit. Zuckerberg is the tech visionary, she is the business visionary. LU STOUT: Now I have to ask you about privacy. How has Facebook handled privacy the last 10 years? KIRKPATRICK: Well, over the last 10 years you know you might say Facebook has handled privacy intermittently well. I think actually they've made a lot of mistakes in the way they've changed their service unexpectedly and communicated it poorly to their users. But one thing many people forget is that Facebook was fundamentally founded on an idea of privacy in a way that no internet company had ever done before. Before Facebook came along, all you used on the Internet was your handle. You would never put your email address or your cellphone number online. Facebook gave people the confidence that they could do things like that, because it gave them control over who saw their data. That is the fundamental form of privacy that Facebook offers you, who you have as your friends, because your friends see everything about you. But I don't think Facebook has explained that properly. I think even though their heritage is one of privacy, they've often strayed away from that in their effort to try to get more page views, to turn themselves commercial in ways that sometimes were a little clumsy. But, you know, that was before Sandberg arrived by the way. But anyway, I think, you know, we're going to continue to see this being a fraught topic for Facebook despite Zuckerberg's commitment that he is building a service that honors privacy, because there is so much personal information there, it makes us all nervous. LU STOUT: Now you met Mark Zuckerberg for the first time back in 2006. And you've said in that meeting you got a sense, and he was just in his early to mid-20s at the time, that he was a leader. How did you get that sense? What is it that he said? What did he do? KIRKPATRICK: It was funny. I was sitting at a restaurant in midtown Manhattan. This is September 2006 when Facebook was two-and-a-half years old and Zuckerberg was 22. And he walked in. And I said to myself, oh, I'm wasting my time, this guy is so young. He's like a baby. Why am I bothering? You know, I had just done it because a PR person suggested it and I thought, oh, Facebook is kind of cool. But then he opened his mouth and I started listening to the things he said. And they were so extraordinarily big picture -- like I said earlier, long-term visionary, confident. I realized I had seldom heard anyone with such a big picture, positive long- term view about what he was engaged in and it made me confident that he was going to have an extraordinary success. I started covering Facebook very closely forever after. And it led to me writing a book a year-and-a-half later and the rest is history. Zuckerberg has proven to be as extraordinary as I thought he might be. (END VIDEOTAPE) LU STOUT: Love that Zuckerberg flashback there. And that was David Kirkpatrick speaking to me earlier. Now Zuckerberg has not been shy about his ambitions for Facebook. He wants it to be your interface for the rest of the internet. And CNN's Laurie Segall joins us live from Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California. And Laurie, we've talked about the last 10 years, let's look at the future, what's next for Facebook? LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: This is a big birthday for Facebook. And it's so interesting, Kristie, you hear David Kirkpatrick talk about how young Mark Zuckerberg was. I actually -- I spoke to Chris Cox who is at Facebook for the last eight years and everybody was so young back in the day, which makes 10 years later that just makes this a huge landmark. And what Chris Cox said, and he's the head of product at Facebook, he's really a visionary behind what we see and what we will see in the future. He gave me a bit of a look at the rocky history and some of those moments that kind of came to define Facebook and also what we can look for in the next 10 years. Check it out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRIS COX, VICE PRESIDENT OF PRODUCT, FACEBOOK: And the big question was, is this something that could work outside of college? And everybody said no, it's probably not going to work outside of college. LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: In honor of Facebook's ten- year anniversary, we decided to take a walk down memory lane. Do you have some of those stories where you thought, my God, I believe we got through that? COX: I mean, the news feed launch was pretty crazy. I spent, with a bunch of people, we worked really hard on making news feed. It took us almost a year to build. And we were pretty naive around how it would be received. Obviously, people were like, this is a lot of change. And there was like a protest organizing outside, so we had to, like, go out the back entrance. SEGALL: You had to go out the back? COX: Yes. And it was just one of those things I look back on right now and it's hard to believe. MEREDITH CHIN, FACEBOOK: Since then, there have been a lot of landmarks that are hard to believe. Six billion likes per day, 7.8 trillion messages sent using Facebook, and 1.2 billion monthly active users. &lt;08:39:54 It's a far cry from their early days. There were no chairs, no tables. They had to find like a bean bag chair. The kid interviewing me who is now a good friend, but he had bare feet. I was like what am I getting myself into? SEGALL: Over the past ten years, Facebook moved from this small office, to here and here and now to this sprawling campus here in Menlo Park. When we talk about the future of Facebook, the word we keep hearing is mobile. When did you guys know mobile is going to be big and what is the future look like when it comes to mobile and Facebook? COX: It really happen a couple of years ago. We sort of instituted all of these rules in the company, like whenever we show our product to each other, we need to start with mobile version. SEGALL: But the future of Facebook may look different. Alongside the traditional lap on your phone, you might start seeing a variety of apps created by the company. COX: We already have Facebook. We have Instagram messenger. We just announced paper, which is a more immersive way at looking at your news feed. SEGALL: Paper, Facebook's latest app, straight to your news feed based on your interest. But a challenge for the company will be continuing to grow at such a rapid pace. They are starting to saturate the internet-connected world. COX: When you just look out over the next three years, there's going to be a lot more people with their first computer and first phone and their first access to the internet. And one of the things that we're really excited about is making the access to the internet in general a lot more affordable. SEGALL: It will be a challenge and not Facebook's only challenge. The company now competes with ample of apps like Snapchat and Twitter. What do you look forward to for the company? CHIN: I think it's the next billion. (END VIDEOTAPE) SEGALL: And Kristie, you know, getting to that next billion that a whole other question because they've got to get people access to the Internet. They already have over a billion people using this service. Now I also spoke to Chris about the idea of artificial intelligence, because there's a group at Facebook -- now he didn't give me too many details, but there's a small group at Facebook working on the idea of artificial intelligence. A lot of big companies like Google investing in this. And how to you make your service even smarter? How do you learn what we're doing and learn it even better -- Kristie. LU STOUT: So artificial intelligence and stand alone apps, two big shifts in Facebook to come in the next 10 years. Laurie Segall joining us live from Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, thank you. Now Facebook and other big tech firms they are shedding light on the secret data requests they receive from the U.S. government on national security matters. But the companies are permitted only to release ranges rather than precise numbers. Now Yahoo received requests for information for more than 30,000 accounts. That was the most. LinkedIn received the fewest with requests targeted less than 250 accounts. But they can't discuss details of the requests or the identities of the users involved. Now the NSA is often said to only collect metadata from users. But let me just explain what metadata means. Now here is a fake email that we've created for this example. Now metadata is the contextual information around this email, but not the message body itself. So in this fictional example, reading metadata means you only be able to see this information here, not the actual email itself. But it's worth pointing out that this, it's still a lot of information, you can see who someone is communicating with and the subject line can also reveal what is being discussed. Now in the United States car crashes kill tens of thousands of people each and every year, but what if your car could help you avoid potential dangers on the road? Rene Marsh reports on a new technology that could save lives. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RENE MARSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's the vehicle of the future -- cars that talk to the driver and each other. The federal government wants it on the road soon, pushing for technology that would warn drivers of danger coming from any direction. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Coming along, the light is green, everything looks -- and all of a sudden we get that warning that says, you know, look out. MARSH: It's called vehicle-to-vehicle technology. Cars would send wireless messages to each other within about a 300 yard radius communicating information like speed, direction and GPS position ten times per second. ANTHONY FOXX, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: When cars share this information, they can account for all the vehicles around them, which means they're able to identify possible crashes. MARSH: The technology sees around corners, over hills and through other vehicles. So let's just say five cars ahead of me the driver slams on the breaks, well that car sends my car a message giving me enough time to react. 33,000 Americans are killed and 2.3 million injured in car crashes every year. The Department of Transportation predicts talking cars could prevent up to 80 percent of crashes involving sober drivers. &lt;08:45:00 Five major car companies have been working with DOT on developing and testing the technology. 3,000 cars in Ann Arbor, Michigan are already using it as part of a government pilot test. Some time after 2016, the federal government hopes your car will be able to communicate with you. Well, the DOT hopes to propose the rule by 2016, but it will still need the public to weigh in before anything is finalized. The bottom line is it's a lengthy process to get something like this mandated. Now as for privacy, the government says that data sent between cars does not record personal information. So your privacy should not be compromised. Rene Marsh, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) LU STOUT: Up next here on News Stream, just what is going on in London's Underground? It is not deep, dark and deserted. Now I'll tell you why business is thriving in these tunnels. LU STOUT: Welcome back. Now Edith Cooper says it took drive and tenacity to rise up the ranks at Goldman Sachs. In this week's Leading Woman talks about the unique challenges of her position with our Poppy Harlow. And she gives insight into how the firm weathered the global financial crisis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POPPY HARLOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Edith Cooper is one of the top ranking women at investment banking firm Goldman Sachs. EDITH COOPER, GOLDMAN SACHS: Just want to make sure we're connecting all of those dots. If you had asked me 30 years ago would I be on the managing committee at Goldman Sachs and be the influencer of our success of our people, oh no way. I think that, you know, I've come to expect the unexpected. HARLOW: As Goldman's head of human capital management, Cooper isn't just one of the top women, she's one of the top executives in the 30,000 member firm. COOPER: When asked the question at an event earlier do you want to be a CEO, of course, of course. You know, I'm young. My career path is not necessarily a clear straight line. HARLOW: She's one of just four women on Goldman's 29 member executive committee. Does that number need to go up? COOPER: Of course it does. I believe that we can't be the great firm that we need to be to be relevant to our clients if we don't have diversity at every level. HARLOW: You are a rare woman in this position and even more rare because you're African-American. COOPER: At times, it's been difficult. It is different for me as an African-American woman than it would be for a white male. I mean, that's just a fact. There's difficulty with respect to the subconscious bias that exists in life. HARLOW: It was a move to London, Cooper says, that was critical for her rise at the firm. COOPER: I think in today's economy, operating outside of your comfort zone is really, really important. When I arrived in Europe, I realized it wasn't the difference of being, you know, African-American it was the difference of being an American, an American. And the tools that I used to lead and to manage in the United States really were not as effective operating with people from all over the world. It was quite an extraordinary experience. HARLOW: But Cooper returned to New York with one of her greatest challenges ahead during the most recent financial crisis. COOPER: Reputationally, Goldman Sachs was really targeted as a company that was at the center of gravity, a lot of the difficulties that existed in the financial markets. HARLOW: Critics were saying you were betting against your clients. They were questioning the size bonuses handed out. How did you deal with that criticism? COOPER: The most difficult thing at the time was that what people thought about Goldman Sachs was not in sync with who we knew we were. &lt;08:50:05 HARLOW: What do you think people would be most surprised to learn about you? COOPER: I'm very tough. I'm very resilient. And the minute I think that someone believes that I can't I do. (END VIDEOTAPE) LU STOUT: Stay with us. And after the break, we go deep below London's Underground train lines. A dark tunnel is home to a blooming business. We take a look at a novel solution to soaring rental prices and the demand for ecofriendly food. LU STOUT: An imminent human disaster spreading across the globe -- that's how the World Health Organization is describing the cancer threat in the coming decades. It says new cases are set to rise by a staggering 70 percent in the next 20 years. And despite advances in medical care, the report predicts that there will be 22 million new cancer cases in 2034, 13 million people each year will be killed by the disease. And researchers say that the high cost of treating cancer is affecting the economies of richer countries. And it says developing nations are not equipped to deal with the crisis. Now the report says about half of all cancers could be avoided, but smoking rates need to be cut. Lung cancer is still the deadliest. And the report calls for better public health campaigns to promote prevention. Now one of the authors spoke to CNN a little bit earlier about the study. And what we can all do to help. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BERNARD STEWART, CO-EDITOR OF WORLD CANCER REPORT 2014: People giving up smoking is not just a matter of their individual choice, they're supported in that decision by restrictions on advertising, by the non-availability of the product to certain people such as children, by the price that discourages the buying of cigarettes and by the lack of advertising. Now we can't necessarily apply all of those things to every known healthy choice, but we can in different societies as the case is made opt for support from government through regulation for people to make the healthy choice. Now in respect of the involuntary exposures, those things that you literally can't avoid, the state of the air you breathe, as you point out, in many Asian cities is appalling and definitively associated with an increase risk of cancer. Lung cancer from that cause is only a small proportion of lung cancer from cigarettes, but it's still a real problem. and that is the responsibility of government. Communities deserve protection for recognized causes of cancer, particularly lung cancer, and action should and can be taken to reduce that risk, particularly has been demonstrated in the success achieved in American cities in reducing the burden of pollution. So that model can serve as a vehicle for other cities, particularly in China, for example, to achieve the same level of protection for their citizens. (END VIDEO CLIP) LU STOUT: And that was one of the editor of the World Cancer Report, Professor Bernard Stewart. Now health experts say that our diet can play a role in disease prevention. &lt;08:55:56 And in London, one business has found a unique way to grow ecofriendly food right in the heart of the city. Isa Soares has that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's another gray morning in South London and as commuters make their way to work, something deep below ground is growing. But little do they know that 33 meters below their seat in a World War II bunker, a unique horticultural endeavor is underway. Here in the dark, damp, rusty tunnels of London with a constant temperature of 16 degrees an innovative farming experiment is raising shoots. RICHARD BALLARD, FOUNDER: Having a stable environment we can create a perfect environment for the plant. So -- and we can grow to a certain time from seven days to 21 days and we can produce a crop and deliver directly into the market, which is just half a kilometer down the road. SOARES: The project is being backed by Michelin starred chief Michel Roux Jr. He tells me this is modern farming in Britian -- underground and no need for a trowel. These herbs? MICHEL ROUX, CHEF: No, these are pea shoots as well. SOARES: Oh, they're pea shoots as well. ROUX: These are fully mature. So they have -- you know, you bite into them and they have that wonderful pea taste if you want to have a little -- and they look great and they really do look great. SOARES: Where do you get the water from? ROUX: The water is -- the water at the moment is just filtered water that we're using, but we're hoping -- we're hoping that we should be able to collect rain water and filter that and various other things that will help us to be as organic as we can. And it's good for the environment. SOARES: There's so much rain at the moment, you're not shoot of water, I can tell you that much. For the time being, they have one tunnel with two-and-a-half acres of space. They're growing garlic chives, pea shoots, Thai basil among other products with a potential of course to expand. And with London's above ground property prices through the roof, this underground business has growth potential. BALLARD: Commercially it's a lot cheaper to grow in this environment than building a farm sort of outside of London. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's about eight times cheaper when you look at the cost in terms of the rent that you would have to pay for that kind of space. SOARES: Well, they're hoping this unique venture will whet the appetites of investors, they need to raise roughly a million pounds in 60 days in a crowdfunding campaign to get food on plates by late summer.

Even of all the countries I can still visit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The worldwide technical standard for this app was developed at EPFL in Lausanne. Is this a respectable success for the Swiss digital scene or finally the breakthrough?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is probably typical for Switzerland: high quality standards, but insufficiently marketed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What does Corona mean for digitalisation in this country?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Corona is the most efficient Chief Digital Officer to date.</p><p>Which industries have particularly benefited?</p><p>Basically, we noticed that almost all tech companies are incredibly resistant to Corona: This has to do with the fact that their business models are very resilient, that they are so flexible and can adapt quickly. Many have benefited: For example, people tried ordering food via app and suddenly the whole family noticed how easy it is. Then it becomes a habit, the company gains long-lasting users without customer acquisition costs. And not only in the food sector, but also in food retailing, education, telemedicine, communication platforms, etc., there have suddenly been spectacular advances. This is also reflected on the stock markets. We as VC have also felt almost no negative consequences for our portfolios.</p><p>Swiss companies also benefit?</p><p>Of course, the big companies benefit disproportionately, and they are often American. Switzerland a little less.</p><p>Which start-ups are being hit by the crisis?</p><p>Those who die now would probably have failed sooner or later anyway. But those who are good and have a strong position, such as GetYourGuide in this country, will get money even in this phase. At the moment, you put that money into the product, but you save on marketing, and when the markets get going again, you come out much stronger and win at the expense of the established industry.</p><p>So start-ups still get money, even in these uncertain times?</p><p>Yes, that has hardly changed. At the moment, the perfect investment is one that combines growth and high liquidity. That means in the listed tech companies. The second best thing is growth and not yet listed on the stock exchange. So start-ups.</p><p>Other Swiss start-ups have suffered. The federal government and the cantons have issued guarantees of 154 million for them. How sensible is that?</p><p>The Swiss approach is relatively good. VCs may be able to compensate with additional funds if 10 or 15 percent of a start-up's turnover is lost. But not 80 or 100 percent as during the lockdown. So you need support programs. Companies that have been nurtured for years and could now make it big must not be allowed to fail. And the way the program was designed in this country, it will work.</p><p>How does a state choose the right startups to survive?</p><p>The state never chooses. It can only ever be those people who risk their own money. So us VCs. And it's the role of the gatekeeper that we have to grow into. That's nothing new in Europe: in the 1950s, 60s, 70s, when start-ups were not yet called that, the first financing came from the house bank. And when the money had spoken, this was the selection criterion, so that the state - in Germany, for example, the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau - could also provide financing. That is why we in Europe today are relatively rich. But today, no company that might belong to the middle class in 10 or 15 years' time receives money from the bank. And it is quite essential that we finance locally, as Corona has shown.</p><p>In what way?</p><p>If those European companies that are at the forefront of vaccine research were financed by American donors, Trump would put pressure on them and say: \"So, the vaccine goes to the USA. And he does, see the Moderna/Lonza case. But he has no chance with the German company CureVac, which was financed by SAP founder Dietmar Hopp.</p><p>The Swiss Entrepreneur Fund, a state-sponsored investment vehicle, but privately financed, has been in existence in Switzerland for two years. Would this country need a real sovereign wealth fund?</p><p>It would be worthwhile: The Federal Republic of Germany has been investing in ventures for 15 years, generating an average annual return of twelve percent.</p><p>And probably creates jobs and tax money as well.</p><p>Plus the basic prerequisite for competitiveness! Even the European Investment Fund (EIF) has never lost money on its funds of funds. And you have a say, sit at the cap table, learn something. But so far, European money has only participated in 14 percent of the financing rounds of large companies worldwide, investing 1.9 percent of the money that is worth only 1.4 percent at the cap tables today. This means that, unfortunately, we are nowhere. And that is not really possible.</p><p>So what can you do to make pension funds, family offices and traditional banks more enthusiastic about start-up investments?</p><p>I think this is a learning process - like private equity. In the 2000s, the asset class venture was not a must. But in the meantime it has matured, you have reliable figures. For me, it no longer fits together when the state earns twelve percent and life insurance companies complain that they cannot earn a two percent guaranteed interest rate. That's why we are building tailor-made structured products for interested banks, insurance companies and pension funds in particular, which create a greater asymmetry between risk and opportunity in order to make this performance available to the wider public. Because if I pay 30 years into my pension and have a ten percentage point difference in interest, that's a huge lever.</p><p>Will there be enough good start-ups in this country that generate such a return, or would the money not necessarily go abroad?</p><p>Thanks to Corona, work from home is now accepted. It's easy to set up a start-up with 10 people in Zurich and 30 in Vladivostok or Liubljana. That plays into Switzerland's hands because it has the intellectual capital with the great universities EPFL and ETH. If only we had the right environment for financing ... At the end of the day, Corona has led to many Europeans in America saying: My God, Europe is great, everything works, it's relatively safe, the quality of life is high. If this were to be combined with a smaller gap in terms of the efficiency of the location conditions, many could fall over and come back. I am sure of it.</p><p>Apart from 50-year-old SAP, Spotify and a few fintechs like Checkout.com or Revolut, there are still no globally successful tech companies from Europe.</p><p>Right, that's one way of looking at it. Another point of view is: How fast is this developing? How many new unicorns, companies worth billions of dollars a year? That's increasing relatively fast. Last year there were as many new unicorns as Europe managed to acquire between 2008 and 2013 in total. Not only will there be many more much faster, but they will also become bigger in relative terms. Spotify has a market capitalization of 50 billion, and the Dutch payment service provider Adyen now has 40 billion. Then there is Delivery Hero, which has just entered the DAX with 18 billion, Zalando is similar in size, and HelloFresh is 8 billion. In the last ten years, Europe has probably seen 10 or 15 companies spring up out of the ground that are bigger than Lufthansa, which was in the DAX until the Corona crisis and took 50 years to get into the DAX. And we have to replace them.</p><p>But compared to the USA these are peanuts.</p><p>That's true. The Americans have invested 870 billion dollars in venture companies over the last 25 years. Today, every ninth US employee is employed by a company that was raised with venture capital. And the 870 billion has become a market capitalization of 6 trillion, or 6000 billion dollars - almost a third of the gross domestic product! In Germany, Europe's largest economy, VC investments only account for 1.5 percent of GDP. So we have to invest much more in venture companies to maintain our competitive position. The Americans, but also the Chinese, are showing us the way.</p><p>Cue Americans and Chinese: The basic idea of the Internet is globalization. Now we have a US president who wants to ban TikTok or have it taken over by a US group, who puts WeChat on the watch list, who puts Huawei under sanctions, with the result that the group is increasingly focusing on the Chinese domestic market. Companies like Facebook or Google are not even allowed to be present there. Are we currently experiencing the nationalization of the Internet?</p><p>To a certain extent, yes. It's going in the direction of an organization of continental monopolies. Because many Western companies have not been allowed to enter the Chinese market for years, the way was clear for local players there. If the reverse is also not allowed to happen now, everyone will soon have staked their claims. And if we as Europeans do not pursue a stringent economic policy, we will be crushed in between. Because China is ruled by a dictatorship that is brought into line, the USA pursues a centralised and incredibly determined economic policy and Europe, by contrast, acts very heterogeneously.</p><p>So if there will soon be an Asian and a Western Internet, and perhaps a European network as a third: What are the consequences for global business models?</p><p>That is an interesting question. Some models are defined mainly by their marginal costs and revenues. In larger economic areas like China, such platforms will be more profitable and efficient than in smaller ones like Europe. But I don't think that even in the digital world you can give in to this dictates of scale without any restrictions.</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>Because then ethics go downhill. Of course, it is more efficient in China to recognize the faces of those who cross the street when the light is red and charge them the fine directly via WeChat. But do we want that? No, I think we will then come to a border as Europe, where we have to say Certain values are so ethically important to us that we won't bow to technical efficiency. Perhaps with the risk that we will then not be competitive in certain areas. There will be a discussion of values. And our values, the way we deal with each other, also distinguish us Europeans from the Americans more than is often thought. This will be a very difficult decision, and it will place an economic burden on us.</p><p>In this context, are European data protection laws, including those of Switzerland, a locational advantage or a locational disadvantage?</p><p>That is a similar question, and the answer is similar. The way we want to handle our data is part of our culture. Our privacy is more important to us - also for historical reasons - than it is to Americans. Nevertheless, without hesitation, we release our data to use services like Facebook or Snapchat - voluntarily.</p><p>Does this mean that the collection and linking of data for these companies in Europe must be made even more difficult?</p><p>At that moment, we would be creating a disadvantage for European companies. Because we hardly have any companies that already serve so many parts of our lives in such an emotionally engaging way as Google, Amazon or Netflix. Ask your friends and acquaintances which of these US services they would not want to do without. Probably most of them. And then ask which European services your friends would not want to do without. Spotify, at best. Now, imagine a start-up in this country that's just getting started. None of your acquaintances will need it. They can all do without it. But if this start-up is not allowed to collect and link data, it will never have the slightest chance to rise even remotely into the league of the established big tech that has been doing this in all other parts of the world for years.</p><p>Do the contents have to be regulated on the major platforms, keyword Fake News?</p><p>Absolutely. Absolutely, yes. Because the current protagonists are overdoing it, it is clear to everyone what completely untruthful Twitter and Facebook exercises can mean for influencing a democracy. If you write something wrong as a journalist, I can confront you with it and if necessary sue you. The situation is similar on public television. And it cannot be that we are allowed to publish any rubbish in the most important medium at all without filters and without consequences. The big question is who then should be the appropriate regulator. A concerted, determined European premium is needed here!</p><p> \"By 2019, there are as many unicorns in Europe as there are 2008 to 2013 combined.\"</p><p> \"Even in the digital world, you can't give in to dictates of scale unreservedly.\"</p><p>THE UNICORN HUNTER</p><p>Klaus Hommels (53) is the most successful VC in Switzerland and one of the most successful in Europe. He invested early in US companies like Facebook, Airbnb or Skype, meanwhile he mainly promotes European tech companies like Spotify, Sennder or Revolut as well as those from Switzerland (Teralytics, GetYourGuide). His investment company Lakestar with offices in Zurich, Berlin, London and Hong Kong set up one of the largest VC funds in Europe last year with a volume of 700 million Swiss francs. During the Corona crisis, Hommels helped the German government to prepare the rescue package for start-ups.

Like cigarettes, he said, Facebook was \"addictive\", \"not good for you\" and there were \"all kinds of forces trying to get you to do certain things\". \"There's a lot of parallels,\" he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a suggestion it met with awkward gasps in January, but now it appears oddly prophetic, even if there was a little tech rivalry involved in Benioff's assessment of Facebook.</p><p>This rapid change in public opinion is mainly due to revelations this week that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to Donald Trump's election campaign, had obtained and exploited the personal data of 50 million Facebook users, one of the largest data leaks in history.</p><p>The social media company has weathered privacy scandals before, but this latest one hit particularly hard, wiping as much as $US50 billion ($65 billion) off its market value, sending founder Mark Zuckerberg into hiding for four days and sparking a global debate about data privacy.</p><p>It has also kicked off the #DeleteFacebook campaign as people expressed horror at the exploitation of their digital lives. Among the people to exit the platform this week was American actress and singer Cher, who took offence the data collected was used in an effort to aid the election of Donald Trump.</p><p>Adrian Turner, chief executive of Data61, the CSIRO's data science outfit, says this backlash against Facebook could potentially take on the momentum of the #MeToo campaign, which sprang up in response to endemic sexual harassment.</p><p>\"We never had the conversation about the consequences of an internet with an advertising-driven business model that relied on profiling,\" Turner says. \"When the internet started, the hippies in California wanted it to be free. That saw the rise of advertising-sponsored content and the unintended consequence of that was the development of sophisticated capability in the socio-economic profiling of people.\"</p><p>Turner says that meant companies could build a profile around people's individual biases, and use that to keep them online for longer, make them buy certain products or, in the case of an election campaign, vote for the desired candidate.</p><p>\"The thing I grapple with is that we knew this profiling was happening so why didn't we care,\" he says.</p><p>One reason people overlooked data collection was the sheer convenience and connectivity of Facebook.</p><p>Families and friends living on opposite sides of the world could keep in touch. Entrepreneurs could launch their businesses by cheaply promoting goods and services via the platform. Busy executives could corral colleagues for the office Christmas party and protest organisers could rally the troops.</p><p>Launched in 2004 by Zuckerberg and his Harvard college buddies, Facebook quickly became indispensable to its users. In just four years it boasted 100 million registered users. By 2010, it had passed the half-billion mark. Today there are more than 2 billion users, or more than a quarter of the world's population.</p><p>In Australia the platform boasts 16 million users, or 60 per cent of the population, with the bulk of these in the key advertising demographic between 25 and 39.</p><p>\"They should have a greater sense of responsibility and accountability which corresponds to the power they have,\" says Turner.</p><p>\"If Facebook skates through this it will be instructive about how powerful these monopolies are and it will increase the calls for greater regulation. I hope what doesn't happen is that we completely back off thinking about how technology can contribute to humanity.\"</p><p>The regulation is already starting to happen.</p><p>In Europe, a new set of data privacy rules will take effect on May 25, restricting the type of personal data technology companies can collect and share. The new regulations include the \"right-to-be-forgotten\" law so people can ask companies to remove online information about them as well as parental consent rules.</p><p>In Australia, the landscape is also moving quickly towards greater regulation, even if that's an unpalatable word for the federal government.</p><p>The responsible minister, Angus Taylor, whose portfolio covers cyber security and law enforcement, said the government expects to bring its Consumer Data Rights legislation to Parliament later this year.</p><p>\"The basic principle is that people control their own data and it is only used in a way they consent to,\" he told AFR Weekend.</p><p>\"I don't think it's radical legislation; it's simply in line with community expectations.\"</p><p>The banking sector is the federal government's first target under this new legislation and it provides a model for how Facebook and other social media platforms might find themselves regulated.</p><p>In an effort to engender competition and foster innovation, Treasurer Scott Morrison is looking to break the stranglehold of Australia's \"big four\", through what he is calling \"open banking\".</p><p>This should eventually allow consumers to safely and easily share their transaction history and loan records with another institution or fintech player, which could use such data to offer better terms to the customer.</p><p>\"Granting third-party access to a customer's data will allow rival providers to offer competitive deals,\" Morrison said in a statement on February 7.</p><p>The basic principle behind this proposed reform is the government decreeing data is owned by the consumer, rather than the bank. The Howard government took this approach to mobile phone numbers in 2001, when legislation decreed these didn't belong to the operator but rather the consumer, thereby allowing people to change providers while still keeping their old number.</p><p>This same principle could be applied to Facebook and other social media platforms.</p><p>Using a similar \"open\" model, the government's new legislation could mean any data captured by a platform is ultimately owned by the individual rather than the company.</p><p>Consumers could then decide who, if anyone, they wished to share their user history with.</p><p>Such a move, which will be fiercely resisted by the big tech firms, would not only stop the likes of Cambridge Analytica accessing user data, but go some way to breaking Facebook's overall dominance and might also influence how Google deploys data. This goes to the heart of platform economics and Facebook itself.</p><p>One of the biggest drawcards is the so-called \"network effect\". If friends and family use a particular social media platform then people can feel compelled to join to stay in touch.</p><p>Platforms like Facebook also take the information they glean from people and use that data to target content, and more importantly, advertising in their direction.</p><p>This keeps a user coming back but also makes it harder for other platforms to offer the same tailored content and advertising as they don't have access to the data and user history.</p><p>In addition that data allows the big platforms to vertically integrate - remember when Amazon just sold books - and use their superior analysts to wipe out the competition.</p><p>\"These platforms are not about capitalism, they are about feudalism,\" says Turner.</p><p>\"They're landlords and that's an extremely powerful position because they're setting the rules for engagement. They should really be public-private partnerships.\"</p><p>Depending on how far legislation in Australia and other parts of the world goes, this could see the likes of Facebook resembling a regulated utility, like an electricity provider.</p><p>Breaking the monopoly these platforms have over data is the first step and should also help curtail their competitive advantage in using such data to move into other industries and becoming even more dominant.</p><p>And while the focus is on Facebook today, this attention could quickly switch to the dominance of other platforms like Amazon and China's Alibaba, as they move further down the value chain and morph from being retailers to looking more and more like farmers or food processors.</p><p>\"Amazon and Alibaba talk openly about building global trading networks,\" says Turner from Data61.</p><p>The issue is how to prevent all the value in a sector like agriculture accruing to the platform owner, like it has in the media space to Google and Facebook.</p><p>Tighter regulation is the obvious answer, an outcome Zuckerberg was peddling hard to avoid during media appearances this week. He said the company had \"made mistakes\" and would double the number of staff working on security and was building technology to stamp out propaganda.</p><p>\"This was a major breach of trust, and I'm really sorry that this happened,\" he said.</p><p>\"We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data.\"</p><p>That is unlikely to be enough for Facebook users or lawmakers, who are moving quickly to curtail the power of the large platforms, which account for seven of world's 10 most valuable companies.</p><p>\"I could be wrong but I think this is big enough and enough of the market feels like technology companies are arrogant and they want to hold them to account,\" says Turner.</p><p>That's the type of public sentiment that eventually had cigarette companies regulated in the 1980s.P</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6ze45yc2oxdvsxmg14x</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXX-C4T1-F0J6-J183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1581\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The whole notion that the UN was scheming to become a global government-style institution with centralized coercive powers was once dismissed as a \"conspiracy theory\" for \"kooks.\" Today, it is obvious to anyone willing to pay attention to the news. As we reported in the companion article \"UN to America: We're the Boss\" (page 10), the UN now regularly makes demands on America that fly in the face of traditional Americanism, across a broad range of crucial policy fields. And if left unchecked, this is only the start.</p><p>Ultimately, liberty, self-government, nation-states, and God-given rights will give way to total government if this is not stopped. And this is plain to see from the UN's own documents, statements, and agreements. Liberty is literally on the line, with globalists and the Deep State seeking to replace it with a fraud that sounds similar, at least at the most superficial level, but could not be more different in reality.</p><p>At the core of the UN's ongoing attacks against America is the drive to replace self-government under God and the Godgiven rights enshrined in America's founding documents with \"global governance\" and UN-granted revocable privileges described by the UN as \"human rights.\" And it is not exactly a secret. In fact, as The New American has documented extensively over a period of many years, the UN now brazenly and routinely claims that Americans' inalienable rights are actually violations of \"international human rights law,\" and as such, must be drastically curtailed to comply with UN demands.</p><p>Indeed, in the January 6, 2015 article headlined \"United Nations Exploits Pseudo-'Human Rights' to Attack U.S.,\" The New American magazine documented this clearly with an array of examples. Among other concerns, the article gave multiple examples of the UN and its top officials publicly claiming that \"human rights\" and \"international law\" require that governments outlaw and punish certain speech, impose more gun control, ignore due-process protections, overturn state self-defense laws, eliminate constitutional limitations on federal power, prohibit spanking of children as a disciplinary tool, fund abortion with tax money, regulate private schools to comply with UN demands, provide more welfare and subsidized housing, and much, much more.</p><p>Attacks on Free Speech, First Amendment</p><p>Since the days of the Soviet Union's push to ban \"hate speech\" internationally, the UN has been waging war on free speech. The UN actually claims international human rights law now requires nations to ban all sorts of speech - basically, anything the UN deems hate, intolerance, discrimination, and so on. In 2014, for instance, two separate UN outfits, the dictator-dominated UN Human Rights Commission and the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, slammed Japan for not violating the free speech protections in its Constitution to ban speech, rallies, and groups that the UN considers \"hateful.\" Even \"propaganda\" that might \"incite discrimination or hostility\" must be banned, the UN demanded of Japan, specifically targeting groups and rallies perceived as being \"Anti-Korean.\"</p><p>Then UN Human Rights Czar Navi Pillay, a South African who condemned the United States after the killing of Trayvon Martin, offered some chilling insight into the dictator-dominated global body's views on the fundamental right to free speech. \"Defining the line that separates protected from unprotected speech is ultimately a decision that is best made after a thorough assessment of the circumstances of each case,\" she argued. In other words, every time somebody speaks, they run the risk of violating the UN-backed restrictions on free speech. And in many nations, such outlandish international schemes are being cited as justification for jailing - yes, jailing - pastors, critics of Islam, critics of homosexuality, critics of mass migration, supporters of marriage, those who disagree with escalating gender confusion, and more.</p><p>After the rally in Charlottesville over monuments that turned bloody, the UN openly called for free speech rights to be curtailed in America. In official statements, the UN said the U.S. government must \"provide the necessary guarantees so that such rights [free speech] are not misused to promote racist hate speech.\" First, it will be \"racist hate speech.\" Then, anything the UN and its member governments hate will be banned as \"hate speech,\" as has occurred in so many nations. The UN also called on the U.S. government to wage a propaganda campaign that would \"actively contribute to the promotion of understanding, tolerance, and diversity between ethnic groups, and acknowledge their contribution to the history and diversity of the United States of America.\" In other words, ban speech the UN dislikes, and use tax money to spread the UN's ideas.</p><p>Attacks on Gun Rights, Second Amendment</p><p>It is not just free speech and freedom of the press that are in the UN's cross hairs. Gun rights are under threat, too. In 2016, after a jihadist with widely reported homosexual proclivities shot up a homosexual bar in Florida, the UN immediately interjected itself. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Hussein, an Islamic prince, claimed the U.S. government has an \"obligation\" to implement \"robust gun regulation.\" \"It is hard to find a rational justification that explains the ease with which people can buy firearms,\" Hussein said, claiming that \"evidence\" shows firearms make society less safe and that the U.S. government must intervene.</p><p>Two years earlier, a UN report on supposed human-rights abuses in America claimed the U.S. government must adopt more gun-control legislation, including gun registration, and remove self-defense rights. Countless similar statements and reports have been disgorged by the UN in recent years. In 2013, for example, the UN released a statement by \"experts\" claiming the Obama administration was \"required\" to \"amend, rescind, or nullify any laws or regulations which have the effect of creating or perpetuating racial discrimination.\" Specifically, the UN was demanding an end to \"stand your ground\" self-defense laws in Florida and other states, along with other laws protecting fundamental rights.</p><p>And of course, as readers of this magazine know well, the global body has been working hard to force all nations to adopt draconian gun control through the UN Anns Trade Treaty (ATT). Among other claims, the treaty purports to grant a monopoly over weaponry to \"authorized state parties,\" in other words to governments, ignoring the dangers signaled via the 300 million murders perpetrated by governments in the last century alone. Ammunition falls under the treaty's prohibitions, too. And in Article 5, the UN agreement commits all national governments to \"establish and maintain a national control system, including a national control list,\" over \"the broadest range of conventional arms.\" That means all of your guns are in the cross hairs.</p><p>It is hardly a pipe dream. In Venezuela, the UN helped socialist tyrant Hugo Chavez disarm civilians as part of a 2012 disarmament campaign that banned all private firearms. Speaking to regime-run \"reporters,\" UN Coordinator for Venezuela Alfredo Missair urged them to actively support the gun ban. \"You are also responsible in this important fight - we need the cooperation of not only the United Nations but of the media,\" Missair said. \"So, we are offering all the support they require to do a good job.\" Murder and crime rates promptly soared as the newly empowered regime stepped up its persecution of the opposition. Today, Venezuela has among the worst crime rates and the worst tyranny of any country on Earth.</p><p>Yet despite all that, the UN has plenty of friends in America who would love to see the same exact thing. In late 2017, Cook County Commissioner Richard Boykin went to New York City and asked the UN to send peacekeeping troops into Chicago to help deal with gun crime. \"I'm hoping to appeal to the UN to actually come to Chicago and meet with victims of violence, and maybe even possibly help out in terms of peacekeeping efforts, because I think it's so critical for us to make sure that these neighborhoods are safe,\" Boykin was quoted as telling the press, claiming there was a \"genocide\" going on against black Americans because most victims of shootings were black. \"So we must protect these population groups, and that's what the United Nations does. They're a peacekeeping force. They know all about keeping the peace, and so we're hopeful that they'll hear our appeal.\"</p><p>Aside from attacks on speech and gun rights, the UN also routinely denigrates America's federalist system of government. In direct violation of the 10th Amendment, which states that any powers not specifically given to the U.S. government remain the province of state governments or the people themselves, the UN has long been demanding that the U.S. government usurp all sorts of powers that were never delegated to it in order to comply with UN demands. It has also repeatedly derided the American justice system with its due process protections, presumption of innocence, trial by jury, and more. This was perhaps most extreme in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting, but continues to this day. Under the guise of fighting \"terrorism\" and \"crime\" and other issues, the UN now routinely demands all sorts of abuses of privacy, too. including global biometric databases, national biometric IDs, support from Big Tech to censor and spy on citizens, and much more.</p><p>In short, there are no fundamental rights enjoyed by Americans that the UN does not seek to eliminate.</p><p>UN's \"Human Rights\": Homosexual \"Marriage,\" Government Control</p><p>By contrast, the UN celebrated the Supreme Court's usurpation of power to invent a right to a \"homosexual marriage\" as a great leap forward in human rights. \"I wholeheartedly welcome this historic decision,\" then-UN boss Ban said in San Francisco about Obergefell while commemorating the 70th anniversary of the signing of the UN Charter. \"This is a great step forward for human rights in the United States.\" In a speech given that same day at a lunch for the UN pro-homosexuality and -transgender campaign \"free and equal,\" Ban celebrated June 26 as \"a day we celebrate not only the birth of the United Nations but marriage equality for all Americans.\"</p><p>The UN's legions of discredited \"special rapporteurs,\" meanwhile, have long made clear that they view \"rights\" in the same way the regimes enslaving the people of the Soviet Union, Cuba, Vietnam, China, and other communist nations have viewed rights. In the United Kingdom, for example, a UN special rapporteur infamous for sacrificing an animal to Karl Marx was relentlessly ridiculed for accusing the U.K. government of \"human rights violations\" because welfare recipients were not being given large enough houses. In Switzerland, UN bureaucrats attacked stay-at-home mothers as human-rights violators. In Canada, they claimed supposedly \"low\" taxes were a \"human rights\" violation because the government needed more resources to battle everything from obesity to inequality.</p><p>There is a method to the madness (See sidebar on page 36). The UN's vision of human rights for the world is exactly the opposite of the views held by America's Founding Fathers that produced the greatest and freest nation in history - not to mention the moral code outlined in the Bible that is at the core of Western civilization. As explained in the Declaration of Independence, the Founders said it was self-evident that God had created people and endowed them with unalienable rights such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They also said governments exist to protect those unalienable rights. The Founders literally viewed rights as a sacred gift from God, as they explained repeatedly.</p><p>The UN, by contrast, believes that governments and international agreements confer privileges that can be revoked at any time for little to no cause. In Article 29 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for instance, the document makes clear that rights can be limited by law under virtually any pretext. It also says that the alleged rights may \"in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\" In other words, individuals have no unalienable rights under the UN's view of human rights, only privileges that can be revoked at will by governments and international organizations.</p><p>The UN Human Rights Council, meanwhile, is literally dominated by dictatorships, with unfree regimes holding the majority of seats. The predecessor organization, the UN Human Rights Committee, was once led by the late Libyan tyrant Moammar Gadhafi. And current UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet is a known supporter of socialism and even mass-murdering communist dictatorships such as the Castro regime enslaving Cuba. In her younger years, as victims were being slaughtered trying to flee East Germany, she defected to that mass-murdering communist regime. She recently praised the \"squad\" of fringe left-wing congresswomen (AOC et al.) famous for hating America and Trump. \"I believe that those four women are fantastic,\" she said, describing them as \"bright\" and celebrating their alleged courage \"to say what they think\" about supposed U.S. deficiencies.</p><p>Nor does the UN itself respect even the most fundamental rights of people. According to the organization Hear Their Cries, UN troops and international aid workers and bureaucrats have raped and sexually exploited over 60,000 women and children just in the last decade. A poll conducted by the non-profit Save the Children revealed that just in the Ivorian town of Toulepleu, which was occupied by UN peace troops, eight out of 10 minor girls admitted to regularly being raped and forced into sexual acts by UN soldiers. Unspeakable horrors perpetrated by the UN's \"blue helmets\" have been documented from Africa and Asia to Europe and the Americas and everywhere in between. And yet, because of \"diplomatic immunity,\" there has been virtually no accountability at all.</p><p>The hypocrisy of the UN's supposed quest for human rights in America is perhaps most perfectly illustrated in its hypocrisy over Communist China. While the United States is constantly under fire, the regime in Beijing does not just get a pass - top UN officials bend over backward to protect the mass-murdering dictatorship from criticism. Consider the recent case at the UN Human Rights Council, where a coalition of more than 120 organizations sought to file a formal complaint against Beijing's network of \"re-education\" camps holding well over a million Uighur Muslims, but was prevented from even publishing a formal complaint at the UN Human Rights Council, in violation of its own procedures. Before that, a top UN \"human rights\" official was exposed by a whistleblower handing straight to Beijing the names of Chinese dissidents seeking to testify against the regime. The whistleblower was persecuted, while the highest echelons of the UN worked to cover up the whole matter by firing judges and suppressing the facts.</p><p>UN Seeking to Become Global Government</p><p>Ultimately, the globalist goal is to turn the UN into a global government that would actively deny individual rights - one that could not be effectively resisted by its victims. It already has courts, armies, self-styled \"law enforcement\" and \"crime fighting\" divisions, and much more. Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon repeatedly referred to the UN as the \"Parliament of Humanity.\" A parliament, by definition, is a law-making body of a government. Before that Ban referred to the UN Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals - essentially a roadmap to global technocratic government - as the planetary \"declaration of interdependence.\" The head of the UN General Assembly when the scheme was adopted, Peter Thompson, referrec to it as a \"master-plan for humanity.\"</p><p>This has been the objective from the start, when U.S. diplomat (and Soviet agent) Alger Hiss led the conference to create the UN. Among those involved in the process who have admitted the goal was John Foster Dulles, a leading Deep State globalist who also helped create the UN and went on to become U.S. secretary of state. \"The United Nations represents not a final stage in the devele pment of world order, but only a primitive stage,\" he wrote in his book War or Peace. \"Therefore its primary task is to create the conditions which will make possible a more highly developed organization.\" Dulles also observed in his took, \"I have never seen any proposal made for collective security with 'teeth' in it, or for 'world government' or for 'world federation,' which could not be carried out either by the United Nations or under the United Nations Charter.\"</p><p>Under President Trump, there have been some efforts to rein in the UN, including leaving some UN agencies. There have also been some tepid efforts to reverse the perverted UN view of human rights. This summer, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo created a commission to deal with the corruption of discourse about human rights. Dubbed the \"Commission on Unalienable Rights,\" the body was tasked with recommending \"reforms of human rights discourse where it has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights.\" It was a nice thought. But the commission was endlessly demonized and mocked by globalists and totalitarians, and it is not clear that it will accomplish much, if anything.</p><p>The real solution to the UN's escalating attacks on American sovereignty and liberty must involve getting out of the UN, something The John Birch Society, which publishes this magazine, has been advocating for over 50 years. Legislation to do that is in Congress already. One of the sponsors of the American Sovereignty Restoration Act (HR 204), Representative Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), has been a leader in the campaign for an #Amexit from the UN. He told The New American in an interview last year that there are many reasons why the U.S. government should get out of the globalist institution.</p><p>\"The best thing that you can say about the United Nations is it's mostly ineffective and a waste of money,\" said Congressman Massie, who started campaigning for an \"Amexit\" from the UN after the British people voted for a \"Brexit\" from the European Union. \"That's the best thing you can say about it. So I'm glad that they are somewhat ineffective, but I don't like that we waste the money.\" But that is just the start. \"It's full of dictators, and it's also something that I don't think our sovereign government should defer to,\" he explained. \"For instance, a lot of these foreign relations bills that come in front of us in Congress and the whereas clauses - they might say 'whereas the UN has said this,' or 'the UN decided this, now therefore be it resolved' - well that's almost an automatic no for me, because why would I defer to the United Nations if we're a sovereign country?\"</p><p>Massie also noted that many of his colleagues love the UN and would like to see the United States even more deeply ensnared within its grasp. And therein lies the problem. These members of Congress were elected by ignorant Americans who do not understand their own heritage, their freedoms, or the existential threat posed to them by the dictators club. As such, beyond simply ending U.S. membership in the UN, Americans must educate the electorate. Absolutely essential to that mission will be restoring a proper public understanding on the nature of rights, the role of government, the U.S. Constitution, and the danger of phony ideas on \"human rights\" that require the government to redistribute wealth extracted from others by force. Without that understanding, even an #Amexit would be only a temporary solution. By getting involved in the JBS campaign to \"Get U.S. Out of the United Nations,\" you can join with others and turn the tide today. *</p><p>In other words, every time somebody speaks, they run the risk of violating the UN-backed restrictions on free speech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2313308292</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGM-5T71-JBHT-D185-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3402\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New American Oct 21, 2019</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 35</volume><issueNumber>No. 20</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 21, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

I do a lot a sport, I'm a keen sailor, and when I practice with people who are much better than me, then I become better. If there are other players that are better than us, we have to improve to become better,\" he said, speaking during a panel at the Sibos technology and banking infrastructure conference on Sept. 25.</p><p>Where UniCredit is not in a position to develop technology itself, it partners with financial technology firms:</p><p>\"It's better to be proactive than play the ostrich. We were the first to introduce Apple Pay in Italy. The more we can partner the better. It's better to lead the disruption than to be caught out by it,\" he said.</p><p>But banks must innovate and partner sensibly, and stay true to their role as guardians of their clients' money:</p><p>\"The question is what does the client want. Of course, the client wants a nice product that is easy to use. But the client expects a financial institution to provide security. At the end [of the day], what do you need in order to do that? You need to have a lot of capital. The true nature of a financial institution is to have a very strong balance sheet,\" he said.</p><p>The end game for fintechs is to acquire as many customers as possible and ultimately be bought out, Mustier said. But this is not the ultimate goal of a bank, which is to protect deposits, he added.</p><p>Retaining client relationships</p><p>\"I am extremely comfortable   while not being in denial   in saying that the financial institutions that will last need to have a huge amount of capital and a footprint that is very large,\" he said.</p><p>Even if UniCredit increasingly acts as an intermediary between different partners, it will still be able to retain relationships with its clients, Mustier said.</p><p>Banking business is \"extremely sticky\" and clients will stay with UniCredit rather than abandoning it for a fintech firm because it represents safety and stability, he added.</p><p>Mustier also spoke out against \"asymmetric\" treatment of banks when it comes to data sharing under new European regulations.</p><p>Under the second European Payment Services Directive or PSD 2, banks are required to open up their data to third parties, but banks do not necessarily get the same level of insight into the data of others:</p><p>\"We are asked to open up our data to everyone, which is fine, that's the rule, but if one of my clients wants me to have access to his data on Amazon or Google that is not possible. I'm going to push super hard with the European Banking Federation to make sure that we have a level playing field. There is no reason why there should be an asymmetric treatment of banks,\" he said.</p><p>PSD 2 came into effect in January 2018.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLEFD-54408135</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLEFD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5F-0W91-F19Y-C047-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">375841</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"485\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL European Financials Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC0004CCW</classCode><className>UNICREDITO ITALIANO SPA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>UCG (WSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>UCG (BIT)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Operations &amp; Strategy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>ST000916T</classCode><className>CUSTOMER RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N518112MM</classCode><className>WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000962</classCode><className>WEBSITES &amp; PORTALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N522110DC</classCode><className>COMMERCIAL BANKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDIyQTAxOUNERDI4NDdFNjkyMEFDOTFFM0MwMTQzNjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI</classCode><className>Commercial Banks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000580</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001536</classCode><className>SEARCH ENGINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC321</classCode><className>ITALY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Google decided to ban the Paytm app due to the Indian company's violation of its policy against \u201csimulated gambling content\u201d, the tech major said.</p><p>\u201cPaytm App is back...We launched a UPI CashBack campaign this morning. Our app got suspended by Google for this. India, you decide if giving cashback is gambling,\u201d Sharma tweeted on Friday evening.</p><p>Some industry experts criticised the takedown pointing to a potential conflict of interest as Google Pay competes with Paytm.</p><p>In a blog post released earlier on Friday, Suzanne Frey, Vice President, Product, Android Security and Privacy, Google, wrote that \u201cwe don't allow online casinos or support any unregulated gambling apps that facilitate sports betting. This includes if an app leads the consumers to an external website that allows them to participate in paid tournaments to win real money or cash prizes, it is a violation of our policies.\u201d</p><p>A representative for Google told ET that Frey's blog post is the company's policy clarification ahead of the IPL and that it states Google's stance against online gambling. Paytm was among other apps against which the tech giant has acted, the spokesperson said. ET was unable to verify which other apps had been taken down along with Paytm from the Play Store.</p><p>\u201cWe are surprised that our app (was) taken off (Play Store). Google has unilaterally taken the decision to remove the app without listening to us,\u201d Vijay Shekar Sharma told ET.</p><p>Other Indian entrepreneurs ET spoke to voiced the need for a domestic App Store to take on the power wielded by the Big Tech firms such as Google and Apple.</p><p>Some industry experts were vocal in their opposition to Google's move, which they said had taken them \u201cby surprise\u201d. Vishwas Patel, chairman of Payments Council of India, said, \u201cPaytm has been at the forefront of enabling payment services for bottom-of-the-pyramid customers. We understand that the move was taken due to violation of Google's gambling policy.\u201d</p><p>People aware of developments told ET that \u201carbitrary flagging\u201d of Indian internet applications by Google could be one of the issues to be raised by the industry when the guidelines for the proposed Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) for payments is finalised by the central bank. \u201cGoogle Pay is in competition with Paytm, so (its action) may be construed to protect GPay interests in the payment industry or maybe get an edge,\u201d said cyber and privacy lawyer Prashant Mali.</p><p>People in the know told ET that Google's action was based on a violation of its Play Store norms by Paytm's new feature which allowed the app's users to avail cashback offers through scratch-cards, allotted on a random basis, linked to the real-time performance of IPL players.</p><p>Industry executives claimed the action, coming a day before the start of the Indian Premier League's 2020 season, had also created \u201cpanic\u201d among customers who used the Paytm app to avail banking services. Paytm has an RBIapproved Payments Bank license.</p><p>Earlier, in a swift response to Google's action, the Noida-based fintech company said it had rolled back the contentious cashback feature on a temporary basis while assuring customers, in a blog post, that their digital balances were safe. Explaining its stand, Paytm confirmed it had \u201creceived communication from Google that they are suspending our app because they believe this to be a violation of their Play Store policies on gambling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile it is clear that all activities on Paytm are completely lawful, we have temporarily removed the cashback component in an effort to meet the Play Store policy requirements. We continue to work with Google to restore the app. We assure all our users that their balances and linked accounts are 100% safe,\u201d the post stated.</p><p>'NOT IN VIOLATION OF INDIAN LAW'</p><p>A Paytm spokesperson told ET earlier on Friday that the newly rolled out feature was not in violation of any Indian law, while pointing out that Google too had such cashback features on its popular UPI app Google Pay. \u201cWe have stickers and cashbacks, Google also has them by the way, where you have a scratch card and you can win cash,\u201d the Paytm spokesperson said. \u201cDoes it violate the law of India? No, it does not. And it is very similar to what Google Pay does,\u201d said the person cited above, adding that it was an issue not limited to Paytm alone and pointed to how Google \u201cregulated\u201d India's internet landscape.</p><p>Experts said Google's action stems from the company's view that IPL-linked cashback feature offered by Paytm violated its stance on non-skill-based fantasy gaming, which is prohibited under Google's anti-gambling policy.</p><p>Mukesh Kumar, engagement manager at consulting firm Redseer said that unlike Apple's app store, the Google Play Store doesn't allow any real money-based gaming application. \u201cTherefore, you can find real money gaming Dream 11, RummyCircle, Adda52 on Apple's app store but not on Google Play store,\u201d he said. In India, gaming is a subject regulated at the state level. While some states allow games such as rummy and poker and count it as a game of skill, others including Telangana, Odisha, Assam, Sikkim and Andhra Pradesh have bans on these games.</p><p>Siddharth Mahajan, Partner at Athena Legal, says that Indian law draws a distinction between games of chance and games of skill. \u201cGames of skill are allowed while games of chance are considered gambling. Many states have specific laws that specifically outlaw gambling and betting while allowing or imposing some restrictions on games of skill as well,\u201d he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTEP-0_8_19092020001008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTEP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W4-6511-DXJR-H2GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382887</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1026\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Google decided to ban the Paytm app due to the Indian company's violation of its policy against \u201csimulated gambling content\u201d, the tech major said.</p><p>\u201cPaytm App is back...We launched a UPI CashBack campaign this morning. Our app got suspended by Google for this. India, you decide if giving cashback is gambling,\u201d Sharma tweeted on Friday evening.</p><p>Some industry experts criticised the takedown pointing to a potential conflict of interest as Google Pay competes with Paytm.</p><p>In a blog post released earlier on Friday, Suzanne Frey, Vice President, Product, Android Security and Privacy, Google, wrote that \u201cwe don't allow online casinos or support any unregulated gambling apps that facilitate sports betting. This includes if an app leads the consumers to an external website that allows them to participate in paid tournaments to win real money or cash prizes, it is a violation of our policies.\u201d</p><p>A representative for Google told ET that Frey's blog post is the company's policy clarification ahead of the IPL and that it states Google's stance against online gambling. Paytm was among other apps against which the tech giant has acted, the spokesperson said. ET was unable to verify which other apps had been taken down along with Paytm from the Play Store.</p><p>\u201cWe are surprised that our app (was) taken off (Play Store). Google has unilaterally taken the decision to remove the app without listening to us,\u201d Vijay Shekar Sharma told ET.</p><p>Other Indian entrepreneurs ET spoke to voiced the need for a domestic App Store to take on the power wielded by the Big Tech firms such as Google and Apple.</p><p>Some industry experts were vocal in their opposition to Google's move, which they said had taken them \u201cby surprise\u201d. Vishwas Patel, chairman of Payments Council of India, said, \u201cPaytm has been at the forefront of enabling payment services for bottom-of-the-pyramid customers. We understand that the move was taken due to violation of Google's gambling policy.\u201d</p><p>People aware of developments told ET that \u201carbitrary flagging\u201d of Indian internet applications by Google could be one of the issues to be raised by the industry when the guidelines for the proposed Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) for payments is finalised by the central bank. \u201cGoogle Pay is in competition with Paytm, so (its action) may be construed to protect GPay interests in the payment industry or maybe get an edge,\u201d said cyber and privacy lawyer Prashant Mali.</p><p>People in the know told ET that Google's action was based on a violation of its Play Store norms by Paytm's new feature which allowed the app's users to avail cashback offers through scratch-cards, allotted on a random basis, linked to the real-time performance of IPL players.</p><p>Industry executives claimed the action, coming a day before the start of the Indian Premier League's 2020 season, had also created \u201cpanic\u201d among customers who used the Paytm app to avail banking services. Paytm has an RBIapproved Payments Bank license.</p><p>Earlier, in a swift response to Google's action, the Noida-based fintech company said it had rolled back the contentious cashback feature on a temporary basis while assuring customers, in a blog post, that their digital balances were safe. Explaining its stand, Paytm confirmed it had \u201creceived communication from Google that they are suspending our app because they believe this to be a violation of their Play Store policies on gambling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile it is clear that all activities on Paytm are completely lawful, we have temporarily removed the cashback component in an effort to meet the Play Store policy requirements. We continue to work with Google to restore the app. We assure all our users that their balances and linked accounts are 100% safe,\u201d the post stated.</p><p>A Paytm spokesperson told ET earlier on Friday that the newly rolled out feature was not in violation of any Indian law, while pointing out that Google too had such cashback features on its popular UPI app Google Pay. \u201cWe have stickers and cashbacks, Google also has them by the way, where you have a scratch card and you can win cash,\u201d the Paytm spokesperson said. \u201cDoes it violate the law of India? No, it does not. And it is very similar to what Google Pay does,\u201d said the person cited above, adding that it was an issue not limited to Paytm alone and pointed to how Google \u201cregulated\u201d India's internet landscape.</p><p>Experts said Google's action stems from the company's view that IPL-linked cashback feature offered by Paytm violated its stance on non-skill-based fantasy gaming, which is prohibited under Google's anti-gambling policy.</p><p>Mukesh Kumar, engagement manager at consulting firm Redseer said that unlike Apple's app store, the Google Play Store doesn't allow any real money-based gaming application. \u201cTherefore, you can find real money gaming Dream 11, RummyCircle, Adda52 on Apple's app store but not on Google Play store,\u201d he said. In India, gaming is a subject regulated at the state level. While some states allow games such as rummy and poker and count it as a game of skill, others including Telangana, Odisha, Assam, Sikkim and Andhra Pradesh have bans on these games.</p><p>Siddharth Mahajan, Partner at Athena Legal, says that Indian law draws a distinction between games of chance and games of skill. \u201cGames of skill are allowed while games of chance are considered gambling. Many states have specific laws that specifically outlaw gambling and betting while allowing or imposing some restrictions on games of skill as well,\u201d he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTEP-0_5_19092020001005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTEP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W4-6511-DXJR-H2J0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382887</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1020\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

The year where we collectively rebuild trust back in our systems and our society,\" he will argue.<br/> Online ad giants Facebook and Google have increasingly found themselves on the hook for enabling the spread of socially divisive, offensive and at times out-and-out illegal content via their platforms - in no small part as a consequence of the popularity of their content-sharing hubs.<br/> While the Internet is filled with all sorts of awful stuff, in its darkest corners, the mainstream reach of platforms like Facebook and YouTube puts them squarely in the political firing line for all sorts of content issues - from political disinformation to socially divisive hate speech.<br/> The fact Facebook and Google are also the chief financial beneficiaries of online ad spending - together accounting for around 60 per cent of online ad spending in the US, for example - makes it difficult for them to dodge the charge that their businesses directly benefit from divisive and exploitative content - all the way from clickbait to fake news to full blown online extremism.<br/>Facebook's 2016 dismissal of concerns about fake news impacting democracy as a \"pretty crazy idea\" has certainly not aged well. And CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has since admitted his platform is broken and made it his personal goal for 2018 to \"fix Facebook\".<br/> Both companies faced a growing backlash last year - with a number of advertisers and brands pulling ads from YouTube over concerns about the types of content that their marketing messages were being served alongside, thanks to the programmatic (i.e. automatic) nature of the ad placement. The platform also took renewed flak for the type of content it routinely serves up to kids.<br/> While Facebook got a political grilling over hosting Kremlin disinformation - though Russia's online dis-ops clearly sprawl across multiple tech platforms. But again, Facebook's massive reach gifts it a greater share of blame - as the most effective channel (at least that we currently know of) for political disinformation muck spreading. (Last fall, for example, it was forced to admit that ~80,000 pieces of Russian-backed content may have been viewed by 126M Facebook users during the 2016 US election.)<br/> Last year Google responded with alacrity to boycotts by its own advertisers, saying it would expands controls for brands to give them more say over where their ads appeared on YouTube, and by taking \"a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content\" - including demonitizing more types of videos. Though it has continued to disappoint politicians demanding better moderation.<br/> As part of its attempts to de-risk the user generated content that its business relies on, and thus avoid the risk of further spooking already spooked advertisers, YouTube recently began removing videos of the so-called 'Tide Pod Challenge' - i.e. where people film themselves trying to consume laundry detergent. Videos which it had previously left up online.<br/> Incidentally Tide Pods aren't a Unilever brand but their parent company, Procter &amp; Gamble, also roasted social media firms last year - calling for them to \"grow up\" and slamming the \"non-traditional media supply chain\" for being \"murky at best, and fraudulent at worst\".<br/>Unilever's Weed also takes aim at ad fraud in his speech, noting how it's partnered with IBM to pilot a new blockchain tech for advertising - which he touts as having \"the potential to drastically reduce advertising fraud by recording how media is purchased, delivered and interacted with by target audiences, providing reliable measurement metrics\". (Can blockchain really fix click fraud? That Unilever is actively entertaining the idea arguably shows how far trust levels in the digital ad space have fallen.)<br/> But the main message is tilted at social media giants' need to \"build social responsibility\" - and invest in trust and transparency to avoid damaging the precious substance known as 'brand trust' which these tech giants' revenue-feeding digital advertisers depend on.<br/> Though, blockchain experiments aside, Unilever seems rather less publicly clear on exactly what it thinks tech giants should do to vanquish the toxic content their business models have (inadvertently or otherwise) been financially incentivizing.<br/> Governments in Europe have been leaning on social media giants to accelerate development of tech tools that can automatically flag and even remove problem content (such as hate speech) before it has a chance to spread - though that approach is hardly uncontroversial, and critics argue it whiffs of censorship.<br/> While, earlier this month, Germany's national competition regulator announced a probe of the online ad sector - citing concerns that a lack of transparency could be skewing market conditions.<br/> Weed's message to social media can be summed up as: This is a problem we'll work with you to fix, but you need to agree to work on fixing it. \"As a brand-led business, Unilever needs its consumers to have trust in our brands,\" he'll say. \"We can't do anything to damage that trust -- including the choice of channels and platforms we use. So, 2018 is the year when social media must win trust back.\"<br/>Unilever is making three specific \"commitments\" relating to its digital media supply chain:<br/> that it will not invest in \"platforms or environments that do not protect our children or which create division in society, and promote anger or hate\", further emphasizing: \"We will prioritise investing only in responsible platforms that are committed to creating a positive impact in society\"     that it is committed to creating \"responsible content\" - with an initial focus on tackling gender stereotypes in advertising     that it will push for what it dubs \"responsible infrastructure\", saying it will only partner with organizations \"which are committed to creating better digital infrastructure, such as aligning around one measurement system and improving the consumer experience\"<br/> So, while the company is not yet issuing an explicit ultimatum to Facebook and Google, it's certainly putting them on notice that the political pressure they've been facing could absolutely turn into a major commercial headache too, if they don't take tackling online muck spreading seriously.<br/> tl;dr massive, mainstream success has a flip side. And boy is big tech going to feel it this year.<br/>Facebook and Google both declined to comment on Unilever's intervention.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10381914</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RMT-KDS1-DYDW-73MB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1329\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 13, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002HQ4</classCode><className>UNILEVER PLC/NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS325620 TOILET PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS325611 SOAP &amp;

There are many things in there that are good to see -- in large part improving transparency around what some companies do with all your data, and giving end users some more control over that data. Indeed, we're curious to see how the inevitable lawsuits[1] play out and if it will lead companies to be more considerate in how they handle data. </p><p>However, we've also noted, repeatedly, our concerns about the wider impact of the GDPR, which appears to go way too far in some areas, in which decisions were made that may have made sense in a vacuum, but where they could have massive unintended consequences. We've already discussed how the GDPR's codification of the \"Right to be Forgotten\" is likely to lead to mass censorship[2] in the EU (and possibly around the globe). That fear remains. But, it's also becoming clear that some potentially useful innovation may not be able to work under the GDPR. A recent NY Times article that details how various big tech companies are preparing[3] for the GDPR has a throwaway paragraph in the middle that highlights an example of this potential overreach. Specifically, Facebook is using AI to try to catch on if someone is planning to harm themselves... but it won't launch that feature in the EU out of a fear that it would breach the GDPR as it pertains to \"medical\" information. Really.Last November, for instance, the company unveiled a program that uses artificial intelligence to monitor Facebook users for signs of self-harm. But it did not open the program[4] to users in Europe, where the company would have had to ask people for permission to access sensitive health data, including about their mental state.Now... you can argue that this is actually a good thing. Maybe we don't want a company like Facebook delving into our mental states. You can probably make a strong case for that. But... there's also something to the idea of preventing someone who may harm or kill themselves from doing so. And that's something that feels like it was not considered much by the drafters of the GDPR. How do you balance these kinds of questions, where there are certain innovations that most people probably want, and which could be incredibly helpful (indeed, potentially saving lives), but don't fit with how the GDPR is designed to \"protect\" data privacy. Is data protection in this context more important than the life of someone who is suicidal? These are not easy calls, but it's not clear at all that the drafters of the GDPR even took these tradeoff questions into consideration -- and that should worry those of us who are excited about potential innovations to improve our lives, and who worry about what may never see the light of day because of these rules. That's not to say that companies should be free to do whatever they want. There are, obviously LOTS of reasons to be concerned and worried about just how much data some large companies are collecting on everyone. But it frequently feels like people are acting as if any data collection is bad, and thus needs to be blocked or stopped, without taking the time to recognize just what kind of innovations we may lose.Permalink[5] | Comments[6] | Email This Story[7] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171201/07371138716/top-eu-privacy-campaigner-says-he-wants-lots-money-none-your-business.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171201/07371138716/top-eu-privacy-campaigner-says-he-wants-lots-money-none-your-business.shtml</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151029/07290832661/how-eus-proposed-new-privacy-rules-will-be-tool-massive-censorship.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151029/07290832661/how-eus-proposed-new-privacy-rules-will-be-tool-massive-censorship.shtml</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/technology/europe-data-privacy-rules.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/technology/europe-data-privacy-rules.html</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/11/getting-our-community-help-in-real-time/\">https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/11/getting-our-community-help-in-real-time/</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180128/21505439105/unintended-consequences-eus-new-internet-privacy-rules-facebook-wont-use-ai-to-catch-suicidal-users.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180128/21505439105/unintended-consequences-eus-new-internet-privacy-rules-facebook-wont-use-ai-to-catch-suicidal-users.shtml</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180128/21505439105/unintended-consequences-eus-new-internet-privacy-rules-facebook-wont-use-ai-to-catch-suicidal-users.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180128/21505439105/unintended-consequences-eus-new-internet-privacy-rules-facebook-wont-use-ai-to-catch-suicidal-users.shtml#comments</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180128/21505439105/unintended-consequences-eus-new-internet-privacy-rules-facebook-wont-use-ai-to-catch-suicidal-users.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180128/21505439105/unintended-consequences-eus-new-internet-privacy-rules-facebook-wont-use-ai-to-catch-suicidal-users.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT1023051517340004371251761700085</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RJ0-BCP1-JCMN-Y4KD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><timeReceived>7:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 30, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Attempting to filter out fake and form comments from 22 million submitted in a 2017 proceeding, he focused on \"semantic outliers\" and matched 646,041 unique comments to addresses in particular congressional districts. \"A manual analysis of 1,000 of these comments showed that 99.7% of the comments opposed the repeal,\" said Singel's 44-page report Monday. \"It shouldn't come as a surprise that nearly every single one of those comments that wasn't written by a telecom lobbyist opposed the repeal,\" said Evan Greer, Fight for the Future deputy director. </p><p>Noting the study's findings, Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel tweeted that the FCC \"rolled back the rules anyway. Washington is not listening to the American public. It's not right -- and we need to keep up the fight.\" FCC spokespersons didn't comment Tuesday. CIS \"is pretty much a wholly-owned subsidiary of Google, one of net neutrality's largest supporters. So, the study is corporate PR,\" emailed Peter Flaherty, National Legal and Policy Center chairman: \"The whole public comment process was hopelessly debased. I'm not sure what the Big Tech firms are now trying to prove. I think the Commissioners had enough input -- both fake and real -- to understand the arguments.\" Singel responded: \"None of the work that CIS does on net neutrality is funded by corporate donations, and this study was not commissioned by anyone, let alone Google.\" CIS discloses that Google is one of several donors but \"does not accept corporate funding for its network neutrality-related work.\" Singel says his funding comes from Stanford Law School, as disclosed here. \"The report I released relies on a publicly available dataset which was analyzed with disclosed methods (including code) that make it easy for anyone to replicate the results or criticize its methodology,\" Singel emailed. \"As a former journalist who once wrote an analysis piece for Wired called 'Why Google Became a Carrier-Humping Net Neutrality Surrender Monkey,' I find the accusation that my work is controlled by Google both hilarious and desperate.\" New York State's attorney general Tuesday vowed to investigate fake comments (see 1810160071).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TH3-VKP1-DYRJ-00M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"392\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 17, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NATIONAL LEGAL &amp;

For more than five hours, the 15 members of an antitrust panel in the House lobbed questions and repeatedly interrupted and talked over Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google.    It was the first congressional hearing for some time where Democrats and Republicans acted as if they had a common foe, though for different reasons. Democratic lawmakers criticized the tech companies for buying start-ups to stifle them and for unfairly using their data hoards to clone and kill off competitors, while Republicans questioned whether the platforms had muzzled conservative viewpoints and were unpatriotic.    ALSO READ: Pichai says 'Google cares', Bezos 'can't remember' in Congressional hearing    \u201cAs gatekeepers to the digital economy, these platforms enjoy the power to pick winners and losers, shake down small businesses and enrich themselves while choking off competitors,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee. \u201cOur founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\u201d    In response, Mr. Pichai, Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Cook and Mr. Bezos, who testified via videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic, were forced to strike a more humble chord. They presented themselves as participants in enormously competitive and fast-changing digital marketplaces, and they evaded questions about the decisions that turned their companies into giants.    \u201cWe approach this process with respect and humility, but we make no concession on the facts,\u201d said Mr. Cook at the outset of his testimony.    Not since Microsoft stood trial in the late 1990s for antitrust charges have tech chief executives been under such a microscope for the power of their businesses. With echoes of the trustbusting of U.S. Steel and Standard Oil more than a century ago and AT&amp;T in 1984, the hearing underlined the government\u2019s recognition that this cohort of tech companies \u2014 which wield immense control over commerce, communications and public discourse \u2014 had become the new trusts of the internet age.    President Trump also used the event to rail against tech power. In a post on Twitter before the hearing began, he said that he would issue executive orders to rein in the companies if Congress did not.    From its conception, the House antitrust hearing was set to be a spectacle, lining up four of the world\u2019s most powerful executives \u2014 with two of them among the planet\u2019s richest individuals \u2014 to answer largely hostile questions together. While the joint appearance limited sustained questioning of any one executive, it created a side-by-side image that recalled the 1994 congressional hearing of top American tobacco executives, who said they did not believe that cigarettes were addictive.    House lawmakers, who had opened an investigation into the tech companies in June 2019, made the most of it. Representative Jerry Nadler, Democrat of New York, confronted Mr. Zuckerberg with the C.E.O.\u2019s own emails, saying they showed a plot to take out a young competitor. Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, said Google was biased and asked Mr. Pichai whether the company would change its products to help elect Joseph R. Biden for president.    In one of the sharpest exchanges, Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, confronted Mr. Bezos on accusations that an Amazon lawyer had lied to the committee about how the company develops its own products. She asked him to answer whether it misused data with a yes or no.    \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question yes or no,\u201d said Mr. Bezos, appearing rattled.         ALSO READ: 'They have too much power': US lawmakers grill Big Tech as Trump weighs in    Yet while the hearing was ripe with theater, any impact will be limited by antitrust laws that were created a century ago and that are imperfect for corralling internet firms. Since the 1980s, enforcement officials have used the notion of consumer welfare as the predominant test for antitrust violations \u2014 generally meaning that if prices are not going up, the markets are most likely competitive enough. The tech giants have generally not driven up prices of digital services or consumer goods; many do not charge at all for services like Google Maps or Instagram.    While Democrats at the hearing indicated they were more inclined to change antitrust law, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, said he did not think the laws needed to change. Ultimately, Congress doesn\u2019t have the power to break up the companies.    Still, the proceedings provided fuel to other investigations of the tech companies by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. The Justice Department is expected to soon announce charges against Google accusing it of abusing its dominance in online advertising, people with knowledge of the investigation have said. The F.T.C. is preparing to question Mr. Zuckerberg under oath in its investigation of Facebook\u2019s grip over social networking and acquisitions of nascent rivals.    \u201cThis is a critical juncture in how the Washington policy clash with the titans of Silicon Valley unfolds,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official and a special adviser to the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.    Regulators around the world are also moving to limit the power of the tech giants. Europe has led the charge with antitrust investigations and Margrethe Vestager, the region\u2019s top trustbuster, recently vowed to take a harder line on the companies. On Wednesday, Turkey passed legislation giving its government sweeping new powers to regulate social media content.    The hearing on Wednesday was a turnabout from just a few years ago, when Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple were emblems of national pride for their innovation and growth. But the expanding reach of the four \u2014 which are involved in everything from smartphones to e-commerce to digital payments \u2014 and their stumbles in misinformation, privacy, election interference and labor issues have increasingly raised hackles.    Even so, the companies have continued growing as more people live their lives online, with all of them expected to post solid financial performances when they report quarterly earnings on Thursday.    The hearing was made more bizarre by Mr. Bezos, Mr. Cook, Mr. Pichai and Mr. Zuckerberg dialing in remotely using Cisco\u2019s Webex videoconferencing service. Lawmakers \u2014 who mostly appeared in person wearing masks in a House hearing room \u2014 faced empty chairs and a jumbo screen with the faces of the executives, who looked soberly into their cameras.    Lawmakers nonetheless drilled down on key moments when the companies had gained power or allegedly squeezed consumers, competitors and small businesses. They directed most of their questions to Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Pichai, then to Mr. Bezos, according to a tally by The New York Times. Mr. Cook was asked the fewest questions.    The tone of the hearing was set with Mr. Cicilline\u2019s very first question, directed at Mr. Pichai. \u201cWhy does Google steal content from honest businesses?\u201d Mr. Cicilline asked. Mr. Pichai replied: \u201cMr. Chairman, with respect, I disagree with that characterization.\u201d    Mr. Pichai was repeatedly asked about Google\u2019s dominance in search and how the company was potentially trying to keep users within \u201ca walled garden.\u201d He said Google had many competitors for specific categories of search, such as shopping.    Mr. Zuckerberg was asked about Facebook emails where executives discussed the company\u2019s 2012 acquisition of Instagram as a possible strategy to take out a nascent competitor. Mr. Zuckerberg said that, in fact, Instagram\u2019s success had never been guaranteed and was the result of Facebook\u2019s investment in the product.    When lawmakers asked Mr. Bezos if Amazon had bullied small merchants, he said that it was \u201cnot how we operate the business\u201d \u2014 before being confronted by an audio recording of a bookseller begging him directly for relief.    In response to questions about whether Apple favored some app developers over others, Mr. Cook said there were \u201copen and transparent rules\u201d that applied \u201cevenly to everyone.\u201d    David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, a project-management company that has battled with both Google and Apple over their market power, said the hearing would be irrelevant if the government did not act to rein in the tech giants.    \u201cWhat we ultimately need is relief. We don\u2019t just need a historic moment. We need this to lead to legislation and regulation and enforcement,\u201d he said.    But, Mr. Heinemeier Hansson added, \u201cthankfully I\u2019ve never been more optimistic for that than I am right now.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata
