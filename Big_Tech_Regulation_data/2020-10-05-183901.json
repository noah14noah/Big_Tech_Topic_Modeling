It is about getting re-elected \u2014 and there are few better ways to rally his base than to rail on California liberals in Silicon Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president has little to lose by taking a shot at the San Francisco tech company and outfits such as Facebook because the Bay Area, as well as Silicon Valley and California in general, overwhelmingly supports Democrats, contributes to their campaigns and dislikes Trump. So Trump revs up his base by ripping on Big Tech \u2014 even though Big Tech helped get him elected.</p><p> Who said that? Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale.</p><p> Parscale said the Trump campaign raised much of its $250 million online haul in 2016 through a robust Facebook advertising push. He also said Trump had masterfully used Twitter to steer the media narrative during the campaign. The president is still using his 80 million-follower Twitter feed to shape the story \u2014 his feud with Jack Dorsey and company is competing this week for top billing with the nearly unfathomable milestone of 100,000 Americans killed by COVID-19.</p><p> \"Facebook and Twitter were the reason we won this thing,\" Parscale told Wired magazine in the days after Trump's 2016 election. \"Twitter for Mr. Trump. And Facebook for fundraising.\"</p><p> But that sort of nuance doesn't rile up Trump's GOP base. Railing on tech companies as biased against conservatives does.</p><p> A Morning Consult poll last year of Republicans found that 48% felt Facebook was biased against conservatives and 36% felt Twitter was anti-conservative. And that was before Twitter stuck \"fact checks\" debunking a pair of Trump's tweets this week making incorrect claims about California's plans to have a nearly all-mail election in November. That's what triggered Trump's order Thursday that would remove a provision of a 24-year-old federal law protecting tech companies from lawsuits over content on their platforms.</p><p> \"We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers,\" Trump said before signing the order, referring to the \"tech monopoly\" that has \"unchecked power.\"</p><p> To Trump, railing on Silicon Valley generates the same reaction as pounding other \"elites\" like the media and Democratic governors who don't want to open the their states for business quickly enough. It's a well-worn tactic that has kept his conservative base with him through three-plus years in office.</p><p> \"California is an easy target for conservatives because of the image that we're 'freaky San Francisco' and Hollywood people,\" said Donnie Fowler, a former Democratic operative who has worked to bridge the gap between Silicon Valley and Washington for two decades and is now the CEO at Tech4America. \"It reinforces their messages.\"</p><p> Trump's latest blast at Silicon Valley started with another shot at California. On Tuesday, Trump took on Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to mail ballots to all California voters for the November election, breaking at least temporarily from the detente the two had stuck to during the pandemic.</p><p> Trump tweeted that \"there is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed.\"</p><p>Twitter pointed out, accurately in its fact check, that that is false. Evidence of voter fraud \"is very rare\" anywhere, including California, UC Irvine election law Professor Rick Hasen told The Chronicle's \"It's All Political\" podcast.</p><p> \"In the five states that use all-mail balloting \u2014 which include some heavily Republican states like Utah \u2014 the amount of election crime generally is very low,\" Hasen said.</p><p> That didn't matter to the president. Trump exploded after Twitter attached its fact check, tweeting that \"Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom.\"</p><p> But Zack Graves, policy director at the libertarian-leaning Lincoln Network think tank that links Silicon Valley and Washington, said there's a disconnect between how many Republicans feel about bias at technology companies and how they feel about regulating them.</p><p> That Morning Consult poll last year of Republicans, which his group commissioned, found that 41% of respondents agreed that \"technology platforms should be free from government regulation regardless of political or ideological bias, because they are private companies.\" Forty percent said tech companies \"need to be regulated by the government to stop political or ideological bias.\"</p><p> \"My view is that conservatives are not upset by content moderation itself, they're distrustful of progressives in San Francisco having massive and opaque power over it,\" Graves said in an email Thursday.</p><p>Harvard government Professor Thomas Patterson doesn't think Trump \"is that fearful of Twitter. It's just a good excuse to go after them.\"</p><p> \"But he is very fearful, and rightfully so, of vote by mail,\" said Patterson, author of the new book \"Is the Republican Party Destroying Itself? And Why It Needs to Reclaim Its Conservative Ideals.\"</p><p> Why? Patterson thinks it's because Trump believes it could hurt his re-election chances by making it easier for more people to vote.</p><p> \"If you ever agreed to it,\" Trump told Fox News in March, \"you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.\"</p><p> That, too, is untrue. Just ask California's newest member of Congress, Rep. Mike Garcia. The Republican businessman easily won a nearly all-mail House election in Southern California this month, flipping a seat that had been held by a Democrat, just hours after Trump told reporters that mail-in ballots were \"subject to tremendous corruption. Tremendous corruption, cheating.\"</p><p> \"And so,\" the president said, \"I'm against it.\"</p><p> Joe Garofoli is The San Francisco Chronicle's senior political writer.

Live from CNN London I'm Hala Gorani. Tonight, the White House is trying to push back against a shocking new book, shedding light on life inside the Trump presidency. We just heard from President Trump in the last few minutes. We will tell you what he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, tonight, exclusive new details on a case that soured relations between Russia and the West. The U.K. in particular. Police named the suspects in the Salisbury poisoning. And they are Russian nationals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, Donald Trump's pick to be a new Supreme Court Judge is getting grilled on Capitol Hill once again today. We will have the latest on that.</p><p>President Trump and his allies are trying to discredit journalist Bob Woodward. And the dysfunctional White House he describes in his new book \"Fear\". The U.S. president just blasted it as a work of total fiction. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's a work of fiction. Already General Mattis has come out very, very strongly. And I think you know General Mattis. He does what he wants to do. He's a very independent guy. He was insulted by the remarks that were attributed to him and he came out with a very strong statement. I assume you read it I hope you read it last night.</p><p>General John Kelly very same thing. He said he is insulted by what they said. He's right here. He's insulted by -- he couldn't believe what they said. He put out a very, very strong statement. And many others, and many statements are coming out. The book is a work of fiction. If you look back at Woodward's past he had the same problem with other presidents he likes to get publicity, sell some book. It was put out to interfere in my opinion with the Kavanaugh hearings which I don't think it has done because so many have come out against it.</p><p>Yule joule (ph) is another one. He's very insulted by the book and what was stated in the book. We run -- we do run a strong White House. There is no question about it. And we are doing things that nobody else has ever been able to do. And our country is stronger now than it has ever been. And in a very short period of time, $700 billion being spent on the military in the next year, 716. $716 billion. We will actually be far stronger than we have ever been, and that's what we needed to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: And that's how president Donald Trump in the White House -- he was in the oval office, in fact, hosting the Emir of Kuwait today. He was asked about Syria, and reports that he had discussed as assassinating the president of Syria. We will get to that in a moment. Obviously, we have been reporting about this book and its contents for 24 hours or so of the it depicts a crazy town White House in which staffers question Mr. Trump's intelligence, his integrity, even his fitness to be president at all.</p><p>Let's go to the White House where Boris Sanchez has the latest details on the reaction to the book. Clearly the president has -- he said over and over again in that oval office moment there when he was hosting the Emir of Kuwait that it is a work of total fiction. But this is not Omarosa, a reality television star. This is Bob Woodward. One of the most respected, celebrated journalists in American history.</p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Hala. The White House is going to face an uphill battle trying to draw into question the credibility of Bob Woodward if only because of his legacy. He has long been a Washington, DC. reporter, somebody who covered along with his partner, Carl Bernstein, the Nixon administration and uncovered the Watergate conspiracy.</p><p>He has had consistent tell-all books for about eight presidents now. Even the president has defended him in the past when he wrote a book that wasn't exactly flattering to the Obama administration. In all, it is not like Omarosa. It is not like who wrote \"Fire and Fury\" a few months ago and published that to the chagrin this White House.</p><p>We should point out sources have told CNN that the president is now asking loyal aides to dig in for information on who would Woodward's sources are. Despite the fact that he's dismissing these claims as bogus, he is simultaneously trying the find out who Woodward spoke to, where he got these quotes. We are also told that the president was pleased specifically with the denials coming from some of the figures currently within his administration, Department of Defense Secretary James Mattis, Chief of Staff John Kelly, and as you heard there, his chief attorney, Rudy Giuliani.</p><p>[15:05:00] But the president is also noticing, according to sources, who is remaining silent. There are a number of former administration officials that were quoted by Bob Woodward. Notably Staff Secretary Robert Porter as well as a former NSA Director HR McMaster and others, Gary Cohn, the national economic chair. So, there are a number of people here, a long list of people who have left the White House on less than graceful terms who the president clearly is upset with. That's why you hear Sarah Sanders repeatedly saying that some of this book, the negative content in it could be attributed to disgruntled former employees.</p><p>GORANI: Is this going to convince people who are likely to believe what's in the book abuse Bob Woodward wrote it, this pushback?</p><p>SANCHEZ: It's unclear. As you well know, Trump supporters are a very coalesced base. More often than not the president has fended off accusations or allegations of wrongdoing or of his unfitness for office by simply dismissing it as fake news. And continuously he has promoted conspiracy theories. The list goes on and on of the kind of defenses he has had for less than flattering stories.</p><p>This would be interesting to see what the base responds to, specifically one portion where Bob Woodward alleges the president sort of made fun of his Attorney General Jeff Sessions calling him mentally retarded and faking a southern accent, calling him a dumb southerner. Again, according to the Woodward's reporting. The president specifically tweeted about that dismissing it as something said to divide. In the south, Jeff Sessions is a popular person and that's where the president draws his base.</p><p>GORANI: Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee says if he's confirmed he will owe his loyalty to the U.S. Constitution and not to the president of the United States. Brett Kavanaugh is undergoing some tough grilling on day two of his confirmation hearings on capitol hill. The grilling coming from Democratic senators. Senators are questioning him on a number of issues including presidential powers and judicial independence. Kavanaugh was asked flat out if he would have trouble ruling against a president who appointed him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NOMINEE: No one is above the law in our constitutional system. Federalist 69 Hamilton makes clear all the ways the executive branch as designed by the framers of the constitution was different from the monarchy. Under our system of government, the executive branch is subject to the law, subject to the court system. And that's an important part of Federalist 69. It's an important part of the constitutional structure.</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA: Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?</p><p>KAVANAUGH: That's a hypothetical question about what would be an elaboration or a difference from U.S. V Nixon's precise holding. And I think going with the Justice Ginsburg principle which is really not the Justice Ginsburg alone principle. It's everyone's principle on the current Supreme Court. And as a matter of the canons of judicial independence I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question.</p><p>GORANI: So, can't give answers on hypotheticals. And Kavanaugh answered in that way when confronted with hypothetical situations and asked about hypothetical cases and how he might rule. Because he also side stepped a question about whether a president can pardon himself. But a lot of other issues are on the table as well from assault weapons to abortion rights. That's one that some activists in the United States are concerned about.</p><p>Let's bring in CNN Justice Correspondent, Jessica Schneider with more. What did we learn about Brett Kavanaugh's position, his potential -- how he might potentially rule on some of these hot topics like abortion rights for instance?</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well you heard of the right there, Hala. Brett Kavanaugh refusing to answer hypotheticals. Also, saying he will stick with precedent. But that's really not satisfying Democrats. This is certain to be a long day on Capitol Hill. We are already six hours into this. It is a likely to stretch at least six hours more. As you saw there, each senator on the committee, they are grilling Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>They have been pressing him on a range of issues. But at the forefront has really been Judge Kavanaugh's views on the power of the presidency. Each time he has been pressed, Kavanaugh has deferred. Democrats have asked him a number of questions like can the president pardon himself? Can the president pardon others? Should the president comply with a subpoena? And of course, each and every question Judge Kavanaugh said, well, I can't answer hypotheticals.</p><p>Now, to be fair, that is a very common tactic used by judges up for confirmation. They just say they can't deal with any cases that aren't before them. But of course, it is especially poignant at this moment in time, Hala with the president embroiled in controversy and many of his former associates facing legal challenges. We just saw two of them plead guilty in recent weeks.</p><p>[15:10:00] Kavanaugh here has really refused to budge. He said he will take each and every case as it comes. One thing that's interesting, though, he did note he has great respect for the 1974 decision U.S. V Nixon. Of course, that required President Nixon to hand over those tapes and other documents that eventually led to his impeachment and resignation. Really, Hala, what we are seeing from Judge Kavanaugh is really a scholarly confirmation hearing.</p><p>Every time he is peppered with questions he kind of goes back, talks about his long history of legal decisions. He relies on the Constitution. He cited the Federalist Papers numerous times. Senators seem to be getting a bit antsy on the Democratic side. Really that's what judges in this situation do. That's what Judge Kavanaugh is doing. They are likely to continue peppering him with these questions and maybe not getting many questions answered as we continue on here.</p><p>GORANI: Let's get perspective from Joey Jackson, CNN legal analyst. If Kavanaugh has said the president is not above the law, how can he justify not answering a hypothetical such as must the president comply with a subpoena?</p><p>JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Always good to see you, Hala. Listen, this is what nominees customarily do. They never commit to answering what may in fact be an issue before the court. For good reason. Because then would you be bound by what you said there? If you don't and you pivot, would you have been lying? And the other thing is would you potentially have to recuse yourself.</p><p>He could be grilled until midnight tonight or midnight on Friday, the fact is he is going to stick to the script. He is going to whip out the pocket Constitution and say this is what I'm bound to, interpretation the Constitution. If you have a legitimate argument and you have the winning argument, you will be ruled in favor of. If you don't, you will not. So as much as you might press -- and we can talk all afternoon, Hala, in terms of where he stands on abortion, where he stands on gun rights, where he stands anywhere. He is just not saying.</p><p>GORANI: What's the point of a confirmation hearing if you can't get any insight. Here's what he said -- he was asked about abortion rights. Here's how he answered, Joey.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FEINSTEIN: What would you say your position today is on a woman's right to choose?</p><p>KAVANAUGH: As a Judge --</p><p>FEINSTEIN: As a Judge.</p><p>KAVANAUGH: As a Judge, it is an important precedent of the Supreme Court, by it I mean Roe V. Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey. It has been reaffirmed many times. Casey is precedent on precedent, which itself is an important factor to remember. And I understand the significance of the issue, the jurisprudential issue and I understand the significance as best I can. I always try, and I do hear of the real-world affects of that decision as I try to do of all the decisions of my court and of the Supreme Court.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Joey, what does that tell you?</p><p>JACKSON: Nothing.</p><p>GORANI: Roe v. Wade is precedent. Then there was another case that was precedent on precedent. He says he respects judicial precedence.</p><p>JACKSON: It tells me nothing. Let me tell you why. Judge Neil Gorsuch sat before nomination hearings. You will recall he was recently nominated to the court and said similarly he respects precedent. We should remind viewers that precedent is everything. Overstating it a little but so, so, so significant in law because there is a principle called stare decisis that means it has been decided. Judges are bounds by precedent.</p><p>Judge Gorsuch said precedent is important, I recognize how precedent is precedent. What did he do? He sat on the court and overturned a 40-year precedent related to labor unions called the Janus decision. If we had taken him at his word that precedent is precedent he would have upheld the right for people to decide that they could pay union dues. He did not. And so simply saying what he says is something we all say as lawyers. Precedent is important. But he is not telling you how he will rule.</p><p>[15:15:00] GORANI: He is not bound by it. He has written in the past that presidents</p><p>shouldn't -- he believes it's distracting to criminally investigate sitting presidents. Presidents I should say, not precedents. I mean, this would usually be kind of a throwaway comment but not for the Trump administration and the Trump presidency, embroiled in this Mueller probe that's been going on for months and months. What did that tell you?</p><p>JACKSON: I thought the answer was very probative to where he stands. He said listen I wrote a law review article. It's not my position as relates to the constitution. I just wrote a law review article and I am not going to answer the question moving forward as to what I would do. I am not going to answer the question as to whether the president can pardon himself. All of these questions are side stepped. What we are left with is an intelligent man who has a distinguished career, a distinguished background, a beautiful family, but on the question of whether will you be on issues that effect everyone? It's really a mystery.</p><p>You have nine members on the Supreme Court. Five of them -- he would be the fifth who are highly conservative. It could affect abortion, immigration, gun control. So, this is a major moment in our history. For him not to commit to answering these questions, you know, it certainly is problematic to say the least. Although there is precedent for that as it relates to other nominees who have appeared before the committee.</p><p>GORANI: Joey Jackson as always, appreciate having you on the program.</p><p>Still to come tonight, caught on camera, named as suspects, and facing enough evidence to be charged. British authorities unveil remarkable new details about the men thought to be behind an attack that is testing relations between London and Moscow.</p><p>Also, Brett Kavanaugh wasn't the only person grilled by lawmakers today. Social media executives were summoned as well. Big tech might be in for more headaches coming up.</p><p>GORANI: Our next story is not so much the spy who came in from the cold. But the spy story coming into the cold light of day. Step by step, image by remarkable image. Chilling new details are emerge being a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter right here in Britain. The U.K. now says it has the evidence to charge two Russian nationals. Saying they were almost certainly acting on orders from on high. Phil Black has more from Salisbury.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:20:00] PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Two Russian men arrive at London's airport on March 2nd. Their mission, assassination. Investigators tracked down their movements over several days using security video. That night they stayed in this east London hotel. The following day, March 3rd, they made a suspected reconnaissance run to Salisbury, traveling by train and returning to London to sleep at the same hotel. Sunday, March 4th. They traveled to Salisbury again. Police believe soon after this image was captured they sprayed the nerve agent Novichok on the front door of Sergei Skripal's home. That afternoon he and his daughter collapsed on a bench in the town center, critically ill.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED POLICEMAN: We are releasing these photographs of them.</p><p>BLACK: By that time police say the suspects had already travelled back to London to board a flight out of Heathrow airport. At that point they thought it was a success. But they were wrong. The targets Sergie and Yulia survived.</p><p>Police officer, Detective Sargent Nick Bailey was also poisoned. He is recovering. A local woman Dawn Sturgis lost her life because of a plot that had nothing to do with her. Months later, the 44-year-old mother of three and her partner found what they thought was a small bottle of fancy perfume. She sprayed it on her wrists. She collapsed that day. A week later, she died. Her husband also felt ill but survived. Police say the bottle and its packages were clever things used to smuggle and deploy the same nerve agent used against the Skripals.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED POLICEMAN: We don't believe the couple were targeted but became victims as a result of the recklessness in which the nerve agent was disposed of.</p><p>BLACK: They were traveling on real passports using the names Alexander Petrov and Rusland Boshirov. Britain's Prime Minister says a body of intelligence shows these men are members of Russia's military intelligence agency the GIU.</p><p>THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER, U.K.: It is a highly disciplined organization with a well-established chain of command. This was not a rogue operation. It was it was almost certainly approved outside the GIU at a senior level of the Russian state.</p><p>BLACK: Police have not revealed the suspected motive behind any of this in Russia has denied any involvement. But the GIU is also the Russian intelligence agency Sergei Skripal officially worked for while he was spying for Britain. Coincidence? Or proof Russia spies never forget or forgive a traitor?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Whoever is responsible, Phil Black joins me now from Salisbury. They actually put it in a perfume bottle knowing full well somebody could find of it. Phil Black is in Salisbury. Matthew Chance has reaction from Moscow. Phil, what are U.K. authorities doing now to try to apprehend these two individuals?</p><p>BLACK: The truth is, Hala, they don't know where they are. They have issued a domestic arrest warrant. They are seeking an EU arrest warrant as well. It would limit their ability to travel freely in the EU because if they are identified there they could be picked up and then brought to the U.K.. They can't be extradited from Russia directly because Russia makes the point and it makes this frequently that the Russian constitution forbids the extradition of Russian citizens to third party countries.</p><p>It's simply not an option. At the moment, though, we don't know for certain that the U.K. authorities actually know precisely who these real people are. They have given names but they are likely to be aliases. We don't know the they know the true identities of these people but at the moment the options for getting these people back here to face justice are limited.</p><p>GORANI: They have given the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. They could be fake names. I don't think anybody will be getting a prize for guessing Russian reaction here?</p><p>BLACK: No. And time again the Russians have been confronted with allegations of all sorts of misdeeds around the world, including this Skripal poisoning. And they have always categorically denied it. You are exactly right. They denied this again, having any knowledge of these individuals saying the photographs and the names that have been circulated by the British authorities in association with this poisoning mean nothing to us. They are saying we don't even know who these people are. So, they seem to be adopting a strategy not just of denying that Russia had anything to do with the poisoning, but also saying they don't know who these individuals are at all, rather than representing them as any other kind of explanation for why they might be there.</p><p>[15:25:00] The British authorities provided a high degree of detail to back up their investigation as we saw in the report there. That in itself undermines the Russian consistent pleas of innocence, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: They were -- whoever did this, these suspects, are alleged to have been so reckless that I understand that some Novichok traces were found in the budget hotel where they stayed potentially putting at risk dozens more people?</p><p>BLACK: Hala, they did. They found trace elements there. They say not enough to be a risk to other people who stayed in the room or other members of the public. But what the authorities here say it shows is that, yes, these two were the guys who were carrying this stuff around and applied it on the door of the house behind me here where Sergei Skripal lives. The British authorities are not saying why they know or believe they are members of Russian military intelligence. They do believe that the evidence they have pieced to the on the ground here in the U.K. is compelling. They have tracked their movements very closely. It's not just that security video as you mentioned.</p><p>They tested for Novichok in that hotel room and they found trace elements there as well. It shows that they carried it to that room. And they believe they are also the people who carried it here. Crucially what they are worried about also is what they can't be sure of is whether that perfume bottle was the last of it. They don't know if that was the bottle used to apply it here at the Skripal's house or if more has been discarded here in this area and is still an ongoing threat to the community.</p><p>GORANI: Thank you. This case is throwing Russia's military agency, the GIU into new focus. CNN's National Security Analyst, Samantha Vinograd is in Washington. What do you make of the allegations here against these two suspects, the fact that U.K. authorities have CCTV footage. They have the names at least on the passports and the two suspects used to leave the country?</p><p>SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: It really shows that Vladimir Putin wasn't trying that hard to fly under the radar. Everything these two GRU agents did was really hiding in plain sight. A, what terrifies me is just how easy it was to transport this Novichok from Russia to the U.K.. It was obviously quite easy for them to get on to airports, I think it was Aeroflot to enter the U.K., and to put it in just a small object and carry it around. So that really tells me that deterrence and deterring another attack, another CW attack is just as important as defending against it and trying to find out how we might be able to get to those two GRU agents.</p><p>GORANI: Right, but if they traveled on aliases with fake names and documents it is virtually impossible really to opry hens these individuals. How do you prove a case here?</p><p>VINOGRAD: The case has been proven not just by what Theresa May unveiled today. The United States for example, we issued sanction earlier in august because we found without a doubt that Russia was responsible for these attacks. Almost two dozen countries expelled Russian diplomats when the attacks firsthand because of the convincing evidence that Russia was behind the attacks.</p><p>It's been obvious from the get-go that Russia was responsible. Yes, these two men we think we know what their aliases were, where these two GRU agents are, we don't know, but there are a heck of a lot more of them. We have to caution Vladimir Putin such that he didn't think he can move chemical weapons around the world so easily and get back for example, at a man who he views as betraying his country.</p><p>GORANI: There are those who say why were Vladimir Putin or anyone high up in the Kremlin want the do this? Why is this in the best interest of Russia? This double agent for years his location was known. Why act now? That it doesn't make sense. It is self defeating. What is your reply to that?</p><p>VINOGRAD: I think the Russians would like to propagate that narrative. The Russian response has been so obvious today. They are obviously denying it and say again, why would we do this now, it's years later? Why would we go to great lengths? That's the kind of misinformation campaign that we should expect the Russians to propagate. I would be a fool if I said I knew what went through Putin's head. I think it's very obvious he has long memory and certainly wants to dissuade any other Russian agents from turning against him, working with foreign intelligence services, and betraying his country.</p><p>GORANI: And I mean you talk about avoiding future similar attacks. But if you can carry around chemical -- you know, a noxious chemical agent like Novichok, on a plane, carry it around, put it in officer fume bottles and do all of that, I mean it just seems incredibly difficult to try to prevent these attacks in the future if someone is determined to contrary them out?</p><p>VINOGRAD: It does. That's why we have to change the calculus and impose costs on Vladimir Putin so that the costs outweigh any benefits. Novichok can be a gas or liquid, a fine powder and it is highly toxic. What does Putin care about? His economy. The last sanctions led the ruble to fall to a two-year low for example. Are other countries going to look at taking similar action sufficient that Putin thinks if I do this again, break international law again, it's going to hit me where it hurts.</p><p>GORANI: Samantha Vinograd, thank you for joining us from Washington.</p><p>Still to come tonight, a busy day on Capitol Hill as social media executives are summoned. Big tech might be in for more headaches. That's coming up. And that is Brett Kavanaugh. And that is Cheryl Sandberg. You have everyone up there talking to lawmakers. We'll be right back.</p><p>[15:35:14] GORANI: U.S. senators have summoned three of the biggest names in tech hoping to find out how those companies plan to stop foreign influence in U.S. elections. Twitter sent its CEO, Jack Dorsey, and Facebook relied on COO, Sheryl Sandberg. Google, however, didn't show up. Twitter's stock fell five percent earlier today, while Dorsey spoke to the Senate Intelligence Committee admitting that his company hadn't done enough to detect fake users.</p><p>Dorsey is also being grilled by the House, Energy and Congress Committee answering questions about accusations of political bias against Republicans on his platform.</p><p>Samuel Burke is here with the very latest.</p><p>So, let's talk about what so -- what did senators want to get -- want to get out of these hearings with these two big tech leaders?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's interesting because there was a much more conciliatory tone on both sides from the politicians and from the executives this time around. And it sounds like these politicians actually knew something about technology. Remember last time the Facebook stock soared because it sounded like Congress didn't know anything about technology. So investors thought, how can they regulate it if they don't understand it?</p><p>I want to just put up on the screen some of the main takeaways that the politicians and us, the journalists got. As Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey were testifying. They've hired moderators to look through this content. This hearing was mainly about foreign interference. Developing artificial intelligence tools to help identify and eradicate that content and working closer with the authorities.</p><p>But Sheryl Sandberg said straight up, we were too slow to spot this content. We were too slow to react and that's our fault. And I think they've learned that striking this type of conciliatory tone will get them further in Washington than having a defensive tone.</p><p>GORANI: But they then -- why did Twitter's stock lose ground?</p><p>BURKE: Well, as if we put them up on the screen and look at both those stocks together, you see they both went down but Twitter's much more. Sheryl Sandberg has a wealth of experience. You see, Facebook's stock down, but Twitter down almost double what Facebook was.</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg doesn't just have business and tech experience. She was the chief of staff to Larry Summers in the treasury during the Clinton years. So she knows Washington, D.C. And she same incredibly poised. But let's just take a look at a soundbite from her. And you can really see her confidence in front of the committee.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK: Everyone here today knows that this is an arms race and that means we need to be ever more vigilant. As Chairman Burr has noted nothing less than the integrity of our democratic institutions, processes and ideals is at stake.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: And pointing out just how serious this problem is.</p><p>Jack Dorsey, on the other hand said, I'm a shy guy. He talked about some of the fundamental problems that still need to be changed on his platform. And he started out by saying, \"Actually, I want to read something I prepared on my phone and I'm going to tweet it out at the same time.\" And he literally, while testifying before Congress, tweeted out the message. I received it on my phone. So he has a different way of communicating.</p><p>[15:35:16] He's an incredibly smart guy and I think he's very honest. When I interviewed him, I found him to be very earnest. He just has a different way of communicating. So I think that maybe made investors a little bit shaky, especially compared to Sheryl Sandberg, who actually at some points, was helping him a bit talking about how they're sharing information. It almost felt like big sister, little brother up there on Capitol Hill today.</p><p>GORANI: And also on Google.</p><p>BURKE: And they were very upset with Google. I mean, that over and over and there were some things that they lauded Google for but were very frustrated with Google. But their stock was only down about two percent. So it's interesting that --</p><p>GORANI: There's a lesson in that.</p><p>BURKE: Yes, exactly.</p><p>GORANI: Don't show up.</p><p>BURKE: Don't show up and be conciliatory to talk to them and your stock will go down, at least if you're Twitter.</p><p>GORANI: OK. Thank you, Samuel Burke.</p><p>Now, big mystery here because U.S. officials are trying to figure out just what caused passengers on boards an Emirates plane to become sick. It was a Dubai to New York flight and it was quarantined at JFK airport. A number of passengers and crew were taken to the hospital for treatment. They reportedly showed signs of fever and were coughing throughout the flight. Mark Morales has more. He's at JFK airport. What's the status of the plane now, Mark?</p><p>MARK MORALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the plane was cleared not -- earlier this afternoon. The passengers were allowed to leave. They only took 11 of them to a local hospital for treatment. That included seven crew members. Other passengers that were on the plane were allowed to go through customs and clear out.</p><p>We've been here, we've been talking to passengers. They've been giving us their experience. They heard a lot of coughing. They experienced a lot of this on line, just waiting to board the plane and on the actual flight itself. Take a listen.</p><p>LARRY COBEN, PASSENGER ON QUARANTINED EMIRATES FLIGHT: Outside, there were a series of ambulances and police cars, probably a dozen police cars and half a dozen ambulances and we were told to remain in our seats, which we did for quite some time. Then someone from the CDC came on board and asked us to fill out some forms. And basically, you know, where we're going to be for the next couple of weeks in case we show any symptoms or they discover anything.</p><p>MORALES: Now, there haven't been any official word as to what caused the illnesses, but the symptoms that they're being treated for at the local hospital include headache, sore throat, fever, cough. And as far as we know, they're still there at the moment.</p><p>GORANI: All right, Mark Morales, thanks very much.</p><p>Still to come tonight, military moves kick into high gear ahead of an expected offensive against Syria's last major rebel stronghold. The very latest, next.</p><p>[15:40:05] GORANI: Well, military activity is picking up as the threat of a government offensive looms over Syria's Idlib province. Russia is now confirming that it conducted Tuesday's air strikes there. Activists say the strikes killed five children and injured 12 civilians.</p><p>Meanwhile, rebels say they blew up a key bridge Wednesday cutting the path to regime forces. And Turkey sent more reinforcements to its border with Syria.</p><p>Tuesday's strikes came just a few hours after President Trump tried the draw the line on Idlib. He told Syria and its allies not to go ahead with the offensive, saying it could cost hundreds of thousands of lives. And then Nikki Haley, his U.N. ambassador said, essentially go ahead with an offensive just as long as you don't use chemical weapons. So many interpreted that as pretty much a green light.</p><p>Our Senior International Correspondent, Fred Pleitgen, joins us from Damascus with more. What's the expectation with the Idlib offensive, Fred? What are you hearing where you are?</p><p>FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I mean really, Hala, when you speak to people here in Syria, I speak to government officials, we also speak to regular Syrians, there are a lot of people here in Syria who believe that that offensive is going to start. And they believe that offensive could start very, very soon. It's no secret here to many Syrians that Idlib is now surrounded, not just by a lot of Syrian government troops, but it seems as though by some of the most elite of the Syrian government troops.</p><p>A lot of those forces that were also involved in a lot of other big operations here in the Syrian conflict. Like for instance the offensive in Aleppo, like for instance the recent one in southern Syria in places like Golan and Daraa so these are battle-hardened forces. They are now apparently dug in and they would be ready to go at any time.</p><p>And you can certainly listen to Syrian officials and also some of the backers as well, like for instance the Iranians and the Russians, all of them seem unfazed by any of the talk that's coming out of the White House or that might be coming from Nikki Hayley as well. They say that they believe that Idlib is what they call a hotbed of terrorism, obviously with a lot of hardline Islamist groups that are situated in that area and they believe that this is something that needs to move forward.</p><p>There were even some were saying who believe -- they believe that this is something that should move forward very quickly. So certainly, if you listen to the folks here on the ground, they believe this operation will happen and they believe that it could happen fairly soon, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: Great. They describe it, obviously, as a terrorist hotbed and there are hardline Islamist fighters there. No one is denying that. They number in the tens of thousands. There are also three million civilians, many of whom reject both the regime and these terrorist groups that are caught in the middle. What happens to them?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Well, that's essentially -- right now, Hala, that's very much in the hands of the three dominating outside powers here in this conflict. The Russians, the Iranians, and of course the Turks as well. We know that there's a very high level meeting that's going to be happening on September the 7th where essentially the leaders of these countries are going to hash out how they intend to move forward, is there going to be this offensive? Is there some other way to do this?</p><p>The Russians are saying there's a humanitarian corridor that they've set up for people to be able to get out of Idlib province. But of course, as you point out, that means that they would be going into Syrian government-held territory. Of course a lot of people would be afraid to do that.</p><p>The big question is, can these people be given enough guarantees for them to actually willingly be wanting to come back to this side? It certainly seem something that these (INAUDIBLE) might not be able to sort out at that meeting, but it is something that could very well be on the table. But that seems to be the plan of the Syrian government and also of its backers to say, look, the humanitarian corridors are out there, take them or leave them. There is a chance for people to get out.</p><p>Of course the Russians also have negotiations going on. They have apparently been negotiating with some of the villages in Idlib province telling them, look, if you flip sides, if you get some of these rebels out of your villages, we will spare you now. Well, make sure that Syrian government forces don't enter those villages until the Idlib offensive is done. Is that good enough? For many of those in Idlib, big question mark.</p><p>GORANI: Also, unclear how civilians will politely ask armed rebels, some of them very hardened to politely leave their village. I'm not sure exactly how that would work.</p><p>Fred Pleitgen, thanks very much for joining us from Damascus. Appreciate it.</p><p>Let's get a closer look at what's happening inside Idlib province. Ismail Alabdullah is the spokesperson for the Syrian Civil Defense, a volunteer rescue group also known as the White Helmets. He is in northern Idlib.</p><p>Mr. Alabdullah, what is the situation now in the province after some reported air strikes yesterday?</p><p>ISMAIL ALABDULLAH, SPOKESPERSON, WHITE HELMETS: Air strikes yesterday killed 13 people, including five kids and three women in different villages of the west countryside of Idlib and (INAUDIBLE) and many villages. After the air strikes at night yesterday, there were mortars falling on the same villages.</p><p>[15:45:03] Today, the air strikes stopped. We haven't counted any air strikes -- any air strikes in Idlib province. Bombed Idlib brought across and this time after crowded with three million civilians. And there is no another Idlib to go. And that situation will be more, more difficult for the people to live, more difficult to the civilians to survive in this time.</p><p>There is no another Idlib. If that forces and the (INAUDIBLE) start bombing and killing the civilians, there will be big mess, because that's what we've heard about.</p><p>GORANI: Mr. Alabdullah, just to sum up, you're saying there's no other Idlib to go. In other words that this is the last refuge for civilians who fled from other parts of Syria. Though there was no bombing today, the concern for you is there will be more bombing in the coming days.</p><p>Is there enough hospital, you know, equipment and doctors to respond to increase air strikes now in Idlib?</p><p>ALABDULLAH: If air strikes will increase in the future, of course, we can't respond to all the bombing. The hospitals will not receive all the wounded people and the injured people, because the bombing will cause many victims and many injured people.</p><p>Now, we have the equipment. We can respond. We can save the people. The hospitals can receive the injured people. But if the offensive will be as -- have been in Eastern Ghouta and Aleppo City, I was in Aleppo City and it was like hellish bombing. Hellish days. If that will happen again in Idlib city and all of the province, there's no -- we will not be able to respond to all the bombing and all cause.</p><p>GORANI: And lastly, when you say there is nowhere else to go, there is really -- in the whole country, this is the last section of the country that is controlled by rebel groups. And there are all the civilians there who have come from other parts of Syria. If they have nowhere to go, what happens to them?</p><p>ALABDULLAH: That's the question. Ninety percent of the people who are living in the Idlib province are displaced people. They came from south, they came from Homs, they came from Aleppo, Eastern -- East Aleppo. Now, they are all trapped in this area and there is no place to go. Maybe their destiny to be killed. With that blood chemical attacks as what happened in Eastern Ghouta in 2013. Maybe will be killed by barrel bombs, bombs, cluster bombs, bunker buster bombs.</p><p>We don't know yet. We will see. We will wait. As all the civilians, three million are now scared, afraid about every single bombing or any news of starting the offensive on the ground.</p><p>GORANI: Ismail Alabdullah, the spokesperson for the White Helmets, joining us live from Idlib province. Thank you very much for your time this evening.</p><p>Coming up, it's been described as crazy town. But is all the focus on Donald Trump and his chaotic White House distracting from the real issues that affect everyone? We'll discuss after this.</p><p>[15:50:28] GORANI: Many people who dislike Donald Trump will see the claims in Bob Woodward's book \"Fear\" as yet more proof that the president is just simply unfit to serve in the role he holds.</p><p>But if you take away the chaos depicted in books like Woodward's, many big concerns remain, like, how the administration, as a whole, is handling the real day to day issues on both the domestic and international fronts?</p><p>For those who criticize the president and believe the problems stem from him, and possibly him alone as an individual, are they missing the point?</p><p>Let's discuss this with assistant professor of global politics at the University College London, Brian Klaas. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>You on your Twitter account are very, very critical of the president. You get thousands and thousands of retweets and favorites. But if you look at the wider picture, ideologically speaking, all the people around him are very much aligned with President Trump, they just don't do and say the thing that cause outrage in the same way the president does.</p><p>BRIAN KLAAS, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF GLOBAL POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: That's right. So there is a Venn diagram that exists between traditional Republican values and Donald Trump. And in the middle of that is something like health care policy and tax policy. So I would expect that if there were a change of leadership in the White House, if Trump were to lose power, those things would continue.</p><p>But there's a lot of very much -- not overlap in areas like trade and international security that are very different where, for example, NAFTA and NATO. Pence would be different on these. He believes in multilateral trade, he believes in multilateral alliances and security agreements.</p><p>And also, I think this is the most important point, is that Trump is different because he's a threat to norms and institutions. The way that he lashes out at the press, at political institutions that are the pillars of American --</p><p>GORANI: Isn't that a reflection of ideologically of the people closest to him? I mean, if you -- think about it. John Kelly, long before he was chief of staff was in favor of things like child separation. I mean, you had others, for instance, Mike Pence and his stance on certain issues deemed homophobic. Jeff Sessions as well on certain issues, ideologically aligned with the president certainly domestically, right?</p><p>KLAAS: Yes. On a lot of issues, they are, in terms of policy. The difference is how aggressively they do these things. You would not have a Vice President Pence who would be regularly tweeting about how the press is the enemy of the people or --</p><p>GORANI: Is it just the tweeting then? Is it just how aggressive? Is it just because he's considered unfit in his behavior?</p><p>KLAAS: But the tweeting is a reflection of policy, too. I mean, the administration is proceeding along the tweets as though they are official presidential statements. So when the president says, as he did three days ago, for example, that it's a shame that Jeff Sessions is prosecuting Republicans because they're Republicans for corruption charges. That actually has a knock-on effect, the chilling effect where people in the Department of Justice and in law enforcement are getting orders on Twitter from the president to basically protect his political allies.</p><p>GORANI: Do you think things would be different if Mike Pence were president?</p><p>KLAAS: I think it'd be different in terms of norms, I think it'd be different in terms of international trade and international security which are very important, right? These are major issues for the economy and for national security.</p><p>GORANI: But what about these very important policy announcements that you say are made on Twitter? We're talking immigration, trade, North Korea, the fact that Nikki Haley said at the United Nations -- and it barely registered on the radar in the United States, that essentially as long as Assad doesn't use chemical weapons, you're free to go ahead and carpet-bomb Idlib. We're fine with it.</p><p>Is the focus on Trump, the individual and the outrageous behavior he sometimes exhibits, taking away from serious journalistic coverage of policy?</p><p>KLAAS: Yes, in a word, yes. And I think that there's also a question about Mike Pence himself in a sense that because Trump was such a circus act during the campaign itself, he wasn't vetted the same way that a normal vice president would be vetted. Most Americans don't know the things you are talking about, with his homophobia in the past.</p><p>Well, for example in 2000, how he said that smoking doesn't cause cancer in an op-ed. That was never part of the conversation in a way that previous vice presidential candidates have been vetted because Trump was a show. And so I think it is a distraction in some ways from the policy --</p><p>GORANI: Is that a mistake?</p><p>KLAAS: No. I think we have to be good enough to be able to do both tracks. It is dangerous that Trump is a reckless impulsive individual who makes policy by tweet -- it is also dangerous that the policy themselves are not getting enough scrutiny. But we have to rise to this occasion and be able answer both challenges at the same time. We cannot simply say, let's just -- let's disregard the insanity unfolding on Twitter or let's just regard these policies that are potentially very dangerous.</p><p>GORANI: Would you consider yourself part of the #resistance?</p><p>KLAAS: No. I think -- the way I always describe my --</p><p>GORANI: Because on Twitter, you are very much --</p><p>KLAAS: I'm extremely anti-Trump. And I'm very critical of him. But I say that I am a non-partisan 2015 American because what I am arguing are things that were uncontroversial two or three years ago. I believe in a free press. I believe that people should not be scapegoated because of the color of their skin. I believe that religious minorities should be treated with respect. I believe that you should not make policy impulsively, you should make it based on evidence and reason.</p><p>[15:55:22] Those things are now partisan. But that doesn't make me partisan. It simply makes me anti-Trump because he's disrespecting those basic principles that used to be foundational principles for both parties in the United States.</p><p>GORANI: But at the same time, Donald Trump is a natural outcome of many, many years, whether the White House was in democratic or in Republican hands, right?</p><p>KLAAS: He is. And I think one thing that's very clear is that for a lot of people who support Trump, he will never be more guilty in their eyes than the system he's attacking. And that's one of the reasons why his base is so solid. So there is something that is good about Trump and that he's producing a wakeup call in politics that people have been ignored for a long time. There are these -- the sort of under the surface anger, there's also a lot of under the surface racism that he's tapped in to.</p><p>But in the end, I think that that positive story is absolutely swamped by all the negative stories in terms of his impulsivity, his recklessness, the corruption around him, and all these other stories.</p><p>GORANI: Let me ask you about Steve Bannon invited and disinvited by the New Yorker. A lot of people, even really Trump opponents said that was a huge own goal. Because -- OK. You invited him but then when you invite him, don't disinvite him. You're basically telling his base, you know, we're snowflakes, we can't handle it. It should be a free exchange of ideas and you've turned it into a platform for people who are an echo chamber for the same liberal ideas.</p><p>KLAAS: Yes. So I think this is a question where obviously it was mishandled, to invite and disinvite was a mistake. The question is whether he should have been invited in the first place and that's a much trickier question.</p><p>GORANI: The Economist thinks that he should be.</p><p>KLAAS: I think that Steve Bannon, when he was part of the administration, was a legitimate newsmaker. He's no longer part of the White House. We know that his views are bigoted. And at some point, you have to say, do we want to make that be the platform that we promote to a lot of other people?</p><p>He is not a run-of-the-mill conservative. So people trying to say that this is censoring conservative viewpoints are incorrect. His views are much more incendiary, the mainstream conservatives and he is effectively peddled white nationalism on Breitbart for a very long time and had headlines -- he printed headlines when he was a publisher of things like, would you rather my child had feminism or cancer? That is not a normal viewpoint or a normal headline for a conservative publication.</p><p>GORANI: He won't be at the New Yorker but he will be at the Economist festival. Thanks very much, Brian Klaas. Always appreciate your time.</p><p>Thanks for watching tonight. I'm Hala Gorani. \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" is next.</p><p>(CLOSING BELL RINGING)</p><p>[16:00:00] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Pretty meandering day. We were up, we were down, essentially, we're flat.

Live  from CNN London I'm Hala Gorani.  Tonight, the White House is trying to  push back against a shocking new book, shedding light on life inside the  Trump presidency.  We just heard from President Trump in the last few  minutes.  We will tell you what he said.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, tonight, exclusive new details on a case that soured relations  between Russia and the West.  The U.K. in particular.  Police named the  suspects in the Salisbury poisoning.  And they are Russian nationals.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, Donald Trump's pick to be a new Supreme Court Judge is getting  grilled on Capitol Hill once again today.  We will have the latest on that.  </p><p>President Trump and his allies are trying to discredit journalist Bob  Woodward.  And the dysfunctional White House he describes in his new book  \"Fear\".  The U.S. president just blasted it as a work of total fiction.   Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's a work of fiction.   Already General Mattis has come out very, very strongly.  And I think you  know General Mattis.  He does what he wants to do.  He's a very independent  guy.  He was insulted by the remarks that were attributed to him and he  came out with a very strong statement.  I assume you read it I hope you  read it last night.  </p><p>General John Kelly very same thing.  He said he is insulted by what they  said.  He's right here.  He's insulted by -- he couldn't believe what they  said.  He put out a very, very strong statement.  And many others, and many  statements are coming out.  The book is a work of fiction.  If you look  back at Woodward's past he had the same problem with other presidents he  likes to get publicity, sell some book.  It was put out to interfere in my  opinion with the Kavanaugh hearings which I don't think it has done because  so many have come out against it.  </p><p>Yule joule (ph) is another one.  He's very insulted by the book and what  was stated in the book.  We run -- we do run a strong White House.  There  is no question about it.  And we are doing things that nobody else has ever  been able to do.  And our country is stronger now than it has ever been.   And in a very short period of time, $700 billion being spent on the  military in the next year, 716.  $716 billion.  We will actually be far  stronger than we have ever been, and that's what we needed to be.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI:  And that's how president Donald Trump in the White House -- he was  in the oval office, in fact, hosting the Emir of Kuwait today.  He was  asked about Syria, and reports that he had discussed as assassinating the  president of Syria.  We will get to that in a moment.  Obviously, we have  been reporting about this book and its contents for 24 hours or so of the  it depicts a crazy town White House in which staffers question Mr. Trump's  intelligence, his integrity, even his fitness to be president at all.  </p><p>Let's go to the White House where Boris Sanchez has the latest details on  the reaction to the book.  Clearly the president has -- he said over and  over again in that oval office moment there when he was hosting the Emir of  Kuwait that it is a work of total fiction.  But this is not Omarosa, a  reality television star.  This is Bob Woodward.  One of the most respected,  celebrated journalists in American history.  </p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Hala.  The White House is  going to face an uphill battle trying to draw into question the credibility  of Bob Woodward if only because of his legacy.  He has long been a  Washington, DC.  reporter, somebody who covered along with his partner,  Carl Bernstein, the Nixon administration and uncovered the Watergate  conspiracy.  </p><p>He has had consistent tell-all books for about eight presidents now.  Even  the president has defended him in the past when he wrote a book that wasn't  exactly flattering to the Obama administration.  In all, it is not like  Omarosa.  It is not like who wrote \"Fire and Fury\" a few months ago and  published that to the chagrin this White House.  </p><p>We should point out sources have told CNN that the president is now asking  loyal aides to dig in for information on who would Woodward's sources are.   Despite the fact that he's dismissing these claims as bogus, he is  simultaneously trying the find out who Woodward spoke to, where he got  these quotes.  We are also told that the president was pleased specifically  with the denials coming from some of the figures currently within his  administration, Department of Defense Secretary James Mattis, Chief of  Staff John Kelly, and as you heard there, his chief attorney, Rudy  Giuliani.  </p><p>[15:05:00] But the president is also noticing, according to sources, who is  remaining silent.  There are a number of former administration officials  that were quoted by Bob Woodward.  Notably Staff Secretary Robert Porter as  well as a former NSA Director HR McMaster and others, Gary Cohn, the  national economic chair.  So, there are a number of people here, a long  list of people who have left the White House on less than graceful terms  who the president clearly is upset with.  That's why you hear Sarah Sanders  repeatedly saying that some of this book, the negative content in it could  be attributed to disgruntled former employees.  </p><p>GORANI:  Is this going to convince people who are likely to believe what's  in the book abuse Bob Woodward wrote it, this pushback?  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  It's unclear.  As you well know, Trump supporters are a very  coalesced base.  More often than not the president has fended off  accusations or allegations of wrongdoing or of his unfitness for office by  simply dismissing it as fake news.  And continuously he has promoted  conspiracy theories.  The list goes on and on of the kind of defenses he  has had for less than flattering stories.  </p><p>This would be interesting to see what the base responds to, specifically  one portion where Bob Woodward alleges the president sort of made fun of  his Attorney General Jeff Sessions calling him mentally retarded and faking  a southern accent, calling him a dumb southerner.  Again, according to the  Woodward's reporting.  The president specifically tweeted about that  dismissing it as something said to divide.  In the south, Jeff Sessions is  a popular person and that's where the president draws his base.  </p><p>GORANI:  Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee says if he's confirmed he  will owe  his loyalty to the U.S. Constitution and not to the president of the United  States.  Brett Kavanaugh is undergoing some tough grilling on day two of  his confirmation hearings on capitol hill.  The grilling coming from  Democratic senators.  Senators are questioning him on a number of issues  including presidential powers and judicial independence.  Kavanaugh was  asked flat out if he would have trouble ruling against a president who  appointed him.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NOMINEE:  No one is above the law in  our constitutional system.  Federalist 69 Hamilton makes clear all the ways  the executive branch as designed by the framers of the constitution was  different from the monarchy.  Under our system of government, the executive  branch is subject to the law, subject to the court system.  And that's an  important part of Federalist 69.  It's an important part of the  constitutional structure.  </p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA:  Can a sitting president be  required to respond to a subpoena?  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  That's a hypothetical question about what would be an  elaboration or a difference from U.S.  V Nixon's precise holding.  And I  think going with the Justice Ginsburg principle which is really not the  Justice Ginsburg alone principle.  It's everyone's principle on the current  Supreme Court.  And as a matter of the canons of judicial independence I  can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question.  </p><p>GORANI:  So, can't give answers on hypotheticals.  And Kavanaugh answered  in that way when confronted with hypothetical situations and asked about  hypothetical cases and how he might rule.  Because he also side stepped a  question about whether a president can pardon himself.  But a lot of other  issues are on the table as well from assault weapons to abortion rights.   That's one that some activists in the United States are concerned about.  </p><p>Let's bring in CNN Justice Correspondent, Jessica Schneider with more.   What did we learn about Brett Kavanaugh's position, his potential -- how he  might potentially rule on some of these hot topics like abortion rights for  instance?  </p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well you heard of the right  there, Hala.  Brett Kavanaugh refusing to answer hypotheticals.  Also,  saying he will stick with precedent.  But that's really not satisfying  Democrats.  This is certain to be a long day on Capitol Hill.  We are  already six hours into this.  It is a likely to stretch at least six hours  more.  As you saw there, each senator on the committee, they are grilling  Judge Kavanaugh.  </p><p>They have been pressing him on a range of issues.  But at the forefront has  really been Judge Kavanaugh's views on the power of the presidency.  Each  time he has been pressed, Kavanaugh has deferred.  Democrats have asked him  a number of questions like can the president pardon himself?  Can the  president pardon others?  Should the president comply with a subpoena?  And  of course, each and every question Judge Kavanaugh said, well, I can't  answer hypotheticals.  </p><p>Now, to be fair, that is a very common tactic used by judges up for  confirmation.  They just say they can't deal with any cases that aren't  before them.  But of course, it is especially poignant at this moment in  time, Hala with the president embroiled in controversy and many of his  former associates facing legal challenges.  We just saw two of them plead  guilty in recent weeks.  </p><p>[15:10:00] Kavanaugh here has really refused to budge.  He said he will  take each and every case as it comes.  One thing that's interesting,  though, he did note he has great respect for the 1974 decision U.S. V  Nixon.  Of course, that required President Nixon to hand over those tapes  and other documents that eventually led to his impeachment and resignation.   Really, Hala, what we are seeing from Judge Kavanaugh is really a scholarly  confirmation hearing.  </p><p>Every time he is peppered with questions he kind of goes back, talks about  his long history of legal decisions.  He relies on the Constitution.  He  cited the Federalist Papers numerous times.  Senators seem to be getting a  bit antsy on the Democratic side.  Really that's what judges in this  situation do.  That's what Judge Kavanaugh is doing.  They are likely to  continue peppering him with these questions and maybe not getting many  questions answered as we continue on here.  </p><p>GORANI:  Let's get perspective from Joey Jackson, CNN legal analyst.  If  Kavanaugh has said the president is not above the law, how can he justify  not answering a hypothetical such as must the president comply with a  subpoena?  </p><p>JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Always good to see you, Hala.  Listen,  this is what nominees customarily do.  They never commit to answering what  may in fact be an issue before the court.  For good reason.  Because then  would you be bound by what you said there?  If you don't and you pivot,  would you have been lying?  And the other thing is would you potentially  have to recuse yourself.  </p><p>He could be grilled until midnight tonight or midnight on Friday, the fact  is he is going to stick to the script.  He is going to whip out the pocket  Constitution and say this is what I'm bound to, interpretation the  Constitution.  If you have a legitimate argument and you have the winning  argument, you will be ruled in favor of.  If you don't, you will not.  So  as much as you might press -- and we can talk all afternoon, Hala, in terms  of where he stands on abortion, where he stands on gun rights, where he  stands anywhere.  He is just not saying.  </p><p>GORANI:  What's the point of a confirmation hearing if you can't get any  insight.  Here's what he said -- he was asked about abortion rights.   Here's how he answered, Joey.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FEINSTEIN:  What would you say your position today is on a woman's right to  choose?  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  As a Judge -- </p><p>FEINSTEIN:  As a Judge.  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  As a Judge, it is an important precedent of the Supreme Court,  by it I mean Roe V.  Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey.  It has been  reaffirmed many times.  Casey is precedent on precedent, which itself is an  important factor to remember.  And I understand the significance of the  issue, the jurisprudential issue and I understand the significance as best  I can.  I always try, and I do hear of the real-world affects of that  decision as I try to do of all the decisions of my court and of the Supreme  Court.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI:  Joey, what does that tell you?  </p><p>JACKSON:  Nothing.  </p><p>GORANI:  Roe v.  Wade is precedent.  Then there was another case that was  precedent on precedent.  He says he respects judicial precedence.  </p><p>JACKSON:  It tells me nothing.  Let me tell you why.  Judge Neil Gorsuch  sat before nomination hearings.  You will recall he was recently nominated  to the court and said similarly he respects precedent.  We should remind  viewers that precedent is everything.  Overstating it a little but so, so,  so significant in law because there is a principle called stare decisis  that means it has been decided.  Judges are bounds by precedent.</p><p>Judge Gorsuch said precedent is important, I recognize how precedent is  precedent.  What did he do?  He sat on the court and overturned a 40-year  precedent related to labor unions called the Janus decision.  If we had  taken him at his word that precedent is precedent he would have upheld the  right for people to decide that they could pay union dues.  He did not.   And so simply saying what he says is something we all say as lawyers.   Precedent is important.  But he is not telling you how he will rule.</p><p>[15:15:00] GORANI:  He is not bound by it.  He has written in the past that  presidents </p><p>shouldn't -- he believes it's distracting to criminally investigate sitting  presidents.  Presidents I should say, not precedents.  I mean, this would  usually be kind of a throwaway comment but not for the Trump administration  and the Trump presidency, embroiled in this Mueller probe that's been going  on for months and months.  What did that tell you?  </p><p>JACKSON:  I thought the answer was very probative to where he stands.  He  said listen I wrote a law review article.  It's not my position as relates  to the constitution.  I just wrote a law review article and I am not going  to answer the question moving forward as to what I would do.  I am not  going to answer the question as to whether the president can pardon  himself.  All of these questions are side stepped.  What we are left with  is an intelligent man who has a distinguished career, a distinguished  background, a beautiful family, but on the question of whether will you be  on issues that effect everyone?  It's really a mystery.</p><p>You have nine members on the Supreme Court.  Five of them -- he would be  the fifth who are highly conservative.  It could affect abortion,  immigration, gun control.  So, this is a major moment in our history.  For  him not to commit to answering these questions, you know, it certainly is  problematic to say the least.  Although there is precedent for that as it  relates to other nominees who have appeared before the committee.  </p><p>GORANI:  Joey Jackson as always, appreciate having you on the program.  </p><p>Still to come tonight, caught on camera, named as suspects, and facing  enough evidence to be charged.  British authorities unveil remarkable new  details about the men thought to be behind an attack that is testing  relations between London and Moscow.  </p><p>Also, Brett Kavanaugh wasn't the only person grilled by lawmakers today.   Social media executives were summoned as well.  Big tech might be in for  more headaches coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GORANI:  Our next story is not so much the spy who came in from the cold.   But the spy story coming into the cold light of day.  Step by step, image  by remarkable image.  Chilling new details are emerge being a nerve agent  attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter right here in Britain.  The  U.K. now says it has the evidence to charge two Russian nationals.  Saying  they were almost certainly acting on orders from on high.  Phil Black has  more from Salisbury.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:20:00] PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Two Russian men arrive at  London's airport on March 2nd.  Their mission, assassination.   Investigators tracked down their movements over several days using security  video.  That night they stayed in this east London hotel.  The following  day, March 3rd, they made a suspected reconnaissance run to Salisbury,  traveling by train and returning to London to sleep at the same hotel.   Sunday, March 4th.  They traveled to Salisbury again.  Police believe soon  after this image was captured they sprayed the nerve agent Novichok on the  front door of Sergei Skripal's home.  That afternoon he and his daughter  collapsed on a bench in the town center, critically ill.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED POLICEMAN:  We are releasing these photographs of them.</p><p>BLACK:  By that time police say the suspects had already travelled back to  London to board a flight out of Heathrow airport.  At that point they  thought it was a success.  But they were wrong.  The targets Sergie and  Yulia survived.  </p><p>Police officer, Detective Sargent Nick Bailey was also poisoned.  He is  recovering.   A local woman Dawn Sturgis lost her life because of a plot that had nothing  to do with her.  Months later, the 44-year-old mother of three and her  partner found what they thought was a small bottle of fancy perfume.  She  sprayed it on her wrists.  She collapsed that day.  A week later, she died.   Her husband also felt ill but survived.  Police say the bottle and its  packages were clever things used to smuggle and deploy the same nerve agent  used against the Skripals.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED POLICEMAN:  We don't believe the couple were targeted but  became victims as a result of the recklessness in which the nerve agent was  disposed of.  </p><p>BLACK:  They were traveling on real passports using the names Alexander  Petrov and Rusland Boshirov.  Britain's Prime Minister says a body of  intelligence shows these men are members of Russia's military intelligence  agency the GIU.  </p><p>THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER, U.K.:  It is a highly disciplined organization  with a well-established chain of command.  This was not a rogue operation.   It was it was almost certainly approved outside the GIU at a senior level  of the Russian state.  </p><p>BLACK:  Police have not revealed the suspected motive behind any of this in  Russia has denied any involvement.  But the GIU is also the Russian  intelligence agency Sergei Skripal officially worked for while he was  spying for Britain.  Coincidence?  Or proof Russia spies never forget or  forgive a traitor?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI:  Whoever is responsible, Phil Black joins me now from Salisbury.   They actually put it in a perfume bottle knowing full well somebody could  find of it.  Phil Black is in Salisbury.  Matthew Chance has reaction from  Moscow.  Phil, what are U.K. authorities doing now to try to apprehend  these two individuals?  </p><p>BLACK:  The truth is, Hala, they don't know where they are.  They have  issued a domestic arrest warrant.  They are seeking an EU arrest warrant as  well.  It would limit their ability to travel freely in the EU because if  they are identified there they could be picked up and then brought to the  U.K..  They can't be extradited from Russia directly because Russia makes  the point and it makes this frequently that the Russian constitution  forbids the extradition of Russian citizens to third party countries.  </p><p>It's simply not an option.  At the moment, though, we don't know for  certain that the U.K. authorities actually know precisely who these real  people are.  They have given names but they are likely to be aliases.  We  don't know the they know the true identities of these people but at the  moment the options for getting these people back here to face justice are  limited.  </p><p>GORANI:  They have given the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.   They could be fake names.  I don't think anybody will be getting a prize  for guessing Russian reaction here?  </p><p>BLACK:  No.  And time again the Russians have been confronted with  allegations of all sorts of misdeeds around the world, including this  Skripal poisoning.  And they have always categorically denied it.  You are  exactly right.  They denied this again, having any knowledge of these  individuals saying the photographs and the names that have been circulated  by the British authorities in association with this poisoning mean nothing  to us.  They are saying we don't even know who these people are.  So, they  seem to be adopting a strategy not just of denying that Russia had anything  to do with the poisoning, but also saying they don't know who these  individuals are at all, rather than representing them as any other kind of  explanation for why they might be there.  </p><p>[15:25:00] The British authorities provided a high degree of detail to back  up their investigation as we saw in the report there.  That in itself  undermines the Russian consistent pleas of innocence, Hala.  </p><p>GORANI:  They were -- whoever did this, these suspects, are alleged to have  been so reckless that I understand that some Novichok traces were found in  the budget hotel where they stayed potentially putting at risk dozens more  people?  </p><p>BLACK:  Hala, they did.  They found trace elements there.  They say not  enough to be a risk to other people who stayed in the room or other members  of the public.  But what the authorities here say it shows is that, yes,  these two were the guys who were carrying this stuff around and applied it  on the door of the house behind me here where Sergei Skripal lives.  The  British authorities are not saying why they know or believe they are  members of Russian military intelligence.  They do believe that the  evidence they have pieced to the on the ground here in the U.K. is  compelling.  They have tracked their movements very closely.  It's not just  that security video as you mentioned.  </p><p>They tested for Novichok in that hotel room and they found trace elements  there as well.  It shows that they carried it to that room.  And they  believe they are also the people who carried it here.  Crucially what they  are worried about also is what they can't be sure of is whether that  perfume bottle was the last of it.  They don't know if that was the bottle  used to apply it here at the Skripal's house or if more has been discarded  here in this area and is still an ongoing threat to the community.  </p><p>GORANI:  Thank you.  This case is throwing Russia's military agency, the  GIU into new focus.  CNN's National Security Analyst, Samantha Vinograd is  in Washington.  What do you make of the allegations here against these two  suspects, the fact that U.K. authorities have CCTV footage.  They have the  names at least on the passports and the two suspects used to leave the  country?  </p><p>SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  It really shows that  Vladimir Putin wasn't trying that hard to fly under the radar.  Everything  these two GRU agents did was really hiding in plain sight.  A, what  terrifies me is just how easy it was to transport this Novichok from Russia  to the U.K..  It was obviously quite easy for them to get on to airports, I  think it was Aeroflot to enter the U.K., and to put it in just a small  object and carry it around.  So that really tells me that deterrence and  deterring another attack, another CW attack is just as important as  defending against it and trying to find out how we might be able to get to  those two GRU agents.  </p><p>GORANI:  Right, but if they traveled on aliases with fake names and  documents it is virtually impossible really to opry hens these individuals.   How do you prove a case here?</p><p>VINOGRAD:  The case has been proven not just by what Theresa May unveiled  today.  The United States for example, we issued sanction earlier in august  because we found without a doubt that Russia was responsible for these  attacks.  Almost two dozen countries expelled Russian diplomats when the  attacks firsthand because of the convincing evidence that Russia was behind  the attacks.  </p><p>It's been obvious from the get-go that Russia was responsible.  Yes, these  two men we think we know what their aliases were, where these two GRU  agents are, we don't know, but there are a heck of a lot more of them.  We  have to caution Vladimir Putin such that he didn't think he can move  chemical weapons around the world so easily and get back for example, at a  man who he views as betraying his country.  </p><p>GORANI:  There are those who say why were Vladimir Putin or anyone high up  in the Kremlin want the do this?  Why is this in the best interest of  Russia?  This double agent for years his location was known.  Why act now?   That it doesn't make sense.  It is self defeating.  What is your reply to  that?</p><p>VINOGRAD:  I think the Russians would like to propagate that narrative.   The Russian response has been so obvious today.  They are obviously denying  it and say again, why would we do this now, it's years later?  Why would we  go to great lengths?  That's the kind of misinformation campaign that we  should expect the Russians to propagate.  I would be a fool if I said I  knew what went through Putin's head.  I think it's very obvious he has long  memory and certainly wants to dissuade any other Russian agents from  turning against him, working with foreign intelligence services, and  betraying his country.  </p><p>GORANI:  And I mean you talk about avoiding future similar attacks.  But if  you can carry around chemical -- you know, a noxious chemical agent like  Novichok, on a plane, carry it around, put it in officer fume bottles and  do all of that, I mean it just seems incredibly difficult to try to prevent  these attacks in the future if someone is determined to contrary them out?  </p><p>VINOGRAD:  It does.  That's why we have to change the calculus and impose  costs on Vladimir Putin so that the costs outweigh any benefits.  Novichok  can be a gas or liquid, a fine powder and it is highly toxic.  What does  Putin care about?  His economy.  The last sanctions led the ruble to fall  to a two-year low for example.  Are other countries going to look at taking  similar action sufficient that Putin thinks if I do this again, break  international law again, it's going to hit me where it hurts.  </p><p>GORANI:  Samantha Vinograd, thank you for joining us from Washington.  </p><p>Still to come tonight, a busy day on Capitol Hill as social media  executives are summoned.  Big tech might be in for more headaches.  That's  coming up.  And that is Brett Kavanaugh.  And that is Cheryl Sandberg.  You  have everyone up there talking to lawmakers.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:35:14] GORANI:  U.S. senators have summoned three of the biggest names  in tech hoping to find out how those companies plan to stop foreign  influence in U.S. elections.  Twitter sent its CEO, Jack Dorsey, and  Facebook relied on COO, Sheryl Sandberg.  Google, however, didn't show up.   Twitter's stock fell five percent earlier today, while Dorsey spoke to the  Senate Intelligence Committee admitting that his company hadn't done enough  to detect fake users.</p><p>Dorsey is also being grilled by the House, Energy and Congress Committee  answering questions about accusations of political bias against Republicans  on his platform.</p><p>Samuel Burke is here with the very latest.</p><p>So, let's talk about what so -- what did senators want to get -- want to  get out of these hearings with these two big tech leaders?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's  interesting because there was a much more conciliatory tone on both sides  from the politicians and from the executives this time around.  And it  sounds like these politicians actually knew something about technology.   Remember last time the Facebook stock soared because it sounded like  Congress didn't know anything about technology.  So investors thought, how  can they regulate it if they don't understand it?</p><p>I want to just put up on the screen some of the main takeaways that the  politicians and us, the journalists got.  As Sheryl Sandberg and Jack  Dorsey were testifying.  They've hired moderators to look through this  content.  This hearing was mainly about foreign interference.  Developing  artificial intelligence tools to help identify and eradicate that content  and working closer with the authorities.</p><p>But Sheryl Sandberg said straight up, we were too slow to spot this  content.  We were too slow to react and that's our fault.  And I think  they've learned that striking this type of conciliatory tone will get them  further in Washington than having a defensive tone.</p><p>GORANI:  But they then -- why did Twitter's stock lose ground?</p><p>BURKE:  Well, as if we put them up on the screen and look at both those  stocks together, you see they both went down but Twitter's much more.   Sheryl Sandberg has a wealth of experience.  You see, Facebook's stock  down, but Twitter down almost double what Facebook was.</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg doesn't just have business and tech experience.  She was  the chief of staff to Larry Summers in the treasury during the Clinton  years.  So she knows Washington, D.C.  And she same incredibly poised.  But  let's just take a look at a soundbite from her.  And you can really see her  confidence in front of the committee.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK:  Everyone here today knows that this is an  arms race and that means we need to be ever more vigilant.  As Chairman  Burr has noted nothing less than the integrity of our democratic  institutions, processes and ideals is at stake.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE:  And pointing out just how serious this problem is.</p><p>Jack Dorsey, on the other hand said, I'm a shy guy.  He talked about some  of the fundamental problems that still need to be changed on his platform.   And he started out by saying, \"Actually, I want to read something I  prepared on my phone and I'm going to tweet it out at the same time.\"  And  he literally, while testifying before Congress, tweeted out the message.  I  received it on my phone.  So he has a different way of communicating.</p><p>[15:35:16] He's an incredibly smart guy and I think he's very honest.  When  I interviewed him, I found him to be very earnest.  He just has a different  way of communicating.  So I think that maybe made investors a little bit  shaky, especially compared to Sheryl Sandberg, who actually at some points,  was helping him a bit talking about how they're sharing information.  It  almost felt like big sister, little brother up there on Capitol Hill today.</p><p>GORANI:  And also on Google.</p><p>BURKE:  And they were very upset with Google.  I mean, that over and over  and there were some things that they lauded Google for but were very  frustrated with Google.  But their stock was only down about two percent.   So it's interesting that -- </p><p>GORANI:  There's a lesson in that.</p><p>BURKE:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>GORANI:  Don't show up.</p><p>BURKE:  Don't show up and be conciliatory to talk to them and your stock  will go down, at least if you're Twitter.</p><p>GORANI:  OK.  Thank you, Samuel Burke.</p><p>Now, big mystery here because U.S. officials are trying to figure out just  what caused passengers on boards an Emirates plane to become sick.  It was  a Dubai to New York flight and it was quarantined at JFK airport.  A number  of passengers and crew were taken to the hospital for treatment.  They  reportedly showed signs of fever and were coughing throughout the flight.   Mark Morales has more.  He's at JFK airport.  What's the status of the  plane now, Mark?</p><p>MARK MORALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the plane was cleared not --  earlier this afternoon.  The passengers were allowed to leave.  They only  took 11 of them to a local hospital for treatment.  That included seven  crew members.  Other passengers that were on the plane were allowed to go  through customs and clear out.</p><p>We've been here, we've been talking to passengers.  They've been giving us  their experience.  They heard a lot of coughing.  They experienced a lot of  this on line, just waiting to board the plane and on the actual flight  itself.  Take a listen.</p><p>LARRY COBEN, PASSENGER ON QUARANTINED EMIRATES FLIGHT:  Outside, there were  a series of ambulances and police cars, probably a dozen police cars and  half a dozen ambulances and we were told to remain in our seats, which we  did for quite some time.  Then someone from the CDC came on board and asked  us to fill out some forms.  And basically, you know, where we're going to  be for the next couple of weeks in case we show any symptoms or they  discover anything.</p><p>MORALES:  Now, there haven't been any official word as to what caused the  illnesses, but the symptoms that they're being treated for at the local  hospital include headache, sore throat, fever, cough.  And as far as we  know, they're still there at the moment.</p><p>GORANI:  All right, Mark Morales, thanks very much.</p><p>Still to come tonight, military moves kick into high gear ahead of an  expected offensive against Syria's last major rebel stronghold.  The very  latest, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:40:05] GORANI:  Well, military activity is picking up as the threat of  a government offensive looms over Syria's Idlib province.  Russia is now  confirming that it conducted Tuesday's air strikes there.  Activists say  the strikes killed five children and injured 12 civilians.</p><p>Meanwhile, rebels say they blew up a key bridge Wednesday cutting the path  to regime forces.  And Turkey sent more reinforcements to its border with  Syria.</p><p>Tuesday's strikes came just a few hours after President Trump tried the  draw the line on Idlib.  He told Syria and its allies not to go ahead with  the offensive, saying it could cost hundreds of thousands of lives.  And  then Nikki Haley, his U.N. ambassador said, essentially go ahead with an  offensive just as long as you don't use chemical weapons.  So many  interpreted that as pretty much a green light.</p><p>Our Senior International Correspondent, Fred Pleitgen, joins us from  Damascus with more.  What's the expectation with the Idlib offensive, Fred?   What are you hearing where you are?</p><p>FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I mean  really, Hala, when you speak to people here in Syria, I speak to government  officials, we also speak to regular Syrians, there are a lot of people here  in Syria who believe that that offensive is going to start.  And they  believe that offensive could start very, very soon.  It's no secret here to  many Syrians that Idlib is now surrounded, not just by a lot of Syrian  government troops, but it seems as though by some of the most elite of the  Syrian government troops.</p><p>A lot of those forces that were also involved in a lot of other big  operations here in the Syrian conflict.  Like for instance the offensive in  Aleppo, like for instance the recent one in southern Syria in places like  Golan and Daraa so these are battle-hardened forces.  They are now  apparently dug in and they would be ready to go at any time.</p><p>And you can certainly listen to Syrian officials and also some of the  backers as well, like for instance the Iranians and the Russians, all of  them seem unfazed by any of the talk that's coming out of the White House  or that might be coming from Nikki Hayley as well.  They say that they  believe that Idlib is what they call a hotbed of terrorism, obviously with  a lot of hardline Islamist groups that are situated in that area and they  believe that this is something that needs to move forward.</p><p>There were even some were saying who believe -- they believe that this is  something that should move forward very quickly.  So certainly, if you  listen to the folks here on the ground, they believe this operation will  happen and they believe that it could happen fairly soon, Hala.</p><p>GORANI:  Great.  They describe it, obviously, as a terrorist hotbed and  there are hardline Islamist fighters there.  No one is denying that.  They  number in the tens of thousands.  There are also three million civilians,  many of whom reject both the regime and these terrorist groups that are  caught in the middle.  What happens to them?</p><p>PLEITGEN:  Well, that's essentially -- right now, Hala, that's very much in  the hands of the three dominating outside powers here in this conflict.   The Russians, the Iranians, and of course the Turks as well.  We know that  there's a very high level meeting that's going to be happening on September  the 7th where essentially the leaders of these countries are going to hash  out how they intend to move forward, is there going to be this offensive?   Is there some other way to do this?</p><p>The Russians are saying there's a humanitarian corridor that they've set up  for people to be able to get out of Idlib province.  But of course, as you  point out, that means that they would be going into Syrian government-held  territory.  Of course a lot of people would be afraid to do that.</p><p>The big question is, can these people be given enough guarantees for them  to actually willingly be wanting to come back to this side?  It certainly  seem something that these (INAUDIBLE) might not be able to sort out at that  meeting, but it is something that could very well be on the table.  But  that seems to be the plan of the Syrian government and also of its backers  to say, look, the humanitarian corridors are out there, take them or leave  them.  There is a chance for people to get out.</p><p>Of course the Russians also have negotiations going on.  They have  apparently been negotiating with some of the villages in Idlib province  telling them, look, if you flip sides, if you get some of these rebels out  of your villages, we will spare you now.  Well, make sure that Syrian  government forces don't enter those villages until the Idlib offensive is  done.  Is that good enough?  For many of those in Idlib, big question mark.</p><p>GORANI:  Also, unclear how civilians will politely ask armed rebels, some  of them very hardened to politely leave their village.  I'm not sure  exactly how that would work.</p><p>Fred Pleitgen, thanks very much for joining us from Damascus.  Appreciate  it.</p><p>Let's get a closer look at what's happening inside Idlib province.  Ismail  Alabdullah is the spokesperson for the Syrian Civil Defense, a volunteer  rescue group also known as the White Helmets.  He is in northern Idlib.</p><p>Mr. Alabdullah, what is the situation now in the province after some  reported air strikes yesterday?</p><p>ISMAIL ALABDULLAH, SPOKESPERSON, WHITE HELMETS:  Air strikes yesterday  killed 13 people, including five kids and three women in different villages  of the west countryside of Idlib and (INAUDIBLE) and many villages.  After  the air strikes at night yesterday, there were mortars falling on the same  villages.</p><p>[15:45:03] Today, the air strikes stopped.  We haven't counted any air  strikes -- any air strikes in Idlib province.  Bombed Idlib brought across  and this time after crowded with three million civilians.  And there is no  another Idlib to go.  And that situation will be more, more difficult for  the people to live, more difficult to the civilians to survive in this  time.</p><p>There is no another Idlib.  If that forces and the (INAUDIBLE) start  bombing and killing the civilians, there will be big mess, because that's  what we've heard about.</p><p>GORANI:  Mr. Alabdullah, just to sum up, you're saying there's no other  Idlib to go.  In other words that this is the last refuge for civilians who  fled from other parts of Syria.  Though there was no bombing today, the  concern for you is there will be more bombing in the coming days.</p><p>Is there enough hospital, you know, equipment and doctors to respond to  increase air strikes now in Idlib?</p><p>ALABDULLAH:  If air strikes will increase in the future, of course, we  can't respond to all the bombing.  The hospitals will not receive all the  wounded people and the injured people, because the bombing will cause many  victims and many injured people.</p><p>Now, we have the equipment.  We can respond.  We can save the people.  The  hospitals can receive the injured people.  But if the offensive will be as  -- have been in Eastern Ghouta and Aleppo City, I was in Aleppo City and it  was like hellish bombing.  Hellish days.  If that will happen again in  Idlib city and all of the province, there's no -- we will not be able to  respond to all the bombing and all cause.</p><p>GORANI:  And lastly, when you say there is nowhere else to go, there is  really -- in the whole country, this is the last section of the country  that is controlled by rebel groups.  And there are all the civilians there  who have come from other parts of Syria.  If they have nowhere to go, what  happens to them?</p><p>ALABDULLAH:  That's the question.  Ninety percent of the people who are  living in the Idlib province are displaced people.  They came from south,  they came from Homs, they came from Aleppo, Eastern -- East Aleppo.  Now,  they are all trapped in this area and there is no place to go.  Maybe their  destiny to be killed.  With that blood chemical attacks as what happened in  Eastern Ghouta in 2013.  Maybe will be killed by barrel bombs, bombs,  cluster bombs, bunker buster bombs.</p><p>We don't know yet.  We will see.  We will wait.  As all the civilians,  three million are now scared, afraid about every single bombing or any news  of starting the offensive on the ground.</p><p>GORANI:  Ismail Alabdullah, the spokesperson for the White Helmets, joining  us live from Idlib province.  Thank you very much for your time this  evening.</p><p>Coming up, it's been described as crazy town.  But is all the focus on  Donald Trump and his chaotic White House distracting from the real issues  that affect everyone?  We'll discuss after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:50:28] GORANI:  Many people who dislike Donald Trump will see the  claims in Bob Woodward's book \"Fear\" as yet more proof that the president  is just simply unfit to serve in the role he holds.</p><p>But if you take away the chaos depicted in books like Woodward's, many big  concerns remain, like, how the administration, as a whole, is handling the  real day to day issues on both the domestic and international fronts?</p><p>For those who criticize the president and believe the problems stem from  him, and possibly him alone as an individual, are they missing the point?</p><p>Let's discuss this with assistant professor of global politics at the  University College London, Brian Klaas.  Thanks for being with us.</p><p>You on your Twitter account are very, very critical of the president.  You  get thousands and thousands of retweets and favorites.  But if you look at  the wider picture, ideologically speaking, all the people around him are  very much aligned with President Trump, they just don't do and say the  thing that cause outrage in the same way the president does.</p><p>BRIAN KLAAS, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF GLOBAL POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE  LONDON:  That's right.  So there is a Venn diagram that exists between  traditional Republican values and Donald Trump.  And in the middle of that  is something like health care policy and tax policy.  So I would expect  that if there were a change of leadership in the White House, if Trump were  to lose power, those things would continue.</p><p>But there's a lot of very much -- not overlap in areas like trade and  international security that are very different where, for example, NAFTA  and NATO.  Pence would be different on these.  He believes in multilateral  trade, he believes in multilateral alliances and security agreements.</p><p>And also, I think this is the most important point, is that Trump is  different because he's a threat to norms and institutions.  The way that he  lashes out at the press, at political institutions that are the pillars of  American -- </p><p>GORANI:  Isn't that a reflection of ideologically of the people closest to  him?  I mean, if you -- think about it.  John Kelly, long before he was  chief of staff was in favor of things like child separation.  I mean, you  had others, for instance, Mike Pence and his stance on certain issues  deemed homophobic.  Jeff Sessions as well on certain issues, ideologically  aligned with the president certainly domestically, right?</p><p>KLAAS:  Yes.  On a lot of issues, they are, in terms of policy.  The  difference is how aggressively they do these things.  You would not have a  Vice President Pence who would be regularly tweeting about how the press is  the enemy of the people or -- </p><p>GORANI:  Is it just the tweeting then?  Is it just how aggressive?  Is it  just because he's considered unfit in his behavior?</p><p>KLAAS:  But the tweeting is a reflection of policy, too.  I mean, the  administration is proceeding along the tweets as though they are official  presidential statements.  So when the president says, as he did three days  ago, for example, that it's a shame that Jeff Sessions is prosecuting  Republicans because they're Republicans for corruption charges.  That  actually has a knock-on effect, the chilling effect where people in the  Department of Justice and in law enforcement are getting orders on Twitter  from the president to basically protect his political allies.</p><p>GORANI:  Do you think things would be different if Mike Pence were  president?</p><p>KLAAS:  I think it'd be different in terms of norms, I think it'd be  different in terms of international trade and international security which  are very important, right?  These are major issues for the economy and for  national security.</p><p>GORANI:  But what about these very important policy announcements that you  say are made on Twitter?  We're talking immigration, trade, North Korea,  the fact that Nikki Haley said at the United Nations -- and it barely  registered on the radar in the United States, that essentially as long as  Assad doesn't use chemical weapons, you're free to go ahead and carpet-bomb  Idlib.  We're fine with it.</p><p>Is the focus on Trump, the individual and the outrageous behavior he  sometimes exhibits, taking away from serious journalistic coverage of  policy?</p><p>KLAAS:  Yes, in a word, yes.  And I think that there's also a question  about Mike Pence himself in a sense that because Trump was such a circus  act during the campaign itself, he wasn't vetted the same way that a normal  vice president would be vetted.  Most Americans don't know the things you  are talking about, with his homophobia in the past.</p><p>Well, for example in 2000, how he said that smoking doesn't cause cancer in  an op-ed.  That was never part of the conversation in a way that previous  vice presidential candidates have been vetted because Trump was a show.   And so I think it is a distraction in some ways from the policy -- </p><p>GORANI:  Is that a mistake?</p><p>KLAAS:  No.  I think we have to be good enough to be able to do both  tracks.  It is dangerous that Trump is a reckless impulsive individual who  makes policy by tweet -- it is also dangerous that the policy themselves  are not getting enough scrutiny.  But we have to rise to this occasion and  be able answer both challenges at the same time. We cannot simply say,  let's just -- let's disregard the insanity unfolding on Twitter or let's  just regard these policies that are potentially very dangerous.</p><p>GORANI:  Would you consider yourself part of the #resistance?</p><p>KLAAS:  No.  I think -- the way I always describe my -- </p><p>GORANI:  Because on Twitter, you are very much -- </p><p>KLAAS:  I'm extremely anti-Trump.  And I'm very critical of him.  But I say  that I am a non-partisan 2015 American because what I am arguing are things  that were uncontroversial two or three years ago.  I believe in a free  press.  I believe that people should not be scapegoated because of the  color of their skin.  I believe that religious minorities should be treated  with respect.  I believe that you should not make policy impulsively, you  should make it based on evidence and reason.</p><p>[15:55:22] Those things are now partisan.  But that doesn't make me  partisan.  It simply makes me anti-Trump because he's disrespecting those  basic principles that used to be foundational principles for both parties  in the United States.</p><p>GORANI:  But at the same time, Donald Trump is a natural outcome of many,  many years, whether the White House was in democratic or in Republican  hands, right?</p><p>KLAAS:  He is.  And I think one thing that's very clear is that for a lot  of people who support Trump, he will never be more guilty in their eyes  than the system he's attacking.  And that's one of the reasons why his base  is so solid.  So there is something that is good about Trump and that he's  producing a wakeup call in politics that people have been ignored for a  long time.  There are these -- the sort of under the surface anger, there's  also a lot of under the surface racism that he's tapped in to.</p><p>But in the end, I think that that positive story is absolutely swamped by  all the negative stories in terms of his impulsivity, his recklessness, the  corruption around him, and all these other stories.</p><p>GORANI:  Let me ask you about Steve Bannon invited and disinvited by the  New Yorker.  A lot of people, even really Trump opponents said that was a  huge own goal.  Because -- OK.  You invited him but then when you invite  him, don't disinvite him.  You're basically telling his base, you know,  we're snowflakes, we can't handle it.  It should be a free exchange of  ideas and you've turned it into a platform for people who are an echo  chamber for the same liberal ideas.</p><p>KLAAS:  Yes.  So I think this is a question where obviously it was  mishandled, to invite and disinvite was a mistake.  The question is whether  he should have been invited in the first place and that's a much trickier  question.</p><p>GORANI:  The Economist thinks that he should be.</p><p>KLAAS:  I think that Steve Bannon, when he was part of the administration,  was a legitimate newsmaker.  He's no longer part of the White House.  We  know that his views are bigoted.  And at some point, you have to say, do we  want to make that be the platform that we promote to a lot of other people?</p><p>He is not a run-of-the-mill conservative.  So people trying to say that  this is censoring conservative viewpoints are incorrect.  His views are  much more incendiary, the mainstream conservatives and he is effectively  peddled white nationalism on Breitbart for a very long time and had  headlines -- he printed headlines when he was a publisher of things like,  would you rather my child had feminism or cancer?  That is not a normal  viewpoint or a normal headline for a conservative publication.</p><p>GORANI:  He won't be at the New Yorker but he will be at the Economist  festival.  Thanks very much, Brian Klaas.  Always appreciate your time.</p><p>Thanks for watching tonight.

Fake CNN is prominent.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Mr. Trump added that ''they are controlling what we can &amp; cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!''</p><p>  Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council and a longtime advocate of deregulation, appeared to back Mr. Trump when asked by reporters later on Tuesday whether the administration would be pursuing more regulation of <person><nameText>Google. </nameText></person>''We'll let you know,'' Mr. Kudlow said. ''We're taking a look at it.''</p><p>  In a statement, <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>said that its search service was ''not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology.''</p><p>  The president's tweets landed at a difficult moment for the tech industry. There is a growing sense across the political spectrum in the United States and in other countries that something must be done to rein in their influence.</p><p>  Executives from many of the largest internet companies will face questions next week at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about their efforts to prevent foreign meddling in the midterm elections in November, a follow-up to congressional hearings held after the 2016 elections. Sheryl Sandberg, <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>chief operating officer, and Twitter's <person><nameText>Jack Dorsey </nameText></person>are scheduled to testify in front of the committee.</p><p><person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>has also been called to testify. Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina and the chairman of the Senate committee, has asked <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>to send <person><nameText>Sundar Pichai, </nameText></person>its chief executive. So far, the company has offered to send Kent Walker, its senior vice president of global affairs.</p><p>  Mr. Burr said he was unlikely to subpoena Mr. Pichai to testify, but that his absence would signal that <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>was choosing ''not to participate'' and be ''part of the solution.''</p><p>  Interfering in how companies like <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>present information would be a notable departure for the federal government, which has mostly taken a hands-off approach to the internet. Free-speech scholars said companies like <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>were free to operate with few restrictions thanks to a 1996 law called the Telecommunications Act.</p><p>  ''That law pretty much removes free-speech liability for <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Facebook,</nameText></person>'' said Roy Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at the Newhouse School. ''That being said, I think it'd be a major leap to believe that the people behind <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>are writing algorithms to discriminate against content.''</p><p>  Last month, regulators in Europe fined <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>$5.1 billion for antitrust violations. After the European fine, Mr. Trump said <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>was ''one of our great companies.''</p><p>  What sort of pressure regulators in the United States could exert is not entirely clear.</p><p>  The Justice Department, under both the Trump and Obama administrations, has shown little interest in pursuing antitrust cases against <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>or its parent company, Alphabet. Mr. Trump has often raised antitrust questions about another tech giant, Amazon, but little has come of his threats.</p><p>  Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has suggested that if internet companies are not a ''neutral platform,'' they should not be protected by a law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives companies broad legal immunity for what people put on their services.</p><p>  Appearing in front of reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump offered a vague expansion of his earlier criticism, saying that social news platforms were actively ''taking advantage'' of people. ''We have tremendous, we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in. And you just can't do that,'' Mr. Trump said.</p><p>  Mr. Trump's claims of bias appeared to be inspired by a segment Monday night from Lou Dobbs, a host on the Fox Business Network. Mr. Dobbs highlighted an article by a conservative website, PJ Media, that said that it had conducted what it called an unscientific study in which 96 percent of <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>search results for the word ''Trump'' were articles from ''left-leaning sites.''</p><p>  The piece was also featured on the website Drudge Report, whose operator, Matt Drudge, was an early supporter of Mr. Trump.</p><p>  Search engine experts said <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>uses many factors in its search algorithm -- including how often a web page is linked to by other sites and how often certain words appear on a page -- and that formula is constantly being updated.</p><p>  ''Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries,'' the company said. ''We continually work to improve <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.''</p><p>  Even longtime <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>critics disagreed with the premise of the PJ Media article.</p><p>  ''The industry should have plenty of concerns with <person><nameText>Google, </nameText></person>particularly antitrust and data collection practices, but this isn't one of them,'' said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. ''The president's tweets this morning are flat-out absurd.''</p><p>  Long before <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Apple and <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>had removed InfoWars from their sites, conservatives were zeroing in on Big Tech as a new enemy in the political culture wars. In February, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., guests packed a ballroom for a discussion called ''Suppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.''</p><p>  Although it provided a target for those in attendance, <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>was a sponsor of the conference. The company held a reception for conference attendees, with an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.</p><p>  Peter Schweizer, a right-wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton, has followed a similar line of attack as a writer and producer of a new documentary, ''The Creepy Line,'' which argues that Silicon Valley is stifling conservative content. The Daily Caller, a conservative news and opinion website, recently posted the trailer.</p><p>  During the presidential election, Trump campaign officials claimed <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>was manipulating search results to favor Hillary Clinton. But right after the election, the top <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>search result for ''final election vote count 2016'' was a link to a story that wrongly stated that Mr. Trump, who won the Electoral College, had also defeated Mrs. Clinton in the popular vote.</p><p>  Since then, <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>has updated its search algorithm to surface what it calls ''more authoritative'' news sources.</p><p>  The internet companies find themselves caught between conservatives who say they are being heavy-handed and others who say they are not doing enough to police their sites. Twitter only suspended Mr. Jones's account, for example, and was condemned by some of its own employees and many on the left for not being tougher.</p><p>  But the move by other tech giants earlier this month to ban Mr. Jones drew condemnation from a range of conservatives -- even some who say they do not care for Mr. Jones. ''Who the hell made <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>the arbiter of political speech?'' Mr. Cruz said in a tweet.</p><p>  Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the majority leader, has also raised concerns that Republican voices were being stifled online. He was joined by other Republican House leaders, including Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, Greg Walden, who threatened to subpoena Twitter's chief executive, <person><nameText>Jack Dorsey, </nameText></person>if he did not testify in Congress in a separate hearing on Sept. 5 on content moderation on the internet.</p><p>  ''Social media platforms are increasingly serving as today's town squares,'' Mr. McCarthy said in a statement after Mr. Dorsey agreed to testify. ''But sadly, conservatives are too often finding their voices silenced.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>says social news platforms are actively ''taking advantage'' of people.

In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me &amp; others, so that almost all stories &amp; news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative &amp; Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% of...[continuing tweet]...results on 'Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google &amp; others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can &amp; cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!\"</p><p>TechCrunch (8/28, Lomas, 595K) said Trump \"unleashed what looks to be his most sustained attack on Google to date - firing off a couple of tweets at ~5.30am Washington DC time,\" but CNBC (8/28, Browne, 4.81M) noted that \"around 11 a.m. ET\" he \"deleted the original tweets and reposted practically identical language.\" Axios (8/28, Hart, 2.49M) quotes Trump as telling reporters, \"I think Google is really taking advantage of a lot of people. And I think that is a very serious thing and it is a very serious charge. I think what Google and what others are doing, if you look at what is going on with Twitter and if you look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you can't do that to people. You can't do it. We have tremendous, we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in. And you just can't do that. And so I think that Google and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory and they have to be careful. It is not fair to large portions of the population.\"</p><p>Most media reports sounded a skeptical note on Trump's claims. NBC Nightly News (8/28, story 4, 2:10, Guthrie, 7.54M) asked whether the government \"could...begin regulating what you see when you do a Google search,\" and added (Jackson) that \"there's no reliable data to back up the President's claim. Google today tells NBC News, 'Search is not used to set a political agenda. We never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.'\" The CBS Evening News (8/28, story 6, 0:20, Dickerson, 5.51M) ran a 2-second piece, indicating Trump \"warned social media companies they'd better be careful,\" while ABC World News skipped the story altogether. Trump's comments, however, received relatively heavy coverage on local television, where reports were generally brief and very similar. The AP (8/28, Superville) says Trump \"lashed out at tech companies,\" but \"cited no evidence for the claim, which echoes both his own attacks on the press and a conservative talking point.\" The AP adds Trump \"has made similar complaints before, but he carried it a step further Tuesday by targeting Google.\" To Bloomberg News (8/28, Hunter, Brody, 4.46M), \"such accusations...have been a chief Trump talking point meant to appeal to the president's base.\"</p><p>Axios (8/28, McCabe, 2.49M) similarly reports, \"Reality Check: The right has been alleging for years that large tech companies are intentionally and systematically biased against them, but there's little evidence to back up those claims.\" To CQ Roll Call (DC) (8/28, Bennett, 117K), meanwhile, \"after nearly 48 hours of battle with the late Sen. John McCain...even after his death, the president needed a new foe on Tuesday,\" or \"at least a new way to change the subject and drive the day's narrative.\" The New York Times (8/28, Satariano, 19.33M) calls Trump's comments \"an about-face from last month, when he said Google was 'one of our great companies,'\" and adds that he \"has increasingly targeted technology businesses, along with the news media, over coverage that the White House does not like.\" The Times also reports \"Trump's attacks on technology companies have increased since Apple, Google and Facebook removed content from Alex Jones, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who has been a vocal supporter of Mr. Trump's agenda.\"</p><p>Bret Baier opened Fox News' Special Report (8/28, 2.13M) reporting that \"if you do a Google search on the words of Trump and Google you get results with words like rage, rigged, and conspiracy theory.\" Trump \"is not happy with Google over what he calls suppression of conservative voices and positive news about his Administration.\" CNN chief White House corespondent Jim Acosta said on CNN's Situation Room (8/28, 824K), however, that \"the reason behind the President's rant\" that \"he doesn't like the news reports he sees when he searches Google.\" The Los Angeles Times (8/28, Stanley-Becker, 4.03M) says \"it was unclear whether the president had Googled himself,\" though according to Politico (8/28, Murray, 3.51M) he appeared \"to be referencing an article from PJ Media, a conservative blog founded in the early 2000s,\" published over the weekend that featured a \"pie chart that says it breaks down 'Google search results for \"Trump\"' by party bias.\" Politico, however, says that \"neither Trump nor the PJ media article offered any proof that Google was purposely promoting negative stories about the president at the expense of positive ones.\"</p><p>The Hill (8/28, Birnbaum, 2.71M) similarly says Trump's \"96 percent\" claim \"appears to have originated with an article by PJ Media,\" and the New York Times (8/28, Satariano, 19.33M) says that \"Trump's criticism appeared to be inspired by a segment last night from Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs,\" who on Wednesday \"highlighted\" the PJ Media story. Dobbs said on Fox Business' Lou Dobbs Tonight (8/28, 291K) last night that PJ Media is \"saying straightforwardly, 'The 96 percent figure came directly from P J Media's supervising editor, Paula Bolyard. Using different laptops, she performed multiple Google searches for the word Trump and found pervasive bias in favor of left-leaning news outlets,' adding that Bolyard said in her article that her study was far from scientific and also tweeting the very same thing, but also pointing out that there is a far more in-depth study that supports much the same conclusion.\"</p><p>USA Today (8/28, Fritze, 11.4M) reports, however, that \"White House aides did not immediately respond to questions about Trump's use of Google or what prompted his tweet on Tuesday,\" and the Washington Examiner (8/28, Yilek, 340K) says \"what action the president might attempt wasn't immediately clear.\" However, hours after Trump's tweets, top economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters the White House is reviewing whether Google searches should be subject to some regulation. Kudlow, the Washington Post (8/28, Romm, 15.68M) reports, said the Administration \"is 'taking a look' at whether Google and its search engine should be regulated by the government.\" Kudlow added, \"We'll let you know. We're taking a look at it.\" The Post says his comments put Google \"squarely in the White House's crosshairs amid wider allegations against the tech industry that it systematically discriminates against conservatives on social media and other platforms.\" Politico (8/28, Morin, 3.51M) reports that \"neither Trump nor Kudlow elaborated on what actions the White House might take.\"</p><p>On that topic, Politico (8/28, Scola, Gold, 3.51M) reports that \"Trump has few direct ways of going after Google,\" but \"his administration and allies in Congress could find ways to make life difficult for the company.\" For example, DOJ antitrust officials \"could investigate whether the search giant is abusing its market dominance. Trump's Republican allies in Congress could subject the company to more unpleasant, high-profile hearings.\" Moreover, \"the president's public attacks could, over time, recast Google as a partisan player, a disturbing possibility for a company that depends on being the default search engine of choice for Americans of all political stripes.\" Axios (8/28, McCabe, 2.49M) outlines some steps the Administration could take, such as \"requiring more transparency around algorithms,\" \"making it easier to sue Big Tech\" or \"designating Google as a 'common carrier,'\" which would \"allow Congress to appoint a regulator to oversee Google (as well as other online platforms) given its significant power and reach, something that could in turn lead to more restrictions on how it moderates content.\"</p><p>Former White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short said on CNN Cuomo Prime Time (8/28, 1.34M), \"This has been an issue that has been rising in conservative circles for a while. I think there's a concern about bias in the mainstream media, so therefore more and more are getting their news from social platforms. Obviously Google is a large provider of that.\" Short added, \"I do think that where the Administration has to be careful is limited government people, we do not want more government regulation. It's important to make sure that that is not a step that the Administration takes.\"</p><p>Reuters (8/28, Heavey) also points out that \"Trump's criticism and threat of action to somehow restrict Google was his latest attack on a major tech company, following a series of tweets about Amazon.\" The Wall Street Journal (8/28, Salama, Macmillan, Subscription Publication, 6.13M) reports that in response to Trump's allegations, a Google spokeswoman said, \"We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.\"</p><p>Mollie Hemingway of The Federalist said on Fox News' Special Report (8/28, 2.13M), \"In the same way that you shouldn't just take what President trump is saying about Google news and how they rank things as the gospel truth, neither should you accept Google's denials, particularly when you have this history of Google admitting they' de-ranked based on their own editorial conceptions. ... There's a lot more that needs to be studied about their algorithms and particularly how when you have a company that has employed almost exclusively progressives or liberals, how that might affect the algorithms that they create.\" Breitbart (8/28, Nolan, 1.28M) indicates, for example, that \"Google's claims that it is politically unbiased have been disproved by Dr. Robert Epstein of the American Institute for Behavioral Research (AIBRT),\" who \"in a series of tests...examined Google's search feature and performed a number of tests in order to gain a greater insight into the possible bias that the search engine may display.\"</p><p>Susan Page of USA Today said on Fox News' Special Report (8/28, 2.13M), \"I think the problem that...Trump is seeing when he Googles his own name is that mainstream news sources and sources that are often linked by a lot of people come up first in the search. It's not like left wing news sources. It's the mainstream news sources that people rely on. The analysis by a conservative group that took a fault with the algorithm that Google uses ranked USA Today as a left wing news source and I can tell you that is not accurate.\"</p><p>Facebook Employees Complain Of Company Culture \"Intolerant\" Of Conservative Views.</p><p>The New York Times (8/28, Conger, Frenkel, 19.33M) reports on a post that \"went up quietly on Facebook's internal message board last week.

Offensive tweets from officials including the president's will be annotated by the tech giant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our new Attorney General Bill Barr -- had he been there initially this all would have not have happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: The president all but admitting he wanted control of the Russia investigation from the start.</p><p>BRIGGS: And another bizarre turn for Jussie Smollett. The files in his case are released before being resealed.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START on a Thursday, everybody. I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>DEAN: Hi, everyone. I'm Jessica Dean. It is 31 minutes past the hour.</p><p>Even Republicans appear bewildered by President Trump's promise to make the GOP the party of healthcare. Deep divisions over the Affordable Care Act that bogged down the party two years ago remain. And according to Axios, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told the president the decision to renew efforts to kill Obamacare made no sense, especially after Democrats routed the Republicans in the midterms in part over the issue of preexisting conditions.</p><p>BRIGGS: Right now the White House has no plan for replacing the Affordable Care Act if a decision by a Texas judge to strike down that law is upheld. But the administration insists there will at some point be a plan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARC SHORT, CHIEF OF STAFF TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: The president will be putting forward plans this year that we hope to introduce into Congress, Wolf. But the reality is that the court decision is likely not until the summer of 2020 by the time it would reach the Supreme Court.</p><p>We don't know how they would rule. The president has said repeatedly he would not sign any law unless it protected preexisting conditions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: President Trump has repeatedly promised to protect preexisting conditions but keeps backing plans that would eliminate them.</p><p>DEAN: The president will tweet and now Twitter will add its say. In a major shift for social media, Twitter will start labeling tweets from officials that violate its rules. Twitter's head of legal policy appeared at a \"Washington Post\" sponsored event in San Francisco. The social media giant is still refusing to remove President Trump's more questionable tweets saying they are in the public interests. But next time the president sends an offensive tweet, it might be accompanied by a note providing more information.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VIJAYA GADDE, TWITTER'S HEAD OF LEGAL POLICY: There are other types of content that we believe have -- are newsworthy or in the public interest that people may want to have a conversation around. But today when we leave that content on a platform, there's no context around that, and it just lives on Twitter and people can see it, and they just assume that that's the type of content or behavior that's allowed by our rules.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Even though your rules say no bullying.</p><p>GADDE: Exactly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Twitter will still remove tweets from anyone with violent or threatening content. The president regularly uses the platform to attack political enemies even sharing images of his foes behind bars. The president has also gone after big tech itself claiming it favors Democrats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I'm able to get the word out through my social media because I have great social media. But I'll tell you, it's much tougher than it should be. I deal with Twitter. It's not right the way they do it. And it seems to be if they're conservative, if they're Republicans, if they're in a certain group there's discrimination, a big discrimination.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) BRIGGS: There are growing concerns the president's Twitter behavior has influenced politicians on the local and state levels and abroad.</p><p>DEAN: President Trump heading to Grand Rapids, Michigan, tonight for his first campaign rally since the Mueller probe wrapped up. The president has already given his first TV interview since Attorney General Bill Barr delivered his summary.</p><p>[04:35:00] Barr effectively clearing the president of collusion but not on obstruction. In the interview on FOX News, the president railed against the Mueller probe calling it an attempted takeover of our government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Our new Attorney General Bill Barr is a great gentleman. And I've heard about him for years. He's a great -- he's a great man. Had he been there initially, this all would not have happened because what's gone on there is just a disgrace to our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: So the president says if he'd made Barr his first attorney general instead of Jeff Sessions, no Mueller report. As much as admitting he wanted to control the Russia investigation from the start. In fact, the Mueller probe started partly because Mr. Trump fired the first person investigating Russian collusion, that was James Comey. The former FBI director yesterday weighed in on Robert Mueller's decision to punt on the obstruction question.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI: The obstruction piece confuses me. The purpose of a special counsel is to make sure that the politicals, in this case the attorney general, doesn't make the ultimate call on whether the subject of the investigation, the president of the United States, should be held criminally liable for activities that were under investigation. And so the idea that the special counsel wouldn't reach the question and hand it to the political leadership doesn't make sense.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff sticking to his claim there is evidence of collusion even if Mueller could not prove the crime of conspiracy.</p><p>Schiff is not backing off his investigation, but he says he is in a holding pattern until more is learned about what the special counsel uncovered. Schiff says he wants to hear from Robert Mueller.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CHAIRMAN, INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: He is going to have to come in and testify. At what point that takes place, whether that's before or after we get the report or the underlying evidence may depend on how much Bill Barr stalls in providing that report to the public.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: On that point House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler says that Barr will not commit to releasing the full Mueller report. House Democrats have set an April 2nd deadline.</p><p>DEAN: The case of \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett going from surprising to flat-out bizarre. The Illinois attorney general has been asked to review the handling of that case. Prosecutors this week abruptly dropped charges that Smollett allegedly plotted a bogus attack on himself.</p><p>BRIGGS: He was let off despite video evidence showing his attackers buying materials that Smollett gave them cash for. On Wednesday the Chicago Police Department released a portion of Smollett's investigative reports and before being advised a court order actually prohibited the release.</p><p>DEAN: Cook County state's attorney Kim Foxx claims clerks made a mistake sealing the case even though the prosecutor in court did not object when Smollett's lawyers asked for the record to be sealed. Foxx had recused herself in that case and says she believes her office could have obtained a conviction against Smollett. Still she defends her office's decision to drop the charges.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIM FOXX, COOK COUNTY STATE'S ATTORNEY: The likelihood that someone would get a precedent sentence for a class four felony is slim. I don't want people to believe that there are two measures of justice for the privileged and those without. Once the rhetoric and the emotions stop, we will stand by our record.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has called the decision a whitewash of justice.</p><p>BRIGGS: Embattled plane maker Boeing making its most direct attempt to fix a safety issue that investigators believe led to two recent crashes that killed 346 people. Regulators and some 200 pilots gathered at its plant in Washington state as it unveiled an overhaul to its safety software and train pilots through scenarios on a flight simulator.</p><p>DEAN: On Capitol Hill, the FAA's acting chief fiercely defended the federal government's approach delegating broad oversight and safety certification of 737 Max planes to Boeing itself. He also told lawmakers early data was not enough to warrant grounding the planes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANIEL ELWELL, ACTING ADMINISTRATOR OF FAA: I can't speak to the reasoning that the other nations took. I know that in communication with those countries they -- in our request what data might they have, they did not have any data for us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: Southwest, the largest domestic carrier in the U.S., says it's taken a huge hit in large part because of the grounding of the 737 Max jets. It says it's cut 9400 flights in the past six weeks and more cancellations are expected.</p><p>BRIGGS: Breaking overnight, a shooting rampage in Seattle leaving two people dead and two others critically wounded. Seattle Police describe the killings as a random senseless act. The incident unfolding when a gunman tried to carjack a woman. She was shot and is in critical condition. The gunman then set his sights on a crowded bus.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[04:40:03] MARC GARTH GREEN, SEATTLE DEPUTY POLICE CHIEF: The suspect then opened fire on the metro bus striking the driver. The driver was able to back the bus up and turn it around and get it out of the area where it is currently where you see it right now, to a safe area, where we're able to get aid to him and the passengers on the bus.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: Police said the gunman then carjacked another car, shooting and killing the 50-year-old driver. A high speed police chase ensued. The suspect collided with another car killing that 70-year-old driver. After a brief standoff, officers took the suspect into custody.</p><p>BRIGGS: Somebody in Wisconsin has a lot of extra cheddar this morning. The one jackpot winning ticket in Wednesday's $768 million Powerball drawing was sold in Wisconsin. The jackpot is the third largest in U.S. history and Powerball's second biggest ever. Those winning numbers 16, 20, 37, 44, 62, and your Powerball, 12.</p><p>Congratulations to someone.</p><p>A check on CNN Business now at 4:40 Eastern Time. The United States and China inching closer to a trade deal and the president's measure of whether or not the U.S. is winning on trade is shrinking. New data from the Commerce Department shows the trade deficit declined nearly 15 percent to $51 billion in January. That is the largest drop since March last year. The trade deficit with China fell 6.4 percent in January. That's partly due to U.S. importers pulling back after rushing to buy Chinese goods before tariffs escalated.</p><p>President Trump had threatened to raise tariffs this month, but that did not happen. The data also shows a rise in soybean purchases from China. Beijing had stopped buying soybeans from American farmers last year in retaliation to Trump's tariffs but the Chinese bought $1.2 billion worth of soybeans in January.</p><p>There is now more pressure to get a deal done. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade rep Robert Lighthizer are in Beijing for two days of talks. A Chinese delegation comes to Washington in April. The grand finale would be a signing ceremony at Mar-a-Lago in late April.</p><p>DEAN: No deal times eight. British lawmakers cannot agree on a Brexit plan even as the prime minister says she will quit just to get the job done. We are live in London.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[04:46:26] JOHN BERCOW, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS: Order. Order. I said order. I'm finishing. Order.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: The United Kingdom hopelessly deadlocked over Brexit. Lawmakers failing to agree on an alternative to the plan being pitched by Theresa May. The prime minister even offering to resign in a desperate attempt to save her deal.</p><p>So what happens now? We go live to 10 Downing Street and bring in Nic Robertson to explain what is an incredibly complicated situation without a lot of answers -- Nic.</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: A chaotic, complicated, you heard it there yesterday, it was some kind of a show going on there in parliament. But it didn't show the parliamentarians the way forward, it didn't show them after all the different eight votes that were supposed to be indicative votes that would supposed to indicate where the MPs could actually have agreement and perhaps find an alternative path to Theresa May's agreement.</p><p>They didn't do it. Every one of those eight different propositions was voted down, some of them narrowly. Theresa May on the other hand offered her resignation dated sometime later this year, sometime she will hand off the Brexit negotiations to a new leader, the Conservative Party. A new leader of the country. We still don't have an exact date on that.</p><p>Of course what also isn't clear at the moment is, can Theresa May resurrect that agreement that she's made with the E.U. and get it voted through the Houses of Parliament. She's tried it twice. It's been hugely defeated twice. There's a possibility she might bring it to a vote this week, but you know what, she doesn't have the support for it still despite offering her resignation there. She still needs the support of those hard line Democratic Unionist MPs from Northern Ireland.</p><p>She doesn't have it. It doesn't seem like it's there for the taking right now. It's not clear how the country moves forward from here.</p><p>DEAN: All right. Nic Robertson, more to come. Thank you.</p><p>BRIGGS: New cars sold in Europe will have to be equipped with speed limiters starting in 2022. The European Union agreeing to new safety rules that require intelligence speed assistance systems. They can be temporarily overridden by the driver. Some automakers have GPS or cameras that detect posted speed limits and make sure drivers adhere. Most safety experts are applauding the new measures but some are raising concerns about drivers becoming complacent and less focused on the road.</p><p>DEAN: Facebook announces it is banning all content that in any way glorifies white nationalism. This comes less than two weeks after the suspect in the New Zealand mosque attacks streamed the massacre live on Facebook. The social network says it has long prohibited hateful treatment of people based on race, but had not applied the same standard to white nationalism.</p><p>Facebook will start directing people who search for terms associated with White House supremacy to organizations that help people leave hate groups.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK. How long would you be willing to watch the \"Avengers\"? Well, it could take a while. CNN Business has the details next.</p><p>[04:54:01] DEAN: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is defending her proposal to cut funding for the Special Olympics. She's coming under fire for her plan to cut 12 percent from the department's budget. It is the third year in a row DeVos has called for eliminating funding for Special Olympics events at schools, and she argues, quote, \"The Special Olympics is not a federal program. It's a private organization. I love its work. There are dozens of worthy nonprofits that support students and adults with disabilities that don't get a dime of federal grant money.\"</p><p>DeVos claims the Special Olympics does not need federal backing because the program can raise private contributions and she says she actually made a private donation to the organization last year.</p><p>BRIGGS: An $80 million award for a California man who says Roundup gave him cancer. A federal jury found the popular Monsanto weed killer was a substantial factor causing Edwin Hardeman's non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Hardeman claimed Roundup's design was defective and Monsanto was negligent in not warning of the product's risks.</p><p>[04:55:07] Bayer, Monsanto's parent company, says it will appeal. Hardeman is the first lawsuit against Monsanto to reach trial in a federal court. About 11,000 similar cases are still pending.</p><p>DEAN: James Fields, the man accused of driving his car into a crowd of counter-protestors at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, has changed his plea to avoid the death penalty. Fields was convicted of 29 federal hate crimes for that 2017 attack that resulted in the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer. In court Wednesday Fields changed his plea from not guilty to guilty. He will be sentenced in July.</p><p>BRIGGS: Police in Florida have identified the student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who apparently took his own life last weekend. Sixteen-year-old Calvin Desir was a sophomore. He's the second teenager who attended Stoneman Douglas during the Parkland shooting to die by suicide recently. The other, Sydney Aiello, she was 19, she graduated last year. Their deaths have put a renewed focus on post-traumatic stress and lasting effects of mass shootings.</p><p>If you or someone you know might be a risk of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, 1-800-273-88255.</p><p>DEAN: For the first time in more than two decades, the FDA is proposing new guidelines to modernize breast cancer screenings. All women in the U.S. getting mammograms would receive information about breast density. Dense tissue can obscure signs of breast cancer.</p><p>The FDA has also proposed expanding the categories used to classify mammography findings. And this should help screening facilities to more precisely classify those findings. It will also help patients and care providers make more informed decisions after receiving mammogram results.</p><p>BRIGGS: McDonald's will no longer pay lobbyists to fight minimum wage hikes. In a letter to the National Restaurant Association, the company says it believes pay increases should be phased in. The average starting salary for employees at corporate owned stores is above $10 an hour and workers are hard to find for low-paying jobs in a labor market with an unemployment rate below 4 percent. McDonald's has been a target for groups fighting to raise the minimum wage nationwide.</p><p>DEAN: Caught on video, a criminal suspect sucker-punches a Florida public defender at a bond hearing. Lawyer Julie Chase was appearing on behalf of another Broward County inmate. A defendant waiting for his own hearing then gets up, walked up behind Chase and punched her in the head. That defendant 27-year-old William Green had been arrested Tuesday charged with attacking a hospital technician. The public defender's office says it was a poor judgment call for Green not to be under closer supervision. Chase was treated and released in a nearby hospital and is now at home.</p><p>BRIGGS: A California woman has been awarded $150,000 in child support nearly 50 years after her divorce. Toni Anderson married Don Lenhart in 1966. They split two years later. A judge ordered him to pay child support for their then 3-year-old daughter but he never did. The 74-year-old Anderson says last year she had a life-changing realization that there is no statute of limitations for child support in California, so she Googled her ex-husband, found him living in Oregon with a big house and a boat. Anderson filed a motion for the unpaid child support. A judge granted her request, and perhaps now she gets her own boat.</p><p>Let's get a check on CNN Business this morning. Global markets are a mix as U.S.-China trade talks continue. Asian markets closed lower. European markets are higher at the beginning of trading there. On Wall Street, futures are higher. Markets finished lower Wednesday, the Dow closed down 32 points recovering from an earlier slide of 232.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both closed lower as well. An important number for investors and the president, GDP will be released this morning. Economists expect fourth quarter GDP to be as low as 1.8 percent. That is well below the president's goal of 3 percent.</p><p>Ford is pulling the plug on its car business in Russia closing three of the four plants it operates there. The company said that a joint venture investors will now concentrate on making commercial vehicles. Last year Ford announced it would restructure its global operations in order to free up resources for electric and self-driving cars. Ford says it expects most plant closings and cut backs to happen outside of North America as part of its restructuring.</p><p>We are less than one month away from this year's biggest film, \"Avengers: End Game,\" and fans, well, you might be sitting a while watching the team beat Thanos.</p><p>An online ticketing site AMC Theaters reported \"End Game\" ran 182 minutes, or just over three hours before deleting that information.</p><p>[05:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019032802CNV34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRY-TN21-DXH2-60PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3452\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

One of the individuals confirmed Microsoft was in the lead to acquire the popular platform's U.S. service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the order was expected to be signed Friday, people had warned that it could fall through since the president was also considering other approaches, including designating TikTok under an executive order that allows the president to exclude national security threats from U.S. networks.</p><p>Late Friday, the president told reporters he was not in favor of a deal to let a U.S. company buy TikTok's U.S. operations. Trump said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to ban TikTok.</p><p>\"Well, I have that authority. I can do it with an executive order or that,\" he said, referring to emergency economic powers.</p><p>The order that would force a sale, which stems from a national security investigation, is fairly rare but has been used by Trump as recently as March, when the president ordered a Chinese company to sell its stake in a U.S. hotel-software company. Last year, the Trump administration used it to demand the Chinese owners of gay dating app Grindr give up control of the company.</p><p>If Microsoft did acquire TikTok, it would make it a major rival to Facebook, Google's YouTube and other tech giants overnight, dramatically reshaping the U.S. social media landscape. </p><p>The prospect of a forced sale came amid growing concern among U.S. officials that the Chinese government could access users' private data, something that prompted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to say earlier this month that the United States is \"certainly looking at\" banning TikTok.</p><p>Branches of the U.S. military, including the Army and Navy, have banned the app from government-issued phones. The Pentagon urged its employees last year to uninstall the app due to security concerns.</p><p>On Friday, Trump reiterated that option. \"We may be banning TikTok,\" Trump told reporters before leaving for Florida. \"We may be doing some other things. There are a couple of options. But a lot of things are happening, so we'll see what happens. But we are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok.\"</p><p>TikTok spokesperson Hilary McQuaide declined to comment on the expected order, but she said they are \"confident in the long-term success of TikTok.\" Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported the news on the divestiture.</p><p>The other order the government could apply is the 2019 International Economic Emergency Powers Act, which effectively bans any communications tool that is a national security threat to the United States.</p><p>If Trump uses the \"full force\" of the remedies under the executive order, said Stewart Baker, a former National Security Agency general counsel, \"No American could work for them. The app store couldn't make them available. American advertisers couldn't pay them for ads. It would be economically devastating for them.\"</p><p>TikTok has continually insisted that it does not hand over information to the Chinese government. \"We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked,\" McQuaide said earlier this month.</p><p>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency body whose powers were strengthened by 2018 legislation, recommends to the president whether certain proposed takeovers should be rejected, and whether completed takeovers should be reversed, on national security grounds. CFIUS began investigating an acquisition by Beijing-based ByteDance after lawmakers asked the government to step in over national security concerns.</p><p>ByteDance bought karaoke app Musical.ly in 2017 and merged it with TikTok, launching the app to mass popularity in the United States.</p><p>James Andrew Lewis, vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said foreign companies usually take the hint when they think a demand from the U.S. government will be coming.</p><p>\"Usually everyone gets the message and takes action without waiting for formal government action,\" he said.</p><p>Buying TikTok could reshape the Big Tech landscape, giving Microsoft a strong foothold in the U.S. consumer market with one of the world's fastest growing social media platforms. Unlike many of its competitors, Microsoft does not have a creative social media company to sow brand recognition with younger users, though the Redmond, Wash.-based company does own professional networking site LinkedIn.</p><p>While the acquisition could raise some antitrust eyebrows, regulators haven't typically blocked acquisitions of business lines that are dissimilar from what a company already does. Microsoft also has deep ties with the U.S. government, most recently winning the Pentagon's JEDI cloud computing contract. Microsoft as a buyer could help quell administration security concerns about TikTok data.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called out TikTok as a rival during a congressional antitrust hearing earlier this week, at which Microsoft was noticeably absent.</p><p>TikTok has tried in recent months to convince U.S. users and regulators of its strong ties to the country. It emphasizes that it has hundreds of employees in the United States and even hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer to be its new chief executive in May.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mayer pledged the company will allow U.S. regulators and privacy experts to take a closer look under its digital hood, offering them the ability to \"examine\" its underlying software code in response to claims it is handing off data to the Chinese government.</p><p>The app, which lets users create and post short videos with music and other effects, has surged in popularity even more during the coronavirus pandemic as people search for at-home activities and distractions. Teens are especially active on TikTok, creating videos showcasing their dancing, pranks and cooking skills.</p><p>This is the latest in a string of moves by the Trump administration to counter Chinese tech giants.</p><p>Tension has already come to a head over Chinese telecom giant Huawei, the world's largest provider of mobile network gear - a field from which U.S. companies are largely absent. The United States calls Huawei a security risk, which the company denies, and has undertaken an international lobbying campaign to persuade other countries not to buy from Huawei.</p><p>The Trump administration has also targeted other Chinese companies, restricting trade with more than a dozen it accuses of supplying surveillance gear in the western province of Xinjiang, where U.S. officials and human rights groups say China's ruling Communist Party is holding Muslims in mass detention camps.</p><p>The Trump administration has also previously used CFIUS to scrutinize, block or reverse Chinese acquisitions.</p><p>In March, Trump ordered a Chinese company to divest all ownership of a U.S. hotel-software company, saying the Beijing investor could harm U.S. national security. A written order from the president's office suggested the administration was concerned about Chinese access to StayNTouch's hotel-guest data.</p><p>The order, which followed a CFIUS review, instructed the Chinese company to immediately to refrain from accessing any of StayNTouch's hotel-guest data.</p><p>The Chinese company, Beijing Shiji Information Technology, acquired StayNTouch in 2018, saying the U.S. company's software was used in connection with 90,000 hotel rooms globally.</p><p>After the order was issued, Beijing Shiji said it was \"not a threat to U.S. security in any way.\"</p><p>\"We offered a range of significant proposals to mitigate any concerns the U.S. government might have, including further restricting access to guest data and appointing an independent monitor to ensure these protections. Unfortunately, those offers were rebuffed,\" the company said at the time.</p><p>In 2018, after a CFIUS review, Trump ordered Singapore-based Broadcom to abandon its $117 billion bid for the U.S. semiconductor company Qualcomm, blocking what would have been one of the biggest technology deals in history.</p><p>A full presidential order isn't always required to block or reverse a deal. Lawyers familiar with CFIUS reviews say the national security committee can tell a foreign company: sell the asset or the president will issue an order.</p><p>That appears to be what happened last year, when the Trump administration forced a Chinese company to sell its majority stake in a U.S. health-care-data company, PatientsLikeMe.</p><p>When Pompeo said earlier this month that TikTok might be banned, frantic users took to the app to bemoan its potential demise and urge followers to find them on other social media sites.</p><p>\"I really hope that this will not happen,\" one user said in a video. \"All the videos, all the memories of you. This can't be true.\"</p><p>             Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-2a786b9f864e4d10b0f2040ae0f1a3d6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GJ-5D41-JB4M-V011-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1551\"/><timeReceived>7:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I think I'd be hurting it very badly if we didn't use it anymore.\" Trump also told reporters that he would delete his Twitter account \"in a heartbeat\" if there was not so much \"fake news\" \u2014 referring to critical coverage by journalists. He has often said that Twitter is his preferred platform for communicating directly with the American public.Go deeper: Trump has turned Big Tech's speech rules into a political football[4] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/sDbbn7Gj-AeXnLRNE.html\">https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/sDbbn7Gj-AeXnLRNE.html</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/can-trump-regulate-or-shut-down-twitter-facebook-2020-5\">https://www.businessinsider.com/can-trump-regulate-or-shut-down-twitter-facebook-2020-5</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-executive-order-social-media-protections-8a53f1c6-3c05-4844-98a3-071373b497a8.html\">https://www.axios.com/trump-executive-order-social-media-protections-8a53f1c6-3c05-4844-98a3-071373b497a8.html</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-social-media-free-speech-rules-576b2614-d45d-4559-8236-5ead5e0e247c.html\">https://www.axios.com/trump-social-media-free-speech-rules-576b2614-d45d-4559-8236-5ead5e0e247c.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO10009544159070595301975776100098</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-B8Y1-F03R-N3JN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"337\"/><timeReceived>10:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He's made it still more complicated with a rant on Twitter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GEORGE HOWELL, CNN HOST: Plus, hope for a tipping point. Firefighters in the U.S. State of California working overtime, trying to contain more than a dozen devastating fires there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALLEN: Also this hour, voting is under way in Zimbabwe, and for the first time in decades the name Mugabe is not on the ballot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HOWELL: Live from CNN world headquarters in Atlanta, we welcome our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm George Howell.</p><p>And I'm Natalie Allen. And you're watching CNN Newsroom.</p><p>HOWELL: At 3:00 a.m. on the U.S. East Coast, the U.S. President Donald Trump has a busy week ahead of him.</p><p>ALLEN: On Monday, he's expected to take questions from reporters in a joint news conference with the visiting prime minister of Italy. Mr. Trump will likely be asked about his latest Twitter rant against the special counsel, Robert Mueller. The president now claiming Mueller has multiple conflicts of interest in the Russia investigation.</p><p>HOWELL: In addition to that, there are still questions about the tapes the president's former attorney just released as well as Mr. Trump's threat to shut down the government to get funding for his border wall that he said Mexico would pay for but in fact he means the taxpayers will pay for.</p><p>ALLEN: CNN's Boris Sanchez is traveling with the president, or he was in New Jersey. He has more on Mr. Trump's Twitter tirade. That's hard to say.</p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: CNN has reached out to the White House to get clarity on specifically what President Trump was referencing when he mentioned business conflicts with the special counsel Robert Mueller. We have yet to hear back. But previous reporting may indicate what the president was talking about here. Earlier this year, the Washington Post and the New York Times separately reported that the president had privately expressed frustration with what he sees as conflicts of interest with Robert Mueller rooted in what he believes are unpaid dues that Robert Mueller owed his golf club in Virginia.</p><p>A spokesperson for the special counsel at the time responded to the Washington Post saying that those claims being made by President Trump were inaccurate.</p><p>Of course the broader context here is that reporting came out when the New York Times published that four sources had told them that President Trump tried to fire Robert Mueller last year and that in that process he expressed his frustration to Don McGahn, the White House counsel.</p><p>Don McGahn refused to carry out that order to fire Mueller. In fact, he threatened to resign according to sources. At that point President Trump backed off of his decision to try to fire Mueller.</p><p>Now he's obviously frustrated again, tweeting out some of his most direct attacks on the special counsel. The backdrop of that of course is this bombshell reporting.</p><p>Sources close to Michael Cohen, the president's former attorney, saying he is prepared to testify to the special counsel that President Trump approved that June 2016 meeting between his son Donald Trump, Jr., other members of his campaign, and Russian nationals, promising dirt on Hillary Clinton.</p><p>It also comes on the heels of the release of that secret recording made by Michael Cohen of a conversation that he had with President Trump. Rudy Giuliani, the president's relatively new attorney, talked about those recordings this weekend, suggesting that they had been tampered with or doctored. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VOICE CLIP)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: He abruptly ended that recording as soon as the president said the word check. We are now -- what we're investigating is why did -- how did that happen? What actually did happen? What was eliminated? And then he's got to raise that question with every one of these tapes, how many of them did he play around with.</p><p>We have determined the fact that he tampered with the tape in the sense that he abruptly mid-conversation turned it off. Now, we know he didn't do that for a good reason.</p><p>(END VOICE CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ: The president and his legal team strategy here is clear. They want to question the credibility not only of Michael Cohen, who just a few months ago they referred to as an honorable man, but also the veracity of the recordings that he made. Boris Sanchez, CNN, traveling with the president just outside Bedminster, New Jersey.</p><p>HOWELL: Boris, with the reporting, thank you. And now let's dig deeper with Scott Lucas. Scott a professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham. live this hour in Birmingham, England. A pleasure to have you on the show with us.</p><p>Look, we understand the publisher of the New York Times told the president his attacks on the media were divisive and dangerous. The president, then on Twitter, airing out his typical grade school name calling. Nothing new to that.</p><p>But noteworthy to point out he is leaning into these media attacks more as we get closer to the mid-terms. How will that play beyond Mr. Trump's base as people now see the president's playbook?</p><p>SCOTT LUCAS, POLITICS PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM: We've got two fronts going on, George. One that Boris Sanchez referred to is the Trump Russia investigation. And this is not just a question of questioning the credibility of the former lawyer Michael Cohen or the credibility of special counsel Robert Mueller.</p><p>[03:05:07] Trump and his camp have to destroy the credibility of those men and possibly others to keep the investigation from closing and possibly bringing the president down.</p><p>But the second front of course, as you mentioned, is the election front. We are now just about three months away from the congressional midterms. And amongst the tweets yesterday Donald Trump was also tweeting about immigration. And what is quite clear is that the Trump campaign is going to double down on zero tolerance on immigration despite the separation of children from parents.</p><p>It's going to double down on the idea that the media is their enemy and they hope the combination of those attacks on journalists and focusing on immigration gives him enough drive amongst enough voters that the Republicans can keep control of the House and Senate in November.</p><p>HOWELL: Mr. Trump's Twitter flow also attacking the special counsel, claiming conflicts of interest, Scott. What do you make of that?</p><p>LUCAS: I think again Boris Sanchez had it right. You know, Trump has got this idea that Robert Mueller owes him money at one of his golf clubs and that the entire motivation for the special counsel must be because he doesn't want to pay up.</p><p>I suspect that isn't true, that Robert Mueller has motivations far beyond that. Carrying out a legal investigation--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOWELL: (Inaudible) survive.</p><p>LUCAS: Yes. But I think Donald Trump's grasping at straws. As is Rudy Giuliani. You know, Take Trump's tweet saying Robert Mueller owes me money and Rudy Giuliani saying, that tape must have been tampered with, although there's absolutely no evidence it was, and that just tells you that the idea is to throw up enough mud on the wall, enough smoke in the eyes, that the realities of the Trump Russia investigation doesn't actually take over and bring him down.</p><p>HOWELL: As the relationship continues to unravel between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump and we're seeing their legal team, Scott, no longer sharing information, there's also the issue around Allen Weisselberg being subpoenaed. Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Foundation. This is the man who knows all of the financial inner workings. How big of a risk could this be to Trump world?</p><p>LUCAS: How big is a mountain? Or rather several mountains. I mean, just to repeat to viewers, this is now three interlinked investigations. One is around the Trump campaign.</p><p>The second is around the workings of the Trump organization including before the campaign. That's why Michael Cohen is so important. And the third is the Trump foundation. And money which was supposedly spent, supposed to go to charity but there are question marks.</p><p>And that's why Allen Weisselberg is so important. I'm not saying that this necessarily means the end of Donald Trump, but what it means is this is more than simply now an issue of one particular Russian hacker.</p><p>And on top of this remember one other thing, George. The trial of Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, starts this week and goodness knows what comes out of that.</p><p>HOWELL: It will be interesting. That case certainly focused on bank and tax crimes. Financial fraud. But you know, not connected to the Trump camp, Mr. Trump directly, but the question is how will that impact Paul Manafort with the bigger investigation playing out?</p><p>Scott Lucas, thank you so much for your time today. We'll stay in touch with you.</p><p>LUCAS: Thank you.</p><p>ALLEN: Well, in a few hours the Trump administration is facing another reunification deadline order by a judge. We're talking about what's going on at the border. This time the administration has to provide a list to the American Civil Liberties Union detailing the migrant children it has reunited with their families.</p><p>Meantime, President Trump is returning to a central campaign issue that fired up his base in 2016. His promise to build a border wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are going to build a great border wall!</p><p>We will build a great, great wall.</p><p>We're going to build a wall. Don't worry about it. We're building it.</p><p>I promise, we will build the wall.</p><p>And who's going to pay for the wall?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL: Well, now he's asking United States citizens to pay for the wall. He wants Congress to foot the bill.</p><p>And he's again threatening a government shutdown if he doesn't get his way. Tweeting this. Quote, \"I would be willing to shut down the government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for border security, which includes the wall.\"</p><p>ALLEN: And along that border more than 700 children separated from their parents at the border still have not been reunited with their families, as we mentioned, after the court-ordered reunification deadline passed Friday.</p><p>For more on that story Kaylee Hartung is in McAllen, Texas.</p><p>KAYLEE HARTUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As we've reported on the impact of President Trump's zero tolerance policy, we've learned that no two family stories are the same. But there have been some common threads among them. That of confusion and frustration.</p><p>At times, chaos and incredible challenges in communication. The story that best encapsulates where we are today, though, is that of a woman we'll call Alejandra.</p><p>[03:10:03] About a month and a half ago, she and her 6-year-old daughter crossed the U.S. border. They had fled their home country of Honduras because of the gang violence there. When they crossed the border, they were detained and separated.</p><p>Eleven days ago, Alejandra was told that she would be reunited with her daughter later that day, given her paperwork for release. But that never happened. As of today she continues to sit in a detention facility in Texas. Her daughter remains in New York. And as Alejandra asks questions, as she sits in limbo, here's what she says she's told.</p><p>(BEGIN VOICE CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): The first thing that I ask is always, do you know when will be, my girl will be brought here so she can be reunified with me? And they tell me, no, I don't know anything, they say to me.</p><p>(END VOICE CLIP)</p><p>HARTUNG: Alejandra's daughter's attorney has been told a red flag has been raised in the child's case. HHS says they will not comment on specific cases. But a spokesperson tells CNN that any family who hasn't been reunited yet is because of specific concerns they have for that family. As I said, no two stories are alike, but frustration remains for so many.</p><p>Kaylee Hartung, CNN, McAllen, Texas.</p><p>HOWELL: Mr. Trump's top economic adviser is defending the president's trade war with China.</p><p>ALLEN: Larry Kudlow once called tariffs a regressive tax on low- income families.

That's always been my view. Most free traders agree, China has not played by the rules and the trading system is broken largely because of them.</p><p>Now, I hope we get to our E.U. trade deal. Let me say this. The president has adopted a view with which I completely agree. He's a free trader. And he wants to have no tariff.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL: Kudlow claims President Trump is trying to fix a completely broken world trading system.</p><p>ALLEN: A ferocious wildfire tears through Northern California. Firefighters may have finally turned a corner in containing it. But the tragedy continues as people have lost their lives.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED BLEDSOE, LOST FAMILY IN CARR FIRE: He said come get me. He said come and get me. The fire's coming in the back door. Come on, grandpa. I said I'm right down the road.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL: It's a very emotional story. It will stick with you. CNN speaks with a man who lost his wife and great grandchildren in one of those raging wildfires in California. Stay with us.</p><p>[03:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ALLEN: Welcome back to CNN Newsroom.</p><p>Firefighters hope they have reached a turning point in their fight to contain a massive wildfire in Northern California. In just a week the so-called Carr fire has burned more than 95,000 acres. That's about 38,000 hectares. It has destroyed more than 870 structures. That's a lot of homes for many people.</p><p>And for the moment it is now 17 percent contained. But it is still burning everything in its path, even take a look at this right here, this boat dock.</p><p>HOWELL: We know that at least six people have died so far in these fires, including two children and their great grandmother. The widowed great grandfather told our Dan Simon that he spoke to his family as the fire closed in on them. This is a very emotional thing he has to say. Just listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLEDSOE: I left and went to town. My wife called me, she said, we can see the fire way over there. She said you need to come and get me. I said I'm on my way. So I just throw down everything, took off over there. I got up on Quartz Hill and there's two or three or four lanes of traffic coming up, wouldn't let me down in there.</p><p>So I just dropped everything and I took off running down there and I helped some guy that got burnt and was trying to get out of there. I got him and helped him out of there. And when I got back down there, the fire was just intense.</p><p>But I still tried to get down in there and they come and stopped me, wouldn't let me go down in there. So I got in my car and took off and passed everybody in the dirt and went all the way around to the other end of Quartz Hill and come up at Keswick, and my son was in there.</p><p>He was up there, but I didn't see him. He was up there and then Gary, my son, was on the other side of the house. And Gary opened the door to go run to the house and it burned his hair off. And took his breath.</p><p>So he got back in the car and then he couldn't even hardly see nothing for smoke to get out of there. His house was on fire. He said there was flames probably 70 feet high.</p><p>I talked to junior on the phone till he died. He just kept saying, grandpa, he said, come and get me. The fire's coming in the back door. \"Come on, grandpa.\" I said, I'm right down the road. He said, come get us.</p><p>Emily said, \"I love you, grandpa.\" Her grandma says, \"I love you grandpa.\" And junior says I love you, come and get us, come and get us. I said I'm on my way. I said -- he talked until he died. I tried to call him back, and it just went to nothing. And I said poor thing, poor babies and my wife.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALLEN: Just so, so sad. The poor man.</p><p>HOWELL: Heart goes out to him. Ed Bledsoe he said that no one really talked to them about evacuating. He said that his wife called 911 and they told her someone would come get her.</p><p>Well, firefighters have been fighting uncooperative weather since they've been trying to contain this fire.</p><p>ALLEN: That isn't the only obstacle facing these fire crews. One danger is entirely manmade. Drones.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRETT GOUVEA, CAL FIRE INCIDENT COMMANDER: We have noticed that there are drone footages online of folks flying drones over this fire. That poses a huge safety risk to our folks. If you fly, we cannot.</p><p>We have to ground all of our aircraft if there's reports of drones over the fire.</p><p>[03:20:03] And it's quite a process to get our aircraft back in the area as we try to clear those drones, find out where they're coming from, and chase that down. So we ask that you please remain from flying drones over the fire.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL: Let's bring in BuzzFeed news reporter Brianna Sacks. Brianna following the story live in Redding, California. Thank you so much for taking time with us there. Tell us about the situation, the conditions as they stand now. As people say this is one of the worst fires they've seen before. The temperature there, the conditions on the ground. What are you seeing?</p><p>BRIANNA SACKS, REPORTER, BUZZFEED: Sure. So what's interesting is they keep saying (AUDIO GAP) fire that we've been dealing with over the past almost year that each one is unprecedented in its conditions, its behavior, its pattern.</p><p>So we've been at triple-digit temperatures for the past few days here, and that's supposed to remain until I think tomorrow morning or maybe Tuesday. And we're going to get some -- but the thing is it's hot, it's dry. The winds are erratic. And it's giving firefighters trouble in terms of trying to actually hold the line.</p><p>They're still very much in the saving residents and homes phase. That's why the amount of acreage has jumped up.</p><p>We're almost at - we're at a little above 95,000 now, the latest numbers released at 8 p.m. tonight. But the good news is it did jump to 17 percent containment and it had been hovering at 5 percent for the past few days.</p><p>HOWELL: And every bit of, you know, acreage that they're able to contain, that is good news, and we appreciate you sharing that information with us.</p><p>But I want to press further with the firefighters themselves.</p><p>SACKS: Yes.</p><p>HOWELL: We're seeing an image right now, and now we're seeing the flames they're dealing with. But talk to us about what a day's work must mean for them. Again, you're talking about men and women putting their lives on the line for sure. Dealing with some really long days and nights. SACKS: Yes. I actually just got a story out on this. So these firefighters, many of them have been constantly on these unprecedented blazes for, you know, months on end and they just few is in -- is from incident to incident. They're out on these lines for like sometimes 24, 48 hours at a time. They come back, they get a few hours of shuteye, and then they're back out again.</p><p>And you know, they go for about a week -- like maybe two or three weeks without seeing their kids and they tell me that when they do have a break it's usually about two days, which is really not a lot of time to recharge.</p><p>You know, one firefighter said to me, I was like, how do you deal with, you know, kind of the emotional toll? And he's like, I don't have time to have feelings. Like it gets in the way of when I'm of the job.</p><p>So it's -- they're stretched. Just like the state's resources are. They're putting everything they have into these fires, and they just keep getting more and more destructive and more frightening.</p><p>HOWELL: And now I'd like to talk about the people there. You know, so this area just to the west of the city of Redding, so many roads closed there, so many new communities being threatened. What is the situation with making sure people evacuate in time and also making sure that people get that message clearly and in time to take action?</p><p>SACKS: Yes. So alerting residents has kind of been an ongoing hot topic of conversation with the fires now because you know, they do destroy cell towers and the way that people really get the word out is when police are knocking at their door, like (technical difficulty).</p><p>And I went home with one man today who lost his home. You know, he was saying that they were kind of just waiting around for police officers to come and get them. They were trusting that. But the fire moved so fast that a literal 'firenado' he called it was at his door in a matter of minutes.</p><p>So alerting residents has become a very difficult thing because the fire is moving so fast. What they keep saying is the speed at which the flames move is really, really unprecedented. So it's hard to get the word out.</p><p>So like all these people were, you know, are upset. They're like why didn't they tell us sooner? But they're kind of trying to roll with it as much as the residents are. It's really like -- I haven't really found a good answer for that unless they evacuate large swaths of the population days in advance. And that creates chaos as well. So it's tough.</p><p>[03:24:58] HOWELL: Brianna Sacks, I'm sure you heard that story just a few minutes ago of Ed Bledsoe talking about the fact that you know, his wife called 911 and they told her that someone would get her. So, certainly the evacuation word getting that out very important. Thank you for your time today. We'll keep in touch with you.</p><p>SACKS: No problem.</p><p>ALLEN: Well, the good news is the fire went from 5 percent contained to 17 percent contained, and we'll see if the weather's going to get any better. Pedram Javaheri's here with more about it. Pedram?</p><p>HOWELL: Hi, Pedram.</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Hi, guys. It is going to improve a little bit. We'll see temps cool off a little bit. That certainly is going to help the firefighting efforts. The winds hopefully will die down. Still see some gusty condition across this region. Triple-digit heat still in the forecast at least the next couple of days.</p><p>Unfortunately, no rain to be had to this region. But of you course, you go towards into this area and the explosive growth of the fire is really remarkable. Consuming over 140 square miles of land or about 95 acres of land there. That's equivalent to the size of Manhattan six times over.</p><p>And that happening in a matter of days across this region. We've had very gusty winds that haven't helped the situation. And in fact, take you 22,000 miles above the earth surface, use those satellite to look down towards the San Joaquin valley. From space even you can see this smoke the haze really taking over this region.</p><p>So the air quality concerns have been really poor across this region as well with the containment again, just now bumped up to 17 percent. We're expected to make some ground over this region in the next couple of days.</p><p>Unfortunately, the drought situation hasn't helped. You know, we often say about 90 percent of all wildfires start because of manmade issues, manmade cause, whether to be a vehicle parked on the side of the road, sparks, ignites from the bottom of the vehicle, or cigarette butts are thrown or it's a campfire that's left on.</p><p>That's kind of a scenario that's really impacted much of the western U.S. this year and with this particular fire the Carr Fire happening because of a vehicle that was malfunctioning, parked off the side of the road. The dry grass set ablaze there.</p><p>And of course the landscape it just doesn't help. Because very elevated terrain, hilly terrain across this region, that helps to exacerbate the situation, and we often say these fire speed tends to double with every 10 degree increase in slope.</p><p>So if you've got a 30 degree slope, 24-mile-per-hour winds, take that up to a 40 degree slope you actually double your wind speed and the fire travels in the same general direction as well, upwards of 48 miles per hour.</p><p>So this is what's made this fire so difficult to be able to contain over this region. But hopefully the next few days bring better news, guys.</p><p>ALLEN: Hope so. Pedram, thanks. HOWELL: Thank you, Pedram.</p><p>Well, as the U.S. president starts his Monday, he will have a sympathetic voice next to him. We look ahead at the Italian prime minister and Donald Trump, who may just be kindred spirits.</p><p>ALLEN: Also ahead, Malaysia releases a new report on missing flight MH-370. We'll go live to the region. Stay with us.</p><p>[03:30:00] ALLEN: Welcome back. You're watching \"CNN Newsroom\" live from Atlanta. I'm Natalie Allen.</p><p>HOWELL,: And I'm George Howell with the headlines we're following for you this hour. In the U.S. state of California, firefighters there are making some progress containing a wildfire that has killed at least six people. The Carr Fire, as it's called, it is now 17 percent contained after exploding to 38,000 hectares or 95,000 acres on Sunday. At least seven people we understand are still missing.</p><p>ALLEN: Voters in Zimbabwe are heading to the polls in their first election since former president Robert Mugabe, seen here, was ousted under military threat. Mr. Mugabe ruled the country for 37 years. And now he says he will not vote for his former party. Instead he's suggesting he supports the opposition.</p><p>HOWELL: The publisher of The New York Times says that he urged the U.S. president to ease up on his criticism of the media. The two met earlier this month. The publisher described Mr. Trump's language as divisive and dangerous, though the president continues to attack the media.</p><p>ALLEN: And President Trump also fired off a number of tweets Sunday slamming special counsel Robert Mueller. He claims Mueller has a conflict of interest because they once had a contentious business relationship. He didn't elaborate. And Mr. Trump again railed against the Russia investigation, calling it an illegal scam.</p><p>The president will begin the week meeting with one European leader who shares many of his views.</p><p>HOWELL: That is the prime minister of Italy at the White House later Monday. Delia Gallagher reports the two men agree on immigration restrictions and the desire for closer ties to Russia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DELIA GALLAGHER, CNNVATICAN CORRESPONDENT: President Trump may see some European countries as foes, but in Italy's prime minister Giuseppe Conte, he's got a friend.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The new prime minister of Italy is great. Got to meet him. Very strong on immigration like I am, by the way.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Closing ports and borders to illegal immigrants is one area where Trump and Italy see eye to eye. Italy's interior minister, Matteo Salvini, visited the U.S. president in 2016 on the campaign trail and ripped more than a few pages out of Trump's playbook for his own election campaign, even the winning slogan, \"Italians First.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (UNTRANSLATED).</p><p>GALLAGHER: More than 600,000 refugees, most from North Africa, have landed in Italy in recent years. But in June, more than 600 refugees at sea were turned away from Italy. Salvini was defiant. They will only see Italy on a postcard, he said. They were eventually accepted in Spain. Professor Federigo Argentieri says Italy's government is similar to Trump's in random decision making and an apparent incoherent plan.</p><p>FEDERIGO ARGENTIERI, PROFESSOR, JOHN CABOT UNIVERSITY: Trump has understood or at least he's being told that Italy must be coddled, so to speak, because so far the only -- the only real similarity in Western Europe.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Although Italy has refused Trump's request to give more money to NATO, they're behind the president in his support of Vladimir Putin. Prime Minister Conte tweeted, \"I agree with the president. Russia should be back in the G8.\"</p><p>Matteo Salvini has made no secret of his admiration for Putin, calling him one of the best politicians of our time and publishing a photo on Facebook wearing a Putin t-shirt in Moscow's Red Square. Italy's government coalition received 69 percent of the vote in March elections, but not all Italians agree with their leaders' support of President Trump.</p><p>Sabrina (ph), legal assistant in Rome, says Trump hasn't made the best impression or bella figura, internationally, especially separating immigrant children from their families.</p><p>[03:35:01] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (UNTRANSLATED).</p><p>GALLAGHER: Bella figura or not, in Italy's government leaders, President Trump has got a friend in Europe, something hard to come by these days.</p><p>Delia Gallagher, CNN, Rome.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: For many years now, MH370 families have waited for answers. Many refuse to give up hope of finding their loved ones alive. Others may just want closure.</p><p>ALLEN: Now, the Malaysian government is releasing a new report on the lost flight. It held a news conference to explain its findings. Two hundred thirty-nine people were on board that flight when it took off from Kuala Lumpur in March 2014. It never reached its destination, Beijing. The plane's ultimate fate remains a mystery still today. Let's go to CNN's Will Ripley. He's live from Hong Kong. Hello to you, Will. What we're learning about this report? Is there any significant new information?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Sadly, Natalie, and you know, I remember March 8th, 2014 like it was yesterday. It was my first assignment for CNN, covering the missing plane. And for weeks on end, we stood there at the airport in Kuala Lumpur and then we moved to Australia where they were centering the search operations.</p><p>And there was so much hope in the beginning that they would find the plane, that they would detect some sort of a signal from the plane. They were confident. And here we are now more than four years later and there is this report, 495 pages released with absolutely no clues as to what may have happened. What investigators have been able to rule out is any obvious signs of anxiety or mental issues on the part of the pilot and the first officer.</p><p>They've ruled out any speculation that the pilot's flight simulator at home which showed he had plotted a course, a simulated course towards the Southern Indian Ocean which is where MH370 is believed to have crashed according to the best guess of investigators, looking at radar and satellite imagery and whatnot. They say that's not enough to prove that he intended to fly the plane deliberately.</p><p>But of course his family has had to live for four and a half years with this kind of cloud of suspicion over them. All of the passengers, 227 passengers, 12 crew members, they looked meticulously at the backgrounds of everybody on the plane.</p><p>No indication that anybody would have been capable of pulling off something like this although investigators can't rule out somebody perhaps breaking into the cockpit, switching off the communication systems and turning that plane around right after it checked in at way point IGARI and of course took the plane on that fateful presumed flight to the Southern Indian Ocean.</p><p>There have been three confirmed pieces of debris from MH370, pieces of the wing that washed up along the African east coast. But another 27 pieces of debris have been found that are believed to be highly likely from MH370 as far north as the eastern coast of Tanzania and as far south as the east coast of South Africa.</p><p>And yet you have all these little pieces of debris but they haven't found the plane itself, the main wreckage which of course is the final resting place for those 239 people. So for all of these families who have lived in a state of limbo ever since that day, March 8th, 2014, it seems sadly that that state of not knowing is going to continue for the foreseeable future.</p><p>ALLEN: That has to be really a living hell for these families and certainly we remember you starting to work for CNN at that time and all your reporting. Will Ripley, for us there in Hong Kong. Thank you, Will.</p><p>Well, there's a critical moment for the future of Zimbabwe ahead. It's the country's first election since former president Robert Mugabe was ousted. But he's not going quietly, taking a jab at his former party. We'll have that story for you coming up next here.</p><p>[03:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOWELL: Zimbabwe is holding a historic election.</p><p>ALLEN: It is the first time in 37 years that ousted former president Robert Mugabe is not on the ballot. Mugabe resigned last November under military threat. He's been rarely seen in public until now.</p><p>HOWELL: And in a surprise intervention, Mugabe turned his back on the party he helped to create and instead appeared to support the main opposition. Our Farai Sevenzo has more from Harare.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FARAI SEVENZO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Zimbabwe's capital Harare was gripped by election fever this last weekend. The city became a tale of two political rallies. Campaigning ended Saturday for the first election since Robert Mugabe resigned under the threat of impeachment last November. He had been in power for 37 years.</p><p>Followers of the opposition, MDC Alliance, gathered to hear from their leader, Nelson Chamisa. Around the same time, Zanu-PF supporters of the ruling party once led by Mugabe came to hear from their man, current president, Emmerson Mnangagwa.</p><p>On the eve of the the historic election, with a record 23 presidential candidates, Mugabe suddenly appeared on people's TV screens. He called a press conference not to praise the new dispensation but to put one more knife in his back.</p><p>ROBERT MUGABE, FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF ZIMBABWE: I cannot vote for those who have tormented me. No, I can't. I will make my choice among the other 22.</p><p>SEVENZO: Zanu-PF's candidate immediately released a video addressing the Mugabe intervention.</p><p>EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, PRESIDENT OF ZIMBABWE: Now that it is clear to all that Chamisa has forged a deal with Mugabe, we can no longer believe that his intentions are to transform Zimbabwe.</p><p>SEVENZO: The man at the center of Mugabe's dubious praise drew dramatic crowds to his final rally.</p><p>As you can see, the numbers have been absolutely massive at Nelson Chamisa's rally. Whether these great numbers in a sea of red will translate into a majority of the vote come Monday is anybody's guess.</p><p>I wanted to know from the opposition supporters what they would do if their man lost these elections.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): If Chamisa loses, it means they will have cheated him. We do not want to be continually intimidated. We are tired and we don't want any more.</p><p>SEVENZO: The Zanu-PF faithful were awaiting their leader.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's the old veteran. He's the one who fought for our country.</p><p>SEVENZO: Isn't he too old? After five years, he'll be 80 years old.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's not old. We need his matured brain.</p><p>SEVENZO: CNN caught up with the opposition leader on the last day of campaigning.</p><p>NELSON CHAMISA, ZIMBABWENIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Maturity is not a creature of age. Maturity is a creature of your ideas. Mugabe, you know, was known to be a man who was not willing to open the doors of democracy. But Mnangagwa's west (ph) because he's sophisticated. He was in government for 38 years. You can't tell us that he is now a born again. When was he born again?</p><p>SEVENZO: The task of rebuilding Zimbabwe will be a tough one.</p><p>[03:45:01] The hope is the country will not go up in flames, whoever wins.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: Let's discuss what will be a major test of Zimbabwe's democracy with our Farai Sevenzo, joining us via Skype live from the capital city of Harare. And from your report, it is quite clear, this is an important shift, seeing Mr. Mugabe support the opposition.</p><p>SEVENZO: Well, yes. It can be seen that way, George. But bear in mind, this is a man who's never really seen in public life anymore. In fact, he's become a bit of an irrelevant. But he has the the capacity in Mr. Mnangagwa's new dispensation to simply call a press conference, and of course being who he is, everybody will rush to listen to him.</p><p>Now, those words that came out yesterday are really aimed at the man who took over power from him. He is saying -- excuse me, in no uncertain ways that he does not want to support the people who treated him so badly. Now, whether or not that will make any difference, no one knows what power base he has anymore.</p><p>And it is because of Mr. Mnangagwa's very open kind of freedom of speech, freedom of worship, anyone can say what they want, but he's able to call an impromptu press conference like that. Now, the most important thing about his words, where does it put Mr. Chamisa on voting day? He's being accused now by all the local papers, especially the state papers, of holding hands with Mr. Mugabe.</p><p>Some even go as far as to say in this morning's editorial that his campaign was funded by the Mugabes. Of course, none of this -- this is all fabrication. No one has been able to put any single cent or dollar trail to the doors of the MDC Alliance but it does make a difference to the campaign style. Having said that, this is by far, George, the most peaceful election this country has seen in a long, long time. The crowds we saw, the crowds you just witnessed, were all passing each other without throwing stones at each other or without any sort of malicious intent. So as far as the voting that will happen this day, it remains to be seen whether the people will still feel free to make their choice democratically.</p><p>HOWELL: And let's talk just a bit about that. What this election means, this changing of the guard with Mr. Mugabe not on the ballot this time. It is a striking difference from your reporting, from what we've seen before within that nation. It was a very different situation for people under Mr. Mugabe, as it is now.</p><p>SEVENZO: Well, yes indeed. You remember those chaotic and euphoric scenes back in November. They seem to have ushered in a new era of, as I say, openness and debates. The mud slinging that went on in the last 24 hours with Mr. Mugabe throwing daggers at the back of Mr. Mnangagwa by saying he cannot support a party that treated him so badly, these are the first signs we've seen of such badmouthing and ill intent.</p><p>But it's absolutely true, George, as you say. It is a new era of campaigning as well as of democracy. Let's see what the results bring and who will accept defeat with the most grace.</p><p>HOWELL: Farai Sevenzo live for us in Harare, Zimbabwe. Thank you for your time today.</p><p>ALLEN: And next here, Britain battles fake news. Lawmakers are setting their sights on social media companies to stop the spread of misinformation.</p><p>[03:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ALLEN: Members of the British parliament are warning that fake news is a threat to democracy.</p><p>HOWELL: A committee investigating the issue wants the government to stop using that term altogether, preferring the term \"misinformation\" instead. And it's calling for greater regulation of social media. Our Samuel Burke explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It's a blueprint for regulation sure to reverberate across Silicon Valley. This 89-page report released Sunday by a British parliamentary committee. The report called on companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to face financial and legal liability when they fail to police fake news on their platforms.</p><p>DAMIAN COLLINS, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: We have to create this sense of liability for them to say that if you don't proactively look for and monitor harmful content and I think they classify the real hard fake news, real lies being spread during an election as harmful content, if you don't act to identify that and the sources of it, then you can be liable for the information having been spread. I think if we introduce that liability into law, we'll see them take it more seriously.</p><p>BURKE: The committee recommended new taxes on social media companies and stiff fines when they promote political ads that lack transparency.</p><p>COLLINS: The tech companies are saying themselves they want to give more transparency. What we could do is write it into our laws.</p><p>BURKE: If adopted, the recommendations would radically change the way tech companies are treated in the U.K. Less like passive platforms and more like publishers.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation.</p><p>BURKE: But British lawmakers said they weren't satisfied with efforts by social media companies to regulate themselves.</p><p>COLLINS: What they do is they pre-empt regulation. They don't like being regulated. So if they think the threat of regulation is real, they will try in their own way to solve the problem.</p><p>BURKE: The committee which has been working closely with members of the U.S. Congress also proposed measures to combat election interference. And it slams Facebook in particular for failing to fully investigate how and if Russia uses its platform to influence voters.</p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook said, \"The committee has raised some important issues.

Let's take  a live look and listen to President Trump.  He's speaking at the Susan B.  Anthony List 11th Annual Campaign for Life Gala at the National Building  Museum in Washington, D.C.  Let's go. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I watch him all the time.  I  don't know him well, but I'll get to know him.  John Rutherford, where is  he, John?  Central casting.  Great job, John.  He's always defending me.   Actually, most of you are always defending me and that's OK.  And from my  neck of the woods, Claudia Kenny.  Thank you, Claudia.  Thank you.  And for  those many that I have left out, I'm sorry.  But I say, give me a totally  complete list and I will call you tomorrow and I will apologize personally.   All right.  But every day between now and November, we must work together  to elect more lawmakers who share our values, cherish our heritage, and  proudly stand for life.  And that is a great group of people I introduced.   I can tell you that.  We're also glad to be joined by a beloved member of  my administration, a true fighter for faith and family, and your 2018  distinguished leader, Kellyanne Conway.  Kellyanne.  What a job --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Sorry.  The president of course speaking introduction  luminaries there at the gala and we will dip back in if there is some  breaking news or he stumbles upon something that you need to hear about it  because you got it right here, baby.  There have been some major twists in  President Trump's scheduled meeting with Kim Jong-un.  The president saying  he no longer likes the North Korean dictator's attitude and casting doubt  that the meeting will happen at all.  Watch this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If it doesn't happen, maybe it will happen later.  Maybe it will  happen at a different time.  But we will see.  But we are talking.  The  meeting is scheduled as you know on June 12th in Singapore.  And whether or  not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon, but we're talking right now. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Talking may not be good enough.  We're being told Kim Jong-un  may have second thoughts about giving up all of his nuclear weapons.  The  president today said the dictator would be making a huge mistake by walking  away from this all-important table.  And just yesterday, Vice President  Pence told our own Martha MacCallum that if he keeps his nukes, the  situation could end really, really badly.  Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It would be a great  mistake for Kim Jong-un to think he could play Donald Trump.  The truth is  that President Trump has made it clear that this administration will not  tolerate the regime in North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and ballistic  missiles that threaten our people, that threaten the United States of  America , that threaten our allies in the region. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The vice president went on to say that North Korea will end up  like Libya if it doesn't make a deal.  And we all remember how that ended.   The country was destroyed.  Muammar Gaddafi was murdered in the street by  rebels.  Wow.  So will Kim Jong-un play ball or is the meeting and the  possible Nobel Prize out the window?  With me now Fox Business Reporter  Edward Lawrence with all the details.  Edward. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kennedy, this  is the first time that we're hearing the president actually say that the  meeting may not go forward on June 12th.  However, the State Department is  saying that they are working towards that date and only that date. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  I do have a real sense that  he would -- he would find American investment, American technology,  American know how of real value to his people.  If we get this right and we  get the denuclearization right, America wouldn't be quite capable of  delivering them with lots of things that would make life better for the  North Korean people. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  And President Trump saying that he personally guarantees the  safety of Kim Jong-un at the meeting in Singapore.  He president going on  to say that he recognizes that fact that Kim Jong-un would be the person to  lead his people into the future.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I would say that we are looking certainly right now at two Koreas,  two very successful Koreas.  You're going to have a very, very successful  North Korea and you're going to have a very successful and you already do,  South Korea. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now, all of this is predicated on denuclearization.  And right  now, there's a group of journalists from the United States, from China,  Russia, and the United Kingdom that are expected to witness the North  Koreans actually taking down, demolishing one of their nuclear sites.  Now,  whether in the area has delayed that trip.  It is expected to happen again  today or tomorrow their time, Kennedy. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, same thing.  Edward, thank you so much.  All right.  So  Kim -- can Kim Jong-un be trusted to keep his word?  And is China throwing  a monkey wrench into the work?  That question answers itself.  It certainly  is fuzz bud.  Just let me bring in former CIA operative Mike Baker, also  the President of Diligence LLC.  Welcome back to the show, Mike. </p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC:  Thank you very much, Kennedy.  Thank  you.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely.  The president says that Kim Jong-un's attitude  needs an adjustment since his most of recent chat with President Xi  Jinping.  What do you think about China's meddling in a situation they're  not necessarily a part of? </p><p>BAKER:  Well, in that you just -- that last part of your sentence is  important to note.  What China wants to insure is that they're relevant in  these conversations.  And they made that fairly clear over the past couple  of months.  But, look, nobody is surprised by sort of the posturing that's  taking place on both sides leading into this.  This is an historic  potentially defining moment.  Even if the summit occurs and nothing happens  after that and we can't get through the lengthy negotiations to get some  type of deal signed, just getting to this point almost being at the table  is an historic moment given how many years we've spent kicking the can down  the road with a fairly feckless foreign policy towards North Korea.  So I  think that the administration has been pretty clear in stating that they  understand this could be problematic and saying they're going to walk away  from the table.  It is interesting to note that aside from the fact you  can't swing a dead cat without hitting a North Korea expert these days.   It's also interesting to know that you got members of the resistance and  some members of the media who seemed almost hoping for this thing to fall  apart.  And if you find yourself rooting against peace on the peninsula  because you don't like President Trump, then you might want to rethink your  priorities. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I absolutely agree with you about that.  And I think there is  a time and a place for resistance.  I think there are certainly instances  where you have to hold the president accountable for the things the he says  and does.  But here I think, you know, this is an area where we have to be  as supportive as possible because a peaceful ending to this situation is  critical.  It's paramount.  Now, what's interesting and something that you  have pointed out is obviously there are issues with the Iran deal.  And you  have noted that part of the issue is because President Obama was so  impatient, and he was so dead set on landing that deal that he really  compromise our position there.  So would you caution this president against  doing the same thing with North Korea? </p><p>BAKER:  Right.  And, again, they've been very been clear in saying over the  past many weeks that they'd be willing to get up from the table and walk  away.  But what they have to be careful about is as you get closer and  closer to that potential meeting on the 12th of June, you have to be  careful that you feel so invested in this now, and you -- you're so keen to  get this going.  But you have to step back, take a breath, and understand  that, as you said, the previous administration, the Obama administration,  you know, they had their knickers in such a twist over the desire to get a  deal, any deal, that they were willing to overlook the problems with the  deal and they were willing to accept all the requests and concessions and  demands that the Iranian regime put into that deal.  And so, you know, and  again, with anything that takes place in this world of weapons agreements  whether you're talking about conventional weapons, nuclear weapons,  biological or chemical weapons really at the end of the day what matters  more than anything else is verification. </p><p>Trust but verify.  If you can't verify and the Iranian example is a good  one because it was in the deal.  We were not allowed to inspect military  sites.  So, yes, were they complying as people who were supporting that the  deal say?  Well, they were complying with it.  Yes, we got -- they were  complying with what was written in the deal.  But we had no verification  capability for any of their military sites.  And frankly, that's like  saying you're a serial killer.  You allow the police to come into your home  and search it, but you can't go in the basement and look around.  So we get  to be really careful and if we do get to that hard difficult point where  we're actually trying to pen a deal.  If we can't get verification locked  down with this, we didn't have it with the Syrian chemical issue.  We  didn't have it in the past on occasion with the Russians --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  -- trust Russia because they said they got rid of all Syria's  chemical weapons.  And he also said that we're fine in Iran because he read  the deal, and it's super solid, and they have no desire to manufacture any  fissile material or use those in drills to make big --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BAKER:  That was their investment.  They were so -- they were so keen as  you pointed out.  So keen to get that deal, so we have to be careful.  The  Trump administration has to be able to say, no, we're not going to sit down  if what appears to be as the North Koreas are making demands and  concessions that we can't accept, don't even sit at the table, and much  less walk away.  Just don't sit down at that point.  Everybody understands  this is an incredibly complex issue between us, North Korea, South Korea,  China, Japan, you know, but this is -- again, it's worth pursuing and as  you pointed out, everybody regardless of your political position should be  willing to root for peace on the peninsula or an effort to get there. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Pretend the U.S. is actually in the World Cup, it's like that.   Everyone wants team USA to win.  Mike Baker, thank you so much. </p><p>BAKER:  What -- the World Cup is what?  That's soccer? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  All right.  That's enough.  All right.  Dear, come on.  Let it  go.  Come on, man.  It's a beautiful game and you're a lovely person, so  thanks again.  Today, former President Jimmy -- oh, Jimmy Carter said he  thinks the president would deserve the Nobel Prize if he manages -- that's  a big if.  He's really qualifying this.  To get the North Koreans to give  up their nukes, but is the President Trump really thinking about canceling  the meeting or is possible that he's just being a showman and amping up the  drama?  Let me go to my military grade party pane tonight, she's an editor  at Townhall.com and a Fox News Contributor, Katie Pavlich is here.

Our resident  actual North Korea expert. </p><p>MICHAEL MALICE, HOST, YOUR WELCOME SHOW:  I'm no Mike Baker. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Come on, man --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MALICE:  -- with a dead cat apparently. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I don't think he was talking about you. </p><p>MALICE:  That's true. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to read you Jimmy Carter's quote because I think -- I  want to -- I want to get your feeling on this.  He's talking about if  they're under constant belief that the United States wants to attack them  meaning North Korea even using nuclear weapons and that we are destroying  their economy and they know that they're starving to death primarily  because the United States withholds food aid for instance, just giving them  surplus food that we can never use.  I can understand how they feel. </p><p>MALICE:  Well, let me give you a little bit of background about Jimmy  Carter and North Korea.  He went there in 1994 and tried to broker a deal  with the great leader Kim Il-sung.  And five years ago today I posted a  quote from North Korean propaganda about their meeting and this is what  they said Jimmy Carter said, \"President Kim Il-sung is a person in whom  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, those popular  three presidents of the United States early in its history are put  together.\"  So that actually did not happen.  But the point is, North Korea  withheld food from getting to its citizenry in the '90s because Kim Jong-il  specifically said, if we allow the U.N. to feed the population, the  government will be superfluous.  So that's absolutely not true that they  would be willing to accept food. </p><p>And if they did accept food, they would claim it's coming from the leader,  so it's false in that regard.  It's absolutely true that they think we're  going to invade at any minute because you see people all over the news  right now blatantly saying John Bolton had a -- entry in the Wall Street  Journal that even South Korea is against it.  We have the unilateral right  to strike if they develop nuclear capabilities.  And when President Bush  said the axis of evil is Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.  This is clearly a  kill list of the three countries he wants to take out.  So they are right  to be afraid.  And again, if most people in this country don't trust  themselves to disarm and give up their guns and trust the federal  government, why would the North Korean government thinking differently? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And they have gotten so many resources over the years that  they could have used to feed their people.  I mean you don't build a multi- billion dollar nuclear weapons program unless you have money. </p><p>MALICE:  And lastly, the have something called Sung Bun and the used food  is a mechanism to control, so that the more loyal you are to the  government, the more likely you are to receive food. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And we're going to talk about that same thing happening in  Venezuela.  But I want to get back here because we've heard a lot about the  Libyan model and it was something that John Bolton said in regards to  denuclearizing North Korea, you know, which is essentially can be by force  with a very sad ending for the leader of either Libya or North Korea.  It  wasn't just something that John Bolton said offhandedly months ago in an  interview.  This is now something that Vice President Pence has legitimized  by using the same term.  So do you think that we are on a march to war if  in fact the meeting doesn't take place? </p><p>STEPHEN KENT, HOST, BELTWAY BANTHAS PODCAST:  I don't think we're on a  march to war.  But I'm stunned that Mike Pence then echo that comment from  John Bolton because that seemed incredibly ill-advice.  They need to keep  that comment and John Bolton off television for the next three weeks if  they're going to make this meeting happen.  He instills this sense of  distrust with the North Korean regime.  And Michael is absolutely right  when he mentioned, you know, like trying to step away from their guns being  their WMD's.  Like -- they're like the cultists in Waco, like you cannot  threaten them in this way.  Their weapons are the only thing that make them  feel secure, so this march towards total denuclearization or else is not  going to work in this case.  We need to be a little bit more gentle here. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  You know, I was talking to Gordon Chang a few weeks ago and he  said they still have a conventional military which is actually a bigger  practical threat to the region and it's much easier for them to go ahead  and bomb South Korea.  They don't -- they don't have to use nukes in order  to inflict a lot of damage.  So even if you take their nuclear program  away, they still have the ability to defend themselves. </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  That's always been the  concern that they'll use artillery power against Seoul, South Korea which  is right there across the border. This conversation you just had goes back  to why this has never worked out and why very administration has had a  failure when it comes to reining in North Korea's program.  They are so far  apart and although in the last couple of months we've seen things come  together on the surface.  When it comes to principles what the North  Koreans are willing to do which is not giving up their nuclear arms, the  negotiation now is about what denuclearization actually means and what the  United States requires which is complete denuclearization of the peninsula.   And the of course, there's China which is playing a role and saying, we  can't ask North Korea to completely give up their nukes.  However, we think  that they should be limited in their capacity.  And by the way, we don't  want any of the fallout when it comes to the regime -- </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  No.  China wants control and they want North Korea to be  dependent and they also want to have as much influence as possible on the  Korean Peninsula.  My question is, does South Korea -- with South Korea and  we're running out of time, so this has to beautiful quick answer.  Would  South Korea rather work with the United States in resolving this situation? </p><p>PAVLICH:  I think ultimately, yes.  I mean the United States is an ally.   We're doing military excises.  The United States has repeatedly said we are  not taking military -- legal military exercises off the table in exchange  for denuclearization of North Korea.  But again, the gap here is very wide  and it feels like we're back to the beginning of why this hasn't work out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's where we five seconds. </p><p>PAVLICH:  Katie gets it perfectly. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Oh, very good, Michael Malice for taking the baton and looking  very classily.  The panel return a little bit later because how could they  not.  Plus, the plot thickens in the White House.  Republican lawmakers now  calling for a second special counsel to investigate the possibility the  feds had politically motivated spies in the Trump campaign.  And now the  president has weighed in.  I'll tell you what  he said.  Chris Stirewalt  joins me next for reaction. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  We got news alert now.  We just learned that the business  partner of President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen has  agreed to cooperate with the government as part of a plea deal.  Evgeny  Friedman, I know I'm not saying that right.  Is the note -- no.  Michael  Malice is shaking his head seriously.  He's got a whiplash.  He's a Russian  immigrant known as the taxi king.  Legal expert say this puts greater  pressure on Cohen to cooperate with the Mueller probe, but the president  says the real issue with the alleged spying on his campaign during the  election.  Watch. </p><p>TRUMP:  A lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign.  If they  had spies in my campaign, that would be a disgrace to this country.  That  would be one of the biggest insults that anyone has ever seen and it would  be very illegal aside from everything else.  It would make probably every  political event ever look like small potatoes. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Small potatoes?  Delicious though.  Michael Cohen cooperating  with the government would certainly be no picnic for the president.  But is  he right to say the election spying is the biggest concern here.  Joining  me now Fox News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt back in action.  Welcome  back. </p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Indeed.  All right.  So let's talk about this.  Spies in my  campaign, is that the biggest issue of all if that is in fact true? </p><p>STIREWALT:  The biggest issue in political history the president says --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Maybe ever. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Maybe ever which they're saying something.  I mean the fall of  Roman stuff was a pretty big deal.  Look, the president says that there  were spies, and this is a good narrative for him.  This helps him with his  base to talk about him as the real victim and the deep state, and it was  really Obama and Clinton, and he's the victim here.  He's not the  perpetuator.  But instead, he's the victim.  And it -- and especially  during a midterm where he desperately wants not to lose the house because  that would create a whole new set of pressures on him in terms of  investigations and conceivably impeachment that he wants to keep  Republicans with him and a good way to do that is to say that he's not the  offender here, that the system -- that he is the victim of the system. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I truly believe that he believes he is not the offender.  He  believes he has done nothing wrong.  And he's just, you know, as a  negotiator does, if something doesn't succeed the first time you go about  it from different angles.  But is there something to this story?  Is it  possible that there were politically motivated operatives who were reaching  out to people of on the Trump campaign getting information to give back to  the FBI? </p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, if they can put cheese in the can and have it spray out  on a cracker that was anything --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  What a great invention. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Anything is possible.  But I don't know.  I mean I cover  politics.  But I do know this that there is an inspector general's report  that is in process about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's  mishandling of state secrets.  We're waiting for that in just the next  coming days.  And then hot on the heels of that one from the inspector  general from the Department of Justice, Mr. Horowitz, is a report on the --  an investigation of the investigation into the Russian meddling and Trump's  campaign, and that rashmitas.  So I'm going to wait and find out, just like  I'm going to wait and find out what Mueller actually has as opposed to all  of these chatter dancing that people are doing around this stuff.  I don't  know.  So I'm just going to wait until I find that. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I mean if there was a coordinated effort between James Clapper  and John Brennan and James Comey, you know, if that's not a politicized  trifecta, I don't know from my politicized trifecta, and I have a menagerie  of them in a green room.</p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, look, if that was so and they conspired together against  Donald Trump, well, that would be very bad.  But we don't know that.  We  don't have that evidence just like we don't have evidence that the  president colluded with Russia.  We just have -- the best I can do at this  point especially since we now have hopes that much of this will be  concluded by the end of the summer.  All I can do as a political forecaster  is say, we'll have enough information to know how this is going to affect  the midterms, how are Republicans going to respond to this.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And I think the deployment of these types of informant is not  only possible.  I think it is plausible given the amount of -- the  capability of these various organizations whether it's the NSA, or CIA, or  FBI, or DEA spy on Americans.  They have the tools.  It would not surprise  me if there are people who would abuse that power for their own benefit.   And I hope that's not the case.  I hope we live in a country where that  kind of power is checked.  So far Congress keeps codifying it and that is  also terrifying.  Chris Stirewalt, thank you so much. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Bottom line and every day of the week young man.  Very good. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Quite so. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes.  Coming up, Venezuela, the hell hole where a month's  salary can't even buy a cup of coffee.  People are so hungry they resorted  to eating zoo animals.  They just re-elected their president with nearly 70  percent of the vote.  Do you smell something fishy like a rotting zebra  carcass?  More examples of socialism destroying society in the monologue  next.  Stay here. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Crappy socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro was elected to  another six-year term in Venezuela.  Yes.  And the equally corrupted  authoritarian Turkish president campaigned for him, so they could share in  the farcical fun.  Leaders like Maduro, Erdogan, and Putin hate freedom  because it gives filthy peasants too much they empower over their own  lives.  They liquidate government holdings to enrich themselves in their  select cronies, and they steal from poor people who live horrible short  lives before they die in squalor.  It is no surprise these liberty loathers  create an access of a-holes.  They need to sow discord in the world's most  powerful economy because a truly free market disrupts their tyrannical  buggery -- signaling widespread discontent.  President Trump has signed an  executive order that bans U.S. citizens from snapping up Venezuelan  bargains from the state fire sale.  When people try to profit off this  desperation, they are further imprisoning the poorest among them who cannot  leave the country.  There has been a mass exodus of doctors, nurses,  teachers, engineers, and anyone else who has the means to escape the  tightening news of cruel socialism.  Anyone who can get out has fled, while  those trapped there are enduring inflation that's already at nearly 14,000  percent.  Plus, soaring malnutrition infant and maternal mortality rates  that are also going up and are being undertreated at vacant hospitals.  All  fraudulent elections should be condemned, including those in Turkey and  Russia.  And we need to be doubly mindful not to indulge amateur socialist  in this country.  Because even though a Bernie Sanders presidency is a  joke, the consequences of diet communism are deadly serious.  And that's  the memo.  </p><p>Oh, hi, great to see me.  That was swift.  How long Nicolas Maduro possibly  hang on to power as people are starving, his economy is ruined, the murder  rate is one of the highest in the world, and all indicators suggest things  are only going to get worse.  So, what can we do to fix this failed  socialist experiment before it turns into another Somalia?  The party panel  is back: Katie Pavlich, Stephen Kent, and Michael Malice.  Katie, I don't  think this is the worst-case-scenario.  I don't think this is a black swan  country undergoing some bad luck.  I think this is the natural ultimate end  of socialism and communism.  What do you think?</p><p>PAVLICH:  People argue, you know, this isn't real socialism or this isn't  real communism.  No, this is what it is.  In 1999, Venezuela decide to go  from more of a free market system to a socialist country to spend more  money on welfare.  This is exactly what we've seen as a result of that.   Now, Maduro is out there this week, on video in this bizarre way -- waving  to crowds that don't exist who applaud him on his re-election by 70  percent.  The United States has condemned the election results.  And the  question is, where do we go from here?  Not only in Venezuela but as the  United States because there are American interests there and there are  foreign policy implications of the regime collapsing.  The Venezuelans are  fleeing in large numbers.  As you mentioned in your monologue that most of  important people in the country who are, you know, doctors, nurses are  leaving.  But regular people are getting out because they are so desperate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Giving on buses in getting out of the country.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Liberals, socialist Utopia that is now existing in Venezuela as a  result of these principles, not a mistake.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Malice?</p><p>MALICE:  What I would like to see happen because there's only so much we  can do in Venezuela.  Every politician who was a segregationist racist had  to disavow, have to turn their backs, and had to be publicly humiliated,  had to be (INAUDIBLE) for decades.  So why are Michael Moore, and Bernie  Sanders, and Jeremy Corbin in the U.K., all of the people who said  Venezuela is a great thing, a great experiment, why do they not run on the  public square and thrown tomatoes at where they go?  You have children  bleeding to death on hospital beds, you have people starving.  Again, they  shoot into crowds when people try to protest.  To have anyone who's in  politics for this, not take responsibility for it, and still begin a  microphone, I think, is disgraceful.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And it's only getting worse,  and worse, and worse.  It's actually getting exponentially worse as  inflation rises, and the poorest people, they are the ones who can't afford  to feed their kids.  They never had to treat malnutrition five years ago.   And now that condition has gone up 100 folds in hospitals that we have no  doctors.  So, what do we do?  Do we do anything as the United States?  </p><p>KENT:  Well, there's again, limited tools in our tool kit to deal with this  situation.  We're not going to invade Venezuela.  We shouldn't.  And  sanctions are something that we have to be delicate with as well, because  we want to target the elite in that country who are abusing and starving  their people without then, actually, hurting the people who live in that  country and are not able to leave.  We are mentioning that doctors and  everyone who are able to flee.  You know, the oil industry runs basically  the only leftover economy that's there, but it only benefits the wealthy.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's absolutely right.  And that's what they did.  I  mean, it is a state-run industry.  They've got so much oil, which was  great, and they were profitable when oil prices were high.  But when they  tanked -- </p><p>MALICE:  This is atlas shrugged comes to life.  This is exactly the  (INAUDIBLE).  Take out excessive business having the government running,  and then how long it takes for people to be --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And you know, when atlas shrugged, that's when the people are  holding up the economy, they leave.  They're exhausted.</p><p>MALICE:  And if the poor and the weak were the first to suffer.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's absolutely right and suffer the longest.  Well, back  here at home, I mean, we're really suffering, right?  Because House Speaker  Paul Ryan is facing renewed pressure to step down from his perch before his  term ends.  The administration maybe nudging the effort along.  White House  Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, reportedly said he has spoken with House  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about ousting Ryan, adding: \"Wouldn't it be  great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut  up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election.  That's a  really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do  it.\"  Now, Mulvaney says he's supportive of the speaker.  And McCarthy said  he's never even talked to Mulvaney about it.  So, should House Republicans  plan a mutiny, Katie?  </p><p>MALICE:  We always hear word of a mutiny whenever there's any kind of  speakers raised.  Jim Jordan, other than the hundred conservatives that  came out and sign the letters saying they want him to run for speaker.   Paul Ryan will likely out his term as speaker of the house.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He's not going to get pushed out of the way?</p><p>PAVLICH:  You know, I don't know.  I mean, the thing is, as they say in  Washington, D.C.: if you want a friend, get a dog.  And although, Kevin  McCarthy and Paul Ryan have been very close for the last couple of years,  not only just in leadership as Paul Ryan came out through the ranks in the  House, from the Ways and Means Committee.  I doubt that McCarthy is going  to actually push Paul Ryan out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  They want Jim to working at job.</p><p>KENT:  No, money talks.  Paul Ryan brought in 11.9 million in the first  quarter of the Republican.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's why Nancy Pelosi is still around.  </p><p>KENT:  So, yes, put up or shut up.  Everybody else who wants that job.   They're not going to move him out as long as they need to raise money for  these mid-term elections which are going to be contentious.  I also would  like to see Paul Ryan finish out this job because we need, we need him to  finish and have a legitimate open-run election.  Kevin McCarthy cannot be  nominated for this.  Nobody really wants him in the Republican --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Is there a benefit to chaos?  </p><p>MALICE:  Look at the last Republican speaker.  You have ambassador of the  Vatican's wife, you have this lobster who's selling marijuana.  Dennis  Hastert, we can't even discuss on air.  And now, we have the guy who Mitt  Romney made his beta.  So, this is quite a cast of characters.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He is his Robin.</p><p>MALICE:  Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, he really is.  I love Paul Rhino.  I love the term Paul  Rhino.  I think Paul Ryan has completely turned his back on his principles.  </p><p>MALICE:  But in 2012, Romney needed to play the base, and he chose Ryan.   And that's how far the Republican Party has gone to the right, but even  Ryan is regardless of the left --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, Ryan and a slap on the base.  You know, I want to thank  you all for being here, because you are good friends, you are allies of  freedom, and you are delightful people.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Thank you for having us.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Freedoms and my feels.  Michael, Stephen, and Katie Pavlich,  thank you all.  Coming up, Cops say Amazon's new facial recognition  technology is helping them identify suspects in crime.  But the privacy  police are sounding alarm bells.  Emily Compagno joins me with the details.   Hi, Emily!  She's coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The future is now.  And I don't know if I like it.  Amazon has  some fancy new facial recognition technology and they're selling it to  police departments for $6.00 a month.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well,  a lot.  Which is why the ACLU is asking the tech giant to stop marketing  the tool to law enforcement agencies -- fearing it could be used to invade  your privacy.  Amazon respond to the ACLU's request with a statement that  read in quote: \"Amazon requires the customers comply with the law and be  responsible when they use Amazon Web Service (AWS).  When we find that AWS  services are being abused by a customer, we suspend that customer's right  to use our services.\"  Now, I would never add the cape for government  regulation to fix a problem like this, but should we be concerned about our  civil liberties and privacy when a tech giant like amazon combines with  government?  Let me ask former Criminal Defense Attorney and Legal Analyst,  Emily Compagno, she is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.  Emily,  welcome back to the show.  </p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND LEGAL ANALYST:  So, let's  discuss this.  What is the down side to selling facial recognition  technology on the cheap to law enforcement?  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  ACLU and others are arguing, look, there's a high  capacity for abuse here.  So, they argue this isn't akin to just an  extension of photography.  They say, this is akin to walking through mass  protests and asking for identification for every single person there.  They  argue this can be used to follow immigrants by ICE, this can be used to  identify any random person on a street corner.  So, they kind of have the  same arguments that they have for all existing surveillance programs, which  is where is the limit, right?  And they argue that, although it's not  different from other facial recognition program.  Here, they site that what  is problematic is Amazon's aggressive marketing to law enforcement agencies  and the fact that the reach is so prolific.  So, that's what they're  arguing here.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And that's one of things that has always concerned me, whether  it's Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other social media platform.  You  know, these big tech companies getting in bed with the government, whether  it's military or law enforcement, the consequences can be dire.  They're  not always dire.  We want our law enforcement agencies to have tools and  have technology so they can keep us safe.  The problem is when these things  malfunction.  My iPhone X recognizes my face about half the time, and it's  not because I'm a supermodel but a lot of people say that.  It's because  this technology isn't perfect.  And you know, I don't trust that the facial  recognition software wouldn't recognize the wrong person.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  Which is part of the argument and, you know, on the  other side, law enforcement agencies are arguing: look, you know, we're not  there yet.  It's important to us that the community understands what it's  being used for just as crucially as what it's not.  And they site the fact  that, you know, this has been used for surveillance footage matching from  burglaries, from what's picked up from CCTV.  They argue this has been used  to find abducted children or missing children in amusement parks.  It was  even used actually this weekend at the royal wedding of now duke and  duchess of Sussex for what royals had attended, right?  Sky News used.  So,  it's important that they feel the community that they --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to know the difference between David Beckham and Serena  Williams.  Because there were some people on other networks who didn't  really know the difference.  And that's a wonderful private application of  that tool essentially for entertainment.  I don't want to be arrested for a  crime that Kate Upton has committed because we look so similar.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes, and I do want to point out, though, that there's a bit of  hyperbole I see here in terms of the narrative that these free speech firms  and companies are pushing forward.  And here's one in particular, they cite  that this can now be used at airports which is a public place, they argue.   We're now in this climate of protesting and robust participation.  They  claim that there could be a chilling factor, but I want to point out that  airports for example are not public places for purposes of free speech.   It's been long held at the first, second, and fourth amendment are actually  restricted there.  So, in terms of the conversation surrounding this, to me  it's important that the narrative isn't subjects to that kind of hyperbolic  quality, because to me, it just increases the chasm between law enforcement  and what they're trying to do, and then lawful protected right to privacy  that we have without kind of muddying the water.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely, understand.  And I think there is so much more to  discuss and address here.  I really appreciate your perspective.  Thank you  so much, Emily.  Great to talk to you again. </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  \"TOPICAL STORM\" is next.  It's a good one.  Stay here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The NYPD is looking for a group of gunmen who robbed a  Walgreen's pharmacy while wearing clown masks.  Witnesses say, there could  be as many as 15 of them.  They were last seen fleeing one tiny car.  Be on  the lookout for a many, because this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\" </p><p>Topic number one.  We begin tonight in Houston, Texas, where everybody  knows that if you're going to drive on the highway, you're going to need  plenty of horse power.  Look at this.  Oh, mercy!  The Belmont state aren't  for another three weeks but this fellow is already getting in a good  workout.  In any other state, the sight of horse on a highway might have  caused a 12-car pile-up.  But in (INAUDIBLE) they're like, it's probably  going out for more beer.  Anything a couple of cars high beams so, they  could pass.  Now, fortunately some good Samaritans were able to steer it  off the road, and police have since returned though, of course, to its  owner but not before issuing a ticket for using the carpooling without a  passenger.  Rules are rules, pal.  Get a (INAUDIBLE) next time.</p><p>Topic number two.  There it is.  A Florida City issued a zombie alert to  its citizens.  And we'd like to think it was an accident, but you never  know in Florida.  A storm caused a blackout on Sunday that led the  residents of Lake Worth, Florida, to get an alert that read: Zombie --  power outage and zombie alert for the residents of Lake Worth and Terminus.   There are now far less than 7300 customers involved due to extreme zombie  activity.  Now, Terminus is a fictitious town from the hit T.V. show \"The  Walking Dead\".  Its inclusion in the message led cops to believe it was a  prank.  Great police, fellows.  Well done.  It's unlikely someone confused  the state of Florida and \"The Walking Dead\" because the two couldn't be  more different.  One is an apocalyptic wasteland of human oddities, and the  other is a T.V. show.  That's right.  </p><p>Topic number three.  If you're a cop in the city of Cleveland, long enough  you'll see everything -- except for a Browns Super Bowl championship.  But  these cops, they don't need a championship to party.  The officers  responded to this block party to cut the noise, but they wound up cutting a  rug because not even a horse can resist it.  It's so addictive.  We have a  staffer named Courtney who does it all the time in the office.  She's very  special.  The video of the dancing cops has taken off across the country,  and so has their other police horse.  There I go again on my own.  Turns  out he'll be shuffling papers behind his desk because he's been suspended  for not tying up his horse.  </p><p>Topic number four.  There it is.  Thanks to Bunk Breaker for this one.   Women's soccer legend, Brandy Chastain, was inducted into the Bay Area hall  of fame this week.  But the person who may brand these flack, must drink a  few brandies before going into the studio.  The women's soccer legend  became famous for whipping off her jersey after hitting the winning penalty  kick in the 1999 World Cup.  She was an international (INAUDIBLE), but  apparently, she's now a trucker named Gill, who likes beef jerky and lot  lizard.  The Internet says she looks like Gary Busey, so either way slice  it, she's looks like someone who is little nuts.  She looks like she's a  transitioning Elizabeth Warren without glasses.  You can't make this up,  unlike Elizabeth's heritage.  The hall of fame has since apologized and  offered to make a new plaque.  And perhaps, not surprisingly Brandi, has  graciously accepted their offer.  We reached out to the plaque maker for  comment but he was at the vet with his seeing eye dog.  </p><p>Topic number five.  Perhaps no athlete is more disappointed than Tonya  Harding who did not win the top prize in last night's \"Dancing with the  Stars\" finale.  Someday, historians will remember this as the end of the  #kneetoo movement.  Figure skater Adam Rippon took home the win, and Lord  knows he'll need the prize money, because competing against Tonya Harding  can cost you an arm and a leg.  If you don't believe me, ask Nancy  Kerrigan.  NFL Star, Josh Norman, with the other runner-up in the first  all-athlete season.  It was also the first season of all famous people.   Usually, that show is a who's who of people that make you say, who?  Her  T.V. comeback may be over, but don't feel bad for Tonya because she just  joined a new dance troupe who are very familiar with her work.  Is he going  to get the police?  (INAUDIBLE) felony.  If only she had this much rhythm  in last night's finale.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Thank you so much for watching this show tonight.

Let's take a live look and listen to <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>He's speaking at the Susan B. Anthony List 11th Annual Campaign for Life Gala at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. Let's go.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I watch him all the time. I don't know him well, but I'll get to know him. <person><nameText>John Rutherford, </nameText></person>where is he, John? Central casting. Great job, John. He's always defending me. Actually, most of you are always defending me and that's OK. And from my neck of the woods, Claudia Kenny. Thank you, Claudia. Thank you. And for those many that I have left out, I'm sorry. But I say, give me a totally complete list and I will call you tomorrow and I will apologize personally. All right. But every day between now and November, we must work together to elect more lawmakers who share our values, cherish our heritage, and proudly stand for life. And that is a great group of people I introduced. I can tell you that. We're also glad to be joined by a beloved member of my administration, a true fighter for faith and family, and your 2018 distinguished leader, <person><nameText>Kellyanne Conway. </nameText></person>Kellyanne. What a job --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Sorry. The president of course speaking introduction luminaries there at the gala and we will dip back in if there is some breaking news or he stumbles upon something that you need to hear about it because you got it right here, baby. There have been some major twists in <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>scheduled meeting with <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un. </nameText></person>The president saying he no longer likes the North Korean dictator's attitude and casting doubt that the meeting will happen at all. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: If it doesn't happen, maybe it will happen later. Maybe it will happen at a different time. But we will see. But we are talking. The meeting is scheduled as you know on June 12th in Singapore. And whether or not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon, but we're talking right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Talking may not be good enough. We're being told <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>may have second thoughts about giving up all of his nuclear weapons. The president today said the dictator would be making a huge mistake by walking away from this all-important table. And just yesterday, <person><nameText>Vice President Pence </nameText></person>told our own Martha MacCallum that if he keeps his nukes, the situation could end really, really badly. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MIKE PENCE, </nameText></person>VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It would be a great mistake for <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>to think he could play <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>The truth is that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has made it clear that this administration will not tolerate the regime in North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles that threaten our people, that threaten the United States of America , that threaten our allies in the region.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: The vice president went on to say that North Korea will end up like Libya if it doesn't make a deal. And we all remember how that ended. The country was destroyed. Muammar Gaddafi was murdered in the street by rebels. Wow. So will <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>play ball or is the meeting and the possible Nobel Prize out the window? With me now Fox Business Reporter Edward Lawrence with all the details. Edward.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kennedy, this is the first time that we're hearing the president actually say that the meeting may not go forward on June 12th. However, the State Department is saying that they are working towards that date and only that date.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: I do have a real sense that he would -- he would find American investment, American technology, American know how of real value to his people. If we get this right and we get the denuclearization right, America wouldn't be quite capable of delivering them with lots of things that would make life better for the North Korean people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: And <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>saying that he personally guarantees the safety of <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>at the meeting in Singapore. He president going on to say that he recognizes that fact that <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>would be the person to lead his people into the future.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I would say that we are looking certainly right now at two Koreas, two very successful Koreas. You're going to have a very, very successful North Korea and you're going to have a very successful and you already do, South Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: Now, all of this is predicated on denuclearization. And right now, there's a group of journalists from the United States, from China, Russia, and the United Kingdom that are expected to witness the North Koreans actually taking down, demolishing one of their nuclear sites. Now, whether in the area has delayed that trip. It is expected to happen again today or tomorrow their time, Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes, same thing. Edward, thank you so much. All right. So Kim -- can <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>be trusted to keep his word? And is China throwing a monkey wrench into the work? That question answers itself. It certainly is fuzz bud. Just let me bring in former <person><nameText>CIA </nameText></person>operative Mike Baker, also the President of Diligence LLC. Welcome back to the show, Mike.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC: Thank you very much, Kennedy. Thank you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Absolutely. The president says that <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un's </nameText></person>attitude needs an adjustment since his most of recent chat with President <person><nameText>Xi Jinping. </nameText></person>What do you think about China's meddling in a situation they're not necessarily a part of?</p><p>BAKER: Well, in that you just -- that last part of your sentence is important to note. What China wants to insure is that they're relevant in these conversations. And they made that fairly clear over the past couple of months. But, look, nobody is surprised by sort of the posturing that's taking place on both sides leading into this. This is an historic potentially defining moment. Even if the summit occurs and nothing happens after that and we can't get through the lengthy negotiations to get some type of deal signed, just getting to this point almost being at the table is an historic moment given how many years we've spent kicking the can down the road with a fairly feckless foreign policy towards North Korea. So I think that the administration has been pretty clear in stating that they understand this could be problematic and saying they're going to walk away from the table. It is interesting to note that aside from the fact you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a North Korea expert these days. It's also interesting to know that you got members of the resistance and some members of the media who seemed almost hoping for this thing to fall apart. And if you find yourself rooting against peace on the peninsula because you don't like <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>then you might want to rethink your priorities.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I absolutely agree with you about that. And I think there is a time and a place for resistance. I think there are certainly instances where you have to hold the president accountable for the things the he says and does. But here I think, you know, this is an area where we have to be as supportive as possible because a peaceful ending to this situation is critical. It's paramount. Now, what's interesting and something that you have pointed out is obviously there are issues with the Iran deal. And you have noted that part of the issue is because President Obama was so impatient, and he was so dead set on landing that deal that he really compromise our position there. So would you caution this president against doing the same thing with North Korea?</p><p>BAKER: Right. And, again, they've been very been clear in saying over the past many weeks that they'd be willing to get up from the table and walk away. But what they have to be careful about is as you get closer and closer to that potential meeting on the 12th of June, you have to be careful that you feel so invested in this now, and you -- you're so keen to get this going. But you have to step back, take a breath, and understand that, as you said, the previous administration, the Obama administration, you know, they had their knickers in such a twist over the desire to get a deal, any deal, that they were willing to overlook the problems with the deal and they were willing to accept all the requests and concessions and demands that the Iranian regime put into that deal. And so, you know, and again, with anything that takes place in this world of weapons agreements whether you're talking about conventional weapons, nuclear weapons, biological or chemical weapons really at the end of the day what matters more than anything else is verification.</p><p>Trust but verify. If you can't verify and the Iranian example is a good one because it was in the deal. We were not allowed to inspect military sites. So, yes, were they complying as people who were supporting that the deal say? Well, they were complying with it. Yes, we got -- they were complying with what was written in the deal. But we had no verification capability for any of their military sites. And frankly, that's like saying you're a serial killer. You allow the police to come into your home and search it, but you can't go in the basement and look around. So we get to be really careful and if we do get to that hard difficult point where we're actually trying to pen a deal. If we can't get verification locked down with this, we didn't have it with the Syrian chemical issue. We didn't have it in the past on occasion with the Russians --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: -- trust Russia because they said they got rid of all Syria's chemical weapons. And he also said that we're fine in Iran because he read the deal, and it's super solid, and they have no desire to manufacture any fissile material or use those in drills to make big --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BAKER: That was their investment. They were so -- they were so keen as you pointed out. So keen to get that deal, so we have to be careful. The Trump administration has to be able to say, no, we're not going to sit down if what appears to be as the North Koreas are making demands and concessions that we can't accept, don't even sit at the table, and much less walk away. Just don't sit down at that point. Everybody understands this is an incredibly complex issue between us, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, you know, but this is -- again, it's worth pursuing and as you pointed out, everybody regardless of your political position should be willing to root for peace on the peninsula or an effort to get there.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Pretend the U.S. is actually in the World Cup, it's like that. Everyone wants team USA to win. Mike Baker, thank you so much.</p><p>BAKER: What -- the World Cup is what? That's soccer?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: All right. That's enough. All right. Dear, come on. Let it go. Come on, man. It's a beautiful game and you're a lovely person, so thanks again. Today, former President Jimmy -- oh, <person><nameText>Jimmy Carter </nameText></person>said he thinks the president would deserve the Nobel Prize if he manages -- that's a big if. He's really qualifying this. To get the North Koreans to give up their nukes, but is the <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>really thinking about canceling the meeting or is possible that he's just being a showman and amping up the drama? Let me go to my military grade party pane tonight, she's an editor at Townhall.com and a Fox News Contributor, Katie Pavlich is here. He is a spokesperson at Young Voices and host of the podcast Beltway Banthas, it's Stephen Kent, and he is the host of \"YOUR WELCOME\", that's a podcast and author of the book, Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of <person><nameText>Kim Jong-il, </nameText></person>he's got a license too, Michael Malice is back. Our resident actual North Korea expert.</p><p>MICHAEL MALICE, HOST, YOUR WELCOME SHOW: I'm no Mike Baker.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Come on, man --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALICE: -- with a dead cat apparently.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I don't think he was talking about you.</p><p>MALICE: That's true.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I want to read you <person><nameText>Jimmy Carter's </nameText></person>quote because I think -- I want to -- I want to get your feeling on this. He's talking about if they're under constant belief that the United States wants to attack them meaning North Korea even using nuclear weapons and that we are destroying their economy and they know that they're starving to death primarily because the United States withholds food aid for instance, just giving them surplus food that we can never use. I can understand how they feel.</p><p>MALICE: Well, let me give you a little bit of background about <person><nameText>Jimmy Carter </nameText></person>and North Korea. He went there in 1994 and tried to broker a deal with the great leader Kim Il-sung. And five years ago today I posted a quote from North Korean propaganda about their meeting and this is what they said <person><nameText>Jimmy Carter </nameText></person>said, \"President Kim Il-sung is a person in whom George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, those popular three presidents of the United States early in its history are put together.\" So that actually did not happen. But the point is, North Korea withheld food from getting to its citizenry in the '90s because <person><nameText>Kim Jong-il </nameText></person>specifically said, if we allow the U.N. to feed the population, the government will be superfluous. So that's absolutely not true that they would be willing to accept food.</p><p>And if they did accept food, they would claim it's coming from the leader, so it's false in that regard. It's absolutely true that they think we're going to invade at any minute because you see people all over the news right now blatantly saying John Bolton had a -- entry in the Wall Street Journal that even South Korea is against it. We have the unilateral right to strike if they develop nuclear capabilities. And when President Bush said the axis of evil is Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. This is clearly a kill list of the three countries he wants to take out. So they are right to be afraid. And again, if most people in this country don't trust themselves to disarm and give up their guns and trust the federal government, why would the North Korean government thinking differently?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And they have gotten so many resources over the years that they could have used to feed their people. I mean you don't build a multi- billion dollar nuclear weapons program unless you have money.</p><p>MALICE: And lastly, the have something called Sung Bun and the used food is a mechanism to control, so that the more loyal you are to the government, the more likely you are to receive food.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And we're going to talk about that same thing happening in Venezuela. But I want to get back here because we've heard a lot about the Libyan model and it was something that John Bolton said in regards to denuclearizing North Korea, you know, which is essentially can be by force with a very sad ending for the leader of either Libya or North Korea. It wasn't just something that John Bolton said offhandedly months ago in an interview. This is now something that <person><nameText>Vice President Pence </nameText></person>has legitimized by using the same term. So do you think that we are on a march to war if in fact the meeting doesn't take place?</p><p>STEPHEN KENT, HOST, BELTWAY BANTHAS PODCAST: I don't think we're on a march to war. But I'm stunned that <person><nameText>Mike Pence </nameText></person>then echo that comment from John Bolton because that seemed incredibly ill-advice. They need to keep that comment and John Bolton off television for the next three weeks if they're going to make this meeting happen. He instills this sense of distrust with the North Korean regime. And Michael is absolutely right when he mentioned, you know, like trying to step away from their guns being their WMD's. Like -- they're like the cultists in Waco, like you cannot threaten them in this way. Their weapons are the only thing that make them feel secure, so this march towards total denuclearization or else is not going to work in this case. We need to be a little bit more gentle here.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: You know, I was talking to Gordon Chang a few weeks ago and he said they still have a conventional military which is actually a bigger practical threat to the region and it's much easier for them to go ahead and bomb South Korea. They don't -- they don't have to use nukes in order to inflict a lot of damage. So even if you take their nuclear program away, they still have the ability to defend themselves.</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Right. That's always been the concern that they'll use artillery power against Seoul, South Korea which is right there across the border. This conversation you just had goes back to why this has never worked out and why very administration has had a failure when it comes to reining in North Korea's program. They are so far apart and although in the last couple of months we've seen things come together on the surface. When it comes to principles what the North Koreans are willing to do which is not giving up their nuclear arms, the negotiation now is about what denuclearization actually means and what the United States requires which is complete denuclearization of the peninsula. And the of course, there's China which is playing a role and saying, we can't ask North Korea to completely give up their nukes. However, we think that they should be limited in their capacity. And by the way, we don't want any of the fallout when it comes to the regime --</p><p>MONTGOMERY: No. China wants control and they want North Korea to be dependent and they also want to have as much influence as possible on the Korean Peninsula. My question is, does South Korea -- with South Korea and we're running out of time, so this has to beautiful quick answer. Would South Korea rather work with the United States in resolving this situation?</p><p>PAVLICH: I think ultimately, yes. I mean the United States is an ally. We're doing military excises. The United States has repeatedly said we are not taking military -- legal military exercises off the table in exchange for denuclearization of North Korea. But again, the gap here is very wide and it feels like we're back to the beginning of why this hasn't work out.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: That's where we five seconds.</p><p>PAVLICH: Katie gets it perfectly.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, very good, Michael Malice for taking the baton and looking very classily. The panel return a little bit later because how could they not. Plus, the plot thickens in the White House. Republican lawmakers now calling for a second special counsel to investigate the possibility the feds had politically motivated spies in the Trump campaign. And now the president has weighed in. I'll tell you what he said. Chris Stirewalt joins me next for reaction.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: We got news alert now. We just learned that the business partner of <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>former personal attorney Michael Cohen has agreed to cooperate with the government as part of a plea deal. Evgeny Friedman, I know I'm not saying that right. Is the note -- no. Michael Malice is shaking his head seriously. He's got a whiplash. He's a Russian immigrant known as the taxi king. Legal expert say this puts greater pressure on Cohen to cooperate with the Mueller probe, but the president says the real issue with the alleged spying on his campaign during the election. Watch.</p><p>TRUMP: A lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign. If they had spies in my campaign, that would be a disgrace to this country. That would be one of the biggest insults that anyone has ever seen and it would be very illegal aside from everything else. It would make probably every political event ever look like small potatoes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Small potatoes? Delicious though. Michael Cohen cooperating with the government would certainly be no picnic for the president. But is he right to say the election spying is the biggest concern here. Joining me now Fox News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt back in action. Welcome back.</p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR: Ma'am.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Indeed. All right. So let's talk about this. Spies in my campaign, is that the biggest issue of all if that is in fact true?</p><p>STIREWALT: The biggest issue in political history the president says --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Maybe ever.</p><p>STIREWALT: Maybe ever which they're saying something. I mean the fall of Roman stuff was a pretty big deal. Look, the president says that there were spies, and this is a good narrative for him. This helps him with his base to talk about him as the real victim and the deep state, and it was really Obama and Clinton, and he's the victim here. He's not the perpetuator. But instead, he's the victim. And it -- and especially during a midterm where he desperately wants not to lose the house because that would create a whole new set of pressures on him in terms of investigations and conceivably impeachment that he wants to keep Republicans with him and a good way to do that is to say that he's not the offender here, that the system -- that he is the victim of the system.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I truly believe that he believes he is not the offender. He believes he has done nothing wrong. And he's just, you know, as a negotiator does, if something doesn't succeed the first time you go about it from different angles. But is there something to this story? Is it possible that there were politically motivated operatives who were reaching out to people of on the Trump campaign getting information to give back to the FBI?</p><p>STIREWALT: Well, if they can put cheese in the can and have it spray out on a cracker that was anything --</p><p>MONTGOMERY: What a great invention.</p><p>STIREWALT: Anything is possible. But I don't know. I mean I cover politics. But I do know this that there is an inspector general's report that is in process about the investigation into <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>mishandling of state secrets. We're waiting for that in just the next coming days. And then hot on the heels of that one from the inspector general from the Department of Justice, Mr. Horowitz, is a report on the -- an investigation of the investigation into the Russian meddling and Trump's campaign, and that rashmitas. So I'm going to wait and find out, just like I'm going to wait and find out what Mueller actually has as opposed to all of these chatter dancing that people are doing around this stuff. I don't know. So I'm just going to wait until I find that.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I mean if there was a coordinated effort between James Clapper and <person><nameText>John Brennan </nameText></person>and James Comey, you know, if that's not a politicized trifecta, I don't know from my politicized trifecta, and I have a menagerie of them in a green room.</p><p>STIREWALT: Well, look, if that was so and they conspired together against <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>well, that would be very bad. But we don't know that. We don't have that evidence just like we don't have evidence that the president colluded with Russia. We just have -- the best I can do at this point especially since we now have hopes that much of this will be concluded by the end of the summer. All I can do as a political forecaster is say, we'll have enough information to know how this is going to affect the midterms, how are Republicans going to respond to this.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And I think the deployment of these types of informant is not only possible. I think it is plausible given the amount of -- the capability of these various organizations whether it's the NSA, or <person><nameText>CIA, </nameText></person>or FBI, or DEA spy on Americans. They have the tools. It would not surprise me if there are people who would abuse that power for their own benefit. And I hope that's not the case. I hope we live in a country where that kind of power is checked. So far Congress keeps codifying it and that is also terrifying. Chris Stirewalt, thank you so much.</p><p>STIREWALT: Ma'am.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Bottom line and every day of the week young man. Very good.</p><p>STIREWALT: Quite so.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes. Coming up, Venezuela, the hell hole where a month's salary can't even buy a cup of coffee. People are so hungry they resorted to eating zoo animals. They just re-elected their president with nearly 70 percent of the vote. Do you smell something fishy like a rotting zebra carcass? More examples of socialism destroying society in the monologue next. Stay here.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Crappy socialist dictator <person><nameText>Nicolas Maduro </nameText></person>was elected to another six-year term in Venezuela. Yes. And the equally corrupted authoritarian Turkish president campaigned for him, so they could share in the farcical fun. Leaders like Maduro, Erdogan, and Putin hate freedom because it gives filthy peasants too much they empower over their own lives. They liquidate government holdings to enrich themselves in their select cronies, and they steal from poor people who live horrible short lives before they die in squalor. It is no surprise these liberty loathers create an access of a-holes. They need to sow discord in the world's most powerful economy because a truly free market disrupts their tyrannical buggery -- signaling widespread discontent. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has signed an executive order that bans U.S. citizens from snapping up Venezuelan bargains from the state fire sale. When people try to profit off this desperation, they are further imprisoning the poorest among them who cannot leave the country. There has been a mass exodus of doctors, nurses, teachers, engineers, and anyone else who has the means to escape the tightening news of cruel socialism. Anyone who can get out has fled, while those trapped there are enduring inflation that's already at nearly 14,000 percent. Plus, soaring malnutrition infant and maternal mortality rates that are also going up and are being undertreated at vacant hospitals. All fraudulent elections should be condemned, including those in Turkey and Russia. And we need to be doubly mindful not to indulge amateur socialist in this country. Because even though a Bernie Sanders presidency is a joke, the consequences of diet communism are deadly serious. And that's the memo.</p><p>Oh, hi, great to see me. That was swift. How long <person><nameText>Nicolas Maduro </nameText></person>possibly hang on to power as people are starving, his economy is ruined, the murder rate is one of the highest in the world, and all indicators suggest things are only going to get worse. So, what can we do to fix this failed socialist experiment before it turns into another Somalia? The party panel is back: Katie Pavlich, Stephen Kent, and Michael Malice. Katie, I don't think this is the worst-case-scenario. I don't think this is a black swan country undergoing some bad luck. I think this is the natural ultimate end of socialism and communism. What do you think?</p><p>PAVLICH: People argue, you know, this isn't real socialism or this isn't real communism. No, this is what it is. In 1999, Venezuela decide to go from more of a free market system to a socialist country to spend more money on welfare. This is exactly what we've seen as a result of that. Now, Maduro is out there this week, on video in this bizarre way -- waving to crowds that don't exist who applaud him on his re-election by 70 percent. The United States has condemned the election results. And the question is, where do we go from here? Not only in Venezuela but as the United States because there are American interests there and there are foreign policy implications of the regime collapsing. The Venezuelans are fleeing in large numbers. As you mentioned in your monologue that most of important people in the country who are, you know, doctors, nurses are leaving. But regular people are getting out because they are so desperate.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Giving on buses in getting out of the country.</p><p>PAVLICH: Liberals, socialist Utopia that is now existing in Venezuela as a result of these principles, not a mistake.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Malice?</p><p>MALICE: What I would like to see happen because there's only so much we can do in Venezuela. Every politician who was a segregationist racist had to disavow, have to turn their backs, and had to be publicly humiliated, had to be (INAUDIBLE) for decades. So why are Michael Moore, and Bernie Sanders, and Jeremy Corbin in the U.K., all of the people who said Venezuela is a great thing, a great experiment, why do they not run on the public square and thrown tomatoes at where they go? You have children bleeding to death on hospital beds, you have people starving. Again, they shoot into crowds when people try to protest. To have anyone who's in politics for this, not take responsibility for it, and still begin a microphone, I think, is disgraceful.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes, you're absolutely right. And it's only getting worse, and worse, and worse. It's actually getting exponentially worse as inflation rises, and the poorest people, they are the ones who can't afford to feed their kids. They never had to treat malnutrition five years ago. And now that condition has gone up 100 folds in hospitals that we have no doctors. So, what do we do? Do we do anything as the United States?</p><p>KENT: Well, there's again, limited tools in our tool kit to deal with this situation. We're not going to invade Venezuela. We shouldn't. And sanctions are something that we have to be delicate with as well, because we want to target the elite in that country who are abusing and starving their people without then, actually, hurting the people who live in that country and are not able to leave. We are mentioning that doctors and everyone who are able to flee. You know, the oil industry runs basically the only leftover economy that's there, but it only benefits the wealthy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes, that's absolutely right. And that's what they did. I mean, it is a state-run industry. They've got so much oil, which was great, and they were profitable when oil prices were high. But when they tanked --</p><p>MALICE: This is atlas shrugged comes to life. This is exactly the (INAUDIBLE). Take out excessive business having the government running, and then how long it takes for people to be --</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And you know, when atlas shrugged, that's when the people are holding up the economy, they leave. They're exhausted.</p><p>MALICE: And if the poor and the weak were the first to suffer.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: That's absolutely right and suffer the longest. Well, back here at home, I mean, we're really suffering, right? Because House <person><nameText>Speaker Paul Ryan </nameText></person>is facing renewed pressure to step down from his perch before his term ends. The administration maybe nudging the effort along. White House Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, reportedly said he has spoken with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about ousting Ryan, adding: \"Wouldn't it be great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election. That's a really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do it.\" Now, Mulvaney says he's supportive of the speaker. And McCarthy said he's never even talked to Mulvaney about it. So, should House Republicans plan a mutiny, Katie?</p><p>MALICE: We always hear word of a mutiny whenever there's any kind of speakers raised. Jim Jordan, other than the hundred conservatives that came out and sign the letters saying they want him to run for <person><nameText>speaker. Paul Ryan </nameText></person>will likely out his term as speaker of the house.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: He's not going to get pushed out of the way?</p><p>PAVLICH: You know, I don't know. I mean, the thing is, as they say in Washington, D.C.: if you want a friend, get a dog. And although, Kevin McCarthy and <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>have been very close for the last couple of years, not only just in leadership as <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>came out through the ranks in the House, from the Ways and Means Committee. I doubt that McCarthy is going to actually push <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>out.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: They want Jim to working at job.</p><p>KENT: No, money talks. <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>brought in 11.9 million in the first quarter of the Republican.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes, that's why Nancy Pelosi is still around.</p><p>KENT: So, yes, put up or shut up. Everybody else who wants that job. They're not going to move him out as long as they need to raise money for these mid-term elections which are going to be contentious. I also would like to see <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>finish out this job because we need, we need him to finish and have a legitimate open-run election. Kevin McCarthy cannot be nominated for this. Nobody really wants him in the Republican --</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Is there a benefit to chaos?</p><p>MALICE: Look at the last Republican speaker. You have ambassador of the Vatican's wife, you have this lobster who's selling marijuana. Dennis Hastert, we can't even discuss on air. And now, we have the guy who Mitt Romney made his beta. So, this is quite a cast of characters.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: He is his Robin.</p><p>MALICE: Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes, he really is. I love Paul Rhino. I love the term Paul Rhino. I think <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>has completely turned his back on his principles.</p><p>MALICE: But in 2012, Romney needed to play the base, and he chose Ryan. And that's how far the Republican Party has gone to the right, but even Ryan is regardless of the left --</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes, Ryan and a slap on the base. You know, I want to thank you all for being here, because you are good friends, you are allies of freedom, and you are delightful people.</p><p>PAVLICH: Thank you for having us.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Freedoms and my feels. Michael, Stephen, and Katie Pavlich, thank you all. Coming up, Cops say Amazon's new facial recognition technology is helping them identify suspects in crime. But the privacy police are sounding alarm bells. Emily Compagno joins me with the details. Hi, Emily! She's coming up.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: The future is now. And I don't know if I like it. Amazon has some fancy new facial recognition technology and they're selling it to police departments for $6.00 a month. What could possibly go wrong? Well, a lot. Which is why the ACLU is asking the tech giant to stop marketing the tool to law enforcement agencies -- fearing it could be used to invade your privacy. Amazon respond to the ACLU's request with a statement that read in quote: \"Amazon requires the customers comply with the law and be responsible when they use Amazon Web Service (AWS). When we find that AWS services are being abused by a customer, we suspend that customer's right to use our services.\" Now, I would never add the cape for government regulation to fix a problem like this, but should we be concerned about our civil liberties and privacy when a tech giant like amazon combines with government? Let me ask former Criminal Defense Attorney and Legal Analyst, Emily Compagno, she is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. Emily, welcome back to the show.</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND LEGAL ANALYST: So, let's discuss this. What is the down side to selling facial recognition technology on the cheap to law enforcement?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Right. ACLU and others are arguing, look, there's a high capacity for abuse here. So, they argue this isn't akin to just an extension of photography. They say, this is akin to walking through mass protests and asking for identification for every single person there. They argue this can be used to follow immigrants by ICE, this can be used to identify any random person on a street corner. So, they kind of have the same arguments that they have for all existing surveillance programs, which is where is the limit, right? And they argue that, although it's not different from other facial recognition program. Here, they site that what is problematic is Amazon's aggressive marketing to law enforcement agencies and the fact that the reach is so prolific. So, that's what they're arguing here.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: And that's one of things that has always concerned me, whether it's Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other social media platform. You know, these big tech companies getting in bed with the government, whether it's military or law enforcement, the consequences can be dire. They're not always dire. We want our law enforcement agencies to have tools and have technology so they can keep us safe. The problem is when these things malfunction. My iPhone X recognizes my face about half the time, and it's not because I'm a supermodel but a lot of people say that. It's because this technology isn't perfect. And you know, I don't trust that the facial recognition software wouldn't recognize the wrong person.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Right. Which is part of the argument and, you know, on the other side, law enforcement agencies are arguing: look, you know, we're not there yet. It's important to us that the community understands what it's being used for just as crucially as what it's not. And they site the fact that, you know, this has been used for surveillance footage matching from burglaries, from what's picked up from CCTV. They argue this has been used to find abducted children or missing children in amusement parks. It was even used actually this weekend at the royal wedding of now duke and duchess of Sussex for what royals had attended, right? Sky News used. So, it's important that they feel the community that they --</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I want to know the difference between David Beckham and Serena Williams. Because there were some people on other networks who didn't really know the difference. And that's a wonderful private application of that tool essentially for entertainment. I don't want to be arrested for a crime that Kate Upton has committed because we look so similar.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, and I do want to point out, though, that there's a bit of hyperbole I see here in terms of the narrative that these free speech firms and companies are pushing forward. And here's one in particular, they cite that this can now be used at airports which is a public place, they argue. We're now in this climate of protesting and robust participation. They claim that there could be a chilling factor, but I want to point out that airports for example are not public places for purposes of free speech. It's been long held at the first, second, and fourth amendment are actually restricted there. So, in terms of the conversation surrounding this, to me it's important that the narrative isn't subjects to that kind of hyperbolic quality, because to me, it just increases the chasm between law enforcement and what they're trying to do, and then lawful protected right to privacy that we have without kind of muddying the water.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Absolutely, understand. And I think there is so much more to discuss and address here. I really appreciate your perspective. Thank you so much, Emily. Great to talk to you again.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Thank you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: \"TOPICAL STORM\" is next. It's a good one. Stay here.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: The NYPD is looking for a group of gunmen who robbed a Walgreen's pharmacy while wearing clown masks. Witnesses say, there could be as many as 15 of them. They were last seen fleeing one tiny car. Be on the lookout for a many, because this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\"</p><p>Topic number one. We begin tonight in Houston, Texas, where everybody knows that if you're going to drive on the highway, you're going to need plenty of horse power. Look at this. Oh, mercy! The Belmont state aren't for another three weeks but this fellow is already getting in a good workout. In any other state, the sight of horse on a highway might have caused a 12-car pile-up. But in (INAUDIBLE) they're like, it's probably going out for more beer. Anything a couple of cars high beams so, they could pass. Now, fortunately some good Samaritans were able to steer it off the road, and police have since returned though, of course, to its owner but not before issuing a ticket for using the carpooling without a passenger. Rules are rules, pal. Get a (INAUDIBLE) next time.</p><p>Topic number two. There it is. A Florida City issued a zombie alert to its citizens. And we'd like to think it was an accident, but you never know in Florida. A storm caused a blackout on Sunday that led the residents of Lake Worth, Florida, to get an alert that read: Zombie -- power outage and zombie alert for the residents of Lake Worth and Terminus. There are now far less than 7300 customers involved due to extreme zombie activity. Now, Terminus is a fictitious town from the hit T.V. show \"The Walking Dead\". Its inclusion in the message led cops to believe it was a prank. Great police, fellows. Well done. It's unlikely someone confused the state of Florida and \"The Walking Dead\" because the two couldn't be more different. One is an apocalyptic wasteland of human oddities, and the other is a T.V. show. That's right.</p><p>Topic number three. If you're a cop in the city of Cleveland, long enough you'll see everything -- except for a Browns Super Bowl championship. But these cops, they don't need a championship to party. The officers responded to this block party to cut the noise, but they wound up cutting a rug because not even a horse can resist it. It's so addictive. We have a staffer named Courtney who does it all the time in the office. She's very special. The video of the dancing cops has taken off across the country, and so has their other police horse. There I go again on my own. Turns out he'll be shuffling papers behind his desk because he's been suspended for not tying up his horse.</p><p>Topic number four. There it is. Thanks to Bunk Breaker for this one. Women's soccer legend, Brandy Chastain, was inducted into the Bay Area hall of fame this week. But the person who may brand these flack, must drink a few brandies before going into the studio. The women's soccer legend became famous for whipping off her jersey after hitting the winning penalty kick in the 1999 World Cup. She was an international (INAUDIBLE), but apparently, she's now a trucker named Gill, who likes beef jerky and lot lizard. The Internet says she looks like Gary Busey, so either way slice it, she's looks like someone who is little nuts. She looks like she's a transitioning Elizabeth Warren without glasses. You can't make this up, unlike Elizabeth's heritage. The hall of fame has since apologized and offered to make a new plaque. And perhaps, not surprisingly Brandi, has graciously accepted their offer. We reached out to the plaque maker for comment but he was at the vet with his seeing eye dog.</p><p>Topic number five. Perhaps no athlete is more disappointed than Tonya Harding who did not win the top prize in last night's \"Dancing with the Stars\" finale. Someday, historians will remember this as the end of the #kneetoo movement. Figure skater Adam Rippon took home the win, and Lord knows he'll need the prize money, because competing against Tonya Harding can cost you an arm and a leg. If you don't believe me, ask Nancy Kerrigan. NFL Star, Josh Norman, with the other runner-up in the first all-athlete season. It was also the first season of all famous people. Usually, that show is a who's who of people that make you say, who? Her T.V. comeback may be over, but don't feel bad for Tonya because she just joined a new dance troupe who are very familiar with her work. Is he going to get the police? (INAUDIBLE) felony. If only she had this much rhythm in last night's finale. We'll be right back.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Thank you so much for watching this show tonight. I am your tender flower.

Let's take  a live look and listen to President Trump.  He's speaking at the Susan B.  Anthony List 11th Annual Campaign for Life Gala at the National Building  Museum in Washington, D.C.  Let's go. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I watch him all the time.  I  don't know him well, but I'll get to know him.  John Rutherford, where is  he, John?  Central casting.  Great job, John.  He's always defending me.   Actually, most of you are always defending me and that's OK.  And from my  neck of the woods, Claudia Kenny.  Thank you, Claudia.  Thank you.  And for  those many that I have left out, I'm sorry.  But I say, give me a totally  complete list and I will call you tomorrow and I will apologize personally.   All right.  But every day between now and November, we must work together  to elect more lawmakers who share our values, cherish our heritage, and  proudly stand for life.  And that is a great group of people I introduced.   I can tell you that.  We're also glad to be joined by a beloved member of  my administration, a true fighter for faith and family, and your 2018  distinguished leader, Kellyanne Conway.  Kellyanne.  What a job --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Sorry.  The president of course speaking introduction  luminaries there at the gala and we will dip back in if there is some  breaking news or he stumbles upon something that you need to hear about it  because you got it right here, baby.  There have been some major twists in  President Trump's scheduled meeting with Kim Jong-un.  The president saying  he no longer likes the North Korean dictator's attitude and casting doubt  that the meeting will happen at all.  Watch this. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  If it doesn't happen, maybe it will happen later.  Maybe it will  happen at a different time.  But we will see.  But we are talking.  The  meeting is scheduled as you know on June 12th in Singapore.  And whether or  not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon, but we're talking right now. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Talking may not be good enough.  We're being told Kim Jong-un  may have second thoughts about giving up all of his nuclear weapons.  The  president today said the dictator would be making a huge mistake by walking  away from this all-important table.  And just yesterday, Vice President  Pence told our own Martha MacCallum that if he keeps his nukes, the  situation could end really, really badly.  Watch. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It would be a great  mistake for Kim Jong-un to think he could play Donald Trump.  The truth is  that President Trump has made it clear that this administration will not  tolerate the regime in North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and ballistic  missiles that threaten our people, that threaten the United States of  America , that threaten our allies in the region. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  The vice president went on to say that North Korea will end up  like Libya if it doesn't make a deal.  And we all remember how that ended.   The country was destroyed.  Muammar Gaddafi was murdered in the street by  rebels.  Wow.  So will Kim Jong-un play ball or is the meeting and the  possible Nobel Prize out the window?  With me now Fox Business Reporter  Edward Lawrence with all the details.  Edward. </p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kennedy, this  is the first time that we're hearing the president actually say that the  meeting may not go forward on June 12th.  However, the State Department is  saying that they are working towards that date and only that date. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  I do have a real sense that  he would -- he would find American investment, American technology,  American know how of real value to his people.  If we get this right and we  get the denuclearization right, America wouldn't be quite capable of  delivering them with lots of things that would make life better for the  North Korean people. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LAWRENCE:  And President Trump saying that he personally guarantees the  safety of Kim Jong-un at the meeting in Singapore.  He president going on  to say that he recognizes that fact that Kim Jong-un would be the person to  lead his people into the future.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  I would say that we are looking certainly right now at two Koreas,  two very successful Koreas.  You're going to have a very, very successful  North Korea and you're going to have a very successful and you already do,  South Korea. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now, all of this is predicated on denuclearization.  And right  now, there's a group of journalists from the United States, from China,  Russia, and the United Kingdom that are expected to witness the North  Koreans actually taking down, demolishing one of their nuclear sites.  Now,  whether in the area has delayed that trip.  It is expected to happen again  today or tomorrow their time, Kennedy. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes, same thing.  Edward, thank you so much.  All right.  So  Kim -- can Kim Jong-un be trusted to keep his word?  And is China throwing  a monkey wrench into the work?  That question answers itself.  It certainly  is fuzz bud.  Just let me bring in former CIA operative Mike Baker, also  the President of Diligence LLC.  Welcome back to the show, Mike. </p><p> MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC:  Thank you very much, Kennedy.  Thank  you.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely.  The president says that Kim Jong-un's attitude  needs an adjustment since his most of recent chat with President Xi  Jinping.  What do you think about China's meddling in a situation they're  not necessarily a part of? </p><p> BAKER:  Well, in that you just -- that last part of your sentence is  important to note.  What China wants to insure is that they're relevant in  these conversations.  And they made that fairly clear over the past couple  of months.  But, look, nobody is surprised by sort of the posturing that's  taking place on both sides leading into this.  This is an historic  potentially defining moment.  Even if the summit occurs and nothing happens  after that and we can't get through the lengthy negotiations to get some  type of deal signed, just getting to this point almost being at the table  is an historic moment given how many years we've spent kicking the can down  the road with a fairly feckless foreign policy towards North Korea.  So I  think that the administration has been pretty clear in stating that they  understand this could be problematic and saying they're going to walk away  from the table.  It is interesting to note that aside from the fact you  can't swing a dead cat without hitting a North Korea expert these days.   It's also interesting to know that you got members of the resistance and  some members of the media who seemed almost hoping for this thing to fall  apart.  And if you find yourself rooting against peace on the peninsula  because you don't like President Trump, then you might want to rethink your  priorities. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  I absolutely agree with you about that.  And I think there is  a time and a place for resistance.  I think there are certainly instances  where you have to hold the president accountable for the things the he says  and does.  But here I think, you know, this is an area where we have to be  as supportive as possible because a peaceful ending to this situation is  critical.  It's paramount.  Now, what's interesting and something that you  have pointed out is obviously there are issues with the Iran deal.  And you  have noted that part of the issue is because President Obama was so  impatient, and he was so dead set on landing that deal that he really  compromise our position there.  So would you caution this president against  doing the same thing with North Korea? </p><p> BAKER:  Right.  And, again, they've been very been clear in saying over the  past many weeks that they'd be willing to get up from the table and walk  away.  But what they have to be careful about is as you get closer and  closer to that potential meeting on the 12th of June, you have to be  careful that you feel so invested in this now, and you -- you're so keen to  get this going.  But you have to step back, take a breath, and understand  that, as you said, the previous administration, the Obama administration,  you know, they had their knickers in such a twist over the desire to get a  deal, any deal, that they were willing to overlook the problems with the  deal and they were willing to accept all the requests and concessions and  demands that the Iranian regime put into that deal.  And so, you know, and  again, with anything that takes place in this world of weapons agreements  whether you're talking about conventional weapons, nuclear weapons,  biological or chemical weapons really at the end of the day what matters  more than anything else is verification. </p><p> Trust but verify.  If you can't verify and the Iranian example is a good  one because it was in the deal.  We were not allowed to inspect military  sites.  So, yes, were they complying as people who were supporting that the  deal say?  Well, they were complying with it.  Yes, we got -- they were  complying with what was written in the deal.  But we had no verification  capability for any of their military sites.  And frankly, that's like  saying you're a serial killer.  You allow the police to come into your home  and search it, but you can't go in the basement and look around.  So we get  to be really careful and if we do get to that hard difficult point where  we're actually trying to pen a deal.  If we can't get verification locked  down with this, we didn't have it with the Syrian chemical issue.  We  didn't have it in the past on occasion with the Russians --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  -- trust Russia because they said they got rid of all Syria's  chemical weapons.  And he also said that we're fine in Iran because he read  the deal, and it's super solid, and they have no desire to manufacture any  fissile material or use those in drills to make big --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BAKER:  That was their investment.  They were so -- they were so keen as  you pointed out.  So keen to get that deal, so we have to be careful.  The  Trump administration has to be able to say, no, we're not going to sit down  if what appears to be as the North Koreas are making demands and  concessions that we can't accept, don't even sit at the table, and much  less walk away.  Just don't sit down at that point.  Everybody understands  this is an incredibly complex issue between us, North Korea, South Korea,  China, Japan, you know, but this is -- again, it's worth pursuing and as  you pointed out, everybody regardless of your political position should be  willing to root for peace on the peninsula or an effort to get there. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Pretend the U.S. is actually in the World Cup, it's like that.   Everyone wants team USA to win.  Mike Baker, thank you so much. </p><p> BAKER:  What -- the World Cup is what?  That's soccer? </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  All right.  That's enough.  All right.  Dear, come on.  Let it  go.  Come on, man.  It's a beautiful game and you're a lovely person, so  thanks again.  Today, former President Jimmy -- oh, Jimmy Carter said he  thinks the president would deserve the Nobel Prize if he manages -- that's  a big if.  He's really qualifying this.  To get the North Koreans to give  up their nukes, but is the President Trump really thinking about canceling  the meeting or is possible that he's just being a showman and amping up the  drama?  Let me go to my military grade party pane tonight, she's an editor  at Townhall.com and a Fox News Contributor, Katie Pavlich is here.  He is a  spokesperson at Young Voices and host of the podcast Beltway Banthas, it's  Stephen Kent, and he is the host of \"YOUR WELCOME\", that's a podcast and  author of the book, Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim  Jong-il, he's got a license too, Michael Malice is back.  Our resident  actual North Korea expert. </p><p> MICHAEL MALICE, HOST, YOUR WELCOME SHOW:  I'm no Mike Baker. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Come on, man --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MALICE:  -- with a dead cat apparently. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  I don't think he was talking about you. </p><p> MALICE:  That's true. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  I want to read you Jimmy Carter's quote because I think -- I  want to -- I want to get your feeling on this.  He's talking about if  they're under constant belief that the United States wants to attack them  meaning North Korea even using nuclear weapons and that we are destroying  their economy and they know that they're starving to death primarily  because the United States withholds food aid for instance, just giving them  surplus food that we can never use.  I can understand how they feel. </p><p> MALICE:  Well, let me give you a little bit of background about Jimmy  Carter and North Korea.  He went there in 1994 and tried to broker a deal  with the great leader Kim Il-sung.  And five years ago today I posted a  quote from North Korean propaganda about their meeting and this is what  they said Jimmy Carter said, \"President Kim Il-sung is a person in whom  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, those popular  three presidents of the United States early in its history are put  together.\"  So that actually did not happen.  But the point is, North Korea  withheld food from getting to its citizenry in the '90s because Kim Jong-il  specifically said, if we allow the U.N. to feed the population, the  government will be superfluous.  So that's absolutely not true that they  would be willing to accept food. </p><p> And if they did accept food, they would claim it's coming from the leader,  so it's false in that regard.  It's absolutely true that they think we're  going to invade at any minute because you see people all over the news  right now blatantly saying John Bolton had a -- entry in the Wall Street  Journal that even South Korea is against it.  We have the unilateral right  to strike if they develop nuclear capabilities.  And when President Bush  said the axis of evil is Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.  This is clearly a  kill list of the three countries he wants to take out.  So they are right  to be afraid.  And again, if most people in this country don't trust  themselves to disarm and give up their guns and trust the federal  government, why would the North Korean government thinking differently? </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  And they have gotten so many resources over the years that  they could have used to feed their people.  I mean you don't build a multi- billion dollar nuclear weapons program unless you have money. </p><p> MALICE:  And lastly, the have something called Sung Bun and the used food  is a mechanism to control, so that the more loyal you are to the  government, the more likely you are to receive food. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  And we're going to talk about that same thing happening in  Venezuela.  But I want to get back here because we've heard a lot about the  Libyan model and it was something that John Bolton said in regards to  denuclearizing North Korea, you know, which is essentially can be by force  with a very sad ending for the leader of either Libya or North Korea.  It  wasn't just something that John Bolton said offhandedly months ago in an  interview.  This is now something that Vice President Pence has legitimized  by using the same term.  So do you think that we are on a march to war if  in fact the meeting doesn't take place? </p><p> STEPHEN KENT, HOST, BELTWAY BANTHAS PODCAST:  I don't think we're on a  march to war.  But I'm stunned that Mike Pence then echo that comment from  John Bolton because that seemed incredibly ill-advice.  They need to keep  that comment and John Bolton off television for the next three weeks if  they're going to make this meeting happen.  He instills this sense of  distrust with the North Korean regime.  And Michael is absolutely right  when he mentioned, you know, like trying to step away from their guns being  their WMD's.  Like -- they're like the cultists in Waco, like you cannot  threaten them in this way.  Their weapons are the only thing that make them  feel secure, so this march towards total denuclearization or else is not  going to work in this case.  We need to be a little bit more gentle here. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  You know, I was talking to Gordon Chang a few weeks ago and he  said they still have a conventional military which is actually a bigger  practical threat to the region and it's much easier for them to go ahead  and bomb South Korea.  They don't -- they don't have to use nukes in order  to inflict a lot of damage.  So even if you take their nuclear program  away, they still have the ability to defend themselves. </p><p> KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  That's always been the  concern that they'll use artillery power against Seoul, South Korea which  is right there across the border. This conversation you just had goes back  to why this has never worked out and why very administration has had a  failure when it comes to reining in North Korea's program.  They are so far  apart and although in the last couple of months we've seen things come  together on the surface.  When it comes to principles what the North  Koreans are willing to do which is not giving up their nuclear arms, the  negotiation now is about what denuclearization actually means and what the  United States requires which is complete denuclearization of the peninsula.   And the of course, there's China which is playing a role and saying, we  can't ask North Korea to completely give up their nukes.  However, we think  that they should be limited in their capacity.  And by the way, we don't  want any of the fallout when it comes to the regime -- </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  No.  China wants control and they want North Korea to be  dependent and they also want to have as much influence as possible on the  Korean Peninsula.  My question is, does South Korea -- with South Korea and  we're running out of time, so this has to beautiful quick answer.  Would  South Korea rather work with the United States in resolving this situation? </p><p> PAVLICH:  I think ultimately, yes.  I mean the United States is an ally.   We're doing military excises.  The United States has repeatedly said we are  not taking military -- legal military exercises off the table in exchange  for denuclearization of North Korea.  But again, the gap here is very wide  and it feels like we're back to the beginning of why this hasn't work out. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  That's where we five seconds. </p><p> PAVLICH:  Katie gets it perfectly. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Oh, very good, Michael Malice for taking the baton and looking  very classily.  The panel return a little bit later because how could they  not.  Plus, the plot thickens in the White House.  Republican lawmakers now  calling for a second special counsel to investigate the possibility the  feds had politically motivated spies in the Trump campaign.  And now the  president has weighed in.  I'll tell you what  he said.  Chris Stirewalt  joins me next for reaction. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  We got news alert now.  We just learned that the business  partner of President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen has  agreed to cooperate with the government as part of a plea deal.  Evgeny  Friedman, I know I'm not saying that right.  Is the note -- no.  Michael  Malice is shaking his head seriously.  He's got a whiplash.  He's a Russian  immigrant known as the taxi king.  Legal expert say this puts greater  pressure on Cohen to cooperate with the Mueller probe, but the president  says the real issue with the alleged spying on his campaign during the  election.  Watch. </p><p> TRUMP:  A lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign.  If they  had spies in my campaign, that would be a disgrace to this country.  That  would be one of the biggest insults that anyone has ever seen and it would  be very illegal aside from everything else.  It would make probably every  political event ever look like small potatoes. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Small potatoes?  Delicious though.  Michael Cohen cooperating  with the government would certainly be no picnic for the president.  But is  he right to say the election spying is the biggest concern here.  Joining  me now Fox News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt back in action.  Welcome  back. </p><p> CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR:  Ma'am. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Indeed.  All right.  So let's talk about this.  Spies in my  campaign, is that the biggest issue of all if that is in fact true? </p><p> STIREWALT:  The biggest issue in political history the president says --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Maybe ever. </p><p> STIREWALT:  Maybe ever which they're saying something.  I mean the fall of  Roman stuff was a pretty big deal.  Look, the president says that there  were spies, and this is a good narrative for him.  This helps him with his  base to talk about him as the real victim and the deep state, and it was  really Obama and Clinton, and he's the victim here.  He's not the  perpetuator.  But instead, he's the victim.  And it -- and especially  during a midterm where he desperately wants not to lose the house because  that would create a whole new set of pressures on him in terms of  investigations and conceivably impeachment that he wants to keep  Republicans with him and a good way to do that is to say that he's not the  offender here, that the system -- that he is the victim of the system. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  I truly believe that he believes he is not the offender.  He  believes he has done nothing wrong.  And he's just, you know, as a  negotiator does, if something doesn't succeed the first time you go about  it from different angles.  But is there something to this story?  Is it  possible that there were politically motivated operatives who were reaching  out to people of on the Trump campaign getting information to give back to  the FBI? </p><p> STIREWALT:  Well, if they can put cheese in the can and have it spray out  on a cracker that was anything --</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  What a great invention. </p><p> STIREWALT:  Anything is possible.  But I don't know.  I mean I cover  politics.  But I do know this that there is an inspector general's report  that is in process about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's  mishandling of state secrets.  We're waiting for that in just the next  coming days.  And then hot on the heels of that one from the inspector  general from the Department of Justice, Mr. Horowitz, is a report on the --  an investigation of the investigation into the Russian meddling and Trump's  campaign, and that rashmitas.  So I'm going to wait and find out, just like  I'm going to wait and find out what Mueller actually has as opposed to all  of these chatter dancing that people are doing around this stuff.  I don't  know.  So I'm just going to wait until I find that. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  I mean if there was a coordinated effort between James Clapper  and John Brennan and James Comey, you know, if that's not a politicized  trifecta, I don't know from my politicized trifecta, and I have a menagerie  of them in a green room.</p><p> STIREWALT:  Well, look, if that was so and they conspired together against  Donald Trump, well, that would be very bad.  But we don't know that.  We  don't have that evidence just like we don't have evidence that the  president colluded with Russia.  We just have -- the best I can do at this  point especially since we now have hopes that much of this will be  concluded by the end of the summer.  All I can do as a political forecaster  is say, we'll have enough information to know how this is going to affect  the midterms, how are Republicans going to respond to this.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  And I think the deployment of these types of informant is not  only possible.  I think it is plausible given the amount of -- the  capability of these various organizations whether it's the NSA, or CIA, or  FBI, or DEA spy on Americans.  They have the tools.  It would not surprise  me if there are people who would abuse that power for their own benefit.   And I hope that's not the case.  I hope we live in a country where that  kind of power is checked.  So far Congress keeps codifying it and that is  also terrifying.  Chris Stirewalt, thank you so much. </p><p> STIREWALT:  Ma'am. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Bottom line and every day of the week young man.  Very good. </p><p> STIREWALT:  Quite so. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes.  Coming up, Venezuela, the hell hole where a month's  salary can't even buy a cup of coffee.  People are so hungry they resorted  to eating zoo animals.  They just re-elected their president with nearly 70  percent of the vote.  Do you smell something fishy like a rotting zebra  carcass?  More examples of socialism destroying society in the monologue  next.  Stay here. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Crappy socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro was elected to  another six-year term in Venezuela.  Yes.  And the equally corrupted  authoritarian Turkish president campaigned for him, so they could share in  the farcical fun.  Leaders like Maduro, Erdogan, and Putin hate freedom  because it gives filthy peasants too much they empower over their own  lives.  They liquidate government holdings to enrich themselves in their  select cronies, and they steal from poor people who live horrible short  lives before they die in squalor.  It is no surprise these liberty loathers  create an access of a-holes.  They need to sow discord in the world's most  powerful economy because a truly free market disrupts their tyrannical  buggery -- signaling widespread discontent.  President Trump has signed an  executive order that bans U.S. citizens from snapping up Venezuelan  bargains from the state fire sale.  When people try to profit off this  desperation, they are further imprisoning the poorest among them who cannot  leave the country.  There has been a mass exodus of doctors, nurses,  teachers, engineers, and anyone else who has the means to escape the  tightening news of cruel socialism.  Anyone who can get out has fled, while  those trapped there are enduring inflation that's already at nearly 14,000  percent.  Plus, soaring malnutrition infant and maternal mortality rates  that are also going up and are being undertreated at vacant hospitals.  All  fraudulent elections should be condemned, including those in Turkey and  Russia.  And we need to be doubly mindful not to indulge amateur socialist  in this country.  Because even though a Bernie Sanders presidency is a  joke, the consequences of diet communism are deadly serious.  And that's  the memo.  </p><p> Oh, hi, great to see me.  That was swift.  How long Nicolas Maduro possibly  hang on to power as people are starving, his economy is ruined, the murder  rate is one of the highest in the world, and all indicators suggest things  are only going to get worse.  So, what can we do to fix this failed  socialist experiment before it turns into another Somalia?  The party panel  is back: Katie Pavlich, Stephen Kent, and Michael Malice.  Katie, I don't  think this is the worst-case-scenario.  I don't think this is a black swan  country undergoing some bad luck.  I think this is the natural ultimate end  of socialism and communism.  What do you think?</p><p> PAVLICH:  People argue, you know, this isn't real socialism or this isn't  real communism.  No, this is what it is.  In 1999, Venezuela decide to go  from more of a free market system to a socialist country to spend more  money on welfare.  This is exactly what we've seen as a result of that.   Now, Maduro is out there this week, on video in this bizarre way -- waving  to crowds that don't exist who applaud him on his re-election by 70  percent.  The United States has condemned the election results.  And the  question is, where do we go from here?  Not only in Venezuela but as the  United States because there are American interests there and there are  foreign policy implications of the regime collapsing.  The Venezuelans are  fleeing in large numbers.  As you mentioned in your monologue that most of  important people in the country who are, you know, doctors, nurses are  leaving.  But regular people are getting out because they are so desperate.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Giving on buses in getting out of the country.</p><p> PAVLICH:  Liberals, socialist Utopia that is now existing in Venezuela as a  result of these principles, not a mistake.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Malice?</p><p> MALICE:  What I would like to see happen because there's only so much we  can do in Venezuela.  Every politician who was a segregationist racist had  to disavow, have to turn their backs, and had to be publicly humiliated,  had to be (INAUDIBLE) for decades.  So why are Michael Moore, and Bernie  Sanders, and Jeremy Corbin in the U.K., all of the people who said  Venezuela is a great thing, a great experiment, why do they not run on the  public square and thrown tomatoes at where they go?  You have children  bleeding to death on hospital beds, you have people starving.  Again, they  shoot into crowds when people try to protest.  To have anyone who's in  politics for this, not take responsibility for it, and still begin a  microphone, I think, is disgraceful.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And it's only getting worse,  and worse, and worse.  It's actually getting exponentially worse as  inflation rises, and the poorest people, they are the ones who can't afford  to feed their kids.  They never had to treat malnutrition five years ago.   And now that condition has gone up 100 folds in hospitals that we have no  doctors.  So, what do we do?  Do we do anything as the United States?  </p><p> KENT:  Well, there's again, limited tools in our tool kit to deal with this  situation.  We're not going to invade Venezuela.  We shouldn't.  And  sanctions are something that we have to be delicate with as well, because  we want to target the elite in that country who are abusing and starving  their people without then, actually, hurting the people who live in that  country and are not able to leave.  We are mentioning that doctors and  everyone who are able to flee.  You know, the oil industry runs basically  the only leftover economy that's there, but it only benefits the wealthy.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's absolutely right.  And that's what they did.  I  mean, it is a state-run industry.  They've got so much oil, which was  great, and they were profitable when oil prices were high.  But when they  tanked -- </p><p> MALICE:  This is atlas shrugged comes to life.  This is exactly the  (INAUDIBLE).  Take out excessive business having the government running,  and then how long it takes for people to be --  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  And you know, when atlas shrugged, that's when the people are  holding up the economy, they leave.  They're exhausted.</p><p> MALICE:  And if the poor and the weak were the first to suffer.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  That's absolutely right and suffer the longest.  Well, back  here at home, I mean, we're really suffering, right?  Because House Speaker  Paul Ryan is facing renewed pressure to step down from his perch before his  term ends.  The administration maybe nudging the effort along.  White House  Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, reportedly said he has spoken with House  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about ousting Ryan, adding: \"Wouldn't it be  great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut  up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election.  That's a  really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do  it.\"  Now, Mulvaney says he's supportive of the speaker.  And McCarthy said  he's never even talked to Mulvaney about it.  So, should House Republicans  plan a mutiny, Katie?  </p><p> MALICE:  We always hear word of a mutiny whenever there's any kind of  speakers raised.  Jim Jordan, other than the hundred conservatives that  came out and sign the letters saying they want him to run for speaker.   Paul Ryan will likely out his term as speaker of the house.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  He's not going to get pushed out of the way?</p><p> PAVLICH:  You know, I don't know.  I mean, the thing is, as they say in  Washington, D.C.: if you want a friend, get a dog.  And although, Kevin  McCarthy and Paul Ryan have been very close for the last couple of years,  not only just in leadership as Paul Ryan came out through the ranks in the  House, from the Ways and Means Committee.  I doubt that McCarthy is going  to actually push Paul Ryan out. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  They want Jim to working at job.</p><p> KENT:  No, money talks.  Paul Ryan brought in 11.9 million in the first  quarter of the Republican.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's why Nancy Pelosi is still around.  </p><p> KENT:  So, yes, put up or shut up.  Everybody else who wants that job.   They're not going to move him out as long as they need to raise money for  these mid-term elections which are going to be contentious.  I also would  like to see Paul Ryan finish out this job because we need, we need him to  finish and have a legitimate open-run election.  Kevin McCarthy cannot be  nominated for this.  Nobody really wants him in the Republican --</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Is there a benefit to chaos?  </p><p> MALICE:  Look at the last Republican speaker.  You have ambassador of the  Vatican's wife, you have this lobster who's selling marijuana.  Dennis  Hastert, we can't even discuss on air.  And now, we have the guy who Mitt  Romney made his beta.  So, this is quite a cast of characters.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  He is his Robin.</p><p> MALICE:  Yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes, he really is.  I love Paul Rhino.  I love the term Paul  Rhino.  I think Paul Ryan has completely turned his back on his principles.  </p><p> MALICE:  But in 2012, Romney needed to play the base, and he chose Ryan.   And that's how far the Republican Party has gone to the right, but even  Ryan is regardless of the left --  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes, Ryan and a slap on the base.  You know, I want to thank  you all for being here, because you are good friends, you are allies of  freedom, and you are delightful people.  </p><p> PAVLICH:  Thank you for having us.</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Freedoms and my feels.  Michael, Stephen, and Katie Pavlich,  thank you all.  Coming up, Cops say Amazon's new facial recognition  technology is helping them identify suspects in crime.  But the privacy  police are sounding alarm bells.  Emily Compagno joins me with the details.   Hi, Emily!  She's coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  The future is now.  And I don't know if I like it.  Amazon has  some fancy new facial recognition technology and they're selling it to  police departments for $6.00 a month.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well,  a lot.  Which is why the ACLU is asking the tech giant to stop marketing  the tool to law enforcement agencies -- fearing it could be used to invade  your privacy.  Amazon respond to the ACLU's request with a statement that  read in quote: \"Amazon requires the customers comply with the law and be  responsible when they use Amazon Web Service (AWS).  When we find that AWS  services are being abused by a customer, we suspend that customer's right  to use our services.\"  Now, I would never add the cape for government  regulation to fix a problem like this, but should we be concerned about our  civil liberties and privacy when a tech giant like amazon combines with  government?  Let me ask former Criminal Defense Attorney and Legal Analyst,  Emily Compagno, she is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.  Emily,  welcome back to the show.  </p><p> EMILY COMPAGNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND LEGAL ANALYST:  So, let's  discuss this.  What is the down side to selling facial recognition  technology on the cheap to law enforcement?  </p><p> COMPAGNO:  Right.  ACLU and others are arguing, look, there's a high  capacity for abuse here.  So, they argue this isn't akin to just an  extension of photography.  They say, this is akin to walking through mass  protests and asking for identification for every single person there.  They  argue this can be used to follow immigrants by ICE, this can be used to  identify any random person on a street corner.  So, they kind of have the  same arguments that they have for all existing surveillance programs, which  is where is the limit, right?  And they argue that, although it's not  different from other facial recognition program.  Here, they site that what  is problematic is Amazon's aggressive marketing to law enforcement agencies  and the fact that the reach is so prolific.  So, that's what they're  arguing here.</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  And that's one of things that has always concerned me, whether  it's Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other social media platform.  You  know, these big tech companies getting in bed with the government, whether  it's military or law enforcement, the consequences can be dire.  They're  not always dire.  We want our law enforcement agencies to have tools and  have technology so they can keep us safe.  The problem is when these things  malfunction.  My iPhone X recognizes my face about half the time, and it's  not because I'm a supermodel but a lot of people say that.  It's because  this technology isn't perfect.  And you know, I don't trust that the facial  recognition software wouldn't recognize the wrong person.  </p><p> COMPAGNO:  Right.  Which is part of the argument and, you know, on the  other side, law enforcement agencies are arguing: look, you know, we're not  there yet.  It's important to us that the community understands what it's  being used for just as crucially as what it's not.  And they site the fact  that, you know, this has been used for surveillance footage matching from  burglaries, from what's picked up from CCTV.  They argue this has been used  to find abducted children or missing children in amusement parks.  It was  even used actually this weekend at the royal wedding of now duke and  duchess of Sussex for what royals had attended, right?  Sky News used.  So,  it's important that they feel the community that they --</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  I want to know the difference between David Beckham and Serena  Williams.  Because there were some people on other networks who didn't  really know the difference.  And that's a wonderful private application of  that tool essentially for entertainment.  I don't want to be arrested for a  crime that Kate Upton has committed because we look so similar.  </p><p> COMPAGNO:  Yes, and I do want to point out, though, that there's a bit of  hyperbole I see here in terms of the narrative that these free speech firms  and companies are pushing forward.  And here's one in particular, they cite  that this can now be used at airports which is a public place, they argue.   We're now in this climate of protesting and robust participation.  They  claim that there could be a chilling factor, but I want to point out that  airports for example are not public places for purposes of free speech.   It's been long held at the first, second, and fourth amendment are actually  restricted there.  So, in terms of the conversation surrounding this, to me  it's important that the narrative isn't subjects to that kind of hyperbolic  quality, because to me, it just increases the chasm between law enforcement  and what they're trying to do, and then lawful protected right to privacy  that we have without kind of muddying the water.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely, understand.  And I think there is so much more to  discuss and address here.  I really appreciate your perspective.  Thank you  so much, Emily.  Great to talk to you again. </p><p> COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  \"TOPICAL STORM\" is next.  It's a good one.  Stay here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  The NYPD is looking for a group of gunmen who robbed a  Walgreen's pharmacy while wearing clown masks.  Witnesses say, there could  be as many as 15 of them.  They were last seen fleeing one tiny car.  Be on  the lookout for a many, because this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\" </p><p> Topic number one.  We begin tonight in Houston, Texas, where everybody  knows that if you're going to drive on the highway, you're going to need  plenty of horse power.  Look at this.  Oh, mercy!  The Belmont state aren't  for another three weeks but this fellow is already getting in a good  workout.  In any other state, the sight of horse on a highway might have  caused a 12-car pile-up.  But in (INAUDIBLE) they're like, it's probably  going out for more beer.  Anything a couple of cars high beams so, they  could pass.  Now, fortunately some good Samaritans were able to steer it  off the road, and police have since returned though, of course, to its  owner but not before issuing a ticket for using the carpooling without a  passenger.  Rules are rules, pal.  Get a (INAUDIBLE) next time.</p><p> Topic number two.  There it is.  A Florida City issued a zombie alert to  its citizens.  And we'd like to think it was an accident, but you never  know in Florida.  A storm caused a blackout on Sunday that led the  residents of Lake Worth, Florida, to get an alert that read: Zombie --  power outage and zombie alert for the residents of Lake Worth and Terminus.   There are now far less than 7300 customers involved due to extreme zombie  activity.  Now, Terminus is a fictitious town from the hit T.V. show \"The  Walking Dead\".  Its inclusion in the message led cops to believe it was a  prank.  Great police, fellows.  Well done.  It's unlikely someone confused  the state of Florida and \"The Walking Dead\" because the two couldn't be  more different.  One is an apocalyptic wasteland of human oddities, and the  other is a T.V. show.  That's right.  </p><p> Topic number three.  If you're a cop in the city of Cleveland, long enough  you'll see everything -- except for a Browns Super Bowl championship.  But  these cops, they don't need a championship to party.  The officers  responded to this block party to cut the noise, but they wound up cutting a  rug because not even a horse can resist it.  It's so addictive.  We have a  staffer named Courtney who does it all the time in the office.  She's very  special.  The video of the dancing cops has taken off across the country,  and so has their other police horse.  There I go again on my own.  Turns  out he'll be shuffling papers behind his desk because he's been suspended  for not tying up his horse.  </p><p> Topic number four.  There it is.  Thanks to Bunk Breaker for this one.   Women's soccer legend, Brandy Chastain, was inducted into the Bay Area hall  of fame this week.  But the person who may brand these flack, must drink a  few brandies before going into the studio.  The women's soccer legend  became famous for whipping off her jersey after hitting the winning penalty  kick in the 1999 World Cup.  She was an international (INAUDIBLE), but  apparently, she's now a trucker named Gill, who likes beef jerky and lot  lizard.  The Internet says she looks like Gary Busey, so either way slice  it, she's looks like someone who is little nuts.  She looks like she's a  transitioning Elizabeth Warren without glasses.  You can't make this up,  unlike Elizabeth's heritage.  The hall of fame has since apologized and  offered to make a new plaque.  And perhaps, not surprisingly Brandi, has  graciously accepted their offer.  We reached out to the plaque maker for  comment but he was at the vet with his seeing eye dog.  </p><p> Topic number five.  Perhaps no athlete is more disappointed than Tonya  Harding who did not win the top prize in last night's \"Dancing with the  Stars\" finale.  Someday, historians will remember this as the end of the  #kneetoo movement.  Figure skater Adam Rippon took home the win, and Lord  knows he'll need the prize money, because competing against Tonya Harding  can cost you an arm and a leg.  If you don't believe me, ask Nancy  Kerrigan.  NFL Star, Josh Norman, with the other runner-up in the first  all-athlete season.  It was also the first season of all famous people.   Usually, that show is a who's who of people that make you say, who?  Her  T.V. comeback may be over, but don't feel bad for Tonya because she just  joined a new dance troupe who are very familiar with her work.  Is he going  to get the police?  (INAUDIBLE) felony.  If only she had this much rhythm  in last night's finale.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Thank you so much for watching this show tonight.

Let's take  a live look and listen to President Trump.  He's speaking at the Susan B.  Anthony List 11th Annual Campaign for Life Gala at the National Building  Museum in Washington, D.C.  Let's go. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I watch him all the time.  I  don't know him well, but I'll get to know him.  John Rutherford, where is  he, John?  Central casting.  Great job, John.  He's always defending me.   Actually, most of you are always defending me and that's OK.  And from my  neck of the woods, Claudia Kenny.  Thank you, Claudia.  Thank you.  And for  those many that I have left out, I'm sorry.  But I say, give me a totally  complete list and I will call you tomorrow and I will apologize personally.   All right.  But every day between now and November, we must work together  to elect more lawmakers who share our values, cherish our heritage, and  proudly stand for life.  And that is a great group of people I introduced.   I can tell you that.  We're also glad to be joined by a beloved member of  my administration, a true fighter for faith and family, and your 2018  distinguished leader, Kellyanne Conway.  Kellyanne.  What a job --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Sorry.  The president of course speaking introduction  luminaries there at the gala and we will dip back in if there is some  breaking news or he stumbles upon something that you need to hear about it  because you got it right here, baby.  There have been some major twists in  President Trump's scheduled meeting with Kim Jong-un.  The president saying  he no longer likes the North Korean dictator's attitude and casting doubt  that the meeting will happen at all.  Watch this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If it doesn't happen, maybe it will happen later.  Maybe it will  happen at a different time.  But we will see.  But we are talking.  The  meeting is scheduled as you know on June 12th in Singapore.  And whether or  not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon, but we're talking right now. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Talking may not be good enough.  We're being told Kim Jong-un  may have second thoughts about giving up all of his nuclear weapons.  The  president today said the dictator would be making a huge mistake by walking  away from this all-important table.  And just yesterday, Vice President  Pence told our own Martha MacCallum that if he keeps his nukes, the  situation could end really, really badly.  Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It would be a great  mistake for Kim Jong-un to think he could play Donald Trump.  The truth is  that President Trump has made it clear that this administration will not  tolerate the regime in North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and ballistic  missiles that threaten our people, that threaten the United States of  America , that threaten our allies in the region. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The vice president went on to say that North Korea will end up  like Libya if it doesn't make a deal.  And we all remember how that ended.   The country was destroyed.  Muammar Gaddafi was murdered in the street by  rebels.  Wow.  So will Kim Jong-un play ball or is the meeting and the  possible Nobel Prize out the window?  With me now Fox Business Reporter  Edward Lawrence with all the details.  Edward. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kennedy, this  is the first time that we're hearing the president actually say that the  meeting may not go forward on June 12th.  However, the State Department is  saying that they are working towards that date and only that date. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  I do have a real sense that  he would -- he would find American investment, American technology,  American know how of real value to his people.  If we get this right and we  get the denuclearization right, America wouldn't be quite capable of  delivering them with lots of things that would make life better for the  North Korean people. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  And President Trump saying that he personally guarantees the  safety of Kim Jong-un at the meeting in Singapore.  He president going on  to say that he recognizes that fact that Kim Jong-un would be the person to  lead his people into the future.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I would say that we are looking certainly right now at two Koreas,  two very successful Koreas.  You're going to have a very, very successful  North Korea and you're going to have a very successful and you already do,  South Korea. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now, all of this is predicated on denuclearization.  And right  now, there's a group of journalists from the United States, from China,  Russia, and the United Kingdom that are expected to witness the North  Koreans actually taking down, demolishing one of their nuclear sites.  Now,  whether in the area has delayed that trip.  It is expected to happen again  today or tomorrow their time, Kennedy. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, same thing.  Edward, thank you so much.  All right.  So  Kim -- can Kim Jong-un be trusted to keep his word?  And is China throwing  a monkey wrench into the work?  That question answers itself.  It certainly  is fuzz bud.  Just let me bring in former CIA operative Mike Baker, also  the President of Diligence LLC.  Welcome back to the show, Mike. </p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC:  Thank you very much, Kennedy.  Thank  you.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely.  The president says that Kim Jong-un's attitude  needs an adjustment since his most of recent chat with President Xi  Jinping.  What do you think about China's meddling in a situation they're  not necessarily a part of? </p><p>BAKER:  Well, in that you just -- that last part of your sentence is  important to note.  What China wants to insure is that they're relevant in  these conversations.  And they made that fairly clear over the past couple  of months.  But, look, nobody is surprised by sort of the posturing that's  taking place on both sides leading into this.  This is an historic  potentially defining moment.  Even if the summit occurs and nothing happens  after that and we can't get through the lengthy negotiations to get some  type of deal signed, just getting to this point almost being at the table  is an historic moment given how many years we've spent kicking the can down  the road with a fairly feckless foreign policy towards North Korea.  So I  think that the administration has been pretty clear in stating that they  understand this could be problematic and saying they're going to walk away  from the table.  It is interesting to note that aside from the fact you  can't swing a dead cat without hitting a North Korea expert these days.   It's also interesting to know that you got members of the resistance and  some members of the media who seemed almost hoping for this thing to fall  apart.  And if you find yourself rooting against peace on the peninsula  because you don't like President Trump, then you might want to rethink your  priorities. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I absolutely agree with you about that.  And I think there is  a time and a place for resistance.  I think there are certainly instances  where you have to hold the president accountable for the things the he says  and does.  But here I think, you know, this is an area where we have to be  as supportive as possible because a peaceful ending to this situation is  critical.  It's paramount.  Now, what's interesting and something that you  have pointed out is obviously there are issues with the Iran deal.  And you  have noted that part of the issue is because President Obama was so  impatient, and he was so dead set on landing that deal that he really  compromise our position there.  So would you caution this president against  doing the same thing with North Korea? </p><p>BAKER:  Right.  And, again, they've been very been clear in saying over the  past many weeks that they'd be willing to get up from the table and walk  away.  But what they have to be careful about is as you get closer and  closer to that potential meeting on the 12th of June, you have to be  careful that you feel so invested in this now, and you -- you're so keen to  get this going.  But you have to step back, take a breath, and understand  that, as you said, the previous administration, the Obama administration,  you know, they had their knickers in such a twist over the desire to get a  deal, any deal, that they were willing to overlook the problems with the  deal and they were willing to accept all the requests and concessions and  demands that the Iranian regime put into that deal.  And so, you know, and  again, with anything that takes place in this world of weapons agreements  whether you're talking about conventional weapons, nuclear weapons,  biological or chemical weapons really at the end of the day what matters  more than anything else is verification. </p><p>Trust but verify.  If you can't verify and the Iranian example is a good  one because it was in the deal.  We were not allowed to inspect military  sites.  So, yes, were they complying as people who were supporting that the  deal say?  Well, they were complying with it.  Yes, we got -- they were  complying with what was written in the deal.  But we had no verification  capability for any of their military sites.  And frankly, that's like  saying you're a serial killer.  You allow the police to come into your home  and search it, but you can't go in the basement and look around.  So we get  to be really careful and if we do get to that hard difficult point where  we're actually trying to pen a deal.  If we can't get verification locked  down with this, we didn't have it with the Syrian chemical issue.  We  didn't have it in the past on occasion with the Russians --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  -- trust Russia because they said they got rid of all Syria's  chemical weapons.  And he also said that we're fine in Iran because he read  the deal, and it's super solid, and they have no desire to manufacture any  fissile material or use those in drills to make big --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BAKER:  That was their investment.  They were so -- they were so keen as  you pointed out.  So keen to get that deal, so we have to be careful.  The  Trump administration has to be able to say, no, we're not going to sit down  if what appears to be as the North Koreas are making demands and  concessions that we can't accept, don't even sit at the table, and much  less walk away.  Just don't sit down at that point.  Everybody understands  this is an incredibly complex issue between us, North Korea, South Korea,  China, Japan, you know, but this is -- again, it's worth pursuing and as  you pointed out, everybody regardless of your political position should be  willing to root for peace on the peninsula or an effort to get there. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Pretend the U.S. is actually in the World Cup, it's like that.   Everyone wants team USA to win.  Mike Baker, thank you so much. </p><p>BAKER:  What -- the World Cup is what?  That's soccer? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  All right.  That's enough.  All right.  Dear, come on.  Let it  go.  Come on, man.  It's a beautiful game and you're a lovely person, so  thanks again.  Today, former President Jimmy -- oh, Jimmy Carter said he  thinks the president would deserve the Nobel Prize if he manages -- that's  a big if.  He's really qualifying this.  To get the North Koreans to give  up their nukes, but is the President Trump really thinking about canceling  the meeting or is possible that he's just being a showman and amping up the  drama?  Let me go to my military grade party pane tonight, she's an editor  at Townhall.com and a Fox News Contributor, Katie Pavlich is here.  He is a  spokesperson at Young Voices and host of the podcast Beltway Banthas, it's  Stephen Kent, and he is the host of \"YOUR WELCOME\", that's a podcast and  author of the book, Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim  Jong-il, he's got a license too, Michael Malice is back.  Our resident  actual North Korea expert. </p><p>MICHAEL MALICE, HOST, YOUR WELCOME SHOW:  I'm no Mike Baker. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Come on, man --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MALICE:  -- with a dead cat apparently. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I don't think he was talking about you. </p><p>MALICE:  That's true. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to read you Jimmy Carter's quote because I think -- I  want to -- I want to get your feeling on this.  He's talking about if  they're under constant belief that the United States wants to attack them  meaning North Korea even using nuclear weapons and that we are destroying  their economy and they know that they're starving to death primarily  because the United States withholds food aid for instance, just giving them  surplus food that we can never use.  I can understand how they feel. </p><p>MALICE:  Well, let me give you a little bit of background about Jimmy  Carter and North Korea.  He went there in 1994 and tried to broker a deal  with the great leader Kim Il-sung.  And five years ago today I posted a  quote from North Korean propaganda about their meeting and this is what  they said Jimmy Carter said, \"President Kim Il-sung is a person in whom  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, those popular  three presidents of the United States early in its history are put  together.\"  So that actually did not happen.  But the point is, North Korea  withheld food from getting to its citizenry in the '90s because Kim Jong-il  specifically said, if we allow the U.N. to feed the population, the  government will be superfluous.  So that's absolutely not true that they  would be willing to accept food. </p><p>And if they did accept food, they would claim it's coming from the leader,  so it's false in that regard.  It's absolutely true that they think we're  going to invade at any minute because you see people all over the news  right now blatantly saying John Bolton had a -- entry in the Wall Street  Journal that even South Korea is against it.  We have the unilateral right  to strike if they develop nuclear capabilities.  And when President Bush  said the axis of evil is Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.  This is clearly a  kill list of the three countries he wants to take out.  So they are right  to be afraid.  And again, if most people in this country don't trust  themselves to disarm and give up their guns and trust the federal  government, why would the North Korean government thinking differently? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And they have gotten so many resources over the years that  they could have used to feed their people.  I mean you don't build a multi- billion dollar nuclear weapons program unless you have money. </p><p>MALICE:  And lastly, the have something called Sung Bun and the used food  is a mechanism to control, so that the more loyal you are to the  government, the more likely you are to receive food. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And we're going to talk about that same thing happening in  Venezuela.  But I want to get back here because we've heard a lot about the  Libyan model and it was something that John Bolton said in regards to  denuclearizing North Korea, you know, which is essentially can be by force  with a very sad ending for the leader of either Libya or North Korea.  It  wasn't just something that John Bolton said offhandedly months ago in an  interview.  This is now something that Vice President Pence has legitimized  by using the same term.  So do you think that we are on a march to war if  in fact the meeting doesn't take place? </p><p>STEPHEN KENT, HOST, BELTWAY BANTHAS PODCAST:  I don't think we're on a  march to war.  But I'm stunned that Mike Pence then echo that comment from  John Bolton because that seemed incredibly ill-advice.  They need to keep  that comment and John Bolton off television for the next three weeks if  they're going to make this meeting happen.  He instills this sense of  distrust with the North Korean regime.  And Michael is absolutely right  when he mentioned, you know, like trying to step away from their guns being  their WMD's.  Like -- they're like the cultists in Waco, like you cannot  threaten them in this way.  Their weapons are the only thing that make them  feel secure, so this march towards total denuclearization or else is not  going to work in this case.  We need to be a little bit more gentle here. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  You know, I was talking to Gordon Chang a few weeks ago and he  said they still have a conventional military which is actually a bigger  practical threat to the region and it's much easier for them to go ahead  and bomb South Korea.  They don't -- they don't have to use nukes in order  to inflict a lot of damage.  So even if you take their nuclear program  away, they still have the ability to defend themselves. </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  That's always been the  concern that they'll use artillery power against Seoul, South Korea which  is right there across the border. This conversation you just had goes back  to why this has never worked out and why very administration has had a  failure when it comes to reining in North Korea's program.  They are so far  apart and although in the last couple of months we've seen things come  together on the surface.  When it comes to principles what the North  Koreans are willing to do which is not giving up their nuclear arms, the  negotiation now is about what denuclearization actually means and what the  United States requires which is complete denuclearization of the peninsula.   And the of course, there's China which is playing a role and saying, we  can't ask North Korea to completely give up their nukes.  However, we think  that they should be limited in their capacity.  And by the way, we don't  want any of the fallout when it comes to the regime -- </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  No.  China wants control and they want North Korea to be  dependent and they also want to have as much influence as possible on the  Korean Peninsula.  My question is, does South Korea -- with South Korea and  we're running out of time, so this has to beautiful quick answer.  Would  South Korea rather work with the United States in resolving this situation? </p><p>PAVLICH:  I think ultimately, yes.  I mean the United States is an ally.   We're doing military excises.  The United States has repeatedly said we are  not taking military -- legal military exercises off the table in exchange  for denuclearization of North Korea.  But again, the gap here is very wide  and it feels like we're back to the beginning of why this hasn't work out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's where we five seconds. </p><p>PAVLICH:  Katie gets it perfectly. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Oh, very good, Michael Malice for taking the baton and looking  very classily.  The panel return a little bit later because how could they  not.  Plus, the plot thickens in the White House.  Republican lawmakers now  calling for a second special counsel to investigate the possibility the  feds had politically motivated spies in the Trump campaign.  And now the  president has weighed in.  I'll tell you what  he said.  Chris Stirewalt  joins me next for reaction. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  We got news alert now.  We just learned that the business  partner of President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen has  agreed to cooperate with the government as part of a plea deal.  Evgeny  Friedman, I know I'm not saying that right.  Is the note -- no.  Michael  Malice is shaking his head seriously.  He's got a whiplash.  He's a Russian  immigrant known as the taxi king.  Legal expert say this puts greater  pressure on Cohen to cooperate with the Mueller probe, but the president  says the real issue with the alleged spying on his campaign during the  election.  Watch. </p><p>TRUMP:  A lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign.  If they  had spies in my campaign, that would be a disgrace to this country.  That  would be one of the biggest insults that anyone has ever seen and it would  be very illegal aside from everything else.  It would make probably every  political event ever look like small potatoes. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Small potatoes?  Delicious though.  Michael Cohen cooperating  with the government would certainly be no picnic for the president.  But is  he right to say the election spying is the biggest concern here.  Joining  me now Fox News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt back in action.  Welcome  back. </p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Indeed.  All right.  So let's talk about this.  Spies in my  campaign, is that the biggest issue of all if that is in fact true? </p><p>STIREWALT:  The biggest issue in political history the president says --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Maybe ever. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Maybe ever which they're saying something.  I mean the fall of  Roman stuff was a pretty big deal.  Look, the president says that there  were spies, and this is a good narrative for him.  This helps him with his  base to talk about him as the real victim and the deep state, and it was  really Obama and Clinton, and he's the victim here.  He's not the  perpetuator.  But instead, he's the victim.  And it -- and especially  during a midterm where he desperately wants not to lose the house because  that would create a whole new set of pressures on him in terms of  investigations and conceivably impeachment that he wants to keep  Republicans with him and a good way to do that is to say that he's not the  offender here, that the system -- that he is the victim of the system. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I truly believe that he believes he is not the offender.  He  believes he has done nothing wrong.  And he's just, you know, as a  negotiator does, if something doesn't succeed the first time you go about  it from different angles.  But is there something to this story?  Is it  possible that there were politically motivated operatives who were reaching  out to people of on the Trump campaign getting information to give back to  the FBI? </p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, if they can put cheese in the can and have it spray out  on a cracker that was anything --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  What a great invention. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Anything is possible.  But I don't know.  I mean I cover  politics.  But I do know this that there is an inspector general's report  that is in process about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's  mishandling of state secrets.  We're waiting for that in just the next  coming days.  And then hot on the heels of that one from the inspector  general from the Department of Justice, Mr. Horowitz, is a report on the --  an investigation of the investigation into the Russian meddling and Trump's  campaign, and that rashmitas.  So I'm going to wait and find out, just like  I'm going to wait and find out what Mueller actually has as opposed to all  of these chatter dancing that people are doing around this stuff.  I don't  know.  So I'm just going to wait until I find that. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I mean if there was a coordinated effort between James Clapper  and John Brennan and James Comey, you know, if that's not a politicized  trifecta, I don't know from my politicized trifecta, and I have a menagerie  of them in a green room.</p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, look, if that was so and they conspired together against  Donald Trump, well, that would be very bad.  But we don't know that.  We  don't have that evidence just like we don't have evidence that the  president colluded with Russia.  We just have -- the best I can do at this  point especially since we now have hopes that much of this will be  concluded by the end of the summer.  All I can do as a political forecaster  is say, we'll have enough information to know how this is going to affect  the midterms, how are Republicans going to respond to this.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And I think the deployment of these types of informant is not  only possible.  I think it is plausible given the amount of -- the  capability of these various organizations whether it's the NSA, or CIA, or  FBI, or DEA spy on Americans.  They have the tools.  It would not surprise  me if there are people who would abuse that power for their own benefit.   And I hope that's not the case.  I hope we live in a country where that  kind of power is checked.  So far Congress keeps codifying it and that is  also terrifying.  Chris Stirewalt, thank you so much. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Bottom line and every day of the week young man.  Very good. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Quite so. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes.  Coming up, Venezuela, the hell hole where a month's  salary can't even buy a cup of coffee.  People are so hungry they resorted  to eating zoo animals.  They just re-elected their president with nearly 70  percent of the vote.  Do you smell something fishy like a rotting zebra  carcass?  More examples of socialism destroying society in the monologue  next.  Stay here. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Crappy socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro was elected to  another six-year term in Venezuela.  Yes.  And the equally corrupted  authoritarian Turkish president campaigned for him, so they could share in  the farcical fun.  Leaders like Maduro, Erdogan, and Putin hate freedom  because it gives filthy peasants too much they empower over their own  lives.  They liquidate government holdings to enrich themselves in their  select cronies, and they steal from poor people who live horrible short  lives before they die in squalor.  It is no surprise these liberty loathers  create an access of a-holes.  They need to sow discord in the world's most  powerful economy because a truly free market disrupts their tyrannical  buggery -- signaling widespread discontent.  President Trump has signed an  executive order that bans U.S. citizens from snapping up Venezuelan  bargains from the state fire sale.  When people try to profit off this  desperation, they are further imprisoning the poorest among them who cannot  leave the country.  There has been a mass exodus of doctors, nurses,  teachers, engineers, and anyone else who has the means to escape the  tightening news of cruel socialism.  Anyone who can get out has fled, while  those trapped there are enduring inflation that's already at nearly 14,000  percent.  Plus, soaring malnutrition infant and maternal mortality rates  that are also going up and are being undertreated at vacant hospitals.  All  fraudulent elections should be condemned, including those in Turkey and  Russia.  And we need to be doubly mindful not to indulge amateur socialist  in this country.  Because even though a Bernie Sanders presidency is a  joke, the consequences of diet communism are deadly serious.  And that's  the memo.  </p><p>Oh, hi, great to see me.  That was swift.  How long Nicolas Maduro possibly  hang on to power as people are starving, his economy is ruined, the murder  rate is one of the highest in the world, and all indicators suggest things  are only going to get worse.  So, what can we do to fix this failed  socialist experiment before it turns into another Somalia?  The party panel  is back: Katie Pavlich, Stephen Kent, and Michael Malice.  Katie, I don't  think this is the worst-case-scenario.  I don't think this is a black swan  country undergoing some bad luck.  I think this is the natural ultimate end  of socialism and communism.  What do you think?</p><p>PAVLICH:  People argue, you know, this isn't real socialism or this isn't  real communism.  No, this is what it is.  In 1999, Venezuela decide to go  from more of a free market system to a socialist country to spend more  money on welfare.  This is exactly what we've seen as a result of that.   Now, Maduro is out there this week, on video in this bizarre way -- waving  to crowds that don't exist who applaud him on his re-election by 70  percent.  The United States has condemned the election results.  And the  question is, where do we go from here?  Not only in Venezuela but as the  United States because there are American interests there and there are  foreign policy implications of the regime collapsing.  The Venezuelans are  fleeing in large numbers.  As you mentioned in your monologue that most of  important people in the country who are, you know, doctors, nurses are  leaving.  But regular people are getting out because they are so desperate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Giving on buses in getting out of the country.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Liberals, socialist Utopia that is now existing in Venezuela as a  result of these principles, not a mistake.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Malice?</p><p>MALICE:  What I would like to see happen because there's only so much we  can do in Venezuela.  Every politician who was a segregationist racist had  to disavow, have to turn their backs, and had to be publicly humiliated,  had to be (INAUDIBLE) for decades.  So why are Michael Moore, and Bernie  Sanders, and Jeremy Corbin in the U.K., all of the people who said  Venezuela is a great thing, a great experiment, why do they not run on the  public square and thrown tomatoes at where they go?  You have children  bleeding to death on hospital beds, you have people starving.  Again, they  shoot into crowds when people try to protest.  To have anyone who's in  politics for this, not take responsibility for it, and still begin a  microphone, I think, is disgraceful.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And it's only getting worse,  and worse, and worse.  It's actually getting exponentially worse as  inflation rises, and the poorest people, they are the ones who can't afford  to feed their kids.  They never had to treat malnutrition five years ago.   And now that condition has gone up 100 folds in hospitals that we have no  doctors.  So, what do we do?  Do we do anything as the United States?  </p><p>KENT:  Well, there's again, limited tools in our tool kit to deal with this  situation.  We're not going to invade Venezuela.  We shouldn't.  And  sanctions are something that we have to be delicate with as well, because  we want to target the elite in that country who are abusing and starving  their people without then, actually, hurting the people who live in that  country and are not able to leave.  We are mentioning that doctors and  everyone who are able to flee.  You know, the oil industry runs basically  the only leftover economy that's there, but it only benefits the wealthy.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's absolutely right.  And that's what they did.  I  mean, it is a state-run industry.  They've got so much oil, which was  great, and they were profitable when oil prices were high.  But when they  tanked -- </p><p>MALICE:  This is atlas shrugged comes to life.  This is exactly the  (INAUDIBLE).  Take out excessive business having the government running,  and then how long it takes for people to be --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And you know, when atlas shrugged, that's when the people are  holding up the economy, they leave.  They're exhausted.</p><p>MALICE:  And if the poor and the weak were the first to suffer.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's absolutely right and suffer the longest.  Well, back  here at home, I mean, we're really suffering, right?  Because House Speaker  Paul Ryan is facing renewed pressure to step down from his perch before his  term ends.  The administration maybe nudging the effort along.  White House  Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, reportedly said he has spoken with House  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about ousting Ryan, adding: \"Wouldn't it be  great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut  up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election.  That's a  really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do  it.\"  Now, Mulvaney says he's supportive of the speaker.  And McCarthy said  he's never even talked to Mulvaney about it.  So, should House Republicans  plan a mutiny, Katie?  </p><p>MALICE:  We always hear word of a mutiny whenever there's any kind of  speakers raised.  Jim Jordan, other than the hundred conservatives that  came out and sign the letters saying they want him to run for speaker.   Paul Ryan will likely out his term as speaker of the house.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He's not going to get pushed out of the way?</p><p>PAVLICH:  You know, I don't know.  I mean, the thing is, as they say in  Washington, D.C.: if you want a friend, get a dog.  And although, Kevin  McCarthy and Paul Ryan have been very close for the last couple of years,  not only just in leadership as Paul Ryan came out through the ranks in the  House, from the Ways and Means Committee.  I doubt that McCarthy is going  to actually push Paul Ryan out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  They want Jim to working at job.</p><p>KENT:  No, money talks.  Paul Ryan brought in 11.9 million in the first  quarter of the Republican.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's why Nancy Pelosi is still around.  </p><p>KENT:  So, yes, put up or shut up.  Everybody else who wants that job.   They're not going to move him out as long as they need to raise money for  these mid-term elections which are going to be contentious.  I also would  like to see Paul Ryan finish out this job because we need, we need him to  finish and have a legitimate open-run election.  Kevin McCarthy cannot be  nominated for this.  Nobody really wants him in the Republican --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Is there a benefit to chaos?  </p><p>MALICE:  Look at the last Republican speaker.  You have ambassador of the  Vatican's wife, you have this lobster who's selling marijuana.  Dennis  Hastert, we can't even discuss on air.  And now, we have the guy who Mitt  Romney made his beta.  So, this is quite a cast of characters.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He is his Robin.</p><p>MALICE:  Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, he really is.  I love Paul Rhino.  I love the term Paul  Rhino.  I think Paul Ryan has completely turned his back on his principles.  </p><p>MALICE:  But in 2012, Romney needed to play the base, and he chose Ryan.   And that's how far the Republican Party has gone to the right, but even  Ryan is regardless of the left --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, Ryan and a slap on the base.  You know, I want to thank  you all for being here, because you are good friends, you are allies of  freedom, and you are delightful people.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Thank you for having us.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Freedoms and my feels.  Michael, Stephen, and Katie Pavlich,  thank you all.  Coming up, Cops say Amazon's new facial recognition  technology is helping them identify suspects in crime.  But the privacy  police are sounding alarm bells.  Emily Compagno joins me with the details.   Hi, Emily!  She's coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The future is now.  And I don't know if I like it.  Amazon has  some fancy new facial recognition technology and they're selling it to  police departments for $6.00 a month.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well,  a lot.  Which is why the ACLU is asking the tech giant to stop marketing  the tool to law enforcement agencies -- fearing it could be used to invade  your privacy.  Amazon respond to the ACLU's request with a statement that  read in quote: \"Amazon requires the customers comply with the law and be  responsible when they use Amazon Web Service (AWS).  When we find that AWS  services are being abused by a customer, we suspend that customer's right  to use our services.\"  Now, I would never add the cape for government  regulation to fix a problem like this, but should we be concerned about our  civil liberties and privacy when a tech giant like amazon combines with  government?  Let me ask former Criminal Defense Attorney and Legal Analyst,  Emily Compagno, she is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.  Emily,  welcome back to the show.  </p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND LEGAL ANALYST:  So, let's  discuss this.  What is the down side to selling facial recognition  technology on the cheap to law enforcement?  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  ACLU and others are arguing, look, there's a high  capacity for abuse here.  So, they argue this isn't akin to just an  extension of photography.  They say, this is akin to walking through mass  protests and asking for identification for every single person there.  They  argue this can be used to follow immigrants by ICE, this can be used to  identify any random person on a street corner.  So, they kind of have the  same arguments that they have for all existing surveillance programs, which  is where is the limit, right?  And they argue that, although it's not  different from other facial recognition program.  Here, they site that what  is problematic is Amazon's aggressive marketing to law enforcement agencies  and the fact that the reach is so prolific.  So, that's what they're  arguing here.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And that's one of things that has always concerned me, whether  it's Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other social media platform.  You  know, these big tech companies getting in bed with the government, whether  it's military or law enforcement, the consequences can be dire.  They're  not always dire.  We want our law enforcement agencies to have tools and  have technology so they can keep us safe.  The problem is when these things  malfunction.  My iPhone X recognizes my face about half the time, and it's  not because I'm a supermodel but a lot of people say that.  It's because  this technology isn't perfect.  And you know, I don't trust that the facial  recognition software wouldn't recognize the wrong person.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  Which is part of the argument and, you know, on the  other side, law enforcement agencies are arguing: look, you know, we're not  there yet.  It's important to us that the community understands what it's  being used for just as crucially as what it's not.  And they site the fact  that, you know, this has been used for surveillance footage matching from  burglaries, from what's picked up from CCTV.  They argue this has been used  to find abducted children or missing children in amusement parks.  It was  even used actually this weekend at the royal wedding of now duke and  duchess of Sussex for what royals had attended, right?  Sky News used.  So,  it's important that they feel the community that they --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to know the difference between David Beckham and Serena  Williams.  Because there were some people on other networks who didn't  really know the difference.  And that's a wonderful private application of  that tool essentially for entertainment.  I don't want to be arrested for a  crime that Kate Upton has committed because we look so similar.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes, and I do want to point out, though, that there's a bit of  hyperbole I see here in terms of the narrative that these free speech firms  and companies are pushing forward.  And here's one in particular, they cite  that this can now be used at airports which is a public place, they argue.   We're now in this climate of protesting and robust participation.  They  claim that there could be a chilling factor, but I want to point out that  airports for example are not public places for purposes of free speech.   It's been long held at the first, second, and fourth amendment are actually  restricted there.  So, in terms of the conversation surrounding this, to me  it's important that the narrative isn't subjects to that kind of hyperbolic  quality, because to me, it just increases the chasm between law enforcement  and what they're trying to do, and then lawful protected right to privacy  that we have without kind of muddying the water.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely, understand.  And I think there is so much more to  discuss and address here.  I really appreciate your perspective.  Thank you  so much, Emily.  Great to talk to you again. </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  \"TOPICAL STORM\" is next.  It's a good one.  Stay here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The NYPD is looking for a group of gunmen who robbed a  Walgreen's pharmacy while wearing clown masks.  Witnesses say, there could  be as many as 15 of them.  They were last seen fleeing one tiny car.  Be on  the lookout for a many, because this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\" </p><p>Topic number one.  We begin tonight in Houston, Texas, where everybody  knows that if you're going to drive on the highway, you're going to need  plenty of horse power.  Look at this.  Oh, mercy!  The Belmont state aren't  for another three weeks but this fellow is already getting in a good  workout.  In any other state, the sight of horse on a highway might have  caused a 12-car pile-up.  But in (INAUDIBLE) they're like, it's probably  going out for more beer.  Anything a couple of cars high beams so, they  could pass.  Now, fortunately some good Samaritans were able to steer it  off the road, and police have since returned though, of course, to its  owner but not before issuing a ticket for using the carpooling without a  passenger.  Rules are rules, pal.  Get a (INAUDIBLE) next time.</p><p>Topic number two.  There it is.  A Florida City issued a zombie alert to  its citizens.  And we'd like to think it was an accident, but you never  know in Florida.  A storm caused a blackout on Sunday that led the  residents of Lake Worth, Florida, to get an alert that read: Zombie --  power outage and zombie alert for the residents of Lake Worth and Terminus.   There are now far less than 7300 customers involved due to extreme zombie  activity.  Now, Terminus is a fictitious town from the hit T.V. show \"The  Walking Dead\".  Its inclusion in the message led cops to believe it was a  prank.  Great police, fellows.  Well done.  It's unlikely someone confused  the state of Florida and \"The Walking Dead\" because the two couldn't be  more different.  One is an apocalyptic wasteland of human oddities, and the  other is a T.V. show.  That's right.  </p><p>Topic number three.  If you're a cop in the city of Cleveland, long enough  you'll see everything -- except for a Browns Super Bowl championship.  But  these cops, they don't need a championship to party.  The officers  responded to this block party to cut the noise, but they wound up cutting a  rug because not even a horse can resist it.  It's so addictive.  We have a  staffer named Courtney who does it all the time in the office.  She's very  special.  The video of the dancing cops has taken off across the country,  and so has their other police horse.  There I go again on my own.  Turns  out he'll be shuffling papers behind his desk because he's been suspended  for not tying up his horse.  </p><p>Topic number four.  There it is.  Thanks to Bunk Breaker for this one.   Women's soccer legend, Brandy Chastain, was inducted into the Bay Area hall  of fame this week.  But the person who may brand these flack, must drink a  few brandies before going into the studio.  The women's soccer legend  became famous for whipping off her jersey after hitting the winning penalty  kick in the 1999 World Cup.  She was an international (INAUDIBLE), but  apparently, she's now a trucker named Gill, who likes beef jerky and lot  lizard.  The Internet says she looks like Gary Busey, so either way slice  it, she's looks like someone who is little nuts.  She looks like she's a  transitioning Elizabeth Warren without glasses.  You can't make this up,  unlike Elizabeth's heritage.  The hall of fame has since apologized and  offered to make a new plaque.  And perhaps, not surprisingly Brandi, has  graciously accepted their offer.  We reached out to the plaque maker for  comment but he was at the vet with his seeing eye dog.  </p><p>Topic number five.  Perhaps no athlete is more disappointed than Tonya  Harding who did not win the top prize in last night's \"Dancing with the  Stars\" finale.  Someday, historians will remember this as the end of the  #kneetoo movement.  Figure skater Adam Rippon took home the win, and Lord  knows he'll need the prize money, because competing against Tonya Harding  can cost you an arm and a leg.  If you don't believe me, ask Nancy  Kerrigan.  NFL Star, Josh Norman, with the other runner-up in the first  all-athlete season.  It was also the first season of all famous people.   Usually, that show is a who's who of people that make you say, who?  Her  T.V. comeback may be over, but don't feel bad for Tonya because she just  joined a new dance troupe who are very familiar with her work.  Is he going  to get the police?  (INAUDIBLE) felony.  If only she had this much rhythm  in last night's finale.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Thank you so much for watching this show tonight.

Let's take  a live look and listen to President Trump.  He's speaking at the Susan B.  Anthony List 11th Annual Campaign for Life Gala at the National Building  Museum in Washington, D.C.  Let's go. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I watch him all the time.  I  don't know him well, but I'll get to know him.  John Rutherford, where is  he, John?  Central casting.  Great job, John.  He's always defending me.   Actually, most of you are always defending me and that's OK.  And from my  neck of the woods, Claudia Kenny.  Thank you, Claudia.  Thank you.  And for  those many that I have left out, I'm sorry.  But I say, give me a totally  complete list and I will call you tomorrow and I will apologize personally.   All right.  But every day between now and November, we must work together  to elect more lawmakers who share our values, cherish our heritage, and  proudly stand for life.  And that is a great group of people I introduced.   I can tell you that.  We're also glad to be joined by a beloved member of  my administration, a true fighter for faith and family, and your 2018  distinguished leader, Kellyanne Conway.  Kellyanne.  What a job --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Sorry.  The president of course speaking introduction  luminaries there at the gala and we will dip back in if there is some  breaking news or he stumbles upon something that you need to hear about it  because you got it right here, baby.  There have been some major twists in  President Trump's scheduled meeting with Kim Jong-un.  The president saying  he no longer likes the North Korean dictator's attitude and casting doubt  that the meeting will happen at all.  Watch this. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  If it doesn't happen, maybe it will happen later.  Maybe it will  happen at a different time.  But we will see.  But we are talking.  The  meeting is scheduled as you know on June 12th in Singapore.  And whether or  not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon, but we're talking right now. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Talking may not be good enough.  We're being told Kim Jong-un  may have second thoughts about giving up all of his nuclear weapons.  The  president today said the dictator would be making a huge mistake by walking  away from this all-important table.  And just yesterday, Vice President  Pence told our own Martha MacCallum that if he keeps his nukes, the  situation could end really, really badly.  Watch. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It would be a great  mistake for Kim Jong-un to think he could play Donald Trump.  The truth is  that President Trump has made it clear that this administration will not  tolerate the regime in North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and ballistic  missiles that threaten our people, that threaten the United States of  America , that threaten our allies in the region. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  The vice president went on to say that North Korea will end up  like Libya if it doesn't make a deal.  And we all remember how that ended.   The country was destroyed.  Muammar Gaddafi was murdered in the street by  rebels.  Wow.  So will Kim Jong-un play ball or is the meeting and the  possible Nobel Prize out the window?  With me now Fox Business Reporter  Edward Lawrence with all the details.  Edward. </p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kennedy, this  is the first time that we're hearing the president actually say that the  meeting may not go forward on June 12th.  However, the State Department is  saying that they are working towards that date and only that date. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  I do have a real sense that  he would -- he would find American investment, American technology,  American know how of real value to his people.  If we get this right and we  get the denuclearization right, America wouldn't be quite capable of  delivering them with lots of things that would make life better for the  North Korean people. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LAWRENCE:  And President Trump saying that he personally guarantees the  safety of Kim Jong-un at the meeting in Singapore.  He president going on  to say that he recognizes that fact that Kim Jong-un would be the person to  lead his people into the future.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  I would say that we are looking certainly right now at two Koreas,  two very successful Koreas.  You're going to have a very, very successful  North Korea and you're going to have a very successful and you already do,  South Korea. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now, all of this is predicated on denuclearization.  And right  now, there's a group of journalists from the United States, from China,  Russia, and the United Kingdom that are expected to witness the North  Koreans actually taking down, demolishing one of their nuclear sites.  Now,  whether in the area has delayed that trip.  It is expected to happen again  today or tomorrow their time, Kennedy. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes, same thing.  Edward, thank you so much.  All right.  So  Kim -- can Kim Jong-un be trusted to keep his word?  And is China throwing  a monkey wrench into the work?  That question answers itself.  It certainly  is fuzz bud.  Just let me bring in former CIA operative Mike Baker, also  the President of Diligence LLC.  Welcome back to the show, Mike. </p><p> MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC:  Thank you very much, Kennedy.  Thank  you.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely.  The president says that Kim Jong-un's attitude  needs an adjustment since his most of recent chat with President Xi  Jinping.  What do you think about China's meddling in a situation they're  not necessarily a part of? </p><p> BAKER:  Well, in that you just -- that last part of your sentence is  important to note.  What China wants to insure is that they're relevant in  these conversations.  And they made that fairly clear over the past couple  of months.  But, look, nobody is surprised by sort of the posturing that's  taking place on both sides leading into this.  This is an historic  potentially defining moment.  Even if the summit occurs and nothing happens  after that and we can't get through the lengthy negotiations to get some  type of deal signed, just getting to this point almost being at the table  is an historic moment given how many years we've spent kicking the can down  the road with a fairly feckless foreign policy towards North Korea.  So I  think that the administration has been pretty clear in stating that they  understand this could be problematic and saying they're going to walk away  from the table.  It is interesting to note that aside from the fact you  can't swing a dead cat without hitting a North Korea expert these days.   It's also interesting to know that you got members of the resistance and  some members of the media who seemed almost hoping for this thing to fall  apart.  And if you find yourself rooting against peace on the peninsula  because you don't like President Trump, then you might want to rethink your  priorities. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  I absolutely agree with you about that.  And I think there is  a time and a place for resistance.  I think there are certainly instances  where you have to hold the president accountable for the things the he says  and does.  But here I think, you know, this is an area where we have to be  as supportive as possible because a peaceful ending to this situation is  critical.  It's paramount.  Now, what's interesting and something that you  have pointed out is obviously there are issues with the Iran deal.  And you  have noted that part of the issue is because President Obama was so  impatient, and he was so dead set on landing that deal that he really  compromise our position there.  So would you caution this president against  doing the same thing with North Korea? </p><p> BAKER:  Right.  And, again, they've been very been clear in saying over the  past many weeks that they'd be willing to get up from the table and walk  away.  But what they have to be careful about is as you get closer and  closer to that potential meeting on the 12th of June, you have to be  careful that you feel so invested in this now, and you -- you're so keen to  get this going.  But you have to step back, take a breath, and understand  that, as you said, the previous administration, the Obama administration,  you know, they had their knickers in such a twist over the desire to get a  deal, any deal, that they were willing to overlook the problems with the  deal and they were willing to accept all the requests and concessions and  demands that the Iranian regime put into that deal.  And so, you know, and  again, with anything that takes place in this world of weapons agreements  whether you're talking about conventional weapons, nuclear weapons,  biological or chemical weapons really at the end of the day what matters  more than anything else is verification. </p><p> Trust but verify.  If you can't verify and the Iranian example is a good  one because it was in the deal.  We were not allowed to inspect military  sites.  So, yes, were they complying as people who were supporting that the  deal say?  Well, they were complying with it.  Yes, we got -- they were  complying with what was written in the deal.  But we had no verification  capability for any of their military sites.  And frankly, that's like  saying you're a serial killer.  You allow the police to come into your home  and search it, but you can't go in the basement and look around.  So we get  to be really careful and if we do get to that hard difficult point where  we're actually trying to pen a deal.  If we can't get verification locked  down with this, we didn't have it with the Syrian chemical issue.  We  didn't have it in the past on occasion with the Russians --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  -- trust Russia because they said they got rid of all Syria's  chemical weapons.  And he also said that we're fine in Iran because he read  the deal, and it's super solid, and they have no desire to manufacture any  fissile material or use those in drills to make big --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BAKER:  That was their investment.  They were so -- they were so keen as  you pointed out.  So keen to get that deal, so we have to be careful.  The  Trump administration has to be able to say, no, we're not going to sit down  if what appears to be as the North Koreas are making demands and  concessions that we can't accept, don't even sit at the table, and much  less walk away.  Just don't sit down at that point.  Everybody understands  this is an incredibly complex issue between us, North Korea, South Korea,  China, Japan, you know, but this is -- again, it's worth pursuing and as  you pointed out, everybody regardless of your political position should be  willing to root for peace on the peninsula or an effort to get there. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Pretend the U.S. is actually in the World Cup, it's like that.   Everyone wants team USA to win.  Mike Baker, thank you so much. </p><p> BAKER:  What -- the World Cup is what?  That's soccer? </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  All right.  That's enough.  All right.  Dear, come on.  Let it  go.  Come on, man.  It's a beautiful game and you're a lovely person, so  thanks again.  Today, former President Jimmy -- oh, Jimmy Carter said he  thinks the president would deserve the Nobel Prize if he manages -- that's  a big if.  He's really qualifying this.  To get the North Koreans to give  up their nukes, but is the President Trump really thinking about canceling  the meeting or is possible that he's just being a showman and amping up the  drama?  Let me go to my military grade party pane tonight, she's an editor  at Townhall.com and a Fox News Contributor, Katie Pavlich is here.  He is a  spokesperson at Young Voices and host of the podcast Beltway Banthas, it's  Stephen Kent, and he is the host of \"YOUR WELCOME\", that's a podcast and  author of the book, Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim  Jong-il, he's got a license too, Michael Malice is back.  Our resident  actual North Korea expert. </p><p> MICHAEL MALICE, HOST, YOUR WELCOME SHOW:  I'm no Mike Baker. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Come on, man --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MALICE:  -- with a dead cat apparently. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  I don't think he was talking about you. </p><p> MALICE:  That's true. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  I want to read you Jimmy Carter's quote because I think -- I  want to -- I want to get your feeling on this.  He's talking about if  they're under constant belief that the United States wants to attack them  meaning North Korea even using nuclear weapons and that we are destroying  their economy and they know that they're starving to death primarily  because the United States withholds food aid for instance, just giving them  surplus food that we can never use.  I can understand how they feel. </p><p> MALICE:  Well, let me give you a little bit of background about Jimmy  Carter and North Korea.  He went there in 1994 and tried to broker a deal  with the great leader Kim Il-sung.  And five years ago today I posted a  quote from North Korean propaganda about their meeting and this is what  they said Jimmy Carter said, \"President Kim Il-sung is a person in whom  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, those popular  three presidents of the United States early in its history are put  together.\"  So that actually did not happen.  But the point is, North Korea  withheld food from getting to its citizenry in the '90s because Kim Jong-il  specifically said, if we allow the U.N. to feed the population, the  government will be superfluous.  So that's absolutely not true that they  would be willing to accept food. </p><p> And if they did accept food, they would claim it's coming from the leader,  so it's false in that regard.  It's absolutely true that they think we're  going to invade at any minute because you see people all over the news  right now blatantly saying John Bolton had a -- entry in the Wall Street  Journal that even South Korea is against it.  We have the unilateral right  to strike if they develop nuclear capabilities.  And when President Bush  said the axis of evil is Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.  This is clearly a  kill list of the three countries he wants to take out.  So they are right  to be afraid.  And again, if most people in this country don't trust  themselves to disarm and give up their guns and trust the federal  government, why would the North Korean government thinking differently? </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  And they have gotten so many resources over the years that  they could have used to feed their people.  I mean you don't build a multi- billion dollar nuclear weapons program unless you have money. </p><p> MALICE:  And lastly, the have something called Sung Bun and the used food  is a mechanism to control, so that the more loyal you are to the  government, the more likely you are to receive food. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  And we're going to talk about that same thing happening in  Venezuela.  But I want to get back here because we've heard a lot about the  Libyan model and it was something that John Bolton said in regards to  denuclearizing North Korea, you know, which is essentially can be by force  with a very sad ending for the leader of either Libya or North Korea.  It  wasn't just something that John Bolton said offhandedly months ago in an  interview.  This is now something that Vice President Pence has legitimized  by using the same term.  So do you think that we are on a march to war if  in fact the meeting doesn't take place? </p><p> STEPHEN KENT, HOST, BELTWAY BANTHAS PODCAST:  I don't think we're on a  march to war.  But I'm stunned that Mike Pence then echo that comment from  John Bolton because that seemed incredibly ill-advice.  They need to keep  that comment and John Bolton off television for the next three weeks if  they're going to make this meeting happen.  He instills this sense of  distrust with the North Korean regime.  And Michael is absolutely right  when he mentioned, you know, like trying to step away from their guns being  their WMD's.  Like -- they're like the cultists in Waco, like you cannot  threaten them in this way.  Their weapons are the only thing that make them  feel secure, so this march towards total denuclearization or else is not  going to work in this case.  We need to be a little bit more gentle here. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  You know, I was talking to Gordon Chang a few weeks ago and he  said they still have a conventional military which is actually a bigger  practical threat to the region and it's much easier for them to go ahead  and bomb South Korea.  They don't -- they don't have to use nukes in order  to inflict a lot of damage.  So even if you take their nuclear program  away, they still have the ability to defend themselves. </p><p> KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  That's always been the  concern that they'll use artillery power against Seoul, South Korea which  is right there across the border. This conversation you just had goes back  to why this has never worked out and why very administration has had a  failure when it comes to reining in North Korea's program.  They are so far  apart and although in the last couple of months we've seen things come  together on the surface.  When it comes to principles what the North  Koreans are willing to do which is not giving up their nuclear arms, the  negotiation now is about what denuclearization actually means and what the  United States requires which is complete denuclearization of the peninsula.   And the of course, there's China which is playing a role and saying, we  can't ask North Korea to completely give up their nukes.  However, we think  that they should be limited in their capacity.  And by the way, we don't  want any of the fallout when it comes to the regime -- </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  No.  China wants control and they want North Korea to be  dependent and they also want to have as much influence as possible on the  Korean Peninsula.  My question is, does South Korea -- with South Korea and  we're running out of time, so this has to beautiful quick answer.  Would  South Korea rather work with the United States in resolving this situation? </p><p> PAVLICH:  I think ultimately, yes.  I mean the United States is an ally.   We're doing military excises.  The United States has repeatedly said we are  not taking military -- legal military exercises off the table in exchange  for denuclearization of North Korea.  But again, the gap here is very wide  and it feels like we're back to the beginning of why this hasn't work out. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  That's where we five seconds. </p><p> PAVLICH:  Katie gets it perfectly. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Oh, very good, Michael Malice for taking the baton and looking  very classily.  The panel return a little bit later because how could they  not.  Plus, the plot thickens in the White House.  Republican lawmakers now  calling for a second special counsel to investigate the possibility the  feds had politically motivated spies in the Trump campaign.  And now the  president has weighed in.  I'll tell you what  he said.  Chris Stirewalt  joins me next for reaction. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  We got news alert now.  We just learned that the business  partner of President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen has  agreed to cooperate with the government as part of a plea deal.  Evgeny  Friedman, I know I'm not saying that right.  Is the note -- no.  Michael  Malice is shaking his head seriously.  He's got a whiplash.  He's a Russian  immigrant known as the taxi king.  Legal expert say this puts greater  pressure on Cohen to cooperate with the Mueller probe, but the president  says the real issue with the alleged spying on his campaign during the  election.  Watch. </p><p> TRUMP:  A lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign.  If they  had spies in my campaign, that would be a disgrace to this country.  That  would be one of the biggest insults that anyone has ever seen and it would  be very illegal aside from everything else.  It would make probably every  political event ever look like small potatoes. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Small potatoes?  Delicious though.  Michael Cohen cooperating  with the government would certainly be no picnic for the president.  But is  he right to say the election spying is the biggest concern here.  Joining  me now Fox News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt back in action.  Welcome  back. </p><p> CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR:  Ma'am. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Indeed.  All right.  So let's talk about this.  Spies in my  campaign, is that the biggest issue of all if that is in fact true? </p><p> STIREWALT:  The biggest issue in political history the president says --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Maybe ever. </p><p> STIREWALT:  Maybe ever which they're saying something.  I mean the fall of  Roman stuff was a pretty big deal.  Look, the president says that there  were spies, and this is a good narrative for him.  This helps him with his  base to talk about him as the real victim and the deep state, and it was  really Obama and Clinton, and he's the victim here.  He's not the  perpetuator.  But instead, he's the victim.  And it -- and especially  during a midterm where he desperately wants not to lose the house because  that would create a whole new set of pressures on him in terms of  investigations and conceivably impeachment that he wants to keep  Republicans with him and a good way to do that is to say that he's not the  offender here, that the system -- that he is the victim of the system. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  I truly believe that he believes he is not the offender.  He  believes he has done nothing wrong.  And he's just, you know, as a  negotiator does, if something doesn't succeed the first time you go about  it from different angles.  But is there something to this story?  Is it  possible that there were politically motivated operatives who were reaching  out to people of on the Trump campaign getting information to give back to  the FBI? </p><p> STIREWALT:  Well, if they can put cheese in the can and have it spray out  on a cracker that was anything --</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  What a great invention. </p><p> STIREWALT:  Anything is possible.  But I don't know.  I mean I cover  politics.  But I do know this that there is an inspector general's report  that is in process about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's  mishandling of state secrets.  We're waiting for that in just the next  coming days.  And then hot on the heels of that one from the inspector  general from the Department of Justice, Mr. Horowitz, is a report on the --  an investigation of the investigation into the Russian meddling and Trump's  campaign, and that rashmitas.  So I'm going to wait and find out, just like  I'm going to wait and find out what Mueller actually has as opposed to all  of these chatter dancing that people are doing around this stuff.  I don't  know.  So I'm just going to wait until I find that. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  I mean if there was a coordinated effort between James Clapper  and John Brennan and James Comey, you know, if that's not a politicized  trifecta, I don't know from my politicized trifecta, and I have a menagerie  of them in a green room.</p><p> STIREWALT:  Well, look, if that was so and they conspired together against  Donald Trump, well, that would be very bad.  But we don't know that.  We  don't have that evidence just like we don't have evidence that the  president colluded with Russia.  We just have -- the best I can do at this  point especially since we now have hopes that much of this will be  concluded by the end of the summer.  All I can do as a political forecaster  is say, we'll have enough information to know how this is going to affect  the midterms, how are Republicans going to respond to this.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  And I think the deployment of these types of informant is not  only possible.  I think it is plausible given the amount of -- the  capability of these various organizations whether it's the NSA, or CIA, or  FBI, or DEA spy on Americans.  They have the tools.  It would not surprise  me if there are people who would abuse that power for their own benefit.   And I hope that's not the case.  I hope we live in a country where that  kind of power is checked.  So far Congress keeps codifying it and that is  also terrifying.  Chris Stirewalt, thank you so much. </p><p> STIREWALT:  Ma'am. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Bottom line and every day of the week young man.  Very good. </p><p> STIREWALT:  Quite so. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes.  Coming up, Venezuela, the hell hole where a month's  salary can't even buy a cup of coffee.  People are so hungry they resorted  to eating zoo animals.  They just re-elected their president with nearly 70  percent of the vote.  Do you smell something fishy like a rotting zebra  carcass?  More examples of socialism destroying society in the monologue  next.  Stay here. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Crappy socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro was elected to  another six-year term in Venezuela.  Yes.  And the equally corrupted  authoritarian Turkish president campaigned for him, so they could share in  the farcical fun.  Leaders like Maduro, Erdogan, and Putin hate freedom  because it gives filthy peasants too much they empower over their own  lives.  They liquidate government holdings to enrich themselves in their  select cronies, and they steal from poor people who live horrible short  lives before they die in squalor.  It is no surprise these liberty loathers  create an access of a-holes.  They need to sow discord in the world's most  powerful economy because a truly free market disrupts their tyrannical  buggery -- signaling widespread discontent.  President Trump has signed an  executive order that bans U.S. citizens from snapping up Venezuelan  bargains from the state fire sale.  When people try to profit off this  desperation, they are further imprisoning the poorest among them who cannot  leave the country.  There has been a mass exodus of doctors, nurses,  teachers, engineers, and anyone else who has the means to escape the  tightening news of cruel socialism.  Anyone who can get out has fled, while  those trapped there are enduring inflation that's already at nearly 14,000  percent.  Plus, soaring malnutrition infant and maternal mortality rates  that are also going up and are being undertreated at vacant hospitals.  All  fraudulent elections should be condemned, including those in Turkey and  Russia.  And we need to be doubly mindful not to indulge amateur socialist  in this country.  Because even though a Bernie Sanders presidency is a  joke, the consequences of diet communism are deadly serious.  And that's  the memo.  </p><p> Oh, hi, great to see me.  That was swift.  How long Nicolas Maduro possibly  hang on to power as people are starving, his economy is ruined, the murder  rate is one of the highest in the world, and all indicators suggest things  are only going to get worse.  So, what can we do to fix this failed  socialist experiment before it turns into another Somalia?  The party panel  is back: Katie Pavlich, Stephen Kent, and Michael Malice.  Katie, I don't  think this is the worst-case-scenario.  I don't think this is a black swan  country undergoing some bad luck.  I think this is the natural ultimate end  of socialism and communism.  What do you think?</p><p> PAVLICH:  People argue, you know, this isn't real socialism or this isn't  real communism.  No, this is what it is.  In 1999, Venezuela decide to go  from more of a free market system to a socialist country to spend more  money on welfare.  This is exactly what we've seen as a result of that.   Now, Maduro is out there this week, on video in this bizarre way -- waving  to crowds that don't exist who applaud him on his re-election by 70  percent.  The United States has condemned the election results.  And the  question is, where do we go from here?  Not only in Venezuela but as the  United States because there are American interests there and there are  foreign policy implications of the regime collapsing.  The Venezuelans are  fleeing in large numbers.  As you mentioned in your monologue that most of  important people in the country who are, you know, doctors, nurses are  leaving.  But regular people are getting out because they are so desperate.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Giving on buses in getting out of the country.</p><p> PAVLICH:  Liberals, socialist Utopia that is now existing in Venezuela as a  result of these principles, not a mistake.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Malice?</p><p> MALICE:  What I would like to see happen because there's only so much we  can do in Venezuela.  Every politician who was a segregationist racist had  to disavow, have to turn their backs, and had to be publicly humiliated,  had to be (INAUDIBLE) for decades.  So why are Michael Moore, and Bernie  Sanders, and Jeremy Corbin in the U.K., all of the people who said  Venezuela is a great thing, a great experiment, why do they not run on the  public square and thrown tomatoes at where they go?  You have children  bleeding to death on hospital beds, you have people starving.  Again, they  shoot into crowds when people try to protest.  To have anyone who's in  politics for this, not take responsibility for it, and still begin a  microphone, I think, is disgraceful.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And it's only getting worse,  and worse, and worse.  It's actually getting exponentially worse as  inflation rises, and the poorest people, they are the ones who can't afford  to feed their kids.  They never had to treat malnutrition five years ago.   And now that condition has gone up 100 folds in hospitals that we have no  doctors.  So, what do we do?  Do we do anything as the United States?  </p><p> KENT:  Well, there's again, limited tools in our tool kit to deal with this  situation.  We're not going to invade Venezuela.  We shouldn't.  And  sanctions are something that we have to be delicate with as well, because  we want to target the elite in that country who are abusing and starving  their people without then, actually, hurting the people who live in that  country and are not able to leave.  We are mentioning that doctors and  everyone who are able to flee.  You know, the oil industry runs basically  the only leftover economy that's there, but it only benefits the wealthy.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's absolutely right.  And that's what they did.  I  mean, it is a state-run industry.  They've got so much oil, which was  great, and they were profitable when oil prices were high.  But when they  tanked -- </p><p> MALICE:  This is atlas shrugged comes to life.  This is exactly the  (INAUDIBLE).  Take out excessive business having the government running,  and then how long it takes for people to be --  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  And you know, when atlas shrugged, that's when the people are  holding up the economy, they leave.  They're exhausted.</p><p> MALICE:  And if the poor and the weak were the first to suffer.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  That's absolutely right and suffer the longest.  Well, back  here at home, I mean, we're really suffering, right?  Because House Speaker  Paul Ryan is facing renewed pressure to step down from his perch before his  term ends.  The administration maybe nudging the effort along.  White House  Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, reportedly said he has spoken with House  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about ousting Ryan, adding: \"Wouldn't it be  great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut  up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election.  That's a  really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do  it.\"  Now, Mulvaney says he's supportive of the speaker.  And McCarthy said  he's never even talked to Mulvaney about it.  So, should House Republicans  plan a mutiny, Katie?  </p><p> MALICE:  We always hear word of a mutiny whenever there's any kind of  speakers raised.  Jim Jordan, other than the hundred conservatives that  came out and sign the letters saying they want him to run for speaker.   Paul Ryan will likely out his term as speaker of the house.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  He's not going to get pushed out of the way?</p><p> PAVLICH:  You know, I don't know.  I mean, the thing is, as they say in  Washington, D.C.: if you want a friend, get a dog.  And although, Kevin  McCarthy and Paul Ryan have been very close for the last couple of years,  not only just in leadership as Paul Ryan came out through the ranks in the  House, from the Ways and Means Committee.  I doubt that McCarthy is going  to actually push Paul Ryan out. </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  They want Jim to working at job.</p><p> KENT:  No, money talks.  Paul Ryan brought in 11.9 million in the first  quarter of the Republican.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's why Nancy Pelosi is still around.  </p><p> KENT:  So, yes, put up or shut up.  Everybody else who wants that job.   They're not going to move him out as long as they need to raise money for  these mid-term elections which are going to be contentious.  I also would  like to see Paul Ryan finish out this job because we need, we need him to  finish and have a legitimate open-run election.  Kevin McCarthy cannot be  nominated for this.  Nobody really wants him in the Republican --</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Is there a benefit to chaos?  </p><p> MALICE:  Look at the last Republican speaker.  You have ambassador of the  Vatican's wife, you have this lobster who's selling marijuana.  Dennis  Hastert, we can't even discuss on air.  And now, we have the guy who Mitt  Romney made his beta.  So, this is quite a cast of characters.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  He is his Robin.</p><p> MALICE:  Yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes, he really is.  I love Paul Rhino.  I love the term Paul  Rhino.  I think Paul Ryan has completely turned his back on his principles.  </p><p> MALICE:  But in 2012, Romney needed to play the base, and he chose Ryan.   And that's how far the Republican Party has gone to the right, but even  Ryan is regardless of the left --  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Yes, Ryan and a slap on the base.  You know, I want to thank  you all for being here, because you are good friends, you are allies of  freedom, and you are delightful people.  </p><p> PAVLICH:  Thank you for having us.</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Freedoms and my feels.  Michael, Stephen, and Katie Pavlich,  thank you all.  Coming up, Cops say Amazon's new facial recognition  technology is helping them identify suspects in crime.  But the privacy  police are sounding alarm bells.  Emily Compagno joins me with the details.   Hi, Emily!  She's coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  The future is now.  And I don't know if I like it.  Amazon has  some fancy new facial recognition technology and they're selling it to  police departments for $6.00 a month.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well,  a lot.  Which is why the ACLU is asking the tech giant to stop marketing  the tool to law enforcement agencies -- fearing it could be used to invade  your privacy.  Amazon respond to the ACLU's request with a statement that  read in quote: \"Amazon requires the customers comply with the law and be  responsible when they use Amazon Web Service (AWS).  When we find that AWS  services are being abused by a customer, we suspend that customer's right  to use our services.\"  Now, I would never add the cape for government  regulation to fix a problem like this, but should we be concerned about our  civil liberties and privacy when a tech giant like amazon combines with  government?  Let me ask former Criminal Defense Attorney and Legal Analyst,  Emily Compagno, she is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.  Emily,  welcome back to the show.  </p><p> EMILY COMPAGNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND LEGAL ANALYST:  So, let's  discuss this.  What is the down side to selling facial recognition  technology on the cheap to law enforcement?  </p><p> COMPAGNO:  Right.  ACLU and others are arguing, look, there's a high  capacity for abuse here.  So, they argue this isn't akin to just an  extension of photography.  They say, this is akin to walking through mass  protests and asking for identification for every single person there.  They  argue this can be used to follow immigrants by ICE, this can be used to  identify any random person on a street corner.  So, they kind of have the  same arguments that they have for all existing surveillance programs, which  is where is the limit, right?  And they argue that, although it's not  different from other facial recognition program.  Here, they site that what  is problematic is Amazon's aggressive marketing to law enforcement agencies  and the fact that the reach is so prolific.  So, that's what they're  arguing here.</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  And that's one of things that has always concerned me, whether  it's Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other social media platform.  You  know, these big tech companies getting in bed with the government, whether  it's military or law enforcement, the consequences can be dire.  They're  not always dire.  We want our law enforcement agencies to have tools and  have technology so they can keep us safe.  The problem is when these things  malfunction.  My iPhone X recognizes my face about half the time, and it's  not because I'm a supermodel but a lot of people say that.  It's because  this technology isn't perfect.  And you know, I don't trust that the facial  recognition software wouldn't recognize the wrong person.  </p><p> COMPAGNO:  Right.  Which is part of the argument and, you know, on the  other side, law enforcement agencies are arguing: look, you know, we're not  there yet.  It's important to us that the community understands what it's  being used for just as crucially as what it's not.  And they site the fact  that, you know, this has been used for surveillance footage matching from  burglaries, from what's picked up from CCTV.  They argue this has been used  to find abducted children or missing children in amusement parks.  It was  even used actually this weekend at the royal wedding of now duke and  duchess of Sussex for what royals had attended, right?  Sky News used.  So,  it's important that they feel the community that they --</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  I want to know the difference between David Beckham and Serena  Williams.  Because there were some people on other networks who didn't  really know the difference.  And that's a wonderful private application of  that tool essentially for entertainment.  I don't want to be arrested for a  crime that Kate Upton has committed because we look so similar.  </p><p> COMPAGNO:  Yes, and I do want to point out, though, that there's a bit of  hyperbole I see here in terms of the narrative that these free speech firms  and companies are pushing forward.  And here's one in particular, they cite  that this can now be used at airports which is a public place, they argue.   We're now in this climate of protesting and robust participation.  They  claim that there could be a chilling factor, but I want to point out that  airports for example are not public places for purposes of free speech.   It's been long held at the first, second, and fourth amendment are actually  restricted there.  So, in terms of the conversation surrounding this, to me  it's important that the narrative isn't subjects to that kind of hyperbolic  quality, because to me, it just increases the chasm between law enforcement  and what they're trying to do, and then lawful protected right to privacy  that we have without kind of muddying the water.  </p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely, understand.  And I think there is so much more to  discuss and address here.  I really appreciate your perspective.  Thank you  so much, Emily.  Great to talk to you again. </p><p> COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  \"TOPICAL STORM\" is next.  It's a good one.  Stay here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  The NYPD is looking for a group of gunmen who robbed a  Walgreen's pharmacy while wearing clown masks.  Witnesses say, there could  be as many as 15 of them.  They were last seen fleeing one tiny car.  Be on  the lookout for a many, because this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\" </p><p> Topic number one.  We begin tonight in Houston, Texas, where everybody  knows that if you're going to drive on the highway, you're going to need  plenty of horse power.  Look at this.  Oh, mercy!  The Belmont state aren't  for another three weeks but this fellow is already getting in a good  workout.  In any other state, the sight of horse on a highway might have  caused a 12-car pile-up.  But in (INAUDIBLE) they're like, it's probably  going out for more beer.  Anything a couple of cars high beams so, they  could pass.  Now, fortunately some good Samaritans were able to steer it  off the road, and police have since returned though, of course, to its  owner but not before issuing a ticket for using the carpooling without a  passenger.  Rules are rules, pal.  Get a (INAUDIBLE) next time.</p><p> Topic number two.  There it is.  A Florida City issued a zombie alert to  its citizens.  And we'd like to think it was an accident, but you never  know in Florida.  A storm caused a blackout on Sunday that led the  residents of Lake Worth, Florida, to get an alert that read: Zombie --  power outage and zombie alert for the residents of Lake Worth and Terminus.   There are now far less than 7300 customers involved due to extreme zombie  activity.  Now, Terminus is a fictitious town from the hit T.V. show \"The  Walking Dead\".  Its inclusion in the message led cops to believe it was a  prank.  Great police, fellows.  Well done.  It's unlikely someone confused  the state of Florida and \"The Walking Dead\" because the two couldn't be  more different.  One is an apocalyptic wasteland of human oddities, and the  other is a T.V. show.  That's right.  </p><p> Topic number three.  If you're a cop in the city of Cleveland, long enough  you'll see everything -- except for a Browns Super Bowl championship.  But  these cops, they don't need a championship to party.  The officers  responded to this block party to cut the noise, but they wound up cutting a  rug because not even a horse can resist it.  It's so addictive.  We have a  staffer named Courtney who does it all the time in the office.  She's very  special.  The video of the dancing cops has taken off across the country,  and so has their other police horse.  There I go again on my own.  Turns  out he'll be shuffling papers behind his desk because he's been suspended  for not tying up his horse.  </p><p> Topic number four.  There it is.  Thanks to Bunk Breaker for this one.   Women's soccer legend, Brandy Chastain, was inducted into the Bay Area hall  of fame this week.  But the person who may brand these flack, must drink a  few brandies before going into the studio.  The women's soccer legend  became famous for whipping off her jersey after hitting the winning penalty  kick in the 1999 World Cup.  She was an international (INAUDIBLE), but  apparently, she's now a trucker named Gill, who likes beef jerky and lot  lizard.  The Internet says she looks like Gary Busey, so either way slice  it, she's looks like someone who is little nuts.  She looks like she's a  transitioning Elizabeth Warren without glasses.  You can't make this up,  unlike Elizabeth's heritage.  The hall of fame has since apologized and  offered to make a new plaque.  And perhaps, not surprisingly Brandi, has  graciously accepted their offer.  We reached out to the plaque maker for  comment but he was at the vet with his seeing eye dog.  </p><p> Topic number five.  Perhaps no athlete is more disappointed than Tonya  Harding who did not win the top prize in last night's \"Dancing with the  Stars\" finale.  Someday, historians will remember this as the end of the  #kneetoo movement.  Figure skater Adam Rippon took home the win, and Lord  knows he'll need the prize money, because competing against Tonya Harding  can cost you an arm and a leg.  If you don't believe me, ask Nancy  Kerrigan.  NFL Star, Josh Norman, with the other runner-up in the first  all-athlete season.  It was also the first season of all famous people.   Usually, that show is a who's who of people that make you say, who?  Her  T.V. comeback may be over, but don't feel bad for Tonya because she just  joined a new dance troupe who are very familiar with her work.  Is he going  to get the police?  (INAUDIBLE) felony.  If only she had this much rhythm  in last night's finale.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MONTGOMERY:  Thank you so much for watching this show tonight.

Let's take  a live look and listen to President Trump.  He's speaking at the Susan B.  Anthony List 11th Annual Campaign for Life Gala at the National Building  Museum in Washington, D.C.  Let's go. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I watch him all the time.  I  don't know him well, but I'll get to know him.  John Rutherford, where is  he, John?  Central casting.  Great job, John.  He's always defending me.   Actually, most of you are always defending me and that's OK.  And from my  neck of the woods, Claudia Kenny.  Thank you, Claudia.  Thank you.  And for  those many that I have left out, I'm sorry.  But I say, give me a totally  complete list and I will call you tomorrow and I will apologize personally.   All right.  But every day between now and November, we must work together  to elect more lawmakers who share our values, cherish our heritage, and  proudly stand for life.  And that is a great group of people I introduced.   I can tell you that.  We're also glad to be joined by a beloved member of  my administration, a true fighter for faith and family, and your 2018  distinguished leader, Kellyanne Conway.  Kellyanne.  What a job --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Sorry.  The president of course speaking introduction  luminaries there at the gala and we will dip back in if there is some  breaking news or he stumbles upon something that you need to hear about it  because you got it right here, baby.  There have been some major twists in  President Trump's scheduled meeting with Kim Jong-un.  The president saying  he no longer likes the North Korean dictator's attitude and casting doubt  that the meeting will happen at all.  Watch this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If it doesn't happen, maybe it will happen later.  Maybe it will  happen at a different time.  But we will see.  But we are talking.  The  meeting is scheduled as you know on June 12th in Singapore.  And whether or  not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon, but we're talking right now. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Talking may not be good enough.  We're being told Kim Jong-un  may have second thoughts about giving up all of his nuclear weapons.  The  president today said the dictator would be making a huge mistake by walking  away from this all-important table.  And just yesterday, Vice President  Pence told our own Martha MacCallum that if he keeps his nukes, the  situation could end really, really badly.  Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It would be a great  mistake for Kim Jong-un to think he could play Donald Trump.  The truth is  that President Trump has made it clear that this administration will not  tolerate the regime in North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and ballistic  missiles that threaten our people, that threaten the United States of  America , that threaten our allies in the region. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The vice president went on to say that North Korea will end up  like Libya if it doesn't make a deal.  And we all remember how that ended.   The country was destroyed.  Muammar Gaddafi was murdered in the street by  rebels.  Wow.  So will Kim Jong-un play ball or is the meeting and the  possible Nobel Prize out the window?  With me now Fox Business Reporter  Edward Lawrence with all the details.  Edward. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kennedy, this  is the first time that we're hearing the president actually say that the  meeting may not go forward on June 12th.  However, the State Department is  saying that they are working towards that date and only that date. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  I do have a real sense that  he would -- he would find American investment, American technology,  American know how of real value to his people.  If we get this right and we  get the denuclearization right, America wouldn't be quite capable of  delivering them with lots of things that would make life better for the  North Korean people. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  And President Trump saying that he personally guarantees the  safety of Kim Jong-un at the meeting in Singapore.  He president going on  to say that he recognizes that fact that Kim Jong-un would be the person to  lead his people into the future.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I would say that we are looking certainly right now at two Koreas,  two very successful Koreas.  You're going to have a very, very successful  North Korea and you're going to have a very successful and you already do,  South Korea. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now, all of this is predicated on denuclearization.  And right  now, there's a group of journalists from the United States, from China,  Russia, and the United Kingdom that are expected to witness the North  Koreans actually taking down, demolishing one of their nuclear sites.  Now,  whether in the area has delayed that trip.  It is expected to happen again  today or tomorrow their time, Kennedy. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, same thing.  Edward, thank you so much.  All right.  So  Kim -- can Kim Jong-un be trusted to keep his word?  And is China throwing  a monkey wrench into the work?  That question answers itself.  It certainly  is fuzz bud.  Just let me bring in former CIA operative Mike Baker, also  the President of Diligence LLC.  Welcome back to the show, Mike. </p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC:  Thank you very much, Kennedy.  Thank  you.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely.  The president says that Kim Jong-un's attitude  needs an adjustment since his most of recent chat with President Xi  Jinping.  What do you think about China's meddling in a situation they're  not necessarily a part of? </p><p>BAKER:  Well, in that you just -- that last part of your sentence is  important to note.  What China wants to insure is that they're relevant in  these conversations.  And they made that fairly clear over the past couple  of months.  But, look, nobody is surprised by sort of the posturing that's  taking place on both sides leading into this.  This is an historic  potentially defining moment.  Even if the summit occurs and nothing happens  after that and we can't get through the lengthy negotiations to get some  type of deal signed, just getting to this point almost being at the table  is an historic moment given how many years we've spent kicking the can down  the road with a fairly feckless foreign policy towards North Korea.  So I  think that the administration has been pretty clear in stating that they  understand this could be problematic and saying they're going to walk away  from the table.  It is interesting to note that aside from the fact you  can't swing a dead cat without hitting a North Korea expert these days.   It's also interesting to know that you got members of the resistance and  some members of the media who seemed almost hoping for this thing to fall  apart.  And if you find yourself rooting against peace on the peninsula  because you don't like President Trump, then you might want to rethink your  priorities. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I absolutely agree with you about that.  And I think there is  a time and a place for resistance.  I think there are certainly instances  where you have to hold the president accountable for the things the he says  and does.  But here I think, you know, this is an area where we have to be  as supportive as possible because a peaceful ending to this situation is  critical.  It's paramount.  Now, what's interesting and something that you  have pointed out is obviously there are issues with the Iran deal.  And you  have noted that part of the issue is because President Obama was so  impatient, and he was so dead set on landing that deal that he really  compromise our position there.  So would you caution this president against  doing the same thing with North Korea? </p><p>BAKER:  Right.  And, again, they've been very been clear in saying over the  past many weeks that they'd be willing to get up from the table and walk  away.  But what they have to be careful about is as you get closer and  closer to that potential meeting on the 12th of June, you have to be  careful that you feel so invested in this now, and you -- you're so keen to  get this going.  But you have to step back, take a breath, and understand  that, as you said, the previous administration, the Obama administration,  you know, they had their knickers in such a twist over the desire to get a  deal, any deal, that they were willing to overlook the problems with the  deal and they were willing to accept all the requests and concessions and  demands that the Iranian regime put into that deal.  And so, you know, and  again, with anything that takes place in this world of weapons agreements  whether you're talking about conventional weapons, nuclear weapons,  biological or chemical weapons really at the end of the day what matters  more than anything else is verification. </p><p>Trust but verify.  If you can't verify and the Iranian example is a good  one because it was in the deal.  We were not allowed to inspect military  sites.  So, yes, were they complying as people who were supporting that the  deal say?  Well, they were complying with it.  Yes, we got -- they were  complying with what was written in the deal.  But we had no verification  capability for any of their military sites.  And frankly, that's like  saying you're a serial killer.  You allow the police to come into your home  and search it, but you can't go in the basement and look around.  So we get  to be really careful and if we do get to that hard difficult point where  we're actually trying to pen a deal.  If we can't get verification locked  down with this, we didn't have it with the Syrian chemical issue.  We  didn't have it in the past on occasion with the Russians --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  -- trust Russia because they said they got rid of all Syria's  chemical weapons.  And he also said that we're fine in Iran because he read  the deal, and it's super solid, and they have no desire to manufacture any  fissile material or use those in drills to make big --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BAKER:  That was their investment.  They were so -- they were so keen as  you pointed out.  So keen to get that deal, so we have to be careful.  The  Trump administration has to be able to say, no, we're not going to sit down  if what appears to be as the North Koreas are making demands and  concessions that we can't accept, don't even sit at the table, and much  less walk away.  Just don't sit down at that point.  Everybody understands  this is an incredibly complex issue between us, North Korea, South Korea,  China, Japan, you know, but this is -- again, it's worth pursuing and as  you pointed out, everybody regardless of your political position should be  willing to root for peace on the peninsula or an effort to get there. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Pretend the U.S. is actually in the World Cup, it's like that.   Everyone wants team USA to win.  Mike Baker, thank you so much. </p><p>BAKER:  What -- the World Cup is what?  That's soccer? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  All right.  That's enough.  All right.  Dear, come on.  Let it  go.  Come on, man.  It's a beautiful game and you're a lovely person, so  thanks again.  Today, former President Jimmy -- oh, Jimmy Carter said he  thinks the president would deserve the Nobel Prize if he manages -- that's  a big if.  He's really qualifying this.  To get the North Koreans to give  up their nukes, but is the President Trump really thinking about canceling  the meeting or is possible that he's just being a showman and amping up the  drama?  Let me go to my military grade party pane tonight, she's an editor  at Townhall.com and a Fox News Contributor, Katie Pavlich is here.  He is a  spokesperson at Young Voices and host of the podcast Beltway Banthas, it's  Stephen Kent, and he is the host of \"YOUR WELCOME\", that's a podcast and  author of the book, Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim  Jong-il, he's got a license too, Michael Malice is back.  Our resident  actual North Korea expert. </p><p>MICHAEL MALICE, HOST, YOUR WELCOME SHOW:  I'm no Mike Baker. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Come on, man --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MALICE:  -- with a dead cat apparently. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I don't think he was talking about you. </p><p>MALICE:  That's true. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to read you Jimmy Carter's quote because I think -- I  want to -- I want to get your feeling on this.  He's talking about if  they're under constant belief that the United States wants to attack them  meaning North Korea even using nuclear weapons and that we are destroying  their economy and they know that they're starving to death primarily  because the United States withholds food aid for instance, just giving them  surplus food that we can never use.  I can understand how they feel. </p><p>MALICE:  Well, let me give you a little bit of background about Jimmy  Carter and North Korea.  He went there in 1994 and tried to broker a deal  with the great leader Kim Il-sung.  And five years ago today I posted a  quote from North Korean propaganda about their meeting and this is what  they said Jimmy Carter said, \"President Kim Il-sung is a person in whom  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, those popular  three presidents of the United States early in its history are put  together.\"  So that actually did not happen.  But the point is, North Korea  withheld food from getting to its citizenry in the '90s because Kim Jong-il  specifically said, if we allow the U.N. to feed the population, the  government will be superfluous.  So that's absolutely not true that they  would be willing to accept food. </p><p>And if they did accept food, they would claim it's coming from the leader,  so it's false in that regard.  It's absolutely true that they think we're  going to invade at any minute because you see people all over the news  right now blatantly saying John Bolton had a -- entry in the Wall Street  Journal that even South Korea is against it.  We have the unilateral right  to strike if they develop nuclear capabilities.  And when President Bush  said the axis of evil is Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.  This is clearly a  kill list of the three countries he wants to take out.  So they are right  to be afraid.  And again, if most people in this country don't trust  themselves to disarm and give up their guns and trust the federal  government, why would the North Korean government thinking differently? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And they have gotten so many resources over the years that  they could have used to feed their people.  I mean you don't build a multi- billion dollar nuclear weapons program unless you have money. </p><p>MALICE:  And lastly, the have something called Sung Bun and the used food  is a mechanism to control, so that the more loyal you are to the  government, the more likely you are to receive food. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And we're going to talk about that same thing happening in  Venezuela.  But I want to get back here because we've heard a lot about the  Libyan model and it was something that John Bolton said in regards to  denuclearizing North Korea, you know, which is essentially can be by force  with a very sad ending for the leader of either Libya or North Korea.  It  wasn't just something that John Bolton said offhandedly months ago in an  interview.  This is now something that Vice President Pence has legitimized  by using the same term.  So do you think that we are on a march to war if  in fact the meeting doesn't take place? </p><p>STEPHEN KENT, HOST, BELTWAY BANTHAS PODCAST:  I don't think we're on a  march to war.  But I'm stunned that Mike Pence then echo that comment from  John Bolton because that seemed incredibly ill-advice.  They need to keep  that comment and John Bolton off television for the next three weeks if  they're going to make this meeting happen.  He instills this sense of  distrust with the North Korean regime.  And Michael is absolutely right  when he mentioned, you know, like trying to step away from their guns being  their WMD's.  Like -- they're like the cultists in Waco, like you cannot  threaten them in this way.  Their weapons are the only thing that make them  feel secure, so this march towards total denuclearization or else is not  going to work in this case.  We need to be a little bit more gentle here. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  You know, I was talking to Gordon Chang a few weeks ago and he  said they still have a conventional military which is actually a bigger  practical threat to the region and it's much easier for them to go ahead  and bomb South Korea.  They don't -- they don't have to use nukes in order  to inflict a lot of damage.  So even if you take their nuclear program  away, they still have the ability to defend themselves. </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  That's always been the  concern that they'll use artillery power against Seoul, South Korea which  is right there across the border. This conversation you just had goes back  to why this has never worked out and why very administration has had a  failure when it comes to reining in North Korea's program.  They are so far  apart and although in the last couple of months we've seen things come  together on the surface.  When it comes to principles what the North  Koreans are willing to do which is not giving up their nuclear arms, the  negotiation now is about what denuclearization actually means and what the  United States requires which is complete denuclearization of the peninsula.   And the of course, there's China which is playing a role and saying, we  can't ask North Korea to completely give up their nukes.  However, we think  that they should be limited in their capacity.  And by the way, we don't  want any of the fallout when it comes to the regime -- </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  No.  China wants control and they want North Korea to be  dependent and they also want to have as much influence as possible on the  Korean Peninsula.  My question is, does South Korea -- with South Korea and  we're running out of time, so this has to beautiful quick answer.  Would  South Korea rather work with the United States in resolving this situation? </p><p>PAVLICH:  I think ultimately, yes.  I mean the United States is an ally.   We're doing military excises.  The United States has repeatedly said we are  not taking military -- legal military exercises off the table in exchange  for denuclearization of North Korea.  But again, the gap here is very wide  and it feels like we're back to the beginning of why this hasn't work out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's where we five seconds. </p><p>PAVLICH:  Katie gets it perfectly. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Oh, very good, Michael Malice for taking the baton and looking  very classily.  The panel return a little bit later because how could they  not.  Plus, the plot thickens in the White House.  Republican lawmakers now  calling for a second special counsel to investigate the possibility the  feds had politically motivated spies in the Trump campaign.  And now the  president has weighed in.  I'll tell you what  he said.  Chris Stirewalt  joins me next for reaction. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  We got news alert now.  We just learned that the business  partner of President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen has  agreed to cooperate with the government as part of a plea deal.  Evgeny  Friedman, I know I'm not saying that right.  Is the note -- no.  Michael  Malice is shaking his head seriously.  He's got a whiplash.  He's a Russian  immigrant known as the taxi king.  Legal expert say this puts greater  pressure on Cohen to cooperate with the Mueller probe, but the president  says the real issue with the alleged spying on his campaign during the  election.  Watch. </p><p>TRUMP:  A lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign.  If they  had spies in my campaign, that would be a disgrace to this country.  That  would be one of the biggest insults that anyone has ever seen and it would  be very illegal aside from everything else.  It would make probably every  political event ever look like small potatoes. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Small potatoes?  Delicious though.  Michael Cohen cooperating  with the government would certainly be no picnic for the president.  But is  he right to say the election spying is the biggest concern here.  Joining  me now Fox News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt back in action.  Welcome  back. </p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Indeed.  All right.  So let's talk about this.  Spies in my  campaign, is that the biggest issue of all if that is in fact true? </p><p>STIREWALT:  The biggest issue in political history the president says --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Maybe ever. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Maybe ever which they're saying something.  I mean the fall of  Roman stuff was a pretty big deal.  Look, the president says that there  were spies, and this is a good narrative for him.  This helps him with his  base to talk about him as the real victim and the deep state, and it was  really Obama and Clinton, and he's the victim here.  He's not the  perpetuator.  But instead, he's the victim.  And it -- and especially  during a midterm where he desperately wants not to lose the house because  that would create a whole new set of pressures on him in terms of  investigations and conceivably impeachment that he wants to keep  Republicans with him and a good way to do that is to say that he's not the  offender here, that the system -- that he is the victim of the system. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I truly believe that he believes he is not the offender.  He  believes he has done nothing wrong.  And he's just, you know, as a  negotiator does, if something doesn't succeed the first time you go about  it from different angles.  But is there something to this story?  Is it  possible that there were politically motivated operatives who were reaching  out to people of on the Trump campaign getting information to give back to  the FBI? </p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, if they can put cheese in the can and have it spray out  on a cracker that was anything --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  What a great invention. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Anything is possible.  But I don't know.  I mean I cover  politics.  But I do know this that there is an inspector general's report  that is in process about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's  mishandling of state secrets.  We're waiting for that in just the next  coming days.  And then hot on the heels of that one from the inspector  general from the Department of Justice, Mr. Horowitz, is a report on the --  an investigation of the investigation into the Russian meddling and Trump's  campaign, and that rashmitas.  So I'm going to wait and find out, just like  I'm going to wait and find out what Mueller actually has as opposed to all  of these chatter dancing that people are doing around this stuff.  I don't  know.  So I'm just going to wait until I find that. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I mean if there was a coordinated effort between James Clapper  and John Brennan and James Comey, you know, if that's not a politicized  trifecta, I don't know from my politicized trifecta, and I have a menagerie  of them in a green room.</p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, look, if that was so and they conspired together against  Donald Trump, well, that would be very bad.  But we don't know that.  We  don't have that evidence just like we don't have evidence that the  president colluded with Russia.  We just have -- the best I can do at this  point especially since we now have hopes that much of this will be  concluded by the end of the summer.  All I can do as a political forecaster  is say, we'll have enough information to know how this is going to affect  the midterms, how are Republicans going to respond to this.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And I think the deployment of these types of informant is not  only possible.  I think it is plausible given the amount of -- the  capability of these various organizations whether it's the NSA, or CIA, or  FBI, or DEA spy on Americans.  They have the tools.  It would not surprise  me if there are people who would abuse that power for their own benefit.   And I hope that's not the case.  I hope we live in a country where that  kind of power is checked.  So far Congress keeps codifying it and that is  also terrifying.  Chris Stirewalt, thank you so much. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Bottom line and every day of the week young man.  Very good. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Quite so. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes.  Coming up, Venezuela, the hell hole where a month's  salary can't even buy a cup of coffee.  People are so hungry they resorted  to eating zoo animals.  They just re-elected their president with nearly 70  percent of the vote.  Do you smell something fishy like a rotting zebra  carcass?  More examples of socialism destroying society in the monologue  next.  Stay here. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Crappy socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro was elected to  another six-year term in Venezuela.  Yes.  And the equally corrupted  authoritarian Turkish president campaigned for him, so they could share in  the farcical fun.  Leaders like Maduro, Erdogan, and Putin hate freedom  because it gives filthy peasants too much they empower over their own  lives.  They liquidate government holdings to enrich themselves in their  select cronies, and they steal from poor people who live horrible short  lives before they die in squalor.  It is no surprise these liberty loathers  create an access of a-holes.  They need to sow discord in the world's most  powerful economy because a truly free market disrupts their tyrannical  buggery -- signaling widespread discontent.  President Trump has signed an  executive order that bans U.S. citizens from snapping up Venezuelan  bargains from the state fire sale.  When people try to profit off this  desperation, they are further imprisoning the poorest among them who cannot  leave the country.  There has been a mass exodus of doctors, nurses,  teachers, engineers, and anyone else who has the means to escape the  tightening news of cruel socialism.  Anyone who can get out has fled, while  those trapped there are enduring inflation that's already at nearly 14,000  percent.  Plus, soaring malnutrition infant and maternal mortality rates  that are also going up and are being undertreated at vacant hospitals.  All  fraudulent elections should be condemned, including those in Turkey and  Russia.  And we need to be doubly mindful not to indulge amateur socialist  in this country.  Because even though a Bernie Sanders presidency is a  joke, the consequences of diet communism are deadly serious.  And that's  the memo.  </p><p>Oh, hi, great to see me.  That was swift.  How long Nicolas Maduro possibly  hang on to power as people are starving, his economy is ruined, the murder  rate is one of the highest in the world, and all indicators suggest things  are only going to get worse.  So, what can we do to fix this failed  socialist experiment before it turns into another Somalia?  The party panel  is back: Katie Pavlich, Stephen Kent, and Michael Malice.  Katie, I don't  think this is the worst-case-scenario.  I don't think this is a black swan  country undergoing some bad luck.  I think this is the natural ultimate end  of socialism and communism.  What do you think?</p><p>PAVLICH:  People argue, you know, this isn't real socialism or this isn't  real communism.  No, this is what it is.  In 1999, Venezuela decide to go  from more of a free market system to a socialist country to spend more  money on welfare.  This is exactly what we've seen as a result of that.   Now, Maduro is out there this week, on video in this bizarre way -- waving  to crowds that don't exist who applaud him on his re-election by 70  percent.  The United States has condemned the election results.  And the  question is, where do we go from here?  Not only in Venezuela but as the  United States because there are American interests there and there are  foreign policy implications of the regime collapsing.  The Venezuelans are  fleeing in large numbers.  As you mentioned in your monologue that most of  important people in the country who are, you know, doctors, nurses are  leaving.  But regular people are getting out because they are so desperate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Giving on buses in getting out of the country.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Liberals, socialist Utopia that is now existing in Venezuela as a  result of these principles, not a mistake.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Malice?</p><p>MALICE:  What I would like to see happen because there's only so much we  can do in Venezuela.  Every politician who was a segregationist racist had  to disavow, have to turn their backs, and had to be publicly humiliated,  had to be (INAUDIBLE) for decades.  So why are Michael Moore, and Bernie  Sanders, and Jeremy Corbin in the U.K., all of the people who said  Venezuela is a great thing, a great experiment, why do they not run on the  public square and thrown tomatoes at where they go?  You have children  bleeding to death on hospital beds, you have people starving.  Again, they  shoot into crowds when people try to protest.  To have anyone who's in  politics for this, not take responsibility for it, and still begin a  microphone, I think, is disgraceful.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And it's only getting worse,  and worse, and worse.  It's actually getting exponentially worse as  inflation rises, and the poorest people, they are the ones who can't afford  to feed their kids.  They never had to treat malnutrition five years ago.   And now that condition has gone up 100 folds in hospitals that we have no  doctors.  So, what do we do?  Do we do anything as the United States?  </p><p>KENT:  Well, there's again, limited tools in our tool kit to deal with this  situation.  We're not going to invade Venezuela.  We shouldn't.  And  sanctions are something that we have to be delicate with as well, because  we want to target the elite in that country who are abusing and starving  their people without then, actually, hurting the people who live in that  country and are not able to leave.  We are mentioning that doctors and  everyone who are able to flee.  You know, the oil industry runs basically  the only leftover economy that's there, but it only benefits the wealthy.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's absolutely right.  And that's what they did.  I  mean, it is a state-run industry.  They've got so much oil, which was  great, and they were profitable when oil prices were high.  But when they  tanked -- </p><p>MALICE:  This is atlas shrugged comes to life.  This is exactly the  (INAUDIBLE).  Take out excessive business having the government running,  and then how long it takes for people to be --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And you know, when atlas shrugged, that's when the people are  holding up the economy, they leave.  They're exhausted.</p><p>MALICE:  And if the poor and the weak were the first to suffer.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's absolutely right and suffer the longest.  Well, back  here at home, I mean, we're really suffering, right?  Because House Speaker  Paul Ryan is facing renewed pressure to step down from his perch before his  term ends.  The administration maybe nudging the effort along.  White House  Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, reportedly said he has spoken with House  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about ousting Ryan, adding: \"Wouldn't it be  great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut  up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election.  That's a  really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do  it.\"  Now, Mulvaney says he's supportive of the speaker.  And McCarthy said  he's never even talked to Mulvaney about it.  So, should House Republicans  plan a mutiny, Katie?  </p><p>MALICE:  We always hear word of a mutiny whenever there's any kind of  speakers raised.  Jim Jordan, other than the hundred conservatives that  came out and sign the letters saying they want him to run for speaker.   Paul Ryan will likely out his term as speaker of the house.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He's not going to get pushed out of the way?</p><p>PAVLICH:  You know, I don't know.  I mean, the thing is, as they say in  Washington, D.C.: if you want a friend, get a dog.  And although, Kevin  McCarthy and Paul Ryan have been very close for the last couple of years,  not only just in leadership as Paul Ryan came out through the ranks in the  House, from the Ways and Means Committee.  I doubt that McCarthy is going  to actually push Paul Ryan out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  They want Jim to working at job.</p><p>KENT:  No, money talks.  Paul Ryan brought in 11.9 million in the first  quarter of the Republican.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's why Nancy Pelosi is still around.  </p><p>KENT:  So, yes, put up or shut up.  Everybody else who wants that job.   They're not going to move him out as long as they need to raise money for  these mid-term elections which are going to be contentious.  I also would  like to see Paul Ryan finish out this job because we need, we need him to  finish and have a legitimate open-run election.  Kevin McCarthy cannot be  nominated for this.  Nobody really wants him in the Republican --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Is there a benefit to chaos?  </p><p>MALICE:  Look at the last Republican speaker.  You have ambassador of the  Vatican's wife, you have this lobster who's selling marijuana.  Dennis  Hastert, we can't even discuss on air.  And now, we have the guy who Mitt  Romney made his beta.  So, this is quite a cast of characters.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He is his Robin.</p><p>MALICE:  Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, he really is.  I love Paul Rhino.  I love the term Paul  Rhino.  I think Paul Ryan has completely turned his back on his principles.  </p><p>MALICE:  But in 2012, Romney needed to play the base, and he chose Ryan.   And that's how far the Republican Party has gone to the right, but even  Ryan is regardless of the left --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, Ryan and a slap on the base.  You know, I want to thank  you all for being here, because you are good friends, you are allies of  freedom, and you are delightful people.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Thank you for having us.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Freedoms and my feels.  Michael, Stephen, and Katie Pavlich,  thank you all.  Coming up, Cops say Amazon's new facial recognition  technology is helping them identify suspects in crime.  But the privacy  police are sounding alarm bells.  Emily Compagno joins me with the details.   Hi, Emily!  She's coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The future is now.  And I don't know if I like it.  Amazon has  some fancy new facial recognition technology and they're selling it to  police departments for $6.00 a month.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well,  a lot.  Which is why the ACLU is asking the tech giant to stop marketing  the tool to law enforcement agencies -- fearing it could be used to invade  your privacy.  Amazon respond to the ACLU's request with a statement that  read in quote: \"Amazon requires the customers comply with the law and be  responsible when they use Amazon Web Service (AWS).  When we find that AWS  services are being abused by a customer, we suspend that customer's right  to use our services.\"  Now, I would never add the cape for government  regulation to fix a problem like this, but should we be concerned about our  civil liberties and privacy when a tech giant like amazon combines with  government?  Let me ask former Criminal Defense Attorney and Legal Analyst,  Emily Compagno, she is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.  Emily,  welcome back to the show.  </p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND LEGAL ANALYST:  So, let's  discuss this.  What is the down side to selling facial recognition  technology on the cheap to law enforcement?  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  ACLU and others are arguing, look, there's a high  capacity for abuse here.  So, they argue this isn't akin to just an  extension of photography.  They say, this is akin to walking through mass  protests and asking for identification for every single person there.  They  argue this can be used to follow immigrants by ICE, this can be used to  identify any random person on a street corner.  So, they kind of have the  same arguments that they have for all existing surveillance programs, which  is where is the limit, right?  And they argue that, although it's not  different from other facial recognition program.  Here, they site that what  is problematic is Amazon's aggressive marketing to law enforcement agencies  and the fact that the reach is so prolific.  So, that's what they're  arguing here.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And that's one of things that has always concerned me, whether  it's Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other social media platform.  You  know, these big tech companies getting in bed with the government, whether  it's military or law enforcement, the consequences can be dire.  They're  not always dire.  We want our law enforcement agencies to have tools and  have technology so they can keep us safe.  The problem is when these things  malfunction.  My iPhone X recognizes my face about half the time, and it's  not because I'm a supermodel but a lot of people say that.  It's because  this technology isn't perfect.  And you know, I don't trust that the facial  recognition software wouldn't recognize the wrong person.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  Which is part of the argument and, you know, on the  other side, law enforcement agencies are arguing: look, you know, we're not  there yet.  It's important to us that the community understands what it's  being used for just as crucially as what it's not.  And they site the fact  that, you know, this has been used for surveillance footage matching from  burglaries, from what's picked up from CCTV.  They argue this has been used  to find abducted children or missing children in amusement parks.  It was  even used actually this weekend at the royal wedding of now duke and  duchess of Sussex for what royals had attended, right?  Sky News used.  So,  it's important that they feel the community that they --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to know the difference between David Beckham and Serena  Williams.  Because there were some people on other networks who didn't  really know the difference.  And that's a wonderful private application of  that tool essentially for entertainment.  I don't want to be arrested for a  crime that Kate Upton has committed because we look so similar.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes, and I do want to point out, though, that there's a bit of  hyperbole I see here in terms of the narrative that these free speech firms  and companies are pushing forward.  And here's one in particular, they cite  that this can now be used at airports which is a public place, they argue.   We're now in this climate of protesting and robust participation.  They  claim that there could be a chilling factor, but I want to point out that  airports for example are not public places for purposes of free speech.   It's been long held at the first, second, and fourth amendment are actually  restricted there.  So, in terms of the conversation surrounding this, to me  it's important that the narrative isn't subjects to that kind of hyperbolic  quality, because to me, it just increases the chasm between law enforcement  and what they're trying to do, and then lawful protected right to privacy  that we have without kind of muddying the water.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely, understand.  And I think there is so much more to  discuss and address here.  I really appreciate your perspective.  Thank you  so much, Emily.  Great to talk to you again. </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  \"TOPICAL STORM\" is next.  It's a good one.  Stay here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The NYPD is looking for a group of gunmen who robbed a  Walgreen's pharmacy while wearing clown masks.  Witnesses say, there could  be as many as 15 of them.  They were last seen fleeing one tiny car.  Be on  the lookout for a many, because this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\" </p><p>Topic number one.  We begin tonight in Houston, Texas, where everybody  knows that if you're going to drive on the highway, you're going to need  plenty of horse power.  Look at this.  Oh, mercy!  The Belmont state aren't  for another three weeks but this fellow is already getting in a good  workout.  In any other state, the sight of horse on a highway might have  caused a 12-car pile-up.  But in (INAUDIBLE) they're like, it's probably  going out for more beer.  Anything a couple of cars high beams so, they  could pass.  Now, fortunately some good Samaritans were able to steer it  off the road, and police have since returned though, of course, to its  owner but not before issuing a ticket for using the carpooling without a  passenger.  Rules are rules, pal.  Get a (INAUDIBLE) next time.</p><p>Topic number two.  There it is.  A Florida City issued a zombie alert to  its citizens.  And we'd like to think it was an accident, but you never  know in Florida.  A storm caused a blackout on Sunday that led the  residents of Lake Worth, Florida, to get an alert that read: Zombie --  power outage and zombie alert for the residents of Lake Worth and Terminus.   There are now far less than 7300 customers involved due to extreme zombie  activity.  Now, Terminus is a fictitious town from the hit T.V. show \"The  Walking Dead\".  Its inclusion in the message led cops to believe it was a  prank.  Great police, fellows.  Well done.  It's unlikely someone confused  the state of Florida and \"The Walking Dead\" because the two couldn't be  more different.  One is an apocalyptic wasteland of human oddities, and the  other is a T.V. show.  That's right.  </p><p>Topic number three.  If you're a cop in the city of Cleveland, long enough  you'll see everything -- except for a Browns Super Bowl championship.  But  these cops, they don't need a championship to party.  The officers  responded to this block party to cut the noise, but they wound up cutting a  rug because not even a horse can resist it.  It's so addictive.  We have a  staffer named Courtney who does it all the time in the office.  She's very  special.  The video of the dancing cops has taken off across the country,  and so has their other police horse.  There I go again on my own.  Turns  out he'll be shuffling papers behind his desk because he's been suspended  for not tying up his horse.  </p><p>Topic number four.  There it is.  Thanks to Bunk Breaker for this one.   Women's soccer legend, Brandy Chastain, was inducted into the Bay Area hall  of fame this week.  But the person who may brand these flack, must drink a  few brandies before going into the studio.  The women's soccer legend  became famous for whipping off her jersey after hitting the winning penalty  kick in the 1999 World Cup.  She was an international (INAUDIBLE), but  apparently, she's now a trucker named Gill, who likes beef jerky and lot  lizard.  The Internet says she looks like Gary Busey, so either way slice  it, she's looks like someone who is little nuts.  She looks like she's a  transitioning Elizabeth Warren without glasses.  You can't make this up,  unlike Elizabeth's heritage.  The hall of fame has since apologized and  offered to make a new plaque.  And perhaps, not surprisingly Brandi, has  graciously accepted their offer.  We reached out to the plaque maker for  comment but he was at the vet with his seeing eye dog.  </p><p>Topic number five.  Perhaps no athlete is more disappointed than Tonya  Harding who did not win the top prize in last night's \"Dancing with the  Stars\" finale.  Someday, historians will remember this as the end of the  #kneetoo movement.  Figure skater Adam Rippon took home the win, and Lord  knows he'll need the prize money, because competing against Tonya Harding  can cost you an arm and a leg.  If you don't believe me, ask Nancy  Kerrigan.  NFL Star, Josh Norman, with the other runner-up in the first  all-athlete season.  It was also the first season of all famous people.   Usually, that show is a who's who of people that make you say, who?  Her  T.V. comeback may be over, but don't feel bad for Tonya because she just  joined a new dance troupe who are very familiar with her work.  Is he going  to get the police?  (INAUDIBLE) felony.  If only she had this much rhythm  in last night's finale.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Thank you so much for watching this show tonight.

Let's take  a live look and listen to President Trump.  He's speaking at the Susan B.  Anthony List 11th Annual Campaign for Life Gala at the National Building  Museum in Washington, D.C.  Let's go. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I watch him all the time.  I  don't know him well, but I'll get to know him.  John Rutherford, where is  he, John?  Central casting.  Great job, John.  He's always defending me.   Actually, most of you are always defending me and that's OK.  And from my  neck of the woods, Claudia Kenny.  Thank you, Claudia.  Thank you.  And for  those many that I have left out, I'm sorry.  But I say, give me a totally  complete list and I will call you tomorrow and I will apologize personally.   All right.  But every day between now and November, we must work together  to elect more lawmakers who share our values, cherish our heritage, and  proudly stand for life.  And that is a great group of people I introduced.   I can tell you that.  We're also glad to be joined by a beloved member of  my administration, a true fighter for faith and family, and your 2018  distinguished leader, Kellyanne Conway.  Kellyanne.  What a job --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Sorry.  The president of course speaking introduction  luminaries there at the gala and we will dip back in if there is some  breaking news or he stumbles upon something that you need to hear about it  because you got it right here, baby.  There have been some major twists in  President Trump's scheduled meeting with Kim Jong-un.  The president saying  he no longer likes the North Korean dictator's attitude and casting doubt  that the meeting will happen at all.  Watch this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If it doesn't happen, maybe it will happen later.  Maybe it will  happen at a different time.  But we will see.  But we are talking.  The  meeting is scheduled as you know on June 12th in Singapore.  And whether or  not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon, but we're talking right now. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Talking may not be good enough.  We're being told Kim Jong-un  may have second thoughts about giving up all of his nuclear weapons.  The  president today said the dictator would be making a huge mistake by walking  away from this all-important table.  And just yesterday, Vice President  Pence told our own Martha MacCallum that if he keeps his nukes, the  situation could end really, really badly.  Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It would be a great  mistake for Kim Jong-un to think he could play Donald Trump.  The truth is  that President Trump has made it clear that this administration will not  tolerate the regime in North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and ballistic  missiles that threaten our people, that threaten the United States of  America , that threaten our allies in the region. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The vice president went on to say that North Korea will end up  like Libya if it doesn't make a deal.  And we all remember how that ended.   The country was destroyed.  Muammar Gaddafi was murdered in the street by  rebels.  Wow.  So will Kim Jong-un play ball or is the meeting and the  possible Nobel Prize out the window?  With me now Fox Business Reporter  Edward Lawrence with all the details.  Edward. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kennedy, this  is the first time that we're hearing the president actually say that the  meeting may not go forward on June 12th.  However, the State Department is  saying that they are working towards that date and only that date. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  I do have a real sense that  he would -- he would find American investment, American technology,  American know how of real value to his people.  If we get this right and we  get the denuclearization right, America wouldn't be quite capable of  delivering them with lots of things that would make life better for the  North Korean people. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  And President Trump saying that he personally guarantees the  safety of Kim Jong-un at the meeting in Singapore.  He president going on  to say that he recognizes that fact that Kim Jong-un would be the person to  lead his people into the future.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I would say that we are looking certainly right now at two Koreas,  two very successful Koreas.  You're going to have a very, very successful  North Korea and you're going to have a very successful and you already do,  South Korea. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now, all of this is predicated on denuclearization.  And right  now, there's a group of journalists from the United States, from China,  Russia, and the United Kingdom that are expected to witness the North  Koreans actually taking down, demolishing one of their nuclear sites.  Now,  whether in the area has delayed that trip.  It is expected to happen again  today or tomorrow their time, Kennedy. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, same thing.  Edward, thank you so much.  All right.  So  Kim -- can Kim Jong-un be trusted to keep his word?  And is China throwing  a monkey wrench into the work?  That question answers itself.  It certainly  is fuzz bud.  Just let me bring in former CIA operative Mike Baker, also  the President of Diligence LLC.  Welcome back to the show, Mike. </p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC:  Thank you very much, Kennedy.  Thank  you.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely.  The president says that Kim Jong-un's attitude  needs an adjustment since his most of recent chat with President Xi  Jinping.  What do you think about China's meddling in a situation they're  not necessarily a part of? </p><p>BAKER:  Well, in that you just -- that last part of your sentence is  important to note.  What China wants to insure is that they're relevant in  these conversations.  And they made that fairly clear over the past couple  of months.  But, look, nobody is surprised by sort of the posturing that's  taking place on both sides leading into this.  This is an historic  potentially defining moment.  Even if the summit occurs and nothing happens  after that and we can't get through the lengthy negotiations to get some  type of deal signed, just getting to this point almost being at the table  is an historic moment given how many years we've spent kicking the can down  the road with a fairly feckless foreign policy towards North Korea.  So I  think that the administration has been pretty clear in stating that they  understand this could be problematic and saying they're going to walk away  from the table.  It is interesting to note that aside from the fact you  can't swing a dead cat without hitting a North Korea expert these days.   It's also interesting to know that you got members of the resistance and  some members of the media who seemed almost hoping for this thing to fall  apart.  And if you find yourself rooting against peace on the peninsula  because you don't like President Trump, then you might want to rethink your  priorities. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I absolutely agree with you about that.  And I think there is  a time and a place for resistance.  I think there are certainly instances  where you have to hold the president accountable for the things the he says  and does.  But here I think, you know, this is an area where we have to be  as supportive as possible because a peaceful ending to this situation is  critical.  It's paramount.  Now, what's interesting and something that you  have pointed out is obviously there are issues with the Iran deal.  And you  have noted that part of the issue is because President Obama was so  impatient, and he was so dead set on landing that deal that he really  compromise our position there.  So would you caution this president against  doing the same thing with North Korea? </p><p>BAKER:  Right.  And, again, they've been very been clear in saying over the  past many weeks that they'd be willing to get up from the table and walk  away.  But what they have to be careful about is as you get closer and  closer to that potential meeting on the 12th of June, you have to be  careful that you feel so invested in this now, and you -- you're so keen to  get this going.  But you have to step back, take a breath, and understand  that, as you said, the previous administration, the Obama administration,  you know, they had their knickers in such a twist over the desire to get a  deal, any deal, that they were willing to overlook the problems with the  deal and they were willing to accept all the requests and concessions and  demands that the Iranian regime put into that deal.  And so, you know, and  again, with anything that takes place in this world of weapons agreements  whether you're talking about conventional weapons, nuclear weapons,  biological or chemical weapons really at the end of the day what matters  more than anything else is verification. </p><p>Trust but verify.  If you can't verify and the Iranian example is a good  one because it was in the deal.  We were not allowed to inspect military  sites.  So, yes, were they complying as people who were supporting that the  deal say?  Well, they were complying with it.  Yes, we got -- they were  complying with what was written in the deal.  But we had no verification  capability for any of their military sites.  And frankly, that's like  saying you're a serial killer.  You allow the police to come into your home  and search it, but you can't go in the basement and look around.  So we get  to be really careful and if we do get to that hard difficult point where  we're actually trying to pen a deal.  If we can't get verification locked  down with this, we didn't have it with the Syrian chemical issue.  We  didn't have it in the past on occasion with the Russians --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  -- trust Russia because they said they got rid of all Syria's  chemical weapons.  And he also said that we're fine in Iran because he read  the deal, and it's super solid, and they have no desire to manufacture any  fissile material or use those in drills to make big --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BAKER:  That was their investment.  They were so -- they were so keen as  you pointed out.  So keen to get that deal, so we have to be careful.  The  Trump administration has to be able to say, no, we're not going to sit down  if what appears to be as the North Koreas are making demands and  concessions that we can't accept, don't even sit at the table, and much  less walk away.  Just don't sit down at that point.  Everybody understands  this is an incredibly complex issue between us, North Korea, South Korea,  China, Japan, you know, but this is -- again, it's worth pursuing and as  you pointed out, everybody regardless of your political position should be  willing to root for peace on the peninsula or an effort to get there. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Pretend the U.S. is actually in the World Cup, it's like that.   Everyone wants team USA to win.  Mike Baker, thank you so much. </p><p>BAKER:  What -- the World Cup is what?  That's soccer? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  All right.  That's enough.  All right.  Dear, come on.  Let it  go.  Come on, man.  It's a beautiful game and you're a lovely person, so  thanks again.  Today, former President Jimmy -- oh, Jimmy Carter said he  thinks the president would deserve the Nobel Prize if he manages -- that's  a big if.  He's really qualifying this.  To get the North Koreans to give  up their nukes, but is the President Trump really thinking about canceling  the meeting or is possible that he's just being a showman and amping up the  drama?  Let me go to my military grade party pane tonight, she's an editor  at Townhall.com and a Fox News Contributor, Katie Pavlich is here.  He is a  spokesperson at Young Voices and host of the podcast Beltway Banthas, it's  Stephen Kent, and he is the host of \"YOUR WELCOME\", that's a podcast and  author of the book, Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim  Jong-il, he's got a license too, Michael Malice is back.  Our resident  actual North Korea expert. </p><p>MICHAEL MALICE, HOST, YOUR WELCOME SHOW:  I'm no Mike Baker. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Come on, man --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MALICE:  -- with a dead cat apparently. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I don't think he was talking about you. </p><p>MALICE:  That's true. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to read you Jimmy Carter's quote because I think -- I  want to -- I want to get your feeling on this.  He's talking about if  they're under constant belief that the United States wants to attack them  meaning North Korea even using nuclear weapons and that we are destroying  their economy and they know that they're starving to death primarily  because the United States withholds food aid for instance, just giving them  surplus food that we can never use.  I can understand how they feel. </p><p>MALICE:  Well, let me give you a little bit of background about Jimmy  Carter and North Korea.  He went there in 1994 and tried to broker a deal  with the great leader Kim Il-sung.  And five years ago today I posted a  quote from North Korean propaganda about their meeting and this is what  they said Jimmy Carter said, \"President Kim Il-sung is a person in whom  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, those popular  three presidents of the United States early in its history are put  together.\"  So that actually did not happen.  But the point is, North Korea  withheld food from getting to its citizenry in the '90s because Kim Jong-il  specifically said, if we allow the U.N. to feed the population, the  government will be superfluous.  So that's absolutely not true that they  would be willing to accept food. </p><p>And if they did accept food, they would claim it's coming from the leader,  so it's false in that regard.  It's absolutely true that they think we're  going to invade at any minute because you see people all over the news  right now blatantly saying John Bolton had a -- entry in the Wall Street  Journal that even South Korea is against it.  We have the unilateral right  to strike if they develop nuclear capabilities.  And when President Bush  said the axis of evil is Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.  This is clearly a  kill list of the three countries he wants to take out.  So they are right  to be afraid.  And again, if most people in this country don't trust  themselves to disarm and give up their guns and trust the federal  government, why would the North Korean government thinking differently? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And they have gotten so many resources over the years that  they could have used to feed their people.  I mean you don't build a multi- billion dollar nuclear weapons program unless you have money. </p><p>MALICE:  And lastly, the have something called Sung Bun and the used food  is a mechanism to control, so that the more loyal you are to the  government, the more likely you are to receive food. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And we're going to talk about that same thing happening in  Venezuela.  But I want to get back here because we've heard a lot about the  Libyan model and it was something that John Bolton said in regards to  denuclearizing North Korea, you know, which is essentially can be by force  with a very sad ending for the leader of either Libya or North Korea.  It  wasn't just something that John Bolton said offhandedly months ago in an  interview.  This is now something that Vice President Pence has legitimized  by using the same term.  So do you think that we are on a march to war if  in fact the meeting doesn't take place? </p><p>STEPHEN KENT, HOST, BELTWAY BANTHAS PODCAST:  I don't think we're on a  march to war.  But I'm stunned that Mike Pence then echo that comment from  John Bolton because that seemed incredibly ill-advice.  They need to keep  that comment and John Bolton off television for the next three weeks if  they're going to make this meeting happen.  He instills this sense of  distrust with the North Korean regime.  And Michael is absolutely right  when he mentioned, you know, like trying to step away from their guns being  their WMD's.  Like -- they're like the cultists in Waco, like you cannot  threaten them in this way.  Their weapons are the only thing that make them  feel secure, so this march towards total denuclearization or else is not  going to work in this case.  We need to be a little bit more gentle here. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  You know, I was talking to Gordon Chang a few weeks ago and he  said they still have a conventional military which is actually a bigger  practical threat to the region and it's much easier for them to go ahead  and bomb South Korea.  They don't -- they don't have to use nukes in order  to inflict a lot of damage.  So even if you take their nuclear program  away, they still have the ability to defend themselves. </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  That's always been the  concern that they'll use artillery power against Seoul, South Korea which  is right there across the border. This conversation you just had goes back  to why this has never worked out and why very administration has had a  failure when it comes to reining in North Korea's program.  They are so far  apart and although in the last couple of months we've seen things come  together on the surface.  When it comes to principles what the North  Koreans are willing to do which is not giving up their nuclear arms, the  negotiation now is about what denuclearization actually means and what the  United States requires which is complete denuclearization of the peninsula.   And the of course, there's China which is playing a role and saying, we  can't ask North Korea to completely give up their nukes.  However, we think  that they should be limited in their capacity.  And by the way, we don't  want any of the fallout when it comes to the regime -- </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  No.  China wants control and they want North Korea to be  dependent and they also want to have as much influence as possible on the  Korean Peninsula.  My question is, does South Korea -- with South Korea and  we're running out of time, so this has to beautiful quick answer.  Would  South Korea rather work with the United States in resolving this situation? </p><p>PAVLICH:  I think ultimately, yes.  I mean the United States is an ally.   We're doing military excises.  The United States has repeatedly said we are  not taking military -- legal military exercises off the table in exchange  for denuclearization of North Korea.  But again, the gap here is very wide  and it feels like we're back to the beginning of why this hasn't work out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's where we five seconds. </p><p>PAVLICH:  Katie gets it perfectly. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Oh, very good, Michael Malice for taking the baton and looking  very classily.  The panel return a little bit later because how could they  not.  Plus, the plot thickens in the White House.  Republican lawmakers now  calling for a second special counsel to investigate the possibility the  feds had politically motivated spies in the Trump campaign.  And now the  president has weighed in.  I'll tell you what  he said.  Chris Stirewalt  joins me next for reaction. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  We got news alert now.  We just learned that the business  partner of President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen has  agreed to cooperate with the government as part of a plea deal.  Evgeny  Friedman, I know I'm not saying that right.  Is the note -- no.  Michael  Malice is shaking his head seriously.  He's got a whiplash.  He's a Russian  immigrant known as the taxi king.  Legal expert say this puts greater  pressure on Cohen to cooperate with the Mueller probe, but the president  says the real issue with the alleged spying on his campaign during the  election.  Watch. </p><p>TRUMP:  A lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign.  If they  had spies in my campaign, that would be a disgrace to this country.  That  would be one of the biggest insults that anyone has ever seen and it would  be very illegal aside from everything else.  It would make probably every  political event ever look like small potatoes. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Small potatoes?  Delicious though.  Michael Cohen cooperating  with the government would certainly be no picnic for the president.  But is  he right to say the election spying is the biggest concern here.  Joining  me now Fox News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt back in action.  Welcome  back. </p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Indeed.  All right.  So let's talk about this.  Spies in my  campaign, is that the biggest issue of all if that is in fact true? </p><p>STIREWALT:  The biggest issue in political history the president says --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Maybe ever. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Maybe ever which they're saying something.  I mean the fall of  Roman stuff was a pretty big deal.  Look, the president says that there  were spies, and this is a good narrative for him.  This helps him with his  base to talk about him as the real victim and the deep state, and it was  really Obama and Clinton, and he's the victim here.  He's not the  perpetuator.  But instead, he's the victim.  And it -- and especially  during a midterm where he desperately wants not to lose the house because  that would create a whole new set of pressures on him in terms of  investigations and conceivably impeachment that he wants to keep  Republicans with him and a good way to do that is to say that he's not the  offender here, that the system -- that he is the victim of the system. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I truly believe that he believes he is not the offender.  He  believes he has done nothing wrong.  And he's just, you know, as a  negotiator does, if something doesn't succeed the first time you go about  it from different angles.  But is there something to this story?  Is it  possible that there were politically motivated operatives who were reaching  out to people of on the Trump campaign getting information to give back to  the FBI? </p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, if they can put cheese in the can and have it spray out  on a cracker that was anything --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  What a great invention. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Anything is possible.  But I don't know.  I mean I cover  politics.  But I do know this that there is an inspector general's report  that is in process about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's  mishandling of state secrets.  We're waiting for that in just the next  coming days.  And then hot on the heels of that one from the inspector  general from the Department of Justice, Mr. Horowitz, is a report on the --  an investigation of the investigation into the Russian meddling and Trump's  campaign, and that rashmitas.  So I'm going to wait and find out, just like  I'm going to wait and find out what Mueller actually has as opposed to all  of these chatter dancing that people are doing around this stuff.  I don't  know.  So I'm just going to wait until I find that. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I mean if there was a coordinated effort between James Clapper  and John Brennan and James Comey, you know, if that's not a politicized  trifecta, I don't know from my politicized trifecta, and I have a menagerie  of them in a green room.</p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, look, if that was so and they conspired together against  Donald Trump, well, that would be very bad.  But we don't know that.  We  don't have that evidence just like we don't have evidence that the  president colluded with Russia.  We just have -- the best I can do at this  point especially since we now have hopes that much of this will be  concluded by the end of the summer.  All I can do as a political forecaster  is say, we'll have enough information to know how this is going to affect  the midterms, how are Republicans going to respond to this.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And I think the deployment of these types of informant is not  only possible.  I think it is plausible given the amount of -- the  capability of these various organizations whether it's the NSA, or CIA, or  FBI, or DEA spy on Americans.  They have the tools.  It would not surprise  me if there are people who would abuse that power for their own benefit.   And I hope that's not the case.  I hope we live in a country where that  kind of power is checked.  So far Congress keeps codifying it and that is  also terrifying.  Chris Stirewalt, thank you so much. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Bottom line and every day of the week young man.  Very good. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Quite so. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes.  Coming up, Venezuela, the hell hole where a month's  salary can't even buy a cup of coffee.  People are so hungry they resorted  to eating zoo animals.  They just re-elected their president with nearly 70  percent of the vote.  Do you smell something fishy like a rotting zebra  carcass?  More examples of socialism destroying society in the monologue  next.  Stay here. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Crappy socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro was elected to  another six-year term in Venezuela.  Yes.  And the equally corrupted  authoritarian Turkish president campaigned for him, so they could share in  the farcical fun.  Leaders like Maduro, Erdogan, and Putin hate freedom  because it gives filthy peasants too much they empower over their own  lives.  They liquidate government holdings to enrich themselves in their  select cronies, and they steal from poor people who live horrible short  lives before they die in squalor.  It is no surprise these liberty loathers  create an access of a-holes.  They need to sow discord in the world's most  powerful economy because a truly free market disrupts their tyrannical  buggery -- signaling widespread discontent.  President Trump has signed an  executive order that bans U.S. citizens from snapping up Venezuelan  bargains from the state fire sale.  When people try to profit off this  desperation, they are further imprisoning the poorest among them who cannot  leave the country.  There has been a mass exodus of doctors, nurses,  teachers, engineers, and anyone else who has the means to escape the  tightening news of cruel socialism.  Anyone who can get out has fled, while  those trapped there are enduring inflation that's already at nearly 14,000  percent.  Plus, soaring malnutrition infant and maternal mortality rates  that are also going up and are being undertreated at vacant hospitals.  All  fraudulent elections should be condemned, including those in Turkey and  Russia.  And we need to be doubly mindful not to indulge amateur socialist  in this country.  Because even though a Bernie Sanders presidency is a  joke, the consequences of diet communism are deadly serious.  And that's  the memo.  </p><p>Oh, hi, great to see me.  That was swift.  How long Nicolas Maduro possibly  hang on to power as people are starving, his economy is ruined, the murder  rate is one of the highest in the world, and all indicators suggest things  are only going to get worse.  So, what can we do to fix this failed  socialist experiment before it turns into another Somalia?  The party panel  is back: Katie Pavlich, Stephen Kent, and Michael Malice.  Katie, I don't  think this is the worst-case-scenario.  I don't think this is a black swan  country undergoing some bad luck.  I think this is the natural ultimate end  of socialism and communism.  What do you think?</p><p>PAVLICH:  People argue, you know, this isn't real socialism or this isn't  real communism.  No, this is what it is.  In 1999, Venezuela decide to go  from more of a free market system to a socialist country to spend more  money on welfare.  This is exactly what we've seen as a result of that.   Now, Maduro is out there this week, on video in this bizarre way -- waving  to crowds that don't exist who applaud him on his re-election by 70  percent.  The United States has condemned the election results.  And the  question is, where do we go from here?  Not only in Venezuela but as the  United States because there are American interests there and there are  foreign policy implications of the regime collapsing.  The Venezuelans are  fleeing in large numbers.  As you mentioned in your monologue that most of  important people in the country who are, you know, doctors, nurses are  leaving.  But regular people are getting out because they are so desperate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Giving on buses in getting out of the country.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Liberals, socialist Utopia that is now existing in Venezuela as a  result of these principles, not a mistake.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Malice?</p><p>MALICE:  What I would like to see happen because there's only so much we  can do in Venezuela.  Every politician who was a segregationist racist had  to disavow, have to turn their backs, and had to be publicly humiliated,  had to be (INAUDIBLE) for decades.  So why are Michael Moore, and Bernie  Sanders, and Jeremy Corbin in the U.K., all of the people who said  Venezuela is a great thing, a great experiment, why do they not run on the  public square and thrown tomatoes at where they go?  You have children  bleeding to death on hospital beds, you have people starving.  Again, they  shoot into crowds when people try to protest.  To have anyone who's in  politics for this, not take responsibility for it, and still begin a  microphone, I think, is disgraceful.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And it's only getting worse,  and worse, and worse.  It's actually getting exponentially worse as  inflation rises, and the poorest people, they are the ones who can't afford  to feed their kids.  They never had to treat malnutrition five years ago.   And now that condition has gone up 100 folds in hospitals that we have no  doctors.  So, what do we do?  Do we do anything as the United States?  </p><p>KENT:  Well, there's again, limited tools in our tool kit to deal with this  situation.  We're not going to invade Venezuela.  We shouldn't.  And  sanctions are something that we have to be delicate with as well, because  we want to target the elite in that country who are abusing and starving  their people without then, actually, hurting the people who live in that  country and are not able to leave.  We are mentioning that doctors and  everyone who are able to flee.  You know, the oil industry runs basically  the only leftover economy that's there, but it only benefits the wealthy.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's absolutely right.  And that's what they did.  I  mean, it is a state-run industry.  They've got so much oil, which was  great, and they were profitable when oil prices were high.  But when they  tanked -- </p><p>MALICE:  This is atlas shrugged comes to life.  This is exactly the  (INAUDIBLE).  Take out excessive business having the government running,  and then how long it takes for people to be --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And you know, when atlas shrugged, that's when the people are  holding up the economy, they leave.  They're exhausted.</p><p>MALICE:  And if the poor and the weak were the first to suffer.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's absolutely right and suffer the longest.  Well, back  here at home, I mean, we're really suffering, right?  Because House Speaker  Paul Ryan is facing renewed pressure to step down from his perch before his  term ends.  The administration maybe nudging the effort along.  White House  Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, reportedly said he has spoken with House  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about ousting Ryan, adding: \"Wouldn't it be  great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut  up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election.  That's a  really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do  it.\"  Now, Mulvaney says he's supportive of the speaker.  And McCarthy said  he's never even talked to Mulvaney about it.  So, should House Republicans  plan a mutiny, Katie?  </p><p>MALICE:  We always hear word of a mutiny whenever there's any kind of  speakers raised.  Jim Jordan, other than the hundred conservatives that  came out and sign the letters saying they want him to run for speaker.   Paul Ryan will likely out his term as speaker of the house.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He's not going to get pushed out of the way?</p><p>PAVLICH:  You know, I don't know.  I mean, the thing is, as they say in  Washington, D.C.: if you want a friend, get a dog.  And although, Kevin  McCarthy and Paul Ryan have been very close for the last couple of years,  not only just in leadership as Paul Ryan came out through the ranks in the  House, from the Ways and Means Committee.  I doubt that McCarthy is going  to actually push Paul Ryan out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  They want Jim to working at job.</p><p>KENT:  No, money talks.  Paul Ryan brought in 11.9 million in the first  quarter of the Republican.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's why Nancy Pelosi is still around.  </p><p>KENT:  So, yes, put up or shut up.  Everybody else who wants that job.   They're not going to move him out as long as they need to raise money for  these mid-term elections which are going to be contentious.  I also would  like to see Paul Ryan finish out this job because we need, we need him to  finish and have a legitimate open-run election.  Kevin McCarthy cannot be  nominated for this.  Nobody really wants him in the Republican --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Is there a benefit to chaos?  </p><p>MALICE:  Look at the last Republican speaker.  You have ambassador of the  Vatican's wife, you have this lobster who's selling marijuana.  Dennis  Hastert, we can't even discuss on air.  And now, we have the guy who Mitt  Romney made his beta.  So, this is quite a cast of characters.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He is his Robin.</p><p>MALICE:  Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, he really is.  I love Paul Rhino.  I love the term Paul  Rhino.  I think Paul Ryan has completely turned his back on his principles.  </p><p>MALICE:  But in 2012, Romney needed to play the base, and he chose Ryan.   And that's how far the Republican Party has gone to the right, but even  Ryan is regardless of the left --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, Ryan and a slap on the base.  You know, I want to thank  you all for being here, because you are good friends, you are allies of  freedom, and you are delightful people.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Thank you for having us.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Freedoms and my feels.  Michael, Stephen, and Katie Pavlich,  thank you all.  Coming up, Cops say Amazon's new facial recognition  technology is helping them identify suspects in crime.  But the privacy  police are sounding alarm bells.  Emily Compagno joins me with the details.   Hi, Emily!  She's coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The future is now.  And I don't know if I like it.  Amazon has  some fancy new facial recognition technology and they're selling it to  police departments for $6.00 a month.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well,  a lot.  Which is why the ACLU is asking the tech giant to stop marketing  the tool to law enforcement agencies -- fearing it could be used to invade  your privacy.  Amazon respond to the ACLU's request with a statement that  read in quote: \"Amazon requires the customers comply with the law and be  responsible when they use Amazon Web Service (AWS).  When we find that AWS  services are being abused by a customer, we suspend that customer's right  to use our services.\"  Now, I would never add the cape for government  regulation to fix a problem like this, but should we be concerned about our  civil liberties and privacy when a tech giant like amazon combines with  government?  Let me ask former Criminal Defense Attorney and Legal Analyst,  Emily Compagno, she is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.  Emily,  welcome back to the show.  </p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND LEGAL ANALYST:  So, let's  discuss this.  What is the down side to selling facial recognition  technology on the cheap to law enforcement?  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  ACLU and others are arguing, look, there's a high  capacity for abuse here.  So, they argue this isn't akin to just an  extension of photography.  They say, this is akin to walking through mass  protests and asking for identification for every single person there.  They  argue this can be used to follow immigrants by ICE, this can be used to  identify any random person on a street corner.  So, they kind of have the  same arguments that they have for all existing surveillance programs, which  is where is the limit, right?  And they argue that, although it's not  different from other facial recognition program.  Here, they site that what  is problematic is Amazon's aggressive marketing to law enforcement agencies  and the fact that the reach is so prolific.  So, that's what they're  arguing here.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And that's one of things that has always concerned me, whether  it's Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other social media platform.  You  know, these big tech companies getting in bed with the government, whether  it's military or law enforcement, the consequences can be dire.  They're  not always dire.  We want our law enforcement agencies to have tools and  have technology so they can keep us safe.  The problem is when these things  malfunction.  My iPhone X recognizes my face about half the time, and it's  not because I'm a supermodel but a lot of people say that.  It's because  this technology isn't perfect.  And you know, I don't trust that the facial  recognition software wouldn't recognize the wrong person.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  Which is part of the argument and, you know, on the  other side, law enforcement agencies are arguing: look, you know, we're not  there yet.  It's important to us that the community understands what it's  being used for just as crucially as what it's not.  And they site the fact  that, you know, this has been used for surveillance footage matching from  burglaries, from what's picked up from CCTV.  They argue this has been used  to find abducted children or missing children in amusement parks.  It was  even used actually this weekend at the royal wedding of now duke and  duchess of Sussex for what royals had attended, right?  Sky News used.  So,  it's important that they feel the community that they --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to know the difference between David Beckham and Serena  Williams.  Because there were some people on other networks who didn't  really know the difference.  And that's a wonderful private application of  that tool essentially for entertainment.  I don't want to be arrested for a  crime that Kate Upton has committed because we look so similar.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes, and I do want to point out, though, that there's a bit of  hyperbole I see here in terms of the narrative that these free speech firms  and companies are pushing forward.  And here's one in particular, they cite  that this can now be used at airports which is a public place, they argue.   We're now in this climate of protesting and robust participation.  They  claim that there could be a chilling factor, but I want to point out that  airports for example are not public places for purposes of free speech.   It's been long held at the first, second, and fourth amendment are actually  restricted there.  So, in terms of the conversation surrounding this, to me  it's important that the narrative isn't subjects to that kind of hyperbolic  quality, because to me, it just increases the chasm between law enforcement  and what they're trying to do, and then lawful protected right to privacy  that we have without kind of muddying the water.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely, understand.  And I think there is so much more to  discuss and address here.  I really appreciate your perspective.  Thank you  so much, Emily.  Great to talk to you again. </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  \"TOPICAL STORM\" is next.  It's a good one.  Stay here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The NYPD is looking for a group of gunmen who robbed a  Walgreen's pharmacy while wearing clown masks.  Witnesses say, there could  be as many as 15 of them.  They were last seen fleeing one tiny car.  Be on  the lookout for a many, because this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\" </p><p>Topic number one.  We begin tonight in Houston, Texas, where everybody  knows that if you're going to drive on the highway, you're going to need  plenty of horse power.  Look at this.  Oh, mercy!  The Belmont state aren't  for another three weeks but this fellow is already getting in a good  workout.  In any other state, the sight of horse on a highway might have  caused a 12-car pile-up.  But in (INAUDIBLE) they're like, it's probably  going out for more beer.  Anything a couple of cars high beams so, they  could pass.  Now, fortunately some good Samaritans were able to steer it  off the road, and police have since returned though, of course, to its  owner but not before issuing a ticket for using the carpooling without a  passenger.  Rules are rules, pal.  Get a (INAUDIBLE) next time.</p><p>Topic number two.  There it is.  A Florida City issued a zombie alert to  its citizens.  And we'd like to think it was an accident, but you never  know in Florida.  A storm caused a blackout on Sunday that led the  residents of Lake Worth, Florida, to get an alert that read: Zombie --  power outage and zombie alert for the residents of Lake Worth and Terminus.   There are now far less than 7300 customers involved due to extreme zombie  activity.  Now, Terminus is a fictitious town from the hit T.V. show \"The  Walking Dead\".  Its inclusion in the message led cops to believe it was a  prank.  Great police, fellows.  Well done.  It's unlikely someone confused  the state of Florida and \"The Walking Dead\" because the two couldn't be  more different.  One is an apocalyptic wasteland of human oddities, and the  other is a T.V. show.  That's right.  </p><p>Topic number three.  If you're a cop in the city of Cleveland, long enough  you'll see everything -- except for a Browns Super Bowl championship.  But  these cops, they don't need a championship to party.  The officers  responded to this block party to cut the noise, but they wound up cutting a  rug because not even a horse can resist it.  It's so addictive.  We have a  staffer named Courtney who does it all the time in the office.  She's very  special.  The video of the dancing cops has taken off across the country,  and so has their other police horse.  There I go again on my own.  Turns  out he'll be shuffling papers behind his desk because he's been suspended  for not tying up his horse.  </p><p>Topic number four.  There it is.  Thanks to Bunk Breaker for this one.   Women's soccer legend, Brandy Chastain, was inducted into the Bay Area hall  of fame this week.  But the person who may brand these flack, must drink a  few brandies before going into the studio.  The women's soccer legend  became famous for whipping off her jersey after hitting the winning penalty  kick in the 1999 World Cup.  She was an international (INAUDIBLE), but  apparently, she's now a trucker named Gill, who likes beef jerky and lot  lizard.  The Internet says she looks like Gary Busey, so either way slice  it, she's looks like someone who is little nuts.  She looks like she's a  transitioning Elizabeth Warren without glasses.  You can't make this up,  unlike Elizabeth's heritage.  The hall of fame has since apologized and  offered to make a new plaque.  And perhaps, not surprisingly Brandi, has  graciously accepted their offer.  We reached out to the plaque maker for  comment but he was at the vet with his seeing eye dog.  </p><p>Topic number five.  Perhaps no athlete is more disappointed than Tonya  Harding who did not win the top prize in last night's \"Dancing with the  Stars\" finale.  Someday, historians will remember this as the end of the  #kneetoo movement.  Figure skater Adam Rippon took home the win, and Lord  knows he'll need the prize money, because competing against Tonya Harding  can cost you an arm and a leg.  If you don't believe me, ask Nancy  Kerrigan.  NFL Star, Josh Norman, with the other runner-up in the first  all-athlete season.  It was also the first season of all famous people.   Usually, that show is a who's who of people that make you say, who?  Her  T.V. comeback may be over, but don't feel bad for Tonya because she just  joined a new dance troupe who are very familiar with her work.  Is he going  to get the police?  (INAUDIBLE) felony.  If only she had this much rhythm  in last night's finale.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Thank you so much for watching this show tonight.

Let's take  a live look and listen to President Trump.  He's speaking at the Susan B.  Anthony List 11th Annual Campaign for Life Gala at the National Building  Museum in Washington, D.C.  Let's go. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I watch him all the time.  I  don't know him well, but I'll get to know him.  John Rutherford, where is  he, John?  Central casting.  Great job, John.  He's always defending me.   Actually, most of you are always defending me and that's OK.  And from my  neck of the woods, Claudia Kenny.  Thank you, Claudia.  Thank you.  And for  those many that I have left out, I'm sorry.  But I say, give me a totally  complete list and I will call you tomorrow and I will apologize personally.   All right.  But every day between now and November, we must work together  to elect more lawmakers who share our values, cherish our heritage, and  proudly stand for life.  And that is a great group of people I introduced.   I can tell you that.  We're also glad to be joined by a beloved member of  my administration, a true fighter for faith and family, and your 2018  distinguished leader, Kellyanne Conway.  Kellyanne.  What a job --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Sorry.  The president of course speaking introduction  luminaries there at the gala and we will dip back in if there is some  breaking news or he stumbles upon something that you need to hear about it  because you got it right here, baby.  There have been some major twists in  President Trump's scheduled meeting with Kim Jong-un.  The president saying  he no longer likes the North Korean dictator's attitude and casting doubt  that the meeting will happen at all.  Watch this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If it doesn't happen, maybe it will happen later.  Maybe it will  happen at a different time.  But we will see.  But we are talking.  The  meeting is scheduled as you know on June 12th in Singapore.  And whether or  not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon, but we're talking right now. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Talking may not be good enough.  We're being told Kim Jong-un  may have second thoughts about giving up all of his nuclear weapons.  The  president today said the dictator would be making a huge mistake by walking  away from this all-important table.  And just yesterday, Vice President  Pence told our own Martha MacCallum that if he keeps his nukes, the  situation could end really, really badly.  Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It would be a great  mistake for Kim Jong-un to think he could play Donald Trump.  The truth is  that President Trump has made it clear that this administration will not  tolerate the regime in North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and ballistic  missiles that threaten our people, that threaten the United States of  America , that threaten our allies in the region. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The vice president went on to say that North Korea will end up  like Libya if it doesn't make a deal.  And we all remember how that ended.   The country was destroyed.  Muammar Gaddafi was murdered in the street by  rebels.  Wow.  So will Kim Jong-un play ball or is the meeting and the  possible Nobel Prize out the window?  With me now Fox Business Reporter  Edward Lawrence with all the details.  Edward. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kennedy, this  is the first time that we're hearing the president actually say that the  meeting may not go forward on June 12th.  However, the State Department is  saying that they are working towards that date and only that date. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  I do have a real sense that  he would -- he would find American investment, American technology,  American know how of real value to his people.  If we get this right and we  get the denuclearization right, America wouldn't be quite capable of  delivering them with lots of things that would make life better for the  North Korean people. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  And President Trump saying that he personally guarantees the  safety of Kim Jong-un at the meeting in Singapore.  He president going on  to say that he recognizes that fact that Kim Jong-un would be the person to  lead his people into the future.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I would say that we are looking certainly right now at two Koreas,  two very successful Koreas.  You're going to have a very, very successful  North Korea and you're going to have a very successful and you already do,  South Korea. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now, all of this is predicated on denuclearization.  And right  now, there's a group of journalists from the United States, from China,  Russia, and the United Kingdom that are expected to witness the North  Koreans actually taking down, demolishing one of their nuclear sites.  Now,  whether in the area has delayed that trip.  It is expected to happen again  today or tomorrow their time, Kennedy. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, same thing.  Edward, thank you so much.  All right.  So  Kim -- can Kim Jong-un be trusted to keep his word?  And is China throwing  a monkey wrench into the work?  That question answers itself.  It certainly  is fuzz bud.  Just let me bring in former CIA operative Mike Baker, also  the President of Diligence LLC.  Welcome back to the show, Mike. </p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC:  Thank you very much, Kennedy.  Thank  you.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely.  The president says that Kim Jong-un's attitude  needs an adjustment since his most of recent chat with President Xi  Jinping.  What do you think about China's meddling in a situation they're  not necessarily a part of? </p><p>BAKER:  Well, in that you just -- that last part of your sentence is  important to note.  What China wants to insure is that they're relevant in  these conversations.  And they made that fairly clear over the past couple  of months.  But, look, nobody is surprised by sort of the posturing that's  taking place on both sides leading into this.  This is an historic  potentially defining moment.  Even if the summit occurs and nothing happens  after that and we can't get through the lengthy negotiations to get some  type of deal signed, just getting to this point almost being at the table  is an historic moment given how many years we've spent kicking the can down  the road with a fairly feckless foreign policy towards North Korea.  So I  think that the administration has been pretty clear in stating that they  understand this could be problematic and saying they're going to walk away  from the table.  It is interesting to note that aside from the fact you  can't swing a dead cat without hitting a North Korea expert these days.   It's also interesting to know that you got members of the resistance and  some members of the media who seemed almost hoping for this thing to fall  apart.  And if you find yourself rooting against peace on the peninsula  because you don't like President Trump, then you might want to rethink your  priorities. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I absolutely agree with you about that.  And I think there is  a time and a place for resistance.  I think there are certainly instances  where you have to hold the president accountable for the things the he says  and does.  But here I think, you know, this is an area where we have to be  as supportive as possible because a peaceful ending to this situation is  critical.  It's paramount.  Now, what's interesting and something that you  have pointed out is obviously there are issues with the Iran deal.  And you  have noted that part of the issue is because President Obama was so  impatient, and he was so dead set on landing that deal that he really  compromise our position there.  So would you caution this president against  doing the same thing with North Korea? </p><p>BAKER:  Right.  And, again, they've been very been clear in saying over the  past many weeks that they'd be willing to get up from the table and walk  away.  But what they have to be careful about is as you get closer and  closer to that potential meeting on the 12th of June, you have to be  careful that you feel so invested in this now, and you -- you're so keen to  get this going.  But you have to step back, take a breath, and understand  that, as you said, the previous administration, the Obama administration,  you know, they had their knickers in such a twist over the desire to get a  deal, any deal, that they were willing to overlook the problems with the  deal and they were willing to accept all the requests and concessions and  demands that the Iranian regime put into that deal.  And so, you know, and  again, with anything that takes place in this world of weapons agreements  whether you're talking about conventional weapons, nuclear weapons,  biological or chemical weapons really at the end of the day what matters  more than anything else is verification. </p><p>Trust but verify.  If you can't verify and the Iranian example is a good  one because it was in the deal.  We were not allowed to inspect military  sites.  So, yes, were they complying as people who were supporting that the  deal say?  Well, they were complying with it.  Yes, we got -- they were  complying with what was written in the deal.  But we had no verification  capability for any of their military sites.  And frankly, that's like  saying you're a serial killer.  You allow the police to come into your home  and search it, but you can't go in the basement and look around.  So we get  to be really careful and if we do get to that hard difficult point where  we're actually trying to pen a deal.  If we can't get verification locked  down with this, we didn't have it with the Syrian chemical issue.  We  didn't have it in the past on occasion with the Russians --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  -- trust Russia because they said they got rid of all Syria's  chemical weapons.  And he also said that we're fine in Iran because he read  the deal, and it's super solid, and they have no desire to manufacture any  fissile material or use those in drills to make big --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BAKER:  That was their investment.  They were so -- they were so keen as  you pointed out.  So keen to get that deal, so we have to be careful.  The  Trump administration has to be able to say, no, we're not going to sit down  if what appears to be as the North Koreas are making demands and  concessions that we can't accept, don't even sit at the table, and much  less walk away.  Just don't sit down at that point.  Everybody understands  this is an incredibly complex issue between us, North Korea, South Korea,  China, Japan, you know, but this is -- again, it's worth pursuing and as  you pointed out, everybody regardless of your political position should be  willing to root for peace on the peninsula or an effort to get there. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Pretend the U.S. is actually in the World Cup, it's like that.   Everyone wants team USA to win.  Mike Baker, thank you so much. </p><p>BAKER:  What -- the World Cup is what?  That's soccer? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  All right.  That's enough.  All right.  Dear, come on.  Let it  go.  Come on, man.  It's a beautiful game and you're a lovely person, so  thanks again.  Today, former President Jimmy -- oh, Jimmy Carter said he  thinks the president would deserve the Nobel Prize if he manages -- that's  a big if.  He's really qualifying this.  To get the North Koreans to give  up their nukes, but is the President Trump really thinking about canceling  the meeting or is possible that he's just being a showman and amping up the  drama?  Let me go to my military grade party pane tonight, she's an editor  at Townhall.com and a Fox News Contributor, Katie Pavlich is here.  He is a  spokesperson at Young Voices and host of the podcast Beltway Banthas, it's  Stephen Kent, and he is the host of \"YOUR WELCOME\", that's a podcast and  author of the book, Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim  Jong-il, he's got a license too, Michael Malice is back.  Our resident  actual North Korea expert. </p><p>MICHAEL MALICE, HOST, YOUR WELCOME SHOW:  I'm no Mike Baker. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Come on, man --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MALICE:  -- with a dead cat apparently. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I don't think he was talking about you. </p><p>MALICE:  That's true. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to read you Jimmy Carter's quote because I think -- I  want to -- I want to get your feeling on this.  He's talking about if  they're under constant belief that the United States wants to attack them  meaning North Korea even using nuclear weapons and that we are destroying  their economy and they know that they're starving to death primarily  because the United States withholds food aid for instance, just giving them  surplus food that we can never use.  I can understand how they feel. </p><p>MALICE:  Well, let me give you a little bit of background about Jimmy  Carter and North Korea.  He went there in 1994 and tried to broker a deal  with the great leader Kim Il-sung.  And five years ago today I posted a  quote from North Korean propaganda about their meeting and this is what  they said Jimmy Carter said, \"President Kim Il-sung is a person in whom  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, those popular  three presidents of the United States early in its history are put  together.\"  So that actually did not happen.  But the point is, North Korea  withheld food from getting to its citizenry in the '90s because Kim Jong-il  specifically said, if we allow the U.N. to feed the population, the  government will be superfluous.  So that's absolutely not true that they  would be willing to accept food. </p><p>And if they did accept food, they would claim it's coming from the leader,  so it's false in that regard.  It's absolutely true that they think we're  going to invade at any minute because you see people all over the news  right now blatantly saying John Bolton had a -- entry in the Wall Street  Journal that even South Korea is against it.  We have the unilateral right  to strike if they develop nuclear capabilities.  And when President Bush  said the axis of evil is Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.  This is clearly a  kill list of the three countries he wants to take out.  So they are right  to be afraid.  And again, if most people in this country don't trust  themselves to disarm and give up their guns and trust the federal  government, why would the North Korean government thinking differently? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And they have gotten so many resources over the years that  they could have used to feed their people.  I mean you don't build a multi- billion dollar nuclear weapons program unless you have money. </p><p>MALICE:  And lastly, the have something called Sung Bun and the used food  is a mechanism to control, so that the more loyal you are to the  government, the more likely you are to receive food. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And we're going to talk about that same thing happening in  Venezuela.  But I want to get back here because we've heard a lot about the  Libyan model and it was something that John Bolton said in regards to  denuclearizing North Korea, you know, which is essentially can be by force  with a very sad ending for the leader of either Libya or North Korea.  It  wasn't just something that John Bolton said offhandedly months ago in an  interview.  This is now something that Vice President Pence has legitimized  by using the same term.  So do you think that we are on a march to war if  in fact the meeting doesn't take place? </p><p>STEPHEN KENT, HOST, BELTWAY BANTHAS PODCAST:  I don't think we're on a  march to war.  But I'm stunned that Mike Pence then echo that comment from  John Bolton because that seemed incredibly ill-advice.  They need to keep  that comment and John Bolton off television for the next three weeks if  they're going to make this meeting happen.  He instills this sense of  distrust with the North Korean regime.  And Michael is absolutely right  when he mentioned, you know, like trying to step away from their guns being  their WMD's.  Like -- they're like the cultists in Waco, like you cannot  threaten them in this way.  Their weapons are the only thing that make them  feel secure, so this march towards total denuclearization or else is not  going to work in this case.  We need to be a little bit more gentle here. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  You know, I was talking to Gordon Chang a few weeks ago and he  said they still have a conventional military which is actually a bigger  practical threat to the region and it's much easier for them to go ahead  and bomb South Korea.  They don't -- they don't have to use nukes in order  to inflict a lot of damage.  So even if you take their nuclear program  away, they still have the ability to defend themselves. </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  That's always been the  concern that they'll use artillery power against Seoul, South Korea which  is right there across the border. This conversation you just had goes back  to why this has never worked out and why very administration has had a  failure when it comes to reining in North Korea's program.  They are so far  apart and although in the last couple of months we've seen things come  together on the surface.  When it comes to principles what the North  Koreans are willing to do which is not giving up their nuclear arms, the  negotiation now is about what denuclearization actually means and what the  United States requires which is complete denuclearization of the peninsula.   And the of course, there's China which is playing a role and saying, we  can't ask North Korea to completely give up their nukes.  However, we think  that they should be limited in their capacity.  And by the way, we don't  want any of the fallout when it comes to the regime -- </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  No.  China wants control and they want North Korea to be  dependent and they also want to have as much influence as possible on the  Korean Peninsula.  My question is, does South Korea -- with South Korea and  we're running out of time, so this has to beautiful quick answer.  Would  South Korea rather work with the United States in resolving this situation? </p><p>PAVLICH:  I think ultimately, yes.  I mean the United States is an ally.   We're doing military excises.  The United States has repeatedly said we are  not taking military -- legal military exercises off the table in exchange  for denuclearization of North Korea.  But again, the gap here is very wide  and it feels like we're back to the beginning of why this hasn't work out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's where we five seconds. </p><p>PAVLICH:  Katie gets it perfectly. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Oh, very good, Michael Malice for taking the baton and looking  very classily.  The panel return a little bit later because how could they  not.  Plus, the plot thickens in the White House.  Republican lawmakers now  calling for a second special counsel to investigate the possibility the  feds had politically motivated spies in the Trump campaign.  And now the  president has weighed in.  I'll tell you what  he said.  Chris Stirewalt  joins me next for reaction. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  We got news alert now.  We just learned that the business  partner of President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen has  agreed to cooperate with the government as part of a plea deal.  Evgeny  Friedman, I know I'm not saying that right.  Is the note -- no.  Michael  Malice is shaking his head seriously.  He's got a whiplash.  He's a Russian  immigrant known as the taxi king.  Legal expert say this puts greater  pressure on Cohen to cooperate with the Mueller probe, but the president  says the real issue with the alleged spying on his campaign during the  election.  Watch. </p><p>TRUMP:  A lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign.  If they  had spies in my campaign, that would be a disgrace to this country.  That  would be one of the biggest insults that anyone has ever seen and it would  be very illegal aside from everything else.  It would make probably every  political event ever look like small potatoes. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Small potatoes?  Delicious though.  Michael Cohen cooperating  with the government would certainly be no picnic for the president.  But is  he right to say the election spying is the biggest concern here.  Joining  me now Fox News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt back in action.  Welcome  back. </p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Indeed.  All right.  So let's talk about this.  Spies in my  campaign, is that the biggest issue of all if that is in fact true? </p><p>STIREWALT:  The biggest issue in political history the president says --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Maybe ever. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Maybe ever which they're saying something.  I mean the fall of  Roman stuff was a pretty big deal.  Look, the president says that there  were spies, and this is a good narrative for him.  This helps him with his  base to talk about him as the real victim and the deep state, and it was  really Obama and Clinton, and he's the victim here.  He's not the  perpetuator.  But instead, he's the victim.  And it -- and especially  during a midterm where he desperately wants not to lose the house because  that would create a whole new set of pressures on him in terms of  investigations and conceivably impeachment that he wants to keep  Republicans with him and a good way to do that is to say that he's not the  offender here, that the system -- that he is the victim of the system. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I truly believe that he believes he is not the offender.  He  believes he has done nothing wrong.  And he's just, you know, as a  negotiator does, if something doesn't succeed the first time you go about  it from different angles.  But is there something to this story?  Is it  possible that there were politically motivated operatives who were reaching  out to people of on the Trump campaign getting information to give back to  the FBI? </p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, if they can put cheese in the can and have it spray out  on a cracker that was anything --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  What a great invention. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Anything is possible.  But I don't know.  I mean I cover  politics.  But I do know this that there is an inspector general's report  that is in process about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's  mishandling of state secrets.  We're waiting for that in just the next  coming days.  And then hot on the heels of that one from the inspector  general from the Department of Justice, Mr. Horowitz, is a report on the --  an investigation of the investigation into the Russian meddling and Trump's  campaign, and that rashmitas.  So I'm going to wait and find out, just like  I'm going to wait and find out what Mueller actually has as opposed to all  of these chatter dancing that people are doing around this stuff.  I don't  know.  So I'm just going to wait until I find that. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I mean if there was a coordinated effort between James Clapper  and John Brennan and James Comey, you know, if that's not a politicized  trifecta, I don't know from my politicized trifecta, and I have a menagerie  of them in a green room.</p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, look, if that was so and they conspired together against  Donald Trump, well, that would be very bad.  But we don't know that.  We  don't have that evidence just like we don't have evidence that the  president colluded with Russia.  We just have -- the best I can do at this  point especially since we now have hopes that much of this will be  concluded by the end of the summer.  All I can do as a political forecaster  is say, we'll have enough information to know how this is going to affect  the midterms, how are Republicans going to respond to this.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And I think the deployment of these types of informant is not  only possible.  I think it is plausible given the amount of -- the  capability of these various organizations whether it's the NSA, or CIA, or  FBI, or DEA spy on Americans.  They have the tools.  It would not surprise  me if there are people who would abuse that power for their own benefit.   And I hope that's not the case.  I hope we live in a country where that  kind of power is checked.  So far Congress keeps codifying it and that is  also terrifying.  Chris Stirewalt, thank you so much. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Bottom line and every day of the week young man.  Very good. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Quite so. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes.  Coming up, Venezuela, the hell hole where a month's  salary can't even buy a cup of coffee.  People are so hungry they resorted  to eating zoo animals.  They just re-elected their president with nearly 70  percent of the vote.  Do you smell something fishy like a rotting zebra  carcass?  More examples of socialism destroying society in the monologue  next.  Stay here. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Crappy socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro was elected to  another six-year term in Venezuela.  Yes.  And the equally corrupted  authoritarian Turkish president campaigned for him, so they could share in  the farcical fun.  Leaders like Maduro, Erdogan, and Putin hate freedom  because it gives filthy peasants too much they empower over their own  lives.  They liquidate government holdings to enrich themselves in their  select cronies, and they steal from poor people who live horrible short  lives before they die in squalor.  It is no surprise these liberty loathers  create an access of a-holes.  They need to sow discord in the world's most  powerful economy because a truly free market disrupts their tyrannical  buggery -- signaling widespread discontent.  President Trump has signed an  executive order that bans U.S. citizens from snapping up Venezuelan  bargains from the state fire sale.  When people try to profit off this  desperation, they are further imprisoning the poorest among them who cannot  leave the country.  There has been a mass exodus of doctors, nurses,  teachers, engineers, and anyone else who has the means to escape the  tightening news of cruel socialism.  Anyone who can get out has fled, while  those trapped there are enduring inflation that's already at nearly 14,000  percent.  Plus, soaring malnutrition infant and maternal mortality rates  that are also going up and are being undertreated at vacant hospitals.  All  fraudulent elections should be condemned, including those in Turkey and  Russia.  And we need to be doubly mindful not to indulge amateur socialist  in this country.  Because even though a Bernie Sanders presidency is a  joke, the consequences of diet communism are deadly serious.  And that's  the memo.  </p><p>Oh, hi, great to see me.  That was swift.  How long Nicolas Maduro possibly  hang on to power as people are starving, his economy is ruined, the murder  rate is one of the highest in the world, and all indicators suggest things  are only going to get worse.  So, what can we do to fix this failed  socialist experiment before it turns into another Somalia?  The party panel  is back: Katie Pavlich, Stephen Kent, and Michael Malice.  Katie, I don't  think this is the worst-case-scenario.  I don't think this is a black swan  country undergoing some bad luck.  I think this is the natural ultimate end  of socialism and communism.  What do you think?</p><p>PAVLICH:  People argue, you know, this isn't real socialism or this isn't  real communism.  No, this is what it is.  In 1999, Venezuela decide to go  from more of a free market system to a socialist country to spend more  money on welfare.  This is exactly what we've seen as a result of that.   Now, Maduro is out there this week, on video in this bizarre way -- waving  to crowds that don't exist who applaud him on his re-election by 70  percent.  The United States has condemned the election results.  And the  question is, where do we go from here?  Not only in Venezuela but as the  United States because there are American interests there and there are  foreign policy implications of the regime collapsing.  The Venezuelans are  fleeing in large numbers.  As you mentioned in your monologue that most of  important people in the country who are, you know, doctors, nurses are  leaving.  But regular people are getting out because they are so desperate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Giving on buses in getting out of the country.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Liberals, socialist Utopia that is now existing in Venezuela as a  result of these principles, not a mistake.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Malice?</p><p>MALICE:  What I would like to see happen because there's only so much we  can do in Venezuela.  Every politician who was a segregationist racist had  to disavow, have to turn their backs, and had to be publicly humiliated,  had to be (INAUDIBLE) for decades.  So why are Michael Moore, and Bernie  Sanders, and Jeremy Corbin in the U.K., all of the people who said  Venezuela is a great thing, a great experiment, why do they not run on the  public square and thrown tomatoes at where they go?  You have children  bleeding to death on hospital beds, you have people starving.  Again, they  shoot into crowds when people try to protest.  To have anyone who's in  politics for this, not take responsibility for it, and still begin a  microphone, I think, is disgraceful.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And it's only getting worse,  and worse, and worse.  It's actually getting exponentially worse as  inflation rises, and the poorest people, they are the ones who can't afford  to feed their kids.  They never had to treat malnutrition five years ago.   And now that condition has gone up 100 folds in hospitals that we have no  doctors.  So, what do we do?  Do we do anything as the United States?  </p><p>KENT:  Well, there's again, limited tools in our tool kit to deal with this  situation.  We're not going to invade Venezuela.  We shouldn't.  And  sanctions are something that we have to be delicate with as well, because  we want to target the elite in that country who are abusing and starving  their people without then, actually, hurting the people who live in that  country and are not able to leave.  We are mentioning that doctors and  everyone who are able to flee.  You know, the oil industry runs basically  the only leftover economy that's there, but it only benefits the wealthy.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's absolutely right.  And that's what they did.  I  mean, it is a state-run industry.  They've got so much oil, which was  great, and they were profitable when oil prices were high.  But when they  tanked -- </p><p>MALICE:  This is atlas shrugged comes to life.  This is exactly the  (INAUDIBLE).  Take out excessive business having the government running,  and then how long it takes for people to be --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And you know, when atlas shrugged, that's when the people are  holding up the economy, they leave.  They're exhausted.</p><p>MALICE:  And if the poor and the weak were the first to suffer.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's absolutely right and suffer the longest.  Well, back  here at home, I mean, we're really suffering, right?  Because House Speaker  Paul Ryan is facing renewed pressure to step down from his perch before his  term ends.  The administration maybe nudging the effort along.  White House  Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, reportedly said he has spoken with House  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about ousting Ryan, adding: \"Wouldn't it be  great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut  up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election.  That's a  really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do  it.\"  Now, Mulvaney says he's supportive of the speaker.  And McCarthy said  he's never even talked to Mulvaney about it.  So, should House Republicans  plan a mutiny, Katie?  </p><p>MALICE:  We always hear word of a mutiny whenever there's any kind of  speakers raised.  Jim Jordan, other than the hundred conservatives that  came out and sign the letters saying they want him to run for speaker.   Paul Ryan will likely out his term as speaker of the house.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He's not going to get pushed out of the way?</p><p>PAVLICH:  You know, I don't know.  I mean, the thing is, as they say in  Washington, D.C.: if you want a friend, get a dog.  And although, Kevin  McCarthy and Paul Ryan have been very close for the last couple of years,  not only just in leadership as Paul Ryan came out through the ranks in the  House, from the Ways and Means Committee.  I doubt that McCarthy is going  to actually push Paul Ryan out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  They want Jim to working at job.</p><p>KENT:  No, money talks.  Paul Ryan brought in 11.9 million in the first  quarter of the Republican.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's why Nancy Pelosi is still around.  </p><p>KENT:  So, yes, put up or shut up.  Everybody else who wants that job.   They're not going to move him out as long as they need to raise money for  these mid-term elections which are going to be contentious.  I also would  like to see Paul Ryan finish out this job because we need, we need him to  finish and have a legitimate open-run election.  Kevin McCarthy cannot be  nominated for this.  Nobody really wants him in the Republican --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Is there a benefit to chaos?  </p><p>MALICE:  Look at the last Republican speaker.  You have ambassador of the  Vatican's wife, you have this lobster who's selling marijuana.  Dennis  Hastert, we can't even discuss on air.  And now, we have the guy who Mitt  Romney made his beta.  So, this is quite a cast of characters.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He is his Robin.</p><p>MALICE:  Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, he really is.  I love Paul Rhino.  I love the term Paul  Rhino.  I think Paul Ryan has completely turned his back on his principles.  </p><p>MALICE:  But in 2012, Romney needed to play the base, and he chose Ryan.   And that's how far the Republican Party has gone to the right, but even  Ryan is regardless of the left --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, Ryan and a slap on the base.  You know, I want to thank  you all for being here, because you are good friends, you are allies of  freedom, and you are delightful people.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Thank you for having us.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Freedoms and my feels.  Michael, Stephen, and Katie Pavlich,  thank you all.  Coming up, Cops say Amazon's new facial recognition  technology is helping them identify suspects in crime.  But the privacy  police are sounding alarm bells.  Emily Compagno joins me with the details.   Hi, Emily!  She's coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The future is now.  And I don't know if I like it.  Amazon has  some fancy new facial recognition technology and they're selling it to  police departments for $6.00 a month.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well,  a lot.  Which is why the ACLU is asking the tech giant to stop marketing  the tool to law enforcement agencies -- fearing it could be used to invade  your privacy.  Amazon respond to the ACLU's request with a statement that  read in quote: \"Amazon requires the customers comply with the law and be  responsible when they use Amazon Web Service (AWS).  When we find that AWS  services are being abused by a customer, we suspend that customer's right  to use our services.\"  Now, I would never add the cape for government  regulation to fix a problem like this, but should we be concerned about our  civil liberties and privacy when a tech giant like amazon combines with  government?  Let me ask former Criminal Defense Attorney and Legal Analyst,  Emily Compagno, she is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.  Emily,  welcome back to the show.  </p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND LEGAL ANALYST:  So, let's  discuss this.  What is the down side to selling facial recognition  technology on the cheap to law enforcement?  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  ACLU and others are arguing, look, there's a high  capacity for abuse here.  So, they argue this isn't akin to just an  extension of photography.  They say, this is akin to walking through mass  protests and asking for identification for every single person there.  They  argue this can be used to follow immigrants by ICE, this can be used to  identify any random person on a street corner.  So, they kind of have the  same arguments that they have for all existing surveillance programs, which  is where is the limit, right?  And they argue that, although it's not  different from other facial recognition program.  Here, they site that what  is problematic is Amazon's aggressive marketing to law enforcement agencies  and the fact that the reach is so prolific.  So, that's what they're  arguing here.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And that's one of things that has always concerned me, whether  it's Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other social media platform.  You  know, these big tech companies getting in bed with the government, whether  it's military or law enforcement, the consequences can be dire.  They're  not always dire.  We want our law enforcement agencies to have tools and  have technology so they can keep us safe.  The problem is when these things  malfunction.  My iPhone X recognizes my face about half the time, and it's  not because I'm a supermodel but a lot of people say that.  It's because  this technology isn't perfect.  And you know, I don't trust that the facial  recognition software wouldn't recognize the wrong person.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  Which is part of the argument and, you know, on the  other side, law enforcement agencies are arguing: look, you know, we're not  there yet.  It's important to us that the community understands what it's  being used for just as crucially as what it's not.  And they site the fact  that, you know, this has been used for surveillance footage matching from  burglaries, from what's picked up from CCTV.  They argue this has been used  to find abducted children or missing children in amusement parks.  It was  even used actually this weekend at the royal wedding of now duke and  duchess of Sussex for what royals had attended, right?  Sky News used.  So,  it's important that they feel the community that they --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to know the difference between David Beckham and Serena  Williams.  Because there were some people on other networks who didn't  really know the difference.  And that's a wonderful private application of  that tool essentially for entertainment.  I don't want to be arrested for a  crime that Kate Upton has committed because we look so similar.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes, and I do want to point out, though, that there's a bit of  hyperbole I see here in terms of the narrative that these free speech firms  and companies are pushing forward.  And here's one in particular, they cite  that this can now be used at airports which is a public place, they argue.   We're now in this climate of protesting and robust participation.  They  claim that there could be a chilling factor, but I want to point out that  airports for example are not public places for purposes of free speech.   It's been long held at the first, second, and fourth amendment are actually  restricted there.  So, in terms of the conversation surrounding this, to me  it's important that the narrative isn't subjects to that kind of hyperbolic  quality, because to me, it just increases the chasm between law enforcement  and what they're trying to do, and then lawful protected right to privacy  that we have without kind of muddying the water.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely, understand.  And I think there is so much more to  discuss and address here.  I really appreciate your perspective.  Thank you  so much, Emily.  Great to talk to you again. </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  \"TOPICAL STORM\" is next.  It's a good one.  Stay here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The NYPD is looking for a group of gunmen who robbed a  Walgreen's pharmacy while wearing clown masks.  Witnesses say, there could  be as many as 15 of them.  They were last seen fleeing one tiny car.  Be on  the lookout for a many, because this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\" </p><p>Topic number one.  We begin tonight in Houston, Texas, where everybody  knows that if you're going to drive on the highway, you're going to need  plenty of horse power.  Look at this.  Oh, mercy!  The Belmont state aren't  for another three weeks but this fellow is already getting in a good  workout.  In any other state, the sight of horse on a highway might have  caused a 12-car pile-up.  But in (INAUDIBLE) they're like, it's probably  going out for more beer.  Anything a couple of cars high beams so, they  could pass.  Now, fortunately some good Samaritans were able to steer it  off the road, and police have since returned though, of course, to its  owner but not before issuing a ticket for using the carpooling without a  passenger.  Rules are rules, pal.  Get a (INAUDIBLE) next time.</p><p>Topic number two.  There it is.  A Florida City issued a zombie alert to  its citizens.  And we'd like to think it was an accident, but you never  know in Florida.  A storm caused a blackout on Sunday that led the  residents of Lake Worth, Florida, to get an alert that read: Zombie --  power outage and zombie alert for the residents of Lake Worth and Terminus.   There are now far less than 7300 customers involved due to extreme zombie  activity.  Now, Terminus is a fictitious town from the hit T.V. show \"The  Walking Dead\".  Its inclusion in the message led cops to believe it was a  prank.  Great police, fellows.  Well done.  It's unlikely someone confused  the state of Florida and \"The Walking Dead\" because the two couldn't be  more different.  One is an apocalyptic wasteland of human oddities, and the  other is a T.V. show.  That's right.  </p><p>Topic number three.  If you're a cop in the city of Cleveland, long enough  you'll see everything -- except for a Browns Super Bowl championship.  But  these cops, they don't need a championship to party.  The officers  responded to this block party to cut the noise, but they wound up cutting a  rug because not even a horse can resist it.  It's so addictive.  We have a  staffer named Courtney who does it all the time in the office.  She's very  special.  The video of the dancing cops has taken off across the country,  and so has their other police horse.  There I go again on my own.  Turns  out he'll be shuffling papers behind his desk because he's been suspended  for not tying up his horse.  </p><p>Topic number four.  There it is.  Thanks to Bunk Breaker for this one.   Women's soccer legend, Brandy Chastain, was inducted into the Bay Area hall  of fame this week.  But the person who may brand these flack, must drink a  few brandies before going into the studio.  The women's soccer legend  became famous for whipping off her jersey after hitting the winning penalty  kick in the 1999 World Cup.  She was an international (INAUDIBLE), but  apparently, she's now a trucker named Gill, who likes beef jerky and lot  lizard.  The Internet says she looks like Gary Busey, so either way slice  it, she's looks like someone who is little nuts.  She looks like she's a  transitioning Elizabeth Warren without glasses.  You can't make this up,  unlike Elizabeth's heritage.  The hall of fame has since apologized and  offered to make a new plaque.  And perhaps, not surprisingly Brandi, has  graciously accepted their offer.  We reached out to the plaque maker for  comment but he was at the vet with his seeing eye dog.  </p><p>Topic number five.  Perhaps no athlete is more disappointed than Tonya  Harding who did not win the top prize in last night's \"Dancing with the  Stars\" finale.  Someday, historians will remember this as the end of the  #kneetoo movement.  Figure skater Adam Rippon took home the win, and Lord  knows he'll need the prize money, because competing against Tonya Harding  can cost you an arm and a leg.  If you don't believe me, ask Nancy  Kerrigan.  NFL Star, Josh Norman, with the other runner-up in the first  all-athlete season.  It was also the first season of all famous people.   Usually, that show is a who's who of people that make you say, who?  Her  T.V. comeback may be over, but don't feel bad for Tonya because she just  joined a new dance troupe who are very familiar with her work.  Is he going  to get the police?  (INAUDIBLE) felony.  If only she had this much rhythm  in last night's finale.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Thank you so much for watching this show tonight.

Let's take  a live look and listen to President Trump.  He's speaking at the Susan B.  Anthony List 11th Annual Campaign for Life Gala at the National Building  Museum in Washington, D.C.  Let's go. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I watch him all the time.  I  don't know him well, but I'll get to know him.  John Rutherford, where is  he, John?  Central casting.  Great job, John.  He's always defending me.   Actually, most of you are always defending me and that's OK.  And from my  neck of the woods, Claudia Kenny.  Thank you, Claudia.  Thank you.  And for  those many that I have left out, I'm sorry.  But I say, give me a totally  complete list and I will call you tomorrow and I will apologize personally.   All right.  But every day between now and November, we must work together  to elect more lawmakers who share our values, cherish our heritage, and  proudly stand for life.  And that is a great group of people I introduced.   I can tell you that.  We're also glad to be joined by a beloved member of  my administration, a true fighter for faith and family, and your 2018  distinguished leader, Kellyanne Conway.  Kellyanne.  What a job --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Sorry.  The president of course speaking introduction  luminaries there at the gala and we will dip back in if there is some  breaking news or he stumbles upon something that you need to hear about it  because you got it right here, baby.  There have been some major twists in  President Trump's scheduled meeting with Kim Jong-un.  The president saying  he no longer likes the North Korean dictator's attitude and casting doubt  that the meeting will happen at all.  Watch this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If it doesn't happen, maybe it will happen later.  Maybe it will  happen at a different time.  But we will see.  But we are talking.  The  meeting is scheduled as you know on June 12th in Singapore.  And whether or  not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon, but we're talking right now. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Talking may not be good enough.  We're being told Kim Jong-un  may have second thoughts about giving up all of his nuclear weapons.  The  president today said the dictator would be making a huge mistake by walking  away from this all-important table.  And just yesterday, Vice President  Pence told our own Martha MacCallum that if he keeps his nukes, the  situation could end really, really badly.  Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It would be a great  mistake for Kim Jong-un to think he could play Donald Trump.  The truth is  that President Trump has made it clear that this administration will not  tolerate the regime in North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and ballistic  missiles that threaten our people, that threaten the United States of  America , that threaten our allies in the region. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The vice president went on to say that North Korea will end up  like Libya if it doesn't make a deal.  And we all remember how that ended.   The country was destroyed.  Muammar Gaddafi was murdered in the street by  rebels.  Wow.  So will Kim Jong-un play ball or is the meeting and the  possible Nobel Prize out the window?  With me now Fox Business Reporter  Edward Lawrence with all the details.  Edward. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kennedy, this  is the first time that we're hearing the president actually say that the  meeting may not go forward on June 12th.  However, the State Department is  saying that they are working towards that date and only that date. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  I do have a real sense that  he would -- he would find American investment, American technology,  American know how of real value to his people.  If we get this right and we  get the denuclearization right, America wouldn't be quite capable of  delivering them with lots of things that would make life better for the  North Korean people. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  And President Trump saying that he personally guarantees the  safety of Kim Jong-un at the meeting in Singapore.  He president going on  to say that he recognizes that fact that Kim Jong-un would be the person to  lead his people into the future.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I would say that we are looking certainly right now at two Koreas,  two very successful Koreas.  You're going to have a very, very successful  North Korea and you're going to have a very successful and you already do,  South Korea. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now, all of this is predicated on denuclearization.  And right  now, there's a group of journalists from the United States, from China,  Russia, and the United Kingdom that are expected to witness the North  Koreans actually taking down, demolishing one of their nuclear sites.  Now,  whether in the area has delayed that trip.  It is expected to happen again  today or tomorrow their time, Kennedy. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, same thing.  Edward, thank you so much.  All right.  So  Kim -- can Kim Jong-un be trusted to keep his word?  And is China throwing  a monkey wrench into the work?  That question answers itself.  It certainly  is fuzz bud.  Just let me bring in former CIA operative Mike Baker, also  the President of Diligence LLC.  Welcome back to the show, Mike. </p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC:  Thank you very much, Kennedy.  Thank  you.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely.  The president says that Kim Jong-un's attitude  needs an adjustment since his most of recent chat with President Xi  Jinping.  What do you think about China's meddling in a situation they're  not necessarily a part of? </p><p>BAKER:  Well, in that you just -- that last part of your sentence is  important to note.  What China wants to insure is that they're relevant in  these conversations.  And they made that fairly clear over the past couple  of months.  But, look, nobody is surprised by sort of the posturing that's  taking place on both sides leading into this.  This is an historic  potentially defining moment.  Even if the summit occurs and nothing happens  after that and we can't get through the lengthy negotiations to get some  type of deal signed, just getting to this point almost being at the table  is an historic moment given how many years we've spent kicking the can down  the road with a fairly feckless foreign policy towards North Korea.  So I  think that the administration has been pretty clear in stating that they  understand this could be problematic and saying they're going to walk away  from the table.  It is interesting to note that aside from the fact you  can't swing a dead cat without hitting a North Korea expert these days.   It's also interesting to know that you got members of the resistance and  some members of the media who seemed almost hoping for this thing to fall  apart.  And if you find yourself rooting against peace on the peninsula  because you don't like President Trump, then you might want to rethink your  priorities. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I absolutely agree with you about that.  And I think there is  a time and a place for resistance.  I think there are certainly instances  where you have to hold the president accountable for the things the he says  and does.  But here I think, you know, this is an area where we have to be  as supportive as possible because a peaceful ending to this situation is  critical.  It's paramount.  Now, what's interesting and something that you  have pointed out is obviously there are issues with the Iran deal.  And you  have noted that part of the issue is because President Obama was so  impatient, and he was so dead set on landing that deal that he really  compromise our position there.  So would you caution this president against  doing the same thing with North Korea? </p><p>BAKER:  Right.  And, again, they've been very been clear in saying over the  past many weeks that they'd be willing to get up from the table and walk  away.  But what they have to be careful about is as you get closer and  closer to that potential meeting on the 12th of June, you have to be  careful that you feel so invested in this now, and you -- you're so keen to  get this going.  But you have to step back, take a breath, and understand  that, as you said, the previous administration, the Obama administration,  you know, they had their knickers in such a twist over the desire to get a  deal, any deal, that they were willing to overlook the problems with the  deal and they were willing to accept all the requests and concessions and  demands that the Iranian regime put into that deal.  And so, you know, and  again, with anything that takes place in this world of weapons agreements  whether you're talking about conventional weapons, nuclear weapons,  biological or chemical weapons really at the end of the day what matters  more than anything else is verification. </p><p>Trust but verify.  If you can't verify and the Iranian example is a good  one because it was in the deal.  We were not allowed to inspect military  sites.  So, yes, were they complying as people who were supporting that the  deal say?  Well, they were complying with it.  Yes, we got -- they were  complying with what was written in the deal.  But we had no verification  capability for any of their military sites.  And frankly, that's like  saying you're a serial killer.  You allow the police to come into your home  and search it, but you can't go in the basement and look around.  So we get  to be really careful and if we do get to that hard difficult point where  we're actually trying to pen a deal.  If we can't get verification locked  down with this, we didn't have it with the Syrian chemical issue.  We  didn't have it in the past on occasion with the Russians --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  -- trust Russia because they said they got rid of all Syria's  chemical weapons.  And he also said that we're fine in Iran because he read  the deal, and it's super solid, and they have no desire to manufacture any  fissile material or use those in drills to make big --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BAKER:  That was their investment.  They were so -- they were so keen as  you pointed out.  So keen to get that deal, so we have to be careful.  The  Trump administration has to be able to say, no, we're not going to sit down  if what appears to be as the North Koreas are making demands and  concessions that we can't accept, don't even sit at the table, and much  less walk away.  Just don't sit down at that point.  Everybody understands  this is an incredibly complex issue between us, North Korea, South Korea,  China, Japan, you know, but this is -- again, it's worth pursuing and as  you pointed out, everybody regardless of your political position should be  willing to root for peace on the peninsula or an effort to get there. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Pretend the U.S. is actually in the World Cup, it's like that.   Everyone wants team USA to win.  Mike Baker, thank you so much. </p><p>BAKER:  What -- the World Cup is what?  That's soccer? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  All right.  That's enough.  All right.  Dear, come on.  Let it  go.  Come on, man.  It's a beautiful game and you're a lovely person, so  thanks again.  Today, former President Jimmy -- oh, Jimmy Carter said he  thinks the president would deserve the Nobel Prize if he manages -- that's  a big if.  He's really qualifying this.  To get the North Koreans to give  up their nukes, but is the President Trump really thinking about canceling  the meeting or is possible that he's just being a showman and amping up the  drama?  Let me go to my military grade party pane tonight, she's an editor  at Townhall.com and a Fox News Contributor, Katie Pavlich is here.  He is a  spokesperson at Young Voices and host of the podcast Beltway Banthas, it's  Stephen Kent, and he is the host of \"YOUR WELCOME\", that's a podcast and  author of the book, Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim  Jong-il, he's got a license too, Michael Malice is back.  Our resident  actual North Korea expert. </p><p>MICHAEL MALICE, HOST, YOUR WELCOME SHOW:  I'm no Mike Baker. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Come on, man --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MALICE:  -- with a dead cat apparently. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I don't think he was talking about you. </p><p>MALICE:  That's true. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to read you Jimmy Carter's quote because I think -- I  want to -- I want to get your feeling on this.  He's talking about if  they're under constant belief that the United States wants to attack them  meaning North Korea even using nuclear weapons and that we are destroying  their economy and they know that they're starving to death primarily  because the United States withholds food aid for instance, just giving them  surplus food that we can never use.  I can understand how they feel. </p><p>MALICE:  Well, let me give you a little bit of background about Jimmy  Carter and North Korea.  He went there in 1994 and tried to broker a deal  with the great leader Kim Il-sung.  And five years ago today I posted a  quote from North Korean propaganda about their meeting and this is what  they said Jimmy Carter said, \"President Kim Il-sung is a person in whom  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, those popular  three presidents of the United States early in its history are put  together.\"  So that actually did not happen.  But the point is, North Korea  withheld food from getting to its citizenry in the '90s because Kim Jong-il  specifically said, if we allow the U.N. to feed the population, the  government will be superfluous.  So that's absolutely not true that they  would be willing to accept food. </p><p>And if they did accept food, they would claim it's coming from the leader,  so it's false in that regard.  It's absolutely true that they think we're  going to invade at any minute because you see people all over the news  right now blatantly saying John Bolton had a -- entry in the Wall Street  Journal that even South Korea is against it.  We have the unilateral right  to strike if they develop nuclear capabilities.  And when President Bush  said the axis of evil is Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.  This is clearly a  kill list of the three countries he wants to take out.  So they are right  to be afraid.  And again, if most people in this country don't trust  themselves to disarm and give up their guns and trust the federal  government, why would the North Korean government thinking differently? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And they have gotten so many resources over the years that  they could have used to feed their people.  I mean you don't build a multi- billion dollar nuclear weapons program unless you have money. </p><p>MALICE:  And lastly, the have something called Sung Bun and the used food  is a mechanism to control, so that the more loyal you are to the  government, the more likely you are to receive food. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And we're going to talk about that same thing happening in  Venezuela.  But I want to get back here because we've heard a lot about the  Libyan model and it was something that John Bolton said in regards to  denuclearizing North Korea, you know, which is essentially can be by force  with a very sad ending for the leader of either Libya or North Korea.  It  wasn't just something that John Bolton said offhandedly months ago in an  interview.  This is now something that Vice President Pence has legitimized  by using the same term.  So do you think that we are on a march to war if  in fact the meeting doesn't take place? </p><p>STEPHEN KENT, HOST, BELTWAY BANTHAS PODCAST:  I don't think we're on a  march to war.  But I'm stunned that Mike Pence then echo that comment from  John Bolton because that seemed incredibly ill-advice.  They need to keep  that comment and John Bolton off television for the next three weeks if  they're going to make this meeting happen.  He instills this sense of  distrust with the North Korean regime.  And Michael is absolutely right  when he mentioned, you know, like trying to step away from their guns being  their WMD's.  Like -- they're like the cultists in Waco, like you cannot  threaten them in this way.  Their weapons are the only thing that make them  feel secure, so this march towards total denuclearization or else is not  going to work in this case.  We need to be a little bit more gentle here. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  You know, I was talking to Gordon Chang a few weeks ago and he  said they still have a conventional military which is actually a bigger  practical threat to the region and it's much easier for them to go ahead  and bomb South Korea.  They don't -- they don't have to use nukes in order  to inflict a lot of damage.  So even if you take their nuclear program  away, they still have the ability to defend themselves. </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  That's always been the  concern that they'll use artillery power against Seoul, South Korea which  is right there across the border. This conversation you just had goes back  to why this has never worked out and why very administration has had a  failure when it comes to reining in North Korea's program.  They are so far  apart and although in the last couple of months we've seen things come  together on the surface.  When it comes to principles what the North  Koreans are willing to do which is not giving up their nuclear arms, the  negotiation now is about what denuclearization actually means and what the  United States requires which is complete denuclearization of the peninsula.   And the of course, there's China which is playing a role and saying, we  can't ask North Korea to completely give up their nukes.  However, we think  that they should be limited in their capacity.  And by the way, we don't  want any of the fallout when it comes to the regime -- </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  No.  China wants control and they want North Korea to be  dependent and they also want to have as much influence as possible on the  Korean Peninsula.  My question is, does South Korea -- with South Korea and  we're running out of time, so this has to beautiful quick answer.  Would  South Korea rather work with the United States in resolving this situation? </p><p>PAVLICH:  I think ultimately, yes.  I mean the United States is an ally.   We're doing military excises.  The United States has repeatedly said we are  not taking military -- legal military exercises off the table in exchange  for denuclearization of North Korea.  But again, the gap here is very wide  and it feels like we're back to the beginning of why this hasn't work out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's where we five seconds. </p><p>PAVLICH:  Katie gets it perfectly. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Oh, very good, Michael Malice for taking the baton and looking  very classily.  The panel return a little bit later because how could they  not.  Plus, the plot thickens in the White House.  Republican lawmakers now  calling for a second special counsel to investigate the possibility the  feds had politically motivated spies in the Trump campaign.  And now the  president has weighed in.  I'll tell you what  he said.  Chris Stirewalt  joins me next for reaction. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  We got news alert now.  We just learned that the business  partner of President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen has  agreed to cooperate with the government as part of a plea deal.  Evgeny  Friedman, I know I'm not saying that right.  Is the note -- no.  Michael  Malice is shaking his head seriously.  He's got a whiplash.  He's a Russian  immigrant known as the taxi king.  Legal expert say this puts greater  pressure on Cohen to cooperate with the Mueller probe, but the president  says the real issue with the alleged spying on his campaign during the  election.  Watch. </p><p>TRUMP:  A lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign.  If they  had spies in my campaign, that would be a disgrace to this country.  That  would be one of the biggest insults that anyone has ever seen and it would  be very illegal aside from everything else.  It would make probably every  political event ever look like small potatoes. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Small potatoes?  Delicious though.  Michael Cohen cooperating  with the government would certainly be no picnic for the president.  But is  he right to say the election spying is the biggest concern here.  Joining  me now Fox News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt back in action.  Welcome  back. </p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Indeed.  All right.  So let's talk about this.  Spies in my  campaign, is that the biggest issue of all if that is in fact true? </p><p>STIREWALT:  The biggest issue in political history the president says --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Maybe ever. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Maybe ever which they're saying something.  I mean the fall of  Roman stuff was a pretty big deal.  Look, the president says that there  were spies, and this is a good narrative for him.  This helps him with his  base to talk about him as the real victim and the deep state, and it was  really Obama and Clinton, and he's the victim here.  He's not the  perpetuator.  But instead, he's the victim.  And it -- and especially  during a midterm where he desperately wants not to lose the house because  that would create a whole new set of pressures on him in terms of  investigations and conceivably impeachment that he wants to keep  Republicans with him and a good way to do that is to say that he's not the  offender here, that the system -- that he is the victim of the system. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I truly believe that he believes he is not the offender.  He  believes he has done nothing wrong.  And he's just, you know, as a  negotiator does, if something doesn't succeed the first time you go about  it from different angles.  But is there something to this story?  Is it  possible that there were politically motivated operatives who were reaching  out to people of on the Trump campaign getting information to give back to  the FBI? </p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, if they can put cheese in the can and have it spray out  on a cracker that was anything --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  What a great invention. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Anything is possible.  But I don't know.  I mean I cover  politics.  But I do know this that there is an inspector general's report  that is in process about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's  mishandling of state secrets.  We're waiting for that in just the next  coming days.  And then hot on the heels of that one from the inspector  general from the Department of Justice, Mr. Horowitz, is a report on the --  an investigation of the investigation into the Russian meddling and Trump's  campaign, and that rashmitas.  So I'm going to wait and find out, just like  I'm going to wait and find out what Mueller actually has as opposed to all  of these chatter dancing that people are doing around this stuff.  I don't  know.  So I'm just going to wait until I find that. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I mean if there was a coordinated effort between James Clapper  and John Brennan and James Comey, you know, if that's not a politicized  trifecta, I don't know from my politicized trifecta, and I have a menagerie  of them in a green room.</p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, look, if that was so and they conspired together against  Donald Trump, well, that would be very bad.  But we don't know that.  We  don't have that evidence just like we don't have evidence that the  president colluded with Russia.  We just have -- the best I can do at this  point especially since we now have hopes that much of this will be  concluded by the end of the summer.  All I can do as a political forecaster  is say, we'll have enough information to know how this is going to affect  the midterms, how are Republicans going to respond to this.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And I think the deployment of these types of informant is not  only possible.  I think it is plausible given the amount of -- the  capability of these various organizations whether it's the NSA, or CIA, or  FBI, or DEA spy on Americans.  They have the tools.  It would not surprise  me if there are people who would abuse that power for their own benefit.   And I hope that's not the case.  I hope we live in a country where that  kind of power is checked.  So far Congress keeps codifying it and that is  also terrifying.  Chris Stirewalt, thank you so much. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Bottom line and every day of the week young man.  Very good. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Quite so. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes.  Coming up, Venezuela, the hell hole where a month's  salary can't even buy a cup of coffee.  People are so hungry they resorted  to eating zoo animals.  They just re-elected their president with nearly 70  percent of the vote.  Do you smell something fishy like a rotting zebra  carcass?  More examples of socialism destroying society in the monologue  next.  Stay here. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Crappy socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro was elected to  another six-year term in Venezuela.  Yes.  And the equally corrupted  authoritarian Turkish president campaigned for him, so they could share in  the farcical fun.  Leaders like Maduro, Erdogan, and Putin hate freedom  because it gives filthy peasants too much they empower over their own  lives.  They liquidate government holdings to enrich themselves in their  select cronies, and they steal from poor people who live horrible short  lives before they die in squalor.  It is no surprise these liberty loathers  create an access of a-holes.  They need to sow discord in the world's most  powerful economy because a truly free market disrupts their tyrannical  buggery -- signaling widespread discontent.  President Trump has signed an  executive order that bans U.S. citizens from snapping up Venezuelan  bargains from the state fire sale.  When people try to profit off this  desperation, they are further imprisoning the poorest among them who cannot  leave the country.  There has been a mass exodus of doctors, nurses,  teachers, engineers, and anyone else who has the means to escape the  tightening news of cruel socialism.  Anyone who can get out has fled, while  those trapped there are enduring inflation that's already at nearly 14,000  percent.  Plus, soaring malnutrition infant and maternal mortality rates  that are also going up and are being undertreated at vacant hospitals.  All  fraudulent elections should be condemned, including those in Turkey and  Russia.  And we need to be doubly mindful not to indulge amateur socialist  in this country.  Because even though a Bernie Sanders presidency is a  joke, the consequences of diet communism are deadly serious.  And that's  the memo.  </p><p>Oh, hi, great to see me.  That was swift.  How long Nicolas Maduro possibly  hang on to power as people are starving, his economy is ruined, the murder  rate is one of the highest in the world, and all indicators suggest things  are only going to get worse.  So, what can we do to fix this failed  socialist experiment before it turns into another Somalia?  The party panel  is back: Katie Pavlich, Stephen Kent, and Michael Malice.  Katie, I don't  think this is the worst-case-scenario.  I don't think this is a black swan  country undergoing some bad luck.  I think this is the natural ultimate end  of socialism and communism.  What do you think?</p><p>PAVLICH:  People argue, you know, this isn't real socialism or this isn't  real communism.  No, this is what it is.  In 1999, Venezuela decide to go  from more of a free market system to a socialist country to spend more  money on welfare.  This is exactly what we've seen as a result of that.   Now, Maduro is out there this week, on video in this bizarre way -- waving  to crowds that don't exist who applaud him on his re-election by 70  percent.  The United States has condemned the election results.  And the  question is, where do we go from here?  Not only in Venezuela but as the  United States because there are American interests there and there are  foreign policy implications of the regime collapsing.  The Venezuelans are  fleeing in large numbers.  As you mentioned in your monologue that most of  important people in the country who are, you know, doctors, nurses are  leaving.  But regular people are getting out because they are so desperate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Giving on buses in getting out of the country.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Liberals, socialist Utopia that is now existing in Venezuela as a  result of these principles, not a mistake.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Malice?</p><p>MALICE:  What I would like to see happen because there's only so much we  can do in Venezuela.  Every politician who was a segregationist racist had  to disavow, have to turn their backs, and had to be publicly humiliated,  had to be (INAUDIBLE) for decades.  So why are Michael Moore, and Bernie  Sanders, and Jeremy Corbin in the U.K., all of the people who said  Venezuela is a great thing, a great experiment, why do they not run on the  public square and thrown tomatoes at where they go?  You have children  bleeding to death on hospital beds, you have people starving.  Again, they  shoot into crowds when people try to protest.  To have anyone who's in  politics for this, not take responsibility for it, and still begin a  microphone, I think, is disgraceful.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And it's only getting worse,  and worse, and worse.  It's actually getting exponentially worse as  inflation rises, and the poorest people, they are the ones who can't afford  to feed their kids.  They never had to treat malnutrition five years ago.   And now that condition has gone up 100 folds in hospitals that we have no  doctors.  So, what do we do?  Do we do anything as the United States?  </p><p>KENT:  Well, there's again, limited tools in our tool kit to deal with this  situation.  We're not going to invade Venezuela.  We shouldn't.  And  sanctions are something that we have to be delicate with as well, because  we want to target the elite in that country who are abusing and starving  their people without then, actually, hurting the people who live in that  country and are not able to leave.  We are mentioning that doctors and  everyone who are able to flee.  You know, the oil industry runs basically  the only leftover economy that's there, but it only benefits the wealthy.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's absolutely right.  And that's what they did.  I  mean, it is a state-run industry.  They've got so much oil, which was  great, and they were profitable when oil prices were high.  But when they  tanked -- </p><p>MALICE:  This is atlas shrugged comes to life.  This is exactly the  (INAUDIBLE).  Take out excessive business having the government running,  and then how long it takes for people to be --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And you know, when atlas shrugged, that's when the people are  holding up the economy, they leave.  They're exhausted.</p><p>MALICE:  And if the poor and the weak were the first to suffer.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's absolutely right and suffer the longest.  Well, back  here at home, I mean, we're really suffering, right?  Because House Speaker  Paul Ryan is facing renewed pressure to step down from his perch before his  term ends.  The administration maybe nudging the effort along.  White House  Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, reportedly said he has spoken with House  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about ousting Ryan, adding: \"Wouldn't it be  great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut  up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election.  That's a  really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do  it.\"  Now, Mulvaney says he's supportive of the speaker.  And McCarthy said  he's never even talked to Mulvaney about it.  So, should House Republicans  plan a mutiny, Katie?  </p><p>MALICE:  We always hear word of a mutiny whenever there's any kind of  speakers raised.  Jim Jordan, other than the hundred conservatives that  came out and sign the letters saying they want him to run for speaker.   Paul Ryan will likely out his term as speaker of the house.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He's not going to get pushed out of the way?</p><p>PAVLICH:  You know, I don't know.  I mean, the thing is, as they say in  Washington, D.C.: if you want a friend, get a dog.  And although, Kevin  McCarthy and Paul Ryan have been very close for the last couple of years,  not only just in leadership as Paul Ryan came out through the ranks in the  House, from the Ways and Means Committee.  I doubt that McCarthy is going  to actually push Paul Ryan out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  They want Jim to working at job.</p><p>KENT:  No, money talks.  Paul Ryan brought in 11.9 million in the first  quarter of the Republican.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's why Nancy Pelosi is still around.  </p><p>KENT:  So, yes, put up or shut up.  Everybody else who wants that job.   They're not going to move him out as long as they need to raise money for  these mid-term elections which are going to be contentious.  I also would  like to see Paul Ryan finish out this job because we need, we need him to  finish and have a legitimate open-run election.  Kevin McCarthy cannot be  nominated for this.  Nobody really wants him in the Republican --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Is there a benefit to chaos?  </p><p>MALICE:  Look at the last Republican speaker.  You have ambassador of the  Vatican's wife, you have this lobster who's selling marijuana.  Dennis  Hastert, we can't even discuss on air.  And now, we have the guy who Mitt  Romney made his beta.  So, this is quite a cast of characters.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He is his Robin.</p><p>MALICE:  Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, he really is.  I love Paul Rhino.  I love the term Paul  Rhino.  I think Paul Ryan has completely turned his back on his principles.  </p><p>MALICE:  But in 2012, Romney needed to play the base, and he chose Ryan.   And that's how far the Republican Party has gone to the right, but even  Ryan is regardless of the left --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, Ryan and a slap on the base.  You know, I want to thank  you all for being here, because you are good friends, you are allies of  freedom, and you are delightful people.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Thank you for having us.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Freedoms and my feels.  Michael, Stephen, and Katie Pavlich,  thank you all.  Coming up, Cops say Amazon's new facial recognition  technology is helping them identify suspects in crime.  But the privacy  police are sounding alarm bells.  Emily Compagno joins me with the details.   Hi, Emily!  She's coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The future is now.  And I don't know if I like it.  Amazon has  some fancy new facial recognition technology and they're selling it to  police departments for $6.00 a month.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well,  a lot.  Which is why the ACLU is asking the tech giant to stop marketing  the tool to law enforcement agencies -- fearing it could be used to invade  your privacy.  Amazon respond to the ACLU's request with a statement that  read in quote: \"Amazon requires the customers comply with the law and be  responsible when they use Amazon Web Service (AWS).  When we find that AWS  services are being abused by a customer, we suspend that customer's right  to use our services.\"  Now, I would never add the cape for government  regulation to fix a problem like this, but should we be concerned about our  civil liberties and privacy when a tech giant like amazon combines with  government?  Let me ask former Criminal Defense Attorney and Legal Analyst,  Emily Compagno, she is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.  Emily,  welcome back to the show.  </p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND LEGAL ANALYST:  So, let's  discuss this.  What is the down side to selling facial recognition  technology on the cheap to law enforcement?  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  ACLU and others are arguing, look, there's a high  capacity for abuse here.  So, they argue this isn't akin to just an  extension of photography.  They say, this is akin to walking through mass  protests and asking for identification for every single person there.  They  argue this can be used to follow immigrants by ICE, this can be used to  identify any random person on a street corner.  So, they kind of have the  same arguments that they have for all existing surveillance programs, which  is where is the limit, right?  And they argue that, although it's not  different from other facial recognition program.  Here, they site that what  is problematic is Amazon's aggressive marketing to law enforcement agencies  and the fact that the reach is so prolific.  So, that's what they're  arguing here.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And that's one of things that has always concerned me, whether  it's Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other social media platform.  You  know, these big tech companies getting in bed with the government, whether  it's military or law enforcement, the consequences can be dire.  They're  not always dire.  We want our law enforcement agencies to have tools and  have technology so they can keep us safe.  The problem is when these things  malfunction.  My iPhone X recognizes my face about half the time, and it's  not because I'm a supermodel but a lot of people say that.  It's because  this technology isn't perfect.  And you know, I don't trust that the facial  recognition software wouldn't recognize the wrong person.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  Which is part of the argument and, you know, on the  other side, law enforcement agencies are arguing: look, you know, we're not  there yet.  It's important to us that the community understands what it's  being used for just as crucially as what it's not.  And they site the fact  that, you know, this has been used for surveillance footage matching from  burglaries, from what's picked up from CCTV.  They argue this has been used  to find abducted children or missing children in amusement parks.  It was  even used actually this weekend at the royal wedding of now duke and  duchess of Sussex for what royals had attended, right?  Sky News used.  So,  it's important that they feel the community that they --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to know the difference between David Beckham and Serena  Williams.  Because there were some people on other networks who didn't  really know the difference.  And that's a wonderful private application of  that tool essentially for entertainment.  I don't want to be arrested for a  crime that Kate Upton has committed because we look so similar.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes, and I do want to point out, though, that there's a bit of  hyperbole I see here in terms of the narrative that these free speech firms  and companies are pushing forward.  And here's one in particular, they cite  that this can now be used at airports which is a public place, they argue.   We're now in this climate of protesting and robust participation.  They  claim that there could be a chilling factor, but I want to point out that  airports for example are not public places for purposes of free speech.   It's been long held at the first, second, and fourth amendment are actually  restricted there.  So, in terms of the conversation surrounding this, to me  it's important that the narrative isn't subjects to that kind of hyperbolic  quality, because to me, it just increases the chasm between law enforcement  and what they're trying to do, and then lawful protected right to privacy  that we have without kind of muddying the water.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely, understand.  And I think there is so much more to  discuss and address here.  I really appreciate your perspective.  Thank you  so much, Emily.  Great to talk to you again. </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  \"TOPICAL STORM\" is next.  It's a good one.  Stay here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The NYPD is looking for a group of gunmen who robbed a  Walgreen's pharmacy while wearing clown masks.  Witnesses say, there could  be as many as 15 of them.  They were last seen fleeing one tiny car.  Be on  the lookout for a many, because this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\" </p><p>Topic number one.  We begin tonight in Houston, Texas, where everybody  knows that if you're going to drive on the highway, you're going to need  plenty of horse power.  Look at this.  Oh, mercy!  The Belmont state aren't  for another three weeks but this fellow is already getting in a good  workout.  In any other state, the sight of horse on a highway might have  caused a 12-car pile-up.  But in (INAUDIBLE) they're like, it's probably  going out for more beer.  Anything a couple of cars high beams so, they  could pass.  Now, fortunately some good Samaritans were able to steer it  off the road, and police have since returned though, of course, to its  owner but not before issuing a ticket for using the carpooling without a  passenger.  Rules are rules, pal.  Get a (INAUDIBLE) next time.</p><p>Topic number two.  There it is.  A Florida City issued a zombie alert to  its citizens.  And we'd like to think it was an accident, but you never  know in Florida.  A storm caused a blackout on Sunday that led the  residents of Lake Worth, Florida, to get an alert that read: Zombie --  power outage and zombie alert for the residents of Lake Worth and Terminus.   There are now far less than 7300 customers involved due to extreme zombie  activity.  Now, Terminus is a fictitious town from the hit T.V. show \"The  Walking Dead\".  Its inclusion in the message led cops to believe it was a  prank.  Great police, fellows.  Well done.  It's unlikely someone confused  the state of Florida and \"The Walking Dead\" because the two couldn't be  more different.  One is an apocalyptic wasteland of human oddities, and the  other is a T.V. show.  That's right.  </p><p>Topic number three.  If you're a cop in the city of Cleveland, long enough  you'll see everything -- except for a Browns Super Bowl championship.  But  these cops, they don't need a championship to party.  The officers  responded to this block party to cut the noise, but they wound up cutting a  rug because not even a horse can resist it.  It's so addictive.  We have a  staffer named Courtney who does it all the time in the office.  She's very  special.  The video of the dancing cops has taken off across the country,  and so has their other police horse.  There I go again on my own.  Turns  out he'll be shuffling papers behind his desk because he's been suspended  for not tying up his horse.  </p><p>Topic number four.  There it is.  Thanks to Bunk Breaker for this one.   Women's soccer legend, Brandy Chastain, was inducted into the Bay Area hall  of fame this week.  But the person who may brand these flack, must drink a  few brandies before going into the studio.  The women's soccer legend  became famous for whipping off her jersey after hitting the winning penalty  kick in the 1999 World Cup.  She was an international (INAUDIBLE), but  apparently, she's now a trucker named Gill, who likes beef jerky and lot  lizard.  The Internet says she looks like Gary Busey, so either way slice  it, she's looks like someone who is little nuts.  She looks like she's a  transitioning Elizabeth Warren without glasses.  You can't make this up,  unlike Elizabeth's heritage.  The hall of fame has since apologized and  offered to make a new plaque.  And perhaps, not surprisingly Brandi, has  graciously accepted their offer.  We reached out to the plaque maker for  comment but he was at the vet with his seeing eye dog.  </p><p>Topic number five.  Perhaps no athlete is more disappointed than Tonya  Harding who did not win the top prize in last night's \"Dancing with the  Stars\" finale.  Someday, historians will remember this as the end of the  #kneetoo movement.  Figure skater Adam Rippon took home the win, and Lord  knows he'll need the prize money, because competing against Tonya Harding  can cost you an arm and a leg.  If you don't believe me, ask Nancy  Kerrigan.  NFL Star, Josh Norman, with the other runner-up in the first  all-athlete season.  It was also the first season of all famous people.   Usually, that show is a who's who of people that make you say, who?  Her  T.V. comeback may be over, but don't feel bad for Tonya because she just  joined a new dance troupe who are very familiar with her work.  Is he going  to get the police?  (INAUDIBLE) felony.  If only she had this much rhythm  in last night's finale.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Thank you so much for watching this show tonight.

Let's take  a live look and listen to President Trump.  He's speaking at the Susan B.  Anthony List 11th Annual Campaign for Life Gala at the National Building  Museum in Washington, D.C.  Let's go. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I watch him all the time.  I  don't know him well, but I'll get to know him.  John Rutherford, where is  he, John?  Central casting.  Great job, John.  He's always defending me.   Actually, most of you are always defending me and that's OK.  And from my  neck of the woods, Claudia Kenny.  Thank you, Claudia.  Thank you.  And for  those many that I have left out, I'm sorry.  But I say, give me a totally  complete list and I will call you tomorrow and I will apologize personally.   All right.  But every day between now and November, we must work together  to elect more lawmakers who share our values, cherish our heritage, and  proudly stand for life.  And that is a great group of people I introduced.   I can tell you that.  We're also glad to be joined by a beloved member of  my administration, a true fighter for faith and family, and your 2018  distinguished leader, Kellyanne Conway.  Kellyanne.  What a job --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Sorry.  The president of course speaking introduction  luminaries there at the gala and we will dip back in if there is some  breaking news or he stumbles upon something that you need to hear about it  because you got it right here, baby.  There have been some major twists in  President Trump's scheduled meeting with Kim Jong-un.  The president saying  he no longer likes the North Korean dictator's attitude and casting doubt  that the meeting will happen at all.  Watch this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If it doesn't happen, maybe it will happen later.  Maybe it will  happen at a different time.  But we will see.  But we are talking.  The  meeting is scheduled as you know on June 12th in Singapore.  And whether or  not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon, but we're talking right now. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Talking may not be good enough.  We're being told Kim Jong-un  may have second thoughts about giving up all of his nuclear weapons.  The  president today said the dictator would be making a huge mistake by walking  away from this all-important table.  And just yesterday, Vice President  Pence told our own Martha MacCallum that if he keeps his nukes, the  situation could end really, really badly.  Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It would be a great  mistake for Kim Jong-un to think he could play Donald Trump.  The truth is  that President Trump has made it clear that this administration will not  tolerate the regime in North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and ballistic  missiles that threaten our people, that threaten the United States of  America , that threaten our allies in the region. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The vice president went on to say that North Korea will end up  like Libya if it doesn't make a deal.  And we all remember how that ended.   The country was destroyed.  Muammar Gaddafi was murdered in the street by  rebels.  Wow.  So will Kim Jong-un play ball or is the meeting and the  possible Nobel Prize out the window?  With me now Fox Business Reporter  Edward Lawrence with all the details.  Edward. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kennedy, this  is the first time that we're hearing the president actually say that the  meeting may not go forward on June 12th.  However, the State Department is  saying that they are working towards that date and only that date. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  I do have a real sense that  he would -- he would find American investment, American technology,  American know how of real value to his people.  If we get this right and we  get the denuclearization right, America wouldn't be quite capable of  delivering them with lots of things that would make life better for the  North Korean people. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  And President Trump saying that he personally guarantees the  safety of Kim Jong-un at the meeting in Singapore.  He president going on  to say that he recognizes that fact that Kim Jong-un would be the person to  lead his people into the future.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I would say that we are looking certainly right now at two Koreas,  two very successful Koreas.  You're going to have a very, very successful  North Korea and you're going to have a very successful and you already do,  South Korea. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now, all of this is predicated on denuclearization.  And right  now, there's a group of journalists from the United States, from China,  Russia, and the United Kingdom that are expected to witness the North  Koreans actually taking down, demolishing one of their nuclear sites.  Now,  whether in the area has delayed that trip.  It is expected to happen again  today or tomorrow their time, Kennedy. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, same thing.  Edward, thank you so much.  All right.  So  Kim -- can Kim Jong-un be trusted to keep his word?  And is China throwing  a monkey wrench into the work?  That question answers itself.  It certainly  is fuzz bud.  Just let me bring in former CIA operative Mike Baker, also  the President of Diligence LLC.  Welcome back to the show, Mike. </p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC:  Thank you very much, Kennedy.  Thank  you.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely.  The president says that Kim Jong-un's attitude  needs an adjustment since his most of recent chat with President Xi  Jinping.  What do you think about China's meddling in a situation they're  not necessarily a part of? </p><p>BAKER:  Well, in that you just -- that last part of your sentence is  important to note.  What China wants to insure is that they're relevant in  these conversations.  And they made that fairly clear over the past couple  of months.  But, look, nobody is surprised by sort of the posturing that's  taking place on both sides leading into this.  This is an historic  potentially defining moment.  Even if the summit occurs and nothing happens  after that and we can't get through the lengthy negotiations to get some  type of deal signed, just getting to this point almost being at the table  is an historic moment given how many years we've spent kicking the can down  the road with a fairly feckless foreign policy towards North Korea.  So I  think that the administration has been pretty clear in stating that they  understand this could be problematic and saying they're going to walk away  from the table.  It is interesting to note that aside from the fact you  can't swing a dead cat without hitting a North Korea expert these days.   It's also interesting to know that you got members of the resistance and  some members of the media who seemed almost hoping for this thing to fall  apart.  And if you find yourself rooting against peace on the peninsula  because you don't like President Trump, then you might want to rethink your  priorities. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I absolutely agree with you about that.  And I think there is  a time and a place for resistance.  I think there are certainly instances  where you have to hold the president accountable for the things the he says  and does.  But here I think, you know, this is an area where we have to be  as supportive as possible because a peaceful ending to this situation is  critical.  It's paramount.  Now, what's interesting and something that you  have pointed out is obviously there are issues with the Iran deal.  And you  have noted that part of the issue is because President Obama was so  impatient, and he was so dead set on landing that deal that he really  compromise our position there.  So would you caution this president against  doing the same thing with North Korea? </p><p>BAKER:  Right.  And, again, they've been very been clear in saying over the  past many weeks that they'd be willing to get up from the table and walk  away.  But what they have to be careful about is as you get closer and  closer to that potential meeting on the 12th of June, you have to be  careful that you feel so invested in this now, and you -- you're so keen to  get this going.  But you have to step back, take a breath, and understand  that, as you said, the previous administration, the Obama administration,  you know, they had their knickers in such a twist over the desire to get a  deal, any deal, that they were willing to overlook the problems with the  deal and they were willing to accept all the requests and concessions and  demands that the Iranian regime put into that deal.  And so, you know, and  again, with anything that takes place in this world of weapons agreements  whether you're talking about conventional weapons, nuclear weapons,  biological or chemical weapons really at the end of the day what matters  more than anything else is verification. </p><p>Trust but verify.  If you can't verify and the Iranian example is a good  one because it was in the deal.  We were not allowed to inspect military  sites.  So, yes, were they complying as people who were supporting that the  deal say?  Well, they were complying with it.  Yes, we got -- they were  complying with what was written in the deal.  But we had no verification  capability for any of their military sites.  And frankly, that's like  saying you're a serial killer.  You allow the police to come into your home  and search it, but you can't go in the basement and look around.  So we get  to be really careful and if we do get to that hard difficult point where  we're actually trying to pen a deal.  If we can't get verification locked  down with this, we didn't have it with the Syrian chemical issue.  We  didn't have it in the past on occasion with the Russians --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  -- trust Russia because they said they got rid of all Syria's  chemical weapons.  And he also said that we're fine in Iran because he read  the deal, and it's super solid, and they have no desire to manufacture any  fissile material or use those in drills to make big --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BAKER:  That was their investment.  They were so -- they were so keen as  you pointed out.  So keen to get that deal, so we have to be careful.  The  Trump administration has to be able to say, no, we're not going to sit down  if what appears to be as the North Koreas are making demands and  concessions that we can't accept, don't even sit at the table, and much  less walk away.  Just don't sit down at that point.  Everybody understands  this is an incredibly complex issue between us, North Korea, South Korea,  China, Japan, you know, but this is -- again, it's worth pursuing and as  you pointed out, everybody regardless of your political position should be  willing to root for peace on the peninsula or an effort to get there. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Pretend the U.S. is actually in the World Cup, it's like that.   Everyone wants team USA to win.  Mike Baker, thank you so much. </p><p>BAKER:  What -- the World Cup is what?  That's soccer? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  All right.  That's enough.  All right.  Dear, come on.  Let it  go.  Come on, man.  It's a beautiful game and you're a lovely person, so  thanks again.  Today, former President Jimmy -- oh, Jimmy Carter said he  thinks the president would deserve the Nobel Prize if he manages -- that's  a big if.  He's really qualifying this.  To get the North Koreans to give  up their nukes, but is the President Trump really thinking about canceling  the meeting or is possible that he's just being a showman and amping up the  drama?  Let me go to my military grade party pane tonight, she's an editor  at Townhall.com and a Fox News Contributor, Katie Pavlich is here.  He is a  spokesperson at Young Voices and host of the podcast Beltway Banthas, it's  Stephen Kent, and he is the host of \"YOUR WELCOME\", that's a podcast and  author of the book, Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim  Jong-il, he's got a license too, Michael Malice is back.  Our resident  actual North Korea expert. </p><p>MICHAEL MALICE, HOST, YOUR WELCOME SHOW:  I'm no Mike Baker. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Come on, man --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MALICE:  -- with a dead cat apparently. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I don't think he was talking about you. </p><p>MALICE:  That's true. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to read you Jimmy Carter's quote because I think -- I  want to -- I want to get your feeling on this.  He's talking about if  they're under constant belief that the United States wants to attack them  meaning North Korea even using nuclear weapons and that we are destroying  their economy and they know that they're starving to death primarily  because the United States withholds food aid for instance, just giving them  surplus food that we can never use.  I can understand how they feel. </p><p>MALICE:  Well, let me give you a little bit of background about Jimmy  Carter and North Korea.  He went there in 1994 and tried to broker a deal  with the great leader Kim Il-sung.  And five years ago today I posted a  quote from North Korean propaganda about their meeting and this is what  they said Jimmy Carter said, \"President Kim Il-sung is a person in whom  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, those popular  three presidents of the United States early in its history are put  together.\"  So that actually did not happen.  But the point is, North Korea  withheld food from getting to its citizenry in the '90s because Kim Jong-il  specifically said, if we allow the U.N. to feed the population, the  government will be superfluous.  So that's absolutely not true that they  would be willing to accept food. </p><p>And if they did accept food, they would claim it's coming from the leader,  so it's false in that regard.  It's absolutely true that they think we're  going to invade at any minute because you see people all over the news  right now blatantly saying John Bolton had a -- entry in the Wall Street  Journal that even South Korea is against it.  We have the unilateral right  to strike if they develop nuclear capabilities.  And when President Bush  said the axis of evil is Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.  This is clearly a  kill list of the three countries he wants to take out.  So they are right  to be afraid.  And again, if most people in this country don't trust  themselves to disarm and give up their guns and trust the federal  government, why would the North Korean government thinking differently? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And they have gotten so many resources over the years that  they could have used to feed their people.  I mean you don't build a multi- billion dollar nuclear weapons program unless you have money. </p><p>MALICE:  And lastly, the have something called Sung Bun and the used food  is a mechanism to control, so that the more loyal you are to the  government, the more likely you are to receive food. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And we're going to talk about that same thing happening in  Venezuela.  But I want to get back here because we've heard a lot about the  Libyan model and it was something that John Bolton said in regards to  denuclearizing North Korea, you know, which is essentially can be by force  with a very sad ending for the leader of either Libya or North Korea.  It  wasn't just something that John Bolton said offhandedly months ago in an  interview.  This is now something that Vice President Pence has legitimized  by using the same term.  So do you think that we are on a march to war if  in fact the meeting doesn't take place? </p><p>STEPHEN KENT, HOST, BELTWAY BANTHAS PODCAST:  I don't think we're on a  march to war.  But I'm stunned that Mike Pence then echo that comment from  John Bolton because that seemed incredibly ill-advice.  They need to keep  that comment and John Bolton off television for the next three weeks if  they're going to make this meeting happen.  He instills this sense of  distrust with the North Korean regime.  And Michael is absolutely right  when he mentioned, you know, like trying to step away from their guns being  their WMD's.  Like -- they're like the cultists in Waco, like you cannot  threaten them in this way.  Their weapons are the only thing that make them  feel secure, so this march towards total denuclearization or else is not  going to work in this case.  We need to be a little bit more gentle here. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  You know, I was talking to Gordon Chang a few weeks ago and he  said they still have a conventional military which is actually a bigger  practical threat to the region and it's much easier for them to go ahead  and bomb South Korea.  They don't -- they don't have to use nukes in order  to inflict a lot of damage.  So even if you take their nuclear program  away, they still have the ability to defend themselves. </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  That's always been the  concern that they'll use artillery power against Seoul, South Korea which  is right there across the border. This conversation you just had goes back  to why this has never worked out and why very administration has had a  failure when it comes to reining in North Korea's program.  They are so far  apart and although in the last couple of months we've seen things come  together on the surface.  When it comes to principles what the North  Koreans are willing to do which is not giving up their nuclear arms, the  negotiation now is about what denuclearization actually means and what the  United States requires which is complete denuclearization of the peninsula.   And the of course, there's China which is playing a role and saying, we  can't ask North Korea to completely give up their nukes.  However, we think  that they should be limited in their capacity.  And by the way, we don't  want any of the fallout when it comes to the regime -- </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  No.  China wants control and they want North Korea to be  dependent and they also want to have as much influence as possible on the  Korean Peninsula.  My question is, does South Korea -- with South Korea and  we're running out of time, so this has to beautiful quick answer.  Would  South Korea rather work with the United States in resolving this situation? </p><p>PAVLICH:  I think ultimately, yes.  I mean the United States is an ally.   We're doing military excises.  The United States has repeatedly said we are  not taking military -- legal military exercises off the table in exchange  for denuclearization of North Korea.  But again, the gap here is very wide  and it feels like we're back to the beginning of why this hasn't work out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's where we five seconds. </p><p>PAVLICH:  Katie gets it perfectly. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Oh, very good, Michael Malice for taking the baton and looking  very classily.  The panel return a little bit later because how could they  not.  Plus, the plot thickens in the White House.  Republican lawmakers now  calling for a second special counsel to investigate the possibility the  feds had politically motivated spies in the Trump campaign.  And now the  president has weighed in.  I'll tell you what  he said.  Chris Stirewalt  joins me next for reaction. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  We got news alert now.  We just learned that the business  partner of President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen has  agreed to cooperate with the government as part of a plea deal.  Evgeny  Friedman, I know I'm not saying that right.  Is the note -- no.  Michael  Malice is shaking his head seriously.  He's got a whiplash.  He's a Russian  immigrant known as the taxi king.  Legal expert say this puts greater  pressure on Cohen to cooperate with the Mueller probe, but the president  says the real issue with the alleged spying on his campaign during the  election.  Watch. </p><p>TRUMP:  A lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign.  If they  had spies in my campaign, that would be a disgrace to this country.  That  would be one of the biggest insults that anyone has ever seen and it would  be very illegal aside from everything else.  It would make probably every  political event ever look like small potatoes. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Small potatoes?  Delicious though.  Michael Cohen cooperating  with the government would certainly be no picnic for the president.  But is  he right to say the election spying is the biggest concern here.  Joining  me now Fox News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt back in action.  Welcome  back. </p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Indeed.  All right.  So let's talk about this.  Spies in my  campaign, is that the biggest issue of all if that is in fact true? </p><p>STIREWALT:  The biggest issue in political history the president says --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Maybe ever. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Maybe ever which they're saying something.  I mean the fall of  Roman stuff was a pretty big deal.  Look, the president says that there  were spies, and this is a good narrative for him.  This helps him with his  base to talk about him as the real victim and the deep state, and it was  really Obama and Clinton, and he's the victim here.  He's not the  perpetuator.  But instead, he's the victim.  And it -- and especially  during a midterm where he desperately wants not to lose the house because  that would create a whole new set of pressures on him in terms of  investigations and conceivably impeachment that he wants to keep  Republicans with him and a good way to do that is to say that he's not the  offender here, that the system -- that he is the victim of the system. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I truly believe that he believes he is not the offender.  He  believes he has done nothing wrong.  And he's just, you know, as a  negotiator does, if something doesn't succeed the first time you go about  it from different angles.  But is there something to this story?  Is it  possible that there were politically motivated operatives who were reaching  out to people of on the Trump campaign getting information to give back to  the FBI? </p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, if they can put cheese in the can and have it spray out  on a cracker that was anything --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  What a great invention. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Anything is possible.  But I don't know.  I mean I cover  politics.  But I do know this that there is an inspector general's report  that is in process about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's  mishandling of state secrets.  We're waiting for that in just the next  coming days.  And then hot on the heels of that one from the inspector  general from the Department of Justice, Mr. Horowitz, is a report on the --  an investigation of the investigation into the Russian meddling and Trump's  campaign, and that rashmitas.  So I'm going to wait and find out, just like  I'm going to wait and find out what Mueller actually has as opposed to all  of these chatter dancing that people are doing around this stuff.  I don't  know.  So I'm just going to wait until I find that. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I mean if there was a coordinated effort between James Clapper  and John Brennan and James Comey, you know, if that's not a politicized  trifecta, I don't know from my politicized trifecta, and I have a menagerie  of them in a green room.</p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, look, if that was so and they conspired together against  Donald Trump, well, that would be very bad.  But we don't know that.  We  don't have that evidence just like we don't have evidence that the  president colluded with Russia.  We just have -- the best I can do at this  point especially since we now have hopes that much of this will be  concluded by the end of the summer.  All I can do as a political forecaster  is say, we'll have enough information to know how this is going to affect  the midterms, how are Republicans going to respond to this.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And I think the deployment of these types of informant is not  only possible.  I think it is plausible given the amount of -- the  capability of these various organizations whether it's the NSA, or CIA, or  FBI, or DEA spy on Americans.  They have the tools.  It would not surprise  me if there are people who would abuse that power for their own benefit.   And I hope that's not the case.  I hope we live in a country where that  kind of power is checked.  So far Congress keeps codifying it and that is  also terrifying.  Chris Stirewalt, thank you so much. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Bottom line and every day of the week young man.  Very good. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Quite so. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes.  Coming up, Venezuela, the hell hole where a month's  salary can't even buy a cup of coffee.  People are so hungry they resorted  to eating zoo animals.  They just re-elected their president with nearly 70  percent of the vote.  Do you smell something fishy like a rotting zebra  carcass?  More examples of socialism destroying society in the monologue  next.  Stay here. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Crappy socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro was elected to  another six-year term in Venezuela.  Yes.  And the equally corrupted  authoritarian Turkish president campaigned for him, so they could share in  the farcical fun.  Leaders like Maduro, Erdogan, and Putin hate freedom  because it gives filthy peasants too much they empower over their own  lives.  They liquidate government holdings to enrich themselves in their  select cronies, and they steal from poor people who live horrible short  lives before they die in squalor.  It is no surprise these liberty loathers  create an access of a-holes.  They need to sow discord in the world's most  powerful economy because a truly free market disrupts their tyrannical  buggery -- signaling widespread discontent.  President Trump has signed an  executive order that bans U.S. citizens from snapping up Venezuelan  bargains from the state fire sale.  When people try to profit off this  desperation, they are further imprisoning the poorest among them who cannot  leave the country.  There has been a mass exodus of doctors, nurses,  teachers, engineers, and anyone else who has the means to escape the  tightening news of cruel socialism.  Anyone who can get out has fled, while  those trapped there are enduring inflation that's already at nearly 14,000  percent.  Plus, soaring malnutrition infant and maternal mortality rates  that are also going up and are being undertreated at vacant hospitals.  All  fraudulent elections should be condemned, including those in Turkey and  Russia.  And we need to be doubly mindful not to indulge amateur socialist  in this country.  Because even though a Bernie Sanders presidency is a  joke, the consequences of diet communism are deadly serious.  And that's  the memo.  </p><p>Oh, hi, great to see me.  That was swift.  How long Nicolas Maduro possibly  hang on to power as people are starving, his economy is ruined, the murder  rate is one of the highest in the world, and all indicators suggest things  are only going to get worse.  So, what can we do to fix this failed  socialist experiment before it turns into another Somalia?  The party panel  is back: Katie Pavlich, Stephen Kent, and Michael Malice.  Katie, I don't  think this is the worst-case-scenario.  I don't think this is a black swan  country undergoing some bad luck.  I think this is the natural ultimate end  of socialism and communism.  What do you think?</p><p>PAVLICH:  People argue, you know, this isn't real socialism or this isn't  real communism.  No, this is what it is.  In 1999, Venezuela decide to go  from more of a free market system to a socialist country to spend more  money on welfare.  This is exactly what we've seen as a result of that.   Now, Maduro is out there this week, on video in this bizarre way -- waving  to crowds that don't exist who applaud him on his re-election by 70  percent.  The United States has condemned the election results.  And the  question is, where do we go from here?  Not only in Venezuela but as the  United States because there are American interests there and there are  foreign policy implications of the regime collapsing.  The Venezuelans are  fleeing in large numbers.  As you mentioned in your monologue that most of  important people in the country who are, you know, doctors, nurses are  leaving.  But regular people are getting out because they are so desperate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Giving on buses in getting out of the country.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Liberals, socialist Utopia that is now existing in Venezuela as a  result of these principles, not a mistake.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Malice?</p><p>MALICE:  What I would like to see happen because there's only so much we  can do in Venezuela.  Every politician who was a segregationist racist had  to disavow, have to turn their backs, and had to be publicly humiliated,  had to be (INAUDIBLE) for decades.  So why are Michael Moore, and Bernie  Sanders, and Jeremy Corbin in the U.K., all of the people who said  Venezuela is a great thing, a great experiment, why do they not run on the  public square and thrown tomatoes at where they go?  You have children  bleeding to death on hospital beds, you have people starving.  Again, they  shoot into crowds when people try to protest.  To have anyone who's in  politics for this, not take responsibility for it, and still begin a  microphone, I think, is disgraceful.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And it's only getting worse,  and worse, and worse.  It's actually getting exponentially worse as  inflation rises, and the poorest people, they are the ones who can't afford  to feed their kids.  They never had to treat malnutrition five years ago.   And now that condition has gone up 100 folds in hospitals that we have no  doctors.  So, what do we do?  Do we do anything as the United States?  </p><p>KENT:  Well, there's again, limited tools in our tool kit to deal with this  situation.  We're not going to invade Venezuela.  We shouldn't.  And  sanctions are something that we have to be delicate with as well, because  we want to target the elite in that country who are abusing and starving  their people without then, actually, hurting the people who live in that  country and are not able to leave.  We are mentioning that doctors and  everyone who are able to flee.  You know, the oil industry runs basically  the only leftover economy that's there, but it only benefits the wealthy.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's absolutely right.  And that's what they did.  I  mean, it is a state-run industry.  They've got so much oil, which was  great, and they were profitable when oil prices were high.  But when they  tanked -- </p><p>MALICE:  This is atlas shrugged comes to life.  This is exactly the  (INAUDIBLE).  Take out excessive business having the government running,  and then how long it takes for people to be --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And you know, when atlas shrugged, that's when the people are  holding up the economy, they leave.  They're exhausted.</p><p>MALICE:  And if the poor and the weak were the first to suffer.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's absolutely right and suffer the longest.  Well, back  here at home, I mean, we're really suffering, right?  Because House Speaker  Paul Ryan is facing renewed pressure to step down from his perch before his  term ends.  The administration maybe nudging the effort along.  White House  Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, reportedly said he has spoken with House  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about ousting Ryan, adding: \"Wouldn't it be  great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut  up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election.  That's a  really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do  it.\"  Now, Mulvaney says he's supportive of the speaker.  And McCarthy said  he's never even talked to Mulvaney about it.  So, should House Republicans  plan a mutiny, Katie?  </p><p>MALICE:  We always hear word of a mutiny whenever there's any kind of  speakers raised.  Jim Jordan, other than the hundred conservatives that  came out and sign the letters saying they want him to run for speaker.   Paul Ryan will likely out his term as speaker of the house.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He's not going to get pushed out of the way?</p><p>PAVLICH:  You know, I don't know.  I mean, the thing is, as they say in  Washington, D.C.: if you want a friend, get a dog.  And although, Kevin  McCarthy and Paul Ryan have been very close for the last couple of years,  not only just in leadership as Paul Ryan came out through the ranks in the  House, from the Ways and Means Committee.  I doubt that McCarthy is going  to actually push Paul Ryan out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  They want Jim to working at job.</p><p>KENT:  No, money talks.  Paul Ryan brought in 11.9 million in the first  quarter of the Republican.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's why Nancy Pelosi is still around.  </p><p>KENT:  So, yes, put up or shut up.  Everybody else who wants that job.   They're not going to move him out as long as they need to raise money for  these mid-term elections which are going to be contentious.  I also would  like to see Paul Ryan finish out this job because we need, we need him to  finish and have a legitimate open-run election.  Kevin McCarthy cannot be  nominated for this.  Nobody really wants him in the Republican --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Is there a benefit to chaos?  </p><p>MALICE:  Look at the last Republican speaker.  You have ambassador of the  Vatican's wife, you have this lobster who's selling marijuana.  Dennis  Hastert, we can't even discuss on air.  And now, we have the guy who Mitt  Romney made his beta.  So, this is quite a cast of characters.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He is his Robin.</p><p>MALICE:  Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, he really is.  I love Paul Rhino.  I love the term Paul  Rhino.  I think Paul Ryan has completely turned his back on his principles.  </p><p>MALICE:  But in 2012, Romney needed to play the base, and he chose Ryan.   And that's how far the Republican Party has gone to the right, but even  Ryan is regardless of the left --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, Ryan and a slap on the base.  You know, I want to thank  you all for being here, because you are good friends, you are allies of  freedom, and you are delightful people.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Thank you for having us.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Freedoms and my feels.  Michael, Stephen, and Katie Pavlich,  thank you all.  Coming up, Cops say Amazon's new facial recognition  technology is helping them identify suspects in crime.  But the privacy  police are sounding alarm bells.  Emily Compagno joins me with the details.   Hi, Emily!  She's coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The future is now.  And I don't know if I like it.  Amazon has  some fancy new facial recognition technology and they're selling it to  police departments for $6.00 a month.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well,  a lot.  Which is why the ACLU is asking the tech giant to stop marketing  the tool to law enforcement agencies -- fearing it could be used to invade  your privacy.  Amazon respond to the ACLU's request with a statement that  read in quote: \"Amazon requires the customers comply with the law and be  responsible when they use Amazon Web Service (AWS).  When we find that AWS  services are being abused by a customer, we suspend that customer's right  to use our services.\"  Now, I would never add the cape for government  regulation to fix a problem like this, but should we be concerned about our  civil liberties and privacy when a tech giant like amazon combines with  government?  Let me ask former Criminal Defense Attorney and Legal Analyst,  Emily Compagno, she is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.  Emily,  welcome back to the show.  </p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND LEGAL ANALYST:  So, let's  discuss this.  What is the down side to selling facial recognition  technology on the cheap to law enforcement?  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  ACLU and others are arguing, look, there's a high  capacity for abuse here.  So, they argue this isn't akin to just an  extension of photography.  They say, this is akin to walking through mass  protests and asking for identification for every single person there.  They  argue this can be used to follow immigrants by ICE, this can be used to  identify any random person on a street corner.  So, they kind of have the  same arguments that they have for all existing surveillance programs, which  is where is the limit, right?  And they argue that, although it's not  different from other facial recognition program.  Here, they site that what  is problematic is Amazon's aggressive marketing to law enforcement agencies  and the fact that the reach is so prolific.  So, that's what they're  arguing here.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And that's one of things that has always concerned me, whether  it's Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other social media platform.  You  know, these big tech companies getting in bed with the government, whether  it's military or law enforcement, the consequences can be dire.  They're  not always dire.  We want our law enforcement agencies to have tools and  have technology so they can keep us safe.  The problem is when these things  malfunction.  My iPhone X recognizes my face about half the time, and it's  not because I'm a supermodel but a lot of people say that.  It's because  this technology isn't perfect.  And you know, I don't trust that the facial  recognition software wouldn't recognize the wrong person.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  Which is part of the argument and, you know, on the  other side, law enforcement agencies are arguing: look, you know, we're not  there yet.  It's important to us that the community understands what it's  being used for just as crucially as what it's not.  And they site the fact  that, you know, this has been used for surveillance footage matching from  burglaries, from what's picked up from CCTV.  They argue this has been used  to find abducted children or missing children in amusement parks.  It was  even used actually this weekend at the royal wedding of now duke and  duchess of Sussex for what royals had attended, right?  Sky News used.  So,  it's important that they feel the community that they --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to know the difference between David Beckham and Serena  Williams.  Because there were some people on other networks who didn't  really know the difference.  And that's a wonderful private application of  that tool essentially for entertainment.  I don't want to be arrested for a  crime that Kate Upton has committed because we look so similar.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes, and I do want to point out, though, that there's a bit of  hyperbole I see here in terms of the narrative that these free speech firms  and companies are pushing forward.  And here's one in particular, they cite  that this can now be used at airports which is a public place, they argue.   We're now in this climate of protesting and robust participation.  They  claim that there could be a chilling factor, but I want to point out that  airports for example are not public places for purposes of free speech.   It's been long held at the first, second, and fourth amendment are actually  restricted there.  So, in terms of the conversation surrounding this, to me  it's important that the narrative isn't subjects to that kind of hyperbolic  quality, because to me, it just increases the chasm between law enforcement  and what they're trying to do, and then lawful protected right to privacy  that we have without kind of muddying the water.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely, understand.  And I think there is so much more to  discuss and address here.  I really appreciate your perspective.  Thank you  so much, Emily.  Great to talk to you again. </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  \"TOPICAL STORM\" is next.  It's a good one.  Stay here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The NYPD is looking for a group of gunmen who robbed a  Walgreen's pharmacy while wearing clown masks.  Witnesses say, there could  be as many as 15 of them.  They were last seen fleeing one tiny car.  Be on  the lookout for a many, because this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\" </p><p>Topic number one.  We begin tonight in Houston, Texas, where everybody  knows that if you're going to drive on the highway, you're going to need  plenty of horse power.  Look at this.  Oh, mercy!  The Belmont state aren't  for another three weeks but this fellow is already getting in a good  workout.  In any other state, the sight of horse on a highway might have  caused a 12-car pile-up.  But in (INAUDIBLE) they're like, it's probably  going out for more beer.  Anything a couple of cars high beams so, they  could pass.  Now, fortunately some good Samaritans were able to steer it  off the road, and police have since returned though, of course, to its  owner but not before issuing a ticket for using the carpooling without a  passenger.  Rules are rules, pal.  Get a (INAUDIBLE) next time.</p><p>Topic number two.  There it is.  A Florida City issued a zombie alert to  its citizens.  And we'd like to think it was an accident, but you never  know in Florida.  A storm caused a blackout on Sunday that led the  residents of Lake Worth, Florida, to get an alert that read: Zombie --  power outage and zombie alert for the residents of Lake Worth and Terminus.   There are now far less than 7300 customers involved due to extreme zombie  activity.  Now, Terminus is a fictitious town from the hit T.V. show \"The  Walking Dead\".  Its inclusion in the message led cops to believe it was a  prank.  Great police, fellows.  Well done.  It's unlikely someone confused  the state of Florida and \"The Walking Dead\" because the two couldn't be  more different.  One is an apocalyptic wasteland of human oddities, and the  other is a T.V. show.  That's right.  </p><p>Topic number three.  If you're a cop in the city of Cleveland, long enough  you'll see everything -- except for a Browns Super Bowl championship.  But  these cops, they don't need a championship to party.  The officers  responded to this block party to cut the noise, but they wound up cutting a  rug because not even a horse can resist it.  It's so addictive.  We have a  staffer named Courtney who does it all the time in the office.  She's very  special.  The video of the dancing cops has taken off across the country,  and so has their other police horse.  There I go again on my own.  Turns  out he'll be shuffling papers behind his desk because he's been suspended  for not tying up his horse.  </p><p>Topic number four.  There it is.  Thanks to Bunk Breaker for this one.   Women's soccer legend, Brandy Chastain, was inducted into the Bay Area hall  of fame this week.  But the person who may brand these flack, must drink a  few brandies before going into the studio.  The women's soccer legend  became famous for whipping off her jersey after hitting the winning penalty  kick in the 1999 World Cup.  She was an international (INAUDIBLE), but  apparently, she's now a trucker named Gill, who likes beef jerky and lot  lizard.  The Internet says she looks like Gary Busey, so either way slice  it, she's looks like someone who is little nuts.  She looks like she's a  transitioning Elizabeth Warren without glasses.  You can't make this up,  unlike Elizabeth's heritage.  The hall of fame has since apologized and  offered to make a new plaque.  And perhaps, not surprisingly Brandi, has  graciously accepted their offer.  We reached out to the plaque maker for  comment but he was at the vet with his seeing eye dog.  </p><p>Topic number five.  Perhaps no athlete is more disappointed than Tonya  Harding who did not win the top prize in last night's \"Dancing with the  Stars\" finale.  Someday, historians will remember this as the end of the  #kneetoo movement.  Figure skater Adam Rippon took home the win, and Lord  knows he'll need the prize money, because competing against Tonya Harding  can cost you an arm and a leg.  If you don't believe me, ask Nancy  Kerrigan.  NFL Star, Josh Norman, with the other runner-up in the first  all-athlete season.  It was also the first season of all famous people.   Usually, that show is a who's who of people that make you say, who?  Her  T.V. comeback may be over, but don't feel bad for Tonya because she just  joined a new dance troupe who are very familiar with her work.  Is he going  to get the police?  (INAUDIBLE) felony.  If only she had this much rhythm  in last night's finale.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Thank you so much for watching this show tonight.

Let's take  a live look and listen to President Trump.  He's speaking at the Susan B.  Anthony List 11th Annual Campaign for Life Gala at the National Building  Museum in Washington, D.C.  Let's go. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I watch him all the time.  I  don't know him well, but I'll get to know him.  John Rutherford, where is  he, John?  Central casting.  Great job, John.  He's always defending me.   Actually, most of you are always defending me and that's OK.  And from my  neck of the woods, Claudia Kenny.  Thank you, Claudia.  Thank you.  And for  those many that I have left out, I'm sorry.  But I say, give me a totally  complete list and I will call you tomorrow and I will apologize personally.   All right.  But every day between now and November, we must work together  to elect more lawmakers who share our values, cherish our heritage, and  proudly stand for life.  And that is a great group of people I introduced.   I can tell you that.  We're also glad to be joined by a beloved member of  my administration, a true fighter for faith and family, and your 2018  distinguished leader, Kellyanne Conway.  Kellyanne.  What a job --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Sorry.  The president of course speaking introduction  luminaries there at the gala and we will dip back in if there is some  breaking news or he stumbles upon something that you need to hear about it  because you got it right here, baby.  There have been some major twists in  President Trump's scheduled meeting with Kim Jong-un.  The president saying  he no longer likes the North Korean dictator's attitude and casting doubt  that the meeting will happen at all.  Watch this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If it doesn't happen, maybe it will happen later.  Maybe it will  happen at a different time.  But we will see.  But we are talking.  The  meeting is scheduled as you know on June 12th in Singapore.  And whether or  not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon, but we're talking right now. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Talking may not be good enough.  We're being told Kim Jong-un  may have second thoughts about giving up all of his nuclear weapons.  The  president today said the dictator would be making a huge mistake by walking  away from this all-important table.  And just yesterday, Vice President  Pence told our own Martha MacCallum that if he keeps his nukes, the  situation could end really, really badly.  Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It would be a great  mistake for Kim Jong-un to think he could play Donald Trump.  The truth is  that President Trump has made it clear that this administration will not  tolerate the regime in North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and ballistic  missiles that threaten our people, that threaten the United States of  America , that threaten our allies in the region. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The vice president went on to say that North Korea will end up  like Libya if it doesn't make a deal.  And we all remember how that ended.   The country was destroyed.  Muammar Gaddafi was murdered in the street by  rebels.  Wow.  So will Kim Jong-un play ball or is the meeting and the  possible Nobel Prize out the window?  With me now Fox Business Reporter  Edward Lawrence with all the details.  Edward. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kennedy, this  is the first time that we're hearing the president actually say that the  meeting may not go forward on June 12th.  However, the State Department is  saying that they are working towards that date and only that date. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  I do have a real sense that  he would -- he would find American investment, American technology,  American know how of real value to his people.  If we get this right and we  get the denuclearization right, America wouldn't be quite capable of  delivering them with lots of things that would make life better for the  North Korean people. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  And President Trump saying that he personally guarantees the  safety of Kim Jong-un at the meeting in Singapore.  He president going on  to say that he recognizes that fact that Kim Jong-un would be the person to  lead his people into the future.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I would say that we are looking certainly right now at two Koreas,  two very successful Koreas.  You're going to have a very, very successful  North Korea and you're going to have a very successful and you already do,  South Korea. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now, all of this is predicated on denuclearization.  And right  now, there's a group of journalists from the United States, from China,  Russia, and the United Kingdom that are expected to witness the North  Koreans actually taking down, demolishing one of their nuclear sites.  Now,  whether in the area has delayed that trip.  It is expected to happen again  today or tomorrow their time, Kennedy. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, same thing.  Edward, thank you so much.  All right.  So  Kim -- can Kim Jong-un be trusted to keep his word?  And is China throwing  a monkey wrench into the work?  That question answers itself.  It certainly  is fuzz bud.  Just let me bring in former CIA operative Mike Baker, also  the President of Diligence LLC.  Welcome back to the show, Mike. </p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE LLC:  Thank you very much, Kennedy.  Thank  you.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely.  The president says that Kim Jong-un's attitude  needs an adjustment since his most of recent chat with President Xi  Jinping.  What do you think about China's meddling in a situation they're  not necessarily a part of? </p><p>BAKER:  Well, in that you just -- that last part of your sentence is  important to note.  What China wants to insure is that they're relevant in  these conversations.  And they made that fairly clear over the past couple  of months.  But, look, nobody is surprised by sort of the posturing that's  taking place on both sides leading into this.  This is an historic  potentially defining moment.  Even if the summit occurs and nothing happens  after that and we can't get through the lengthy negotiations to get some  type of deal signed, just getting to this point almost being at the table  is an historic moment given how many years we've spent kicking the can down  the road with a fairly feckless foreign policy towards North Korea.  So I  think that the administration has been pretty clear in stating that they  understand this could be problematic and saying they're going to walk away  from the table.  It is interesting to note that aside from the fact you  can't swing a dead cat without hitting a North Korea expert these days.   It's also interesting to know that you got members of the resistance and  some members of the media who seemed almost hoping for this thing to fall  apart.  And if you find yourself rooting against peace on the peninsula  because you don't like President Trump, then you might want to rethink your  priorities. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I absolutely agree with you about that.  And I think there is  a time and a place for resistance.  I think there are certainly instances  where you have to hold the president accountable for the things the he says  and does.  But here I think, you know, this is an area where we have to be  as supportive as possible because a peaceful ending to this situation is  critical.  It's paramount.  Now, what's interesting and something that you  have pointed out is obviously there are issues with the Iran deal.  And you  have noted that part of the issue is because President Obama was so  impatient, and he was so dead set on landing that deal that he really  compromise our position there.  So would you caution this president against  doing the same thing with North Korea? </p><p>BAKER:  Right.  And, again, they've been very been clear in saying over the  past many weeks that they'd be willing to get up from the table and walk  away.  But what they have to be careful about is as you get closer and  closer to that potential meeting on the 12th of June, you have to be  careful that you feel so invested in this now, and you -- you're so keen to  get this going.  But you have to step back, take a breath, and understand  that, as you said, the previous administration, the Obama administration,  you know, they had their knickers in such a twist over the desire to get a  deal, any deal, that they were willing to overlook the problems with the  deal and they were willing to accept all the requests and concessions and  demands that the Iranian regime put into that deal.  And so, you know, and  again, with anything that takes place in this world of weapons agreements  whether you're talking about conventional weapons, nuclear weapons,  biological or chemical weapons really at the end of the day what matters  more than anything else is verification. </p><p>Trust but verify.  If you can't verify and the Iranian example is a good  one because it was in the deal.  We were not allowed to inspect military  sites.  So, yes, were they complying as people who were supporting that the  deal say?  Well, they were complying with it.  Yes, we got -- they were  complying with what was written in the deal.  But we had no verification  capability for any of their military sites.  And frankly, that's like  saying you're a serial killer.  You allow the police to come into your home  and search it, but you can't go in the basement and look around.  So we get  to be really careful and if we do get to that hard difficult point where  we're actually trying to pen a deal.  If we can't get verification locked  down with this, we didn't have it with the Syrian chemical issue.  We  didn't have it in the past on occasion with the Russians --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  -- trust Russia because they said they got rid of all Syria's  chemical weapons.  And he also said that we're fine in Iran because he read  the deal, and it's super solid, and they have no desire to manufacture any  fissile material or use those in drills to make big --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BAKER:  That was their investment.  They were so -- they were so keen as  you pointed out.  So keen to get that deal, so we have to be careful.  The  Trump administration has to be able to say, no, we're not going to sit down  if what appears to be as the North Koreas are making demands and  concessions that we can't accept, don't even sit at the table, and much  less walk away.  Just don't sit down at that point.  Everybody understands  this is an incredibly complex issue between us, North Korea, South Korea,  China, Japan, you know, but this is -- again, it's worth pursuing and as  you pointed out, everybody regardless of your political position should be  willing to root for peace on the peninsula or an effort to get there. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Pretend the U.S. is actually in the World Cup, it's like that.   Everyone wants team USA to win.  Mike Baker, thank you so much. </p><p>BAKER:  What -- the World Cup is what?  That's soccer? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  All right.  That's enough.  All right.  Dear, come on.  Let it  go.  Come on, man.  It's a beautiful game and you're a lovely person, so  thanks again.  Today, former President Jimmy -- oh, Jimmy Carter said he  thinks the president would deserve the Nobel Prize if he manages -- that's  a big if.  He's really qualifying this.  To get the North Koreans to give  up their nukes, but is the President Trump really thinking about canceling  the meeting or is possible that he's just being a showman and amping up the  drama?  Let me go to my military grade party pane tonight, she's an editor  at Townhall.com and a Fox News Contributor, Katie Pavlich is here.  He is a  spokesperson at Young Voices and host of the podcast Beltway Banthas, it's  Stephen Kent, and he is the host of \"YOUR WELCOME\", that's a podcast and  author of the book, Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim  Jong-il, he's got a license too, Michael Malice is back.  Our resident  actual North Korea expert. </p><p>MICHAEL MALICE, HOST, YOUR WELCOME SHOW:  I'm no Mike Baker. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Come on, man --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MALICE:  -- with a dead cat apparently. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I don't think he was talking about you. </p><p>MALICE:  That's true. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to read you Jimmy Carter's quote because I think -- I  want to -- I want to get your feeling on this.  He's talking about if  they're under constant belief that the United States wants to attack them  meaning North Korea even using nuclear weapons and that we are destroying  their economy and they know that they're starving to death primarily  because the United States withholds food aid for instance, just giving them  surplus food that we can never use.  I can understand how they feel. </p><p>MALICE:  Well, let me give you a little bit of background about Jimmy  Carter and North Korea.  He went there in 1994 and tried to broker a deal  with the great leader Kim Il-sung.  And five years ago today I posted a  quote from North Korean propaganda about their meeting and this is what  they said Jimmy Carter said, \"President Kim Il-sung is a person in whom  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, those popular  three presidents of the United States early in its history are put  together.\"  So that actually did not happen.  But the point is, North Korea  withheld food from getting to its citizenry in the '90s because Kim Jong-il  specifically said, if we allow the U.N. to feed the population, the  government will be superfluous.  So that's absolutely not true that they  would be willing to accept food. </p><p>And if they did accept food, they would claim it's coming from the leader,  so it's false in that regard.  It's absolutely true that they think we're  going to invade at any minute because you see people all over the news  right now blatantly saying John Bolton had a -- entry in the Wall Street  Journal that even South Korea is against it.  We have the unilateral right  to strike if they develop nuclear capabilities.  And when President Bush  said the axis of evil is Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.  This is clearly a  kill list of the three countries he wants to take out.  So they are right  to be afraid.  And again, if most people in this country don't trust  themselves to disarm and give up their guns and trust the federal  government, why would the North Korean government thinking differently? </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And they have gotten so many resources over the years that  they could have used to feed their people.  I mean you don't build a multi- billion dollar nuclear weapons program unless you have money. </p><p>MALICE:  And lastly, the have something called Sung Bun and the used food  is a mechanism to control, so that the more loyal you are to the  government, the more likely you are to receive food. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And we're going to talk about that same thing happening in  Venezuela.  But I want to get back here because we've heard a lot about the  Libyan model and it was something that John Bolton said in regards to  denuclearizing North Korea, you know, which is essentially can be by force  with a very sad ending for the leader of either Libya or North Korea.  It  wasn't just something that John Bolton said offhandedly months ago in an  interview.  This is now something that Vice President Pence has legitimized  by using the same term.  So do you think that we are on a march to war if  in fact the meeting doesn't take place? </p><p>STEPHEN KENT, HOST, BELTWAY BANTHAS PODCAST:  I don't think we're on a  march to war.  But I'm stunned that Mike Pence then echo that comment from  John Bolton because that seemed incredibly ill-advice.  They need to keep  that comment and John Bolton off television for the next three weeks if  they're going to make this meeting happen.  He instills this sense of  distrust with the North Korean regime.  And Michael is absolutely right  when he mentioned, you know, like trying to step away from their guns being  their WMD's.  Like -- they're like the cultists in Waco, like you cannot  threaten them in this way.  Their weapons are the only thing that make them  feel secure, so this march towards total denuclearization or else is not  going to work in this case.  We need to be a little bit more gentle here. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  You know, I was talking to Gordon Chang a few weeks ago and he  said they still have a conventional military which is actually a bigger  practical threat to the region and it's much easier for them to go ahead  and bomb South Korea.  They don't -- they don't have to use nukes in order  to inflict a lot of damage.  So even if you take their nuclear program  away, they still have the ability to defend themselves. </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  That's always been the  concern that they'll use artillery power against Seoul, South Korea which  is right there across the border. This conversation you just had goes back  to why this has never worked out and why very administration has had a  failure when it comes to reining in North Korea's program.  They are so far  apart and although in the last couple of months we've seen things come  together on the surface.  When it comes to principles what the North  Koreans are willing to do which is not giving up their nuclear arms, the  negotiation now is about what denuclearization actually means and what the  United States requires which is complete denuclearization of the peninsula.   And the of course, there's China which is playing a role and saying, we  can't ask North Korea to completely give up their nukes.  However, we think  that they should be limited in their capacity.  And by the way, we don't  want any of the fallout when it comes to the regime -- </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  No.  China wants control and they want North Korea to be  dependent and they also want to have as much influence as possible on the  Korean Peninsula.  My question is, does South Korea -- with South Korea and  we're running out of time, so this has to beautiful quick answer.  Would  South Korea rather work with the United States in resolving this situation? </p><p>PAVLICH:  I think ultimately, yes.  I mean the United States is an ally.   We're doing military excises.  The United States has repeatedly said we are  not taking military -- legal military exercises off the table in exchange  for denuclearization of North Korea.  But again, the gap here is very wide  and it feels like we're back to the beginning of why this hasn't work out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's where we five seconds. </p><p>PAVLICH:  Katie gets it perfectly. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Oh, very good, Michael Malice for taking the baton and looking  very classily.  The panel return a little bit later because how could they  not.  Plus, the plot thickens in the White House.  Republican lawmakers now  calling for a second special counsel to investigate the possibility the  feds had politically motivated spies in the Trump campaign.  And now the  president has weighed in.  I'll tell you what  he said.  Chris Stirewalt  joins me next for reaction. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  We got news alert now.  We just learned that the business  partner of President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen has  agreed to cooperate with the government as part of a plea deal.  Evgeny  Friedman, I know I'm not saying that right.  Is the note -- no.  Michael  Malice is shaking his head seriously.  He's got a whiplash.  He's a Russian  immigrant known as the taxi king.  Legal expert say this puts greater  pressure on Cohen to cooperate with the Mueller probe, but the president  says the real issue with the alleged spying on his campaign during the  election.  Watch. </p><p>TRUMP:  A lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign.  If they  had spies in my campaign, that would be a disgrace to this country.  That  would be one of the biggest insults that anyone has ever seen and it would  be very illegal aside from everything else.  It would make probably every  political event ever look like small potatoes. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Small potatoes?  Delicious though.  Michael Cohen cooperating  with the government would certainly be no picnic for the president.  But is  he right to say the election spying is the biggest concern here.  Joining  me now Fox News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt back in action.  Welcome  back. </p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Indeed.  All right.  So let's talk about this.  Spies in my  campaign, is that the biggest issue of all if that is in fact true? </p><p>STIREWALT:  The biggest issue in political history the president says --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Maybe ever. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Maybe ever which they're saying something.  I mean the fall of  Roman stuff was a pretty big deal.  Look, the president says that there  were spies, and this is a good narrative for him.  This helps him with his  base to talk about him as the real victim and the deep state, and it was  really Obama and Clinton, and he's the victim here.  He's not the  perpetuator.  But instead, he's the victim.  And it -- and especially  during a midterm where he desperately wants not to lose the house because  that would create a whole new set of pressures on him in terms of  investigations and conceivably impeachment that he wants to keep  Republicans with him and a good way to do that is to say that he's not the  offender here, that the system -- that he is the victim of the system. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I truly believe that he believes he is not the offender.  He  believes he has done nothing wrong.  And he's just, you know, as a  negotiator does, if something doesn't succeed the first time you go about  it from different angles.  But is there something to this story?  Is it  possible that there were politically motivated operatives who were reaching  out to people of on the Trump campaign getting information to give back to  the FBI? </p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, if they can put cheese in the can and have it spray out  on a cracker that was anything --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  What a great invention. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Anything is possible.  But I don't know.  I mean I cover  politics.  But I do know this that there is an inspector general's report  that is in process about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's  mishandling of state secrets.  We're waiting for that in just the next  coming days.  And then hot on the heels of that one from the inspector  general from the Department of Justice, Mr. Horowitz, is a report on the --  an investigation of the investigation into the Russian meddling and Trump's  campaign, and that rashmitas.  So I'm going to wait and find out, just like  I'm going to wait and find out what Mueller actually has as opposed to all  of these chatter dancing that people are doing around this stuff.  I don't  know.  So I'm just going to wait until I find that. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I mean if there was a coordinated effort between James Clapper  and John Brennan and James Comey, you know, if that's not a politicized  trifecta, I don't know from my politicized trifecta, and I have a menagerie  of them in a green room.</p><p>STIREWALT:  Well, look, if that was so and they conspired together against  Donald Trump, well, that would be very bad.  But we don't know that.  We  don't have that evidence just like we don't have evidence that the  president colluded with Russia.  We just have -- the best I can do at this  point especially since we now have hopes that much of this will be  concluded by the end of the summer.  All I can do as a political forecaster  is say, we'll have enough information to know how this is going to affect  the midterms, how are Republicans going to respond to this.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And I think the deployment of these types of informant is not  only possible.  I think it is plausible given the amount of -- the  capability of these various organizations whether it's the NSA, or CIA, or  FBI, or DEA spy on Americans.  They have the tools.  It would not surprise  me if there are people who would abuse that power for their own benefit.   And I hope that's not the case.  I hope we live in a country where that  kind of power is checked.  So far Congress keeps codifying it and that is  also terrifying.  Chris Stirewalt, thank you so much. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Ma'am. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Bottom line and every day of the week young man.  Very good. </p><p>STIREWALT:  Quite so. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes.  Coming up, Venezuela, the hell hole where a month's  salary can't even buy a cup of coffee.  People are so hungry they resorted  to eating zoo animals.  They just re-elected their president with nearly 70  percent of the vote.  Do you smell something fishy like a rotting zebra  carcass?  More examples of socialism destroying society in the monologue  next.  Stay here. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Crappy socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro was elected to  another six-year term in Venezuela.  Yes.  And the equally corrupted  authoritarian Turkish president campaigned for him, so they could share in  the farcical fun.  Leaders like Maduro, Erdogan, and Putin hate freedom  because it gives filthy peasants too much they empower over their own  lives.  They liquidate government holdings to enrich themselves in their  select cronies, and they steal from poor people who live horrible short  lives before they die in squalor.  It is no surprise these liberty loathers  create an access of a-holes.  They need to sow discord in the world's most  powerful economy because a truly free market disrupts their tyrannical  buggery -- signaling widespread discontent.  President Trump has signed an  executive order that bans U.S. citizens from snapping up Venezuelan  bargains from the state fire sale.  When people try to profit off this  desperation, they are further imprisoning the poorest among them who cannot  leave the country.  There has been a mass exodus of doctors, nurses,  teachers, engineers, and anyone else who has the means to escape the  tightening news of cruel socialism.  Anyone who can get out has fled, while  those trapped there are enduring inflation that's already at nearly 14,000  percent.  Plus, soaring malnutrition infant and maternal mortality rates  that are also going up and are being undertreated at vacant hospitals.  All  fraudulent elections should be condemned, including those in Turkey and  Russia.  And we need to be doubly mindful not to indulge amateur socialist  in this country.  Because even though a Bernie Sanders presidency is a  joke, the consequences of diet communism are deadly serious.  And that's  the memo.  </p><p>Oh, hi, great to see me.  That was swift.  How long Nicolas Maduro possibly  hang on to power as people are starving, his economy is ruined, the murder  rate is one of the highest in the world, and all indicators suggest things  are only going to get worse.  So, what can we do to fix this failed  socialist experiment before it turns into another Somalia?  The party panel  is back: Katie Pavlich, Stephen Kent, and Michael Malice.  Katie, I don't  think this is the worst-case-scenario.  I don't think this is a black swan  country undergoing some bad luck.  I think this is the natural ultimate end  of socialism and communism.  What do you think?</p><p>PAVLICH:  People argue, you know, this isn't real socialism or this isn't  real communism.  No, this is what it is.  In 1999, Venezuela decide to go  from more of a free market system to a socialist country to spend more  money on welfare.  This is exactly what we've seen as a result of that.   Now, Maduro is out there this week, on video in this bizarre way -- waving  to crowds that don't exist who applaud him on his re-election by 70  percent.  The United States has condemned the election results.  And the  question is, where do we go from here?  Not only in Venezuela but as the  United States because there are American interests there and there are  foreign policy implications of the regime collapsing.  The Venezuelans are  fleeing in large numbers.  As you mentioned in your monologue that most of  important people in the country who are, you know, doctors, nurses are  leaving.  But regular people are getting out because they are so desperate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Giving on buses in getting out of the country.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Liberals, socialist Utopia that is now existing in Venezuela as a  result of these principles, not a mistake.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Malice?</p><p>MALICE:  What I would like to see happen because there's only so much we  can do in Venezuela.  Every politician who was a segregationist racist had  to disavow, have to turn their backs, and had to be publicly humiliated,  had to be (INAUDIBLE) for decades.  So why are Michael Moore, and Bernie  Sanders, and Jeremy Corbin in the U.K., all of the people who said  Venezuela is a great thing, a great experiment, why do they not run on the  public square and thrown tomatoes at where they go?  You have children  bleeding to death on hospital beds, you have people starving.  Again, they  shoot into crowds when people try to protest.  To have anyone who's in  politics for this, not take responsibility for it, and still begin a  microphone, I think, is disgraceful.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And it's only getting worse,  and worse, and worse.  It's actually getting exponentially worse as  inflation rises, and the poorest people, they are the ones who can't afford  to feed their kids.  They never had to treat malnutrition five years ago.   And now that condition has gone up 100 folds in hospitals that we have no  doctors.  So, what do we do?  Do we do anything as the United States?  </p><p>KENT:  Well, there's again, limited tools in our tool kit to deal with this  situation.  We're not going to invade Venezuela.  We shouldn't.  And  sanctions are something that we have to be delicate with as well, because  we want to target the elite in that country who are abusing and starving  their people without then, actually, hurting the people who live in that  country and are not able to leave.  We are mentioning that doctors and  everyone who are able to flee.  You know, the oil industry runs basically  the only leftover economy that's there, but it only benefits the wealthy.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's absolutely right.  And that's what they did.  I  mean, it is a state-run industry.  They've got so much oil, which was  great, and they were profitable when oil prices were high.  But when they  tanked -- </p><p>MALICE:  This is atlas shrugged comes to life.  This is exactly the  (INAUDIBLE).  Take out excessive business having the government running,  and then how long it takes for people to be --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And you know, when atlas shrugged, that's when the people are  holding up the economy, they leave.  They're exhausted.</p><p>MALICE:  And if the poor and the weak were the first to suffer.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  That's absolutely right and suffer the longest.  Well, back  here at home, I mean, we're really suffering, right?  Because House Speaker  Paul Ryan is facing renewed pressure to step down from his perch before his  term ends.  The administration maybe nudging the effort along.  White House  Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, reportedly said he has spoken with House  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about ousting Ryan, adding: \"Wouldn't it be  great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut  up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election.  That's a  really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do  it.\"  Now, Mulvaney says he's supportive of the speaker.  And McCarthy said  he's never even talked to Mulvaney about it.  So, should House Republicans  plan a mutiny, Katie?  </p><p>MALICE:  We always hear word of a mutiny whenever there's any kind of  speakers raised.  Jim Jordan, other than the hundred conservatives that  came out and sign the letters saying they want him to run for speaker.   Paul Ryan will likely out his term as speaker of the house.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He's not going to get pushed out of the way?</p><p>PAVLICH:  You know, I don't know.  I mean, the thing is, as they say in  Washington, D.C.: if you want a friend, get a dog.  And although, Kevin  McCarthy and Paul Ryan have been very close for the last couple of years,  not only just in leadership as Paul Ryan came out through the ranks in the  House, from the Ways and Means Committee.  I doubt that McCarthy is going  to actually push Paul Ryan out. </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  They want Jim to working at job.</p><p>KENT:  No, money talks.  Paul Ryan brought in 11.9 million in the first  quarter of the Republican.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, that's why Nancy Pelosi is still around.  </p><p>KENT:  So, yes, put up or shut up.  Everybody else who wants that job.   They're not going to move him out as long as they need to raise money for  these mid-term elections which are going to be contentious.  I also would  like to see Paul Ryan finish out this job because we need, we need him to  finish and have a legitimate open-run election.  Kevin McCarthy cannot be  nominated for this.  Nobody really wants him in the Republican --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Is there a benefit to chaos?  </p><p>MALICE:  Look at the last Republican speaker.  You have ambassador of the  Vatican's wife, you have this lobster who's selling marijuana.  Dennis  Hastert, we can't even discuss on air.  And now, we have the guy who Mitt  Romney made his beta.  So, this is quite a cast of characters.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  He is his Robin.</p><p>MALICE:  Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, he really is.  I love Paul Rhino.  I love the term Paul  Rhino.  I think Paul Ryan has completely turned his back on his principles.  </p><p>MALICE:  But in 2012, Romney needed to play the base, and he chose Ryan.   And that's how far the Republican Party has gone to the right, but even  Ryan is regardless of the left --  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Yes, Ryan and a slap on the base.  You know, I want to thank  you all for being here, because you are good friends, you are allies of  freedom, and you are delightful people.  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Thank you for having us.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Freedoms and my feels.  Michael, Stephen, and Katie Pavlich,  thank you all.  Coming up, Cops say Amazon's new facial recognition  technology is helping them identify suspects in crime.  But the privacy  police are sounding alarm bells.  Emily Compagno joins me with the details.   Hi, Emily!  She's coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The future is now.  And I don't know if I like it.  Amazon has  some fancy new facial recognition technology and they're selling it to  police departments for $6.00 a month.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well,  a lot.  Which is why the ACLU is asking the tech giant to stop marketing  the tool to law enforcement agencies -- fearing it could be used to invade  your privacy.  Amazon respond to the ACLU's request with a statement that  read in quote: \"Amazon requires the customers comply with the law and be  responsible when they use Amazon Web Service (AWS).  When we find that AWS  services are being abused by a customer, we suspend that customer's right  to use our services.\"  Now, I would never add the cape for government  regulation to fix a problem like this, but should we be concerned about our  civil liberties and privacy when a tech giant like amazon combines with  government?  Let me ask former Criminal Defense Attorney and Legal Analyst,  Emily Compagno, she is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.  Emily,  welcome back to the show.  </p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND LEGAL ANALYST:  So, let's  discuss this.  What is the down side to selling facial recognition  technology on the cheap to law enforcement?  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  ACLU and others are arguing, look, there's a high  capacity for abuse here.  So, they argue this isn't akin to just an  extension of photography.  They say, this is akin to walking through mass  protests and asking for identification for every single person there.  They  argue this can be used to follow immigrants by ICE, this can be used to  identify any random person on a street corner.  So, they kind of have the  same arguments that they have for all existing surveillance programs, which  is where is the limit, right?  And they argue that, although it's not  different from other facial recognition program.  Here, they site that what  is problematic is Amazon's aggressive marketing to law enforcement agencies  and the fact that the reach is so prolific.  So, that's what they're  arguing here.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  And that's one of things that has always concerned me, whether  it's Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other social media platform.  You  know, these big tech companies getting in bed with the government, whether  it's military or law enforcement, the consequences can be dire.  They're  not always dire.  We want our law enforcement agencies to have tools and  have technology so they can keep us safe.  The problem is when these things  malfunction.  My iPhone X recognizes my face about half the time, and it's  not because I'm a supermodel but a lot of people say that.  It's because  this technology isn't perfect.  And you know, I don't trust that the facial  recognition software wouldn't recognize the wrong person.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  Which is part of the argument and, you know, on the  other side, law enforcement agencies are arguing: look, you know, we're not  there yet.  It's important to us that the community understands what it's  being used for just as crucially as what it's not.  And they site the fact  that, you know, this has been used for surveillance footage matching from  burglaries, from what's picked up from CCTV.  They argue this has been used  to find abducted children or missing children in amusement parks.  It was  even used actually this weekend at the royal wedding of now duke and  duchess of Sussex for what royals had attended, right?  Sky News used.  So,  it's important that they feel the community that they --</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  I want to know the difference between David Beckham and Serena  Williams.  Because there were some people on other networks who didn't  really know the difference.  And that's a wonderful private application of  that tool essentially for entertainment.  I don't want to be arrested for a  crime that Kate Upton has committed because we look so similar.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes, and I do want to point out, though, that there's a bit of  hyperbole I see here in terms of the narrative that these free speech firms  and companies are pushing forward.  And here's one in particular, they cite  that this can now be used at airports which is a public place, they argue.   We're now in this climate of protesting and robust participation.  They  claim that there could be a chilling factor, but I want to point out that  airports for example are not public places for purposes of free speech.   It's been long held at the first, second, and fourth amendment are actually  restricted there.  So, in terms of the conversation surrounding this, to me  it's important that the narrative isn't subjects to that kind of hyperbolic  quality, because to me, it just increases the chasm between law enforcement  and what they're trying to do, and then lawful protected right to privacy  that we have without kind of muddying the water.  </p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Absolutely, understand.  And I think there is so much more to  discuss and address here.  I really appreciate your perspective.  Thank you  so much, Emily.  Great to talk to you again. </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Thank you.</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  \"TOPICAL STORM\" is next.  It's a good one.  Stay here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  The NYPD is looking for a group of gunmen who robbed a  Walgreen's pharmacy while wearing clown masks.  Witnesses say, there could  be as many as 15 of them.  They were last seen fleeing one tiny car.  Be on  the lookout for a many, because this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\" </p><p>Topic number one.  We begin tonight in Houston, Texas, where everybody  knows that if you're going to drive on the highway, you're going to need  plenty of horse power.  Look at this.  Oh, mercy!  The Belmont state aren't  for another three weeks but this fellow is already getting in a good  workout.  In any other state, the sight of horse on a highway might have  caused a 12-car pile-up.  But in (INAUDIBLE) they're like, it's probably  going out for more beer.  Anything a couple of cars high beams so, they  could pass.  Now, fortunately some good Samaritans were able to steer it  off the road, and police have since returned though, of course, to its  owner but not before issuing a ticket for using the carpooling without a  passenger.  Rules are rules, pal.  Get a (INAUDIBLE) next time.</p><p>Topic number two.  There it is.  A Florida City issued a zombie alert to  its citizens.  And we'd like to think it was an accident, but you never  know in Florida.  A storm caused a blackout on Sunday that led the  residents of Lake Worth, Florida, to get an alert that read: Zombie --  power outage and zombie alert for the residents of Lake Worth and Terminus.   There are now far less than 7300 customers involved due to extreme zombie  activity.  Now, Terminus is a fictitious town from the hit T.V. show \"The  Walking Dead\".  Its inclusion in the message led cops to believe it was a  prank.  Great police, fellows.  Well done.  It's unlikely someone confused  the state of Florida and \"The Walking Dead\" because the two couldn't be  more different.  One is an apocalyptic wasteland of human oddities, and the  other is a T.V. show.  That's right.  </p><p>Topic number three.  If you're a cop in the city of Cleveland, long enough  you'll see everything -- except for a Browns Super Bowl championship.  But  these cops, they don't need a championship to party.  The officers  responded to this block party to cut the noise, but they wound up cutting a  rug because not even a horse can resist it.  It's so addictive.  We have a  staffer named Courtney who does it all the time in the office.  She's very  special.  The video of the dancing cops has taken off across the country,  and so has their other police horse.  There I go again on my own.  Turns  out he'll be shuffling papers behind his desk because he's been suspended  for not tying up his horse.  </p><p>Topic number four.  There it is.  Thanks to Bunk Breaker for this one.   Women's soccer legend, Brandy Chastain, was inducted into the Bay Area hall  of fame this week.  But the person who may brand these flack, must drink a  few brandies before going into the studio.  The women's soccer legend  became famous for whipping off her jersey after hitting the winning penalty  kick in the 1999 World Cup.  She was an international (INAUDIBLE), but  apparently, she's now a trucker named Gill, who likes beef jerky and lot  lizard.  The Internet says she looks like Gary Busey, so either way slice  it, she's looks like someone who is little nuts.  She looks like she's a  transitioning Elizabeth Warren without glasses.  You can't make this up,  unlike Elizabeth's heritage.  The hall of fame has since apologized and  offered to make a new plaque.  And perhaps, not surprisingly Brandi, has  graciously accepted their offer.  We reached out to the plaque maker for  comment but he was at the vet with his seeing eye dog.  </p><p>Topic number five.  Perhaps no athlete is more disappointed than Tonya  Harding who did not win the top prize in last night's \"Dancing with the  Stars\" finale.  Someday, historians will remember this as the end of the  #kneetoo movement.  Figure skater Adam Rippon took home the win, and Lord  knows he'll need the prize money, because competing against Tonya Harding  can cost you an arm and a leg.  If you don't believe me, ask Nancy  Kerrigan.  NFL Star, Josh Norman, with the other runner-up in the first  all-athlete season.  It was also the first season of all famous people.   Usually, that show is a who's who of people that make you say, who?  Her  T.V. comeback may be over, but don't feel bad for Tonya because she just  joined a new dance troupe who are very familiar with her work.  Is he going  to get the police?  (INAUDIBLE) felony.  If only she had this much rhythm  in last night's finale.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MONTGOMERY:  Thank you so much for watching this show tonight.  I am your  tender flower.  It is the best hour of your day and mine.

Which side has the political upper hand ahead of a key test for the president's political power? Stick around to find out.</p><p>Also tonight, retired four-star general, General Jack Keane is standing by live to tell us what he knows about the Taliban talks at Camp David that fell apart. He'll tell us how to end America's longest war and bring our troops home from Afghanistan.</p><p>Plus, Texas' attorney general, Ken Paxton, is leading the charge against Google and its, quote, \"monopolistic behavior.\" Almost every state is joining the massive antitrust investigation. This is just the latest effort in the crackdown on big tech and how America rains in the industry's power.</p><p>Could Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple be facing new restrictions? We'll debate. Hello and welcome to Fox News @ Night. I'm Mike Emanuel in for Shannon Bream. We begin tonight in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie is at President Trump's rally. Good evening, Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you, Mike. President Trump had hoped to tour storm damage from hurricane Dorian in advance of tonight's rally. Thunderstorms in the area along the North Carolina coast prevented him from doing that, but he did receive a briefing onboard Air Force One. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've just come from a meeting with North Carolina officials representing communities hit by hurricane Dorian and I expressed the unwavering solidarity of the American people. We are behind you 100 percent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERRIE: Tonight's rally comes on the eve of a special election in North Carolina's ninth Congressional district. Republican, Dan Bishop, entered the race after state election officials refused to certify last year's contest amid allegations of ballot tampering. President Trump hopes to tip the balance of this tight race.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Our first task is a giant victory tomorrow, right here in the great state of North Carolina. With your support, tomorrow, we take the first steps to firing Speaker Pelosi and winning back the House in 2020.</p><p>SEN. DAN BISHOP (R-NC), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: What's going to happen tomorrow, on Tuesday September 10th, is the ninth district is going to send the Congressman with backbone who can stand up to the smears and the lies of the lying fake news media and support the president of the United States as he keeps America great.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERRIE: Ahead of this evening's rally, Democrat, Dan McCready, was also in Fayetteville. The Marine veteran held the Get-out-to-Vote rally with military families and went door-to-door campaigning.</p><p>Today, McCready tweeted, \"No one should go to Washington as a Democrat first or a Republican first. They should go as Americans first. That's why I stood with fellow veterans from both parties to say, let's work across the aisle to lower health care costs and get the job done for North Carolinians.\"</p><p>Mike, both parties have been watching this race very closely as a potential indicator of what to expect in 2020. They've been testing out various messages with voters to see what resonates most. Mike?</p><p>EMANUEL: Jonathan Serrie leading us off in battleground North Carolina. Jonathan, thanks a lot.</p><p>Lawmakers returning to the nation's capital and Congressional Democrats in the House and Senate are setting some big goals to accomplish. Topping the list in the House, figuring out a way to potentially move forward on impeaching President Trump.</p><p>Correspondent David Spunt is here now. Good evening, David.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Mike, minutes after getting back into the swing of things, House Democrats began moving forward with consideration of an impeachment probe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT: After a six-week recess, Congress is back in session and the Judiciary Committee, chaired by New York Congressman, Jerry Nadler, is preparing to consider an impeachment probe.</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): I think the resolution speaks for itself if you read it.</p><p>SPUNT: Chairman Nadler announced a Thursday vote to set the rules for any future impeachment-type hearings. He calls it, \"The next step,\" in determining, \"Whether to recommend articles of impeachment.\"</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who has cautioned the use of the \"I\" word in the past, said this exclusively to Fox News tonight.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you support the resolution that Chairman Nadler has put forward?</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Yes, I do. I think that you should characterize it for what it is, it's a continuation of what we have been doing and how we all work together on these things.</p><p>SPUNT: But this doesn't mean the House Speaker is in favor of impeachment. Nadler's resolution simply lays out procedures for a, \"Impeachment investigation.\" Republicans don't seem fazed.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): They know they don't have the votes to go for a full formal impeachment inquiry, which is what our House rules require. So what they're doing is they're going to try and change our rules.</p><p>SPUNT: Other Democrats are probing Vice President Mike Pence's stay at the president's property in Doonbeg, Ireland last week. Pence was on official business and traveled 180 miles for meetings in Dublin. And the Air Force is internally reviewing travel policies after a cruise spent time at the president's Scotland resort, Trump Turnberry, while on official business.</p><p>TRUMP: I own a lot of different places. Soon, you'll find that out. Because I'll be, at some point, prior to the election, I'm going to be giving out a financial report of me and it'll be extremely complete.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT: House Democrats also announced an investigation into allegations that the Trump reelection campaign is using the Ukrainian justice system to its advantage to hurt Joe Biden's campaign. No word from the Trump campaign tonight on that specific allegation. Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: David Spunt live in Washington. David, thanks a lot.</p><p>Does this impeachment push here in Washington playing into the president's hands or well out in places like faithful North Carolina where the president said this about his Democratic opponents?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: A vote for any Democrat in 2020 and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow in North Carolina is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Let's turn to the former national spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, Josh Schwerin, and Fox News contributor, Marc Thiessen. Gentlemen, great to have you.</p><p>JOSH SCHWERIN, COMMS DIRECTOR, PRIORIES USA: Good to be with you.</p><p>EMANUEL: Josh, let me play this for you from Ohio Republican Congressman, Jim Jordan, and I will get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Look, the Michael Cohen hearing didn't work out the way they wanted, the John Dean hearing didn't work out the way they wanted, and of course, the Bob Mueller hearing and that investigation didn't work out the way they wanted, but that doesn't stop them. They're going to continue to push this ridiculous impeachment narrative.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: So, Josh, what about the argument that it's time for Democrats to move on?</p><p>SCHWERIN: Democrats can do multiple things. They can do their constitutional duty to get out to oversight of the Executive Branch, and they can introduce policy.</p><p>Today, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were calling on the Senate to put forth legislation on background checks, which is 80 percent support, 90 percent support. Later in the week, I believe, they're going to introduce legislation on drug pricing. So they are doing both things.</p><p>If you remember, Republicans when they had control of the House, they took the majority in January of 2011. By February, they were already investigating Obama. After that point, there was not a single day of Obama's presidency where the Republicans did not have an investigation open.</p><p>The fact is, you can investigate and legislate at the same time and the Republicans are just hypocritical because they're afraid of what people might find, and Donald Trump's afraid of it.</p><p>EMANUEL: But it seems like all the impeachment talk really eats up a lot of the oxygen in this town. Let's take a listen to judiciary Democrat, Steve Cohen, and then I will get you guys to weigh in on that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STEVE COHEN (D-TN): Like they did in Nixon, it was 17 percent when they started their hearings, over 60 percent when the hearings were concluded. Is there a smoking gun? I think there's an arsenal, a garrison. It proves out there that we'll be in a good spot in December and the public will find that they've been taken for a ride.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Marc, is this push by House Democrats going to grow in public support?</p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No. Look, the Democrats of the party that cried collusion. For two years, they told us Donald Trump had colluded with Russia, that Trump was a traitor, that he was a Russian agent, conspired with the Russians to undermine our democracy, and those were serious accusations and the American people took them seriously, and so we had a special counsel who investigated it, we spent tens of millions of dollars and it turned out it was nothing more than a conspiracy theory. It never happened, he didn't do it.</p><p>And so what's happening now is the Democrats failed to do what they wanted to, which is to depose a sitting president with these Trumped up charges of collusion and they're shifting gears to other things. One, they have no credibility because they lied to the American people about collusion and misled them.</p><p>And second of all, they're not listening to the American people. After the Mueller probe, Harris Poll found 65 percent of Americans say they should not have impeachment proceedings. Fifty percent said given the Mueller report, we should turn the page and investigations of Trump. And 80 percent said they want their Congressional representatives working on infrastructure, health care, immigration, rather than investigations to the president.</p><p>They are not listening to the American people. And every day that they focused on investigations instead of their agenda, and that's leading the news, is a bad day for the Democratic Party.</p><p>EMANUEL: Josh, tonight, President Trump warned supporters about the rise of radical socialism and that a vote for, \"Any Democrat\" was like supporting the destruction of the American dream. Your response?</p><p>SCHWERIN: We've been hearing socialism attacks against Democrats for 50 years. I can say in my organization, Priorities USA, does a lot of polling about the states. This attack doesn't work. The fact is what we're talking about in states right now is health care, Medicare, Social Security, the trade war that Trump is bankrupting farmers with.</p><p>Those are the issues that voters want to hear about and that's what Democrats are talking about right now. And the fact is Trump has given up on winning over the middle, so he just uses this red meat rhetoric that we've heard for decades to gin up his base, because he wants to scare people, but it's not going to work.</p><p>THIESSEN: Except it's true now. I mean, you're -- when Bill Clinton -- you worked for Hillary Clinton, you're a Clinton person. Bill Clinton said the era of big government is over. Today's message of the Democratic Party is the ear of big government is back. They're proposing literally over $100 million in new -- if you had a Medicare for All, Green New Deal, all the climate plans, all the free health care, free college, free everything in terms of loan forgiveness for students, literally, more than the entire national debt.</p><p>So the idea that somehow that this is because Republicans have been saying socialism for years, it's actually true.</p><p>EMANUEL: All right. Marc Thiessen, Josh Schwerin, thanks for your time, gentlemen.</p><p>SCHWERIN: Thank you.</p><p>EMANUEL: Fox News Alert. President Trump says peace talks with the Taliban are dead and Afghans are preparing for a new wave of violence.</p><p>Tonight, we're learning more about what led to the collapse of these month- long talks. Here's Correspondent, Gillian Turner. Good evening, Gillian.</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Mike. So after a week of will they won't, the immediate speculation, President Trump announced via Twitter, this weekend, he canceled with the chatter chat with the Afghan Taliban at Camp David.</p><p>So now, after nearly 18 years, 2,300 American lives, and $900 billion, some top military brass insist the war in Afghanistan is still worth fighting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS, FORMER AFGHANISTAN COALITION COMMANDER: I think the president very much made the right call. Again, we went for a reason, and we have stayed for a reason. That's to ensure that Al Qaeda and now the Islamic state, which has moved in as well to try to exploit the situation cannot reestablish the sanctuary.</p><p>TURNER: The ill-fated meeting between President Trump and Taliban leadership, fell apart, after facing resistance from key White House officials including National Security Advisor, John Bolton.</p><p>Now, Republican and Democratic lawmakers are lining up to denounce the president's decision to schedule the meeting in the first place.</p><p>Key senators from his own party say the very idea of negotiations should be a nonstarter as long as Taliban fighters have American blood on their hands.</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): We shouldn't be negotiating with a group that's killing young Americans at the same time.</p><p>TURNER: Other lawmakers say the leader of the free world's country home should be off-limits to America's enemies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would not have them at Camp David, I would not have them in the United States.</p><p>TURNER: Still, others are crying foul on timing, pointing out at the meeting was slated just three days before 9/11.</p><p>SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): It's pretty clear the Taliban is not a reliable negotiating party. It would be my choice to have them come to Camp David really now.</p><p>TURNER: Key Democrats say these kinds of last-minute switcheroos are becoming a hallmark of President Trump's foreign policy.</p><p>SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ): Whether it's with Kim Jong-un, whether it's in this case of the Taliban, whether it was with our closest allies or some of our most fierce adversaries like Russia, is that there is no strategic plan by the administration.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TURNER: Talks with the North Koreans have stopped and started and fits over the past year, now the White House is gearing up to reengage with Iran over at the U.N. later this month to gin up what President Trump calls a better nuclear deal.</p><p>Also developing tonight, Mike, a senior administration source confirms to Fox News, President Trump is still looking to get out of Afghanistan completely as soon as possible. Mike?</p><p>EMANUEL: All right. We'll keep watching it. Gillian Turner, thanks a lot.</p><p>TURNER: You bet.</p><p>EMANUEL: Do MAGA rallies like tonight leads to hate crimes? New evidence, next.</p><p>Plus, a brutal Baltimore murder case, six of the seven people charged identified is being part of the deadly MS-13 gang, and in the country illegally, former governor of Maryland, Robert Ehrlich joins us, next.</p><p>EMANUEL: Tonight, two Harvard academics are calling into question the validity of a paper published in The Washington Post back in March, that claims a massive spike in hate crimes in counties where President Trump has hosted campaign rallies. Our chief breaking news correspondent Trace Gallagher is looking into it, tonight. Good evening, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Mike. The paper was written by three Texas A&amp;M professors who claim that during the 2016 presidential campaign, counties that hosted Trump rallies, saw a jump in hate crimes of 226 percent.</p><p>The paper was never published, peer-reviewed, or thoroughly fact-checked, and yet, made its way into The Washington Post. From there, it got prominent play on just about every liberal media outlet.</p><p>t was also used to attack the president by Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Congress member Ilhan Omar, who cited the numbers and wrote \"assaults increase when cities host Trump rallies. Your rhetoric is directly and indirectly inciting hate, Mr. President.\"</p><p>Except, the numbers were wrong. Last week, Reason published a piece by two Harvard PhD students who will look at the claims made by the Texas A&amp;M professors, replicated the results, and found that, oops, the conclusions were based on a mistake.</p><p>In fact, to double check the mistake, the Harvard students used the same method to analyze the effects of Hillary Clinton's campaign rallies and found they actually led to a higher jump in hate crimes than Trump rallies.</p><p>But here's the problem, the Texas A&amp;M professors simply compared counties with rallies to counties without. They forgot to factor in the size of the counties and candidates tend to campaign in bigger counties.</p><p>So, Orange County, California and its 3 million people got the same weight as Orange County, Indiana, population, 19,000. The mathematic equation basically went like this; Orange County, California had two Trump rallies and five hate incidents, Orange County, Indiana had no Trump rallies and no hate incidents. Therefore, Trump breeds hate.</p><p>But after controlling for the disparity in population, bottom line is that neither Trump nor Clinton's rallies sparked hate crimes. And the Harvard students add that because academics and journalists are largely liberal, they were eager to pounce on the anti-Trump conclusion.</p><p>Had the initial study found the Clinton campaign inciting hate, many believe The Washington Post would have fact-checked until the Pinocchios were running off the page. Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: Trace Gallagher, thanks for breaking it down for us. GALLAGHER: Yes.</p><p>EMANUEL: Fox News Alert, six of the seven people charged in a stabbing death of a man in Maryland have been identified as part of the deadly street gang MS-13 and are reportedly in the county, in this country, illegally. Joining me now is a former Republican governor of Maryland, Robert Ehrlich, Governor, great to have you.</p><p>ROBERT EHRLICH, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MARYLAND: Mike, how are you doing? Good to be back with you.</p><p>EMANUEL: Thank you. President Trump spoke this evening about taking the fight to this brutal street gang. Let's play the comment and I'll ask you to respond, sir.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Many killers in those gangs, and we're taking them out of our country by the thousands, MS-13.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: So, what about that, and this deadly gang operating in your beloved home state?</p><p>EHRLICH: Yes, the president -- what's there to argue with? The president is talking about a deadly gang involved in the drug trade, with lots of bodies around. What's the problem? I don't understand why anyone would defend this gang and their brutal history.</p><p>So, the president is usually blunt to the point, whether he's at a rally or a press conference, he tells it like it is. When you have comments like that about this sort of gang, it, sort of, explains part of his popularity. It's blunt, it's real, it's in your face, and it's true, and it's accurate.</p><p>EMANUEL: Montgomery County right outside the nation's capital tweeted last Thursday. Montgomery County is committed to building and maintaining a safe and inclusive community for our residents. Understanding tolerance and respect are hallmarks of Montgomery County. Social justice for all is what we strive to achieve in our county. Is that enabling MS-13?</p><p>EHRLICH: Well, I don't know if it enables MS-13, but what it is, it's just -- it's nothing. It talks by the issue. And then, of course, they're going to talk about belief -- you're going to ask me about Nazis and Trump and Republicans, and it doesn't -- it's classic. It doesn't get to the issue. It talks by the issue. It's worked for social justice.</p><p>Well, what about the rapes? What about the gangs? Why are they there? Because the local government is not helping the federal government do its job. So, they're making a very dangerous environment for women in Montgomery County.</p><p>So, yes, what they say is, high-sounding, and sounds good when you say it really fast, but it talks by the issue. When you can't engage, when you lose on the merits, when your precision is wrong, they talk by the issue. It's a classic.</p><p>EMANUEL: Acting director Ken Cuccinelli of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, tweeted Friday, Sanctuary County, Montgomery County, Maryland cannot debate the failure of its sanctuary policies on the merits, seven violent assaults, rape, et cetera, including child victims in one month, so they resort to ad hominem attacks using Nazi implications, arguments, out-of-bounds in civil society.</p><p>Is he right about that, Governor?</p><p>EHRLICH: It's the game plan, Mike. You've seen it, time and time again. When you can't engage on the merits, when your sanctuary city policy -- when your sanctuary policy, generally, is leading to a more dangerous environment at home. What do you do when things go wrong? You talk by the issue. You blame Nazis and Republicans and President Trump.</p><p>You do anything other than engage on the issue. That's what Ken is talking about. It's very frustrating. At least, at some point, we need to engage. It's a real dangerous situation we have here, women are being raped. It's a serious issue. You just can't get by it with singing Kumbaya.</p><p>EMANUEL: Let's briefly switch subjects. Let's take a look at this headline from the Baltimore Sun yesterday. Trump to attend House Republican retreat in Baltimore on Thursday, less than two months after calling Baltimore a rat and rodent infested mess where no human being would want to live. President Trump will be there this week. Will there be protests?</p><p>EHRLICH: Well, you know what, there may be protests, but I love the president engaging. You may know a lot of Republicans from my generation are Jack Kemp fans. Jack Kemp would show up. You know, he would engage in the communities. This president has a real record in the community here.</p><p>So, I want him to talk about criminal justice reform and black unemployment numbers and community grants and trying to empower impoverished communities. He has a terrific record. I want to see him show up, but not just talk to Republicans, talk to the community, talk to the Democrats, talk to everybody. He's good at it.</p><p>I think, politically, as he said in the last campaign, there's no downside to it. We can't do worse, correct? So, again, as Jack Kemp, Republicans applaud it, engage, dialogue, and you're going to pick up some votes as a functional substance, not just a scare campaign for progressives to engage in a daily basis.</p><p>EMANUEL: All right. Former governor of Maryland, Robert Ehrlich, thank you so much for your time, sir.</p><p>EHRLICH: Good to see you, my friend.</p><p>EMANUEL: Thank you. The Trump administration issuing new visa guidelines tonight for residents fleeing the Bahamas and Florida Republican senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott are asking the Trump administration to go easy on those asylum-seekers. Here's how President Trump sees it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have to be very careful. Everybody needs totally proper documentation. I don't want to allow people that weren't supposed to be in the Bahamas, to come into the United States, including some very bad people and some very bad gang members, and some very, very bad drug dealers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Rescue teams are continuing to recover bodies in Abaco, one of the hardest hit areas of the Bahamas. Correspondent Jeff Paul is riding along with the lead U.S. federal agency coordinating relief efforts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: From corporations like Delta, flying over supplies, to ordinary folks who are pitching in, the help is coming from all over, including the U.S. government. We got a firsthand look at those very efforts, flying out of the air reserve base and homestead with USAID.</p><p>Administrator Mark Green and his team brought us along as we toured some of the hardest hit spots in the Bahamas. Green compared what he saw in places like Abaco, to a bomb going off. And that's why the U.S. is providing $2.8 million in aid.</p><p>Once on the ground, they are handing things out like food, water containers, shelter items and hygiene kits. This private airfield now, a makeshift base as the search and rescue efforts continue. This place set up in about 24 hours, likely to double in size.</p><p>As you see, personnel from all sorts of different jurisdictions and countries. They tell us the most difficult thing right now is just how vast the landscape is, how desolate it is. The only way they can bring in supplies and will continue to do so, is by air.</p><p>Forty-seven metric tons and all, so far, and Administrator Green says, as teams set up their base camps, their work is just beginning.</p><p>MARK GREEN, ADMINISTRATOR, USAID: This is American compassion. We always stand with people, particularly our neighbors, when crisis strike. This is who we are as Americans. They know it and we know it.</p><p>PAUL: Search and rescue crews tell us they understand the frustrations from those who need help and they are frustrated too that relief can't come faster.</p><p>TRACEY REID, PLANS TEAM MANAGER, USA 1: We wish we were there when it happened or directly afterwards, so that we could be there immediately. So, we feel like we're making up for lost time from the moment we hit the ground.</p><p>PAUL: Some of the people on the ground say, unlike responding to a disaster on the mainland portion of the U.S., they can't drive in supplies, only further delaying getting those items to those who need it the most. In Homestead, Florida, Jeff Paul, FOX News.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EMANUEL: Texas leads the way in a huge investigation of the search giant, Google. Texas A.G. Ken Paxton is here, next, to explain his case.</p><p>EMANUEL: The crackdown on big tech intensifying tonight, nearly every state is joining a bipartisan investigation into Google's market dominance and this is just days after a separate group of states announced an investigation into Facebook. Fox Business Network's Hillary Vaughn is investigating the latest claims. Good evening, Hillary.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Mike, this is not the first anti-trust probe that Google has faced, but it is the largest with attorneys general from all states but California and Alabama joining in. The bipartisan team of state A.G.'s will start by looking into Google's ad practices, how consumer data they collect feeds into their ad dominance resulting in what some watchdogs are calling a monopoly on digital advertising. But some A.G.s say, this investigation could go further.</p><p>SEAN REYES, ATTORNEY GENERAL, UTAH: That's what our investigation intends to uncover and reveal, whether Google is delayed by the rules and acted fairly. There's a fine line sometimes between aggressive business practices and illegal ones. Usually the line is very clear, and again, our investigation will determine whether Google has crossed that line.</p><p>VAUGHN: Today's announcement was about flexing the power of the attorney general's office to crack down on a company that has had little oversight and tried to force some regulations. Google responding to the investigation writing: \"The DOJ has asked us to provide information about these past investigations and we expect state attorneys general will ask similar questions. We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so.\" Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt tells me there is strength in numbers. His state was the first to launch an anti-trust probe into Google, and he says: \"Everything is on the table with this multistate investigation.\"</p><p>ERIC SCHMITT, ATTORNEY GENERAL, MISSOURI That's the force and the power of all the attorneys general being there together to get answers and make sure that everybody is held accountable.</p><p>VAUGHN: This probe is adding to a pile of problems for Google as they face mounting pressure from Congress, a separate investigation by the Department of Justice, other countries around the world are also investigating the company. Mike.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EMANUEL: Hillary Vaughn, thanks very much. Our next guest is leading the charge against Google and the massive anti-trust probe. Let's bring in Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. General, great to have you.</p><p>KEN PAXTON, ATTORNEY GENERAL, TEXAS: Thanks for having me on. I appreciate it.</p><p>EMANUEL: Why is this necessary, sir?</p><p>PAXTON: We have had complaints from other companies, from individuals for years and years. It's not -- this is an organic thing. It's not coming up through a particular A.G.'s office. And there've been enough of those complaints that we felt like it was time to take a look at it.</p><p>EMANUEL: Washington Post's take on your efforts as this: \"For years, Silicon Valley has been relatively free of regulation, particularly in Washington. Former President Barack Obama took a hands-off approach to encourage the industry's growth and Congress never took serious action. But a series of scandals including the misuse of social media during the 2016 election thrust of the industry into the political spotlight, prompting some state and federal policy makers to question whether companies have become too big, too powerful, and too unchecked.\" Does the Washington Post have this right?</p><p>PAXTON: They may have this right. We're looking -- that's exactly what we're looking at. We've got a company here, an online advertising, supposedly everything is free. Everything is free for all of these searches. The reality is, they're making $117 billion a year, which means there's a lot of money being made and they control the buy side, the sell side, the (INAUDIBLE), they control the entire market, and so we're concerned.</p><p>EMANUEL: I guess some folks are going to ask what about some of these other big company? The Amazon, the Facebook, do you have your eyes on them as well?</p><p>PAXTON: So, I know the Department of Justice is looking at some of those companies. Our focus is primarily on Google and that's where we're going to start.</p><p>EMANUEL: What are you concerned you may find?</p><p>PAXTON: Look, we are concerned about dominance of one player and how that affects consumers because while they may think that the Internet is free, that the searching is free, it's really not free when they're making $117 billion. And those costs ultimately are passed on to consumers, and so consumers don't really understand, are not aware, that they're actually paying a very high price because there's one player and the one player can charge higher prices.</p><p>EMANUEL: Let me play for you something Elizabeth Warren has been saying out on the campaign trail and I'll get you to respond, sir.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We got the big banks. We've got the -- we've got big tech, right? Over and over and over. So, we got a couple of things we can do about this. Part one, how about if we got a president who has the courage to enforce the anti-trust laws that are on the books?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Your thoughts on what she is saying?</p><p>PAXTON: Well, I think we do have a president that's looking at that. We have -- we've talked to William Barr, we've talk to some of the people that work for them. They're definitely interested in the same issues. So, her criticism of the administration is not accurate. They are interested in this -- and as you can see, there are almost every state in the country, this goes across party lines. This is an issue that affects all of us and consumers across the country.</p><p>EMANUEL: Attorney General Ken Paxton of the great state of Texas, nice to see you sir</p><p>PAXTON: Thank you. Good to see you too.</p><p>EMANUEL: Fox News Alert, Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom signing a bill to limit vaccine exemptions in California schools, anti-vaccination protesters blocking several entrances to the state capital tonight and to Newsom's office. California highway patrol confirming there were several arrests.</p><p>After calling off the controversial Taliban talks, what's President Trump's next move on Afghanistan? Who better to ask than Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane, next.</p><p>EMANUEL: Tonight, President Trump says he is through talking peace with the Taliban for now, despite campaigning on bringing our troops home and ending America's longest war. Let's talk about the big picture of the Afghan War with Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst General Jack Keane. General, it's great to have you here.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes, good to be here, Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: One of the top Republicans in the House: Liz Cheney, is praising President Trump for calling off the talks. Take a listen and I'll ask you to respond.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY): I am very glad that the president said these talks are dead, we're not going to be negotiating with them. You can't trust the Taliban. You know, we've been talking to the Taliban for years but the notion that somehow, we think they're going to be a partner for peace, that somehow, they're going to give us counterterrorism assurances.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Is at the right call, General Keane?</p><p>KEANE: Yes, absolutely. Listen, what the Taliban did almost a year ago before the negotiations began, they told their fighters to increase the level of activity and the level of fighting and kill as many as you can to include Americans. and they did that for the single purpose of increasing their leverage at these negotiations. That's the kind of folks that we're dealing with here. So, what do we got now? President made the right call; we got an opportunity to reassess and reset and let's go get us a better deal. This thing was moving, I believe, in the wrong direction.</p><p>New deal, (INAUDIBLE) should be -- we don't talk unless a cease-fire, let's stop the killing. That makes sense. Second thing is, we got to get the Afghan government involved, not just us. Third thing, Pakistan, their new leadership, the general in charge, the president in charge said we're backing away from our predecessors -- we want a stable Afghanistan, we're no longer (INAUDIBLE) war. Let's put them to the test about that. The other thing, is we've got to make certain that this is not in a deal.</p><p>A timetable withdrawal, because that was going to be announced, that we would get out of there by the end of 2020. We should not have a timetable drive that. We should not make an announcement like that. The conditions should be the driver of that. And I think we got to get the Afghan government to absorb all the Afghan cost and just have the United States pay for U.S. costs. I think we can get that worked out.</p><p>EMANUEL: It's worth-noting almost 75 years after the end of World War II, we still have troops in places like Germany and Japan. 66 years or so after the Korean conflict we still have plenty of troops keeping an eye on North Korea. Is there any reason why the United States shouldn't keep some troops in Afghanistan to keep an eye on things and make sure there's not another 9/11?</p><p>KEANE: That's a great question people ask me even today. I had an official asking me: what does the end look like? How does this turn out? Well, the fact is, radical Islam is a multigenerational war? We're not close to the end of it. And we're only interested in certain pieces of that war. I would suggest Pakistan, would conduct covert operations in the al-Qaeda there, we got their foot on their neck. Afghanistan is another place -- we keep a modest investment in.</p><p>Our viewers may not know that we go into Yemen, Libya and Somalia, attack radical Islamic organizations there, why? Because we believe they have aspirational goals to attack America. Same thing in Syria. Even though we took the caliphate away, ISIS is still there. They have aspirational goals to return to that caliphate and hurt -- to America. So, here, is a half a dozen places where America has national security interests. That requires some level of commitment, Mike, and it's in our national security interests to protect the American people. There are 30 or 40 other places the radical Islamists are involved. We're not getting involved and we don't have the national interest to do so.</p><p>EMANUEL: So, if the president were to call you after watching the segment would you say, Mr. President, would just be patient?</p><p>KEANE: Yes. Let's get a much better deal, let's hold the Taliban's feet to the fire, and if you're going to continue to kill people, Americans and innocent civilians, the way you are doing wantonly, we're not talking to you. Let's get a cease-fire as the first order of business and then we'll start talking.</p><p>EMANUEL: General Jack Keane, I could pick your brain all night, but we're out of time sir.</p><p>KEANE: Good talking to you, Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: Thanks for your time.</p><p>KEANE: Good seeing you, pal.</p><p>EMANUEL: After a late night in Britain's parliament, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffering yet another setback. British lawmakers rejecting his request for an election before the country's scheduled departure from the European Union next month. Johnson wanted an early election to help him push through Brexit. The opposition wants to delay Brexit but Johnson tonight is vowing to push ahead with Brexit, though it is unclear how he can do so at this point.</p><p>Stick around for a brand-new special series featuring Shannon's interviews with 2020 power partners, the spouses and loved ones of the candidates. She goes inside their loves and lives and finds out who's really in charge in these power couples.</p><p>EMANUEL: \"2020 IN 60 SECONDS\" now, something you don't see in every campaign, a presidential candidate leading a meditation session for her supporters. Spiritual Author Marianne Williamson telling Fox News: meditation may be unique for a presidential campaign, but not for America. She searched for her inner truth in New Hampshire tonight.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris apologizing for her reaction to a remark from a questioner during a Town Hall who called President Trump's actions mentally retarded. Senator Harris laughed. Now, she's apologizing; she says she didn't hear the words and that kind of comment is unacceptable at any rate.</p><p>And controversial activist, Linda Sarsour, campaigning for Senator Bernie Sanders, the Women's March co-founder endorsing Sanders' foreign policies and praising him for his stand on Israel. He has proposed leveraging aid to push Israel to change its policies on the Palestinians.</p><p>As the campaign trail heats up for 2020 Democrats, tonight we start a new segment where we get to know the better halves behind the candidates. Tonight's first power partner is former Congressman John Delaney's wife April McLain Delaney, whom Shannon met in Georgetown near the power couple's apartment from years ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>APRIL MCLAIN-DELANEY, WIFE OF JOHN DELANEY: My husband is actually, if you can believe it, a better cook than me.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Same in my house.</p><p>DELANEY: He often says that cooking is one of those things that you can immediately see the benefits of your labor and enjoy them.</p><p>BREAM: That's true, that's true.</p><p>DELANEY: And so, he -- he's one of these people who has always loved to grill, but he's actually incredible with Italian foods. Also, (INAUDIBLE) is amazing, but he used to cook a lot here and I would clean up --</p><p>BREAM: It's a good give and take.</p><p>We spoke to April Delaney in one of her favorite spots, dog tag bakery. Near John's old apartment in Georgetown.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They are made of oats.</p><p>DELANEY: Well, it's interesting when I first moved to Washington in 1986, the fall of 86, it was not as broken and divided.</p><p>BREAM: The roaring 80s were bursting with optimism and so were the Delaney's.</p><p>DELANEY: We started with nothing. I mean, we had nothing when we started. I was working in a law firm; he started his first businesses.</p><p>BREAM: While John was launching health care financing start-ups, April forged ahead with her own ambitious legal career.</p><p>DELANEY: I practiced for many years as communications attorney and then I went to work for a satellite company.</p><p>BREAM: Her next stop, a nonprofit that deals with how all kinds of media affect kids like her four children aged 12 to 23.</p><p>DELANEY: Protecting your privacy, skyrocketing anxiety and depression in our nation's youth.</p><p>BREAM: Much like her husband, April sounds like a centrist Democrat who appreciates the hard work it takes to get different sides together to find common solutions.</p><p>DELANEY: I think in that, you meet a lot of people along the way in Washington and you realize that there's a lot of good to be had. You find it actually processed dormant progress is made one bite of the apple at a time. It's taking government and private sector and consumer groups and nonprofit, and coalescing and taking one step forward in having one bite of the apple.</p><p>BREAM: Hearkening back to a different era, one she believes provides lessons for today.</p><p>DELANEY: And everyone now wants the whole apple, but actually that's not the way the framers wanted it to be. And actually, hard work and progress come from rolling up your sleeves and really hard work, and that's not encapsulated in a tweet.</p><p>BREAM: As we talked to the dog tag, it occurred to me not a lot has changed with the Delaney's since their early days in the kitchen in Georgetown. The stakes are bigger, but it's the old give and take and teamwork. John is vowing to stay in the race despite not making the debate stage in Houston and April is doing her part to help keep them in the 2020 campaign. Like her husband, she believes that getting to the 130,000 unique donors to make the October debate stage is achievable, but more difficult because he's a centrist.</p><p>DELANEY: If you really have a fringe, or if you're already a celebrity or if you have a real fringe either left or right type of message, it's quicker, Americans need to have voices on the Democratic stage that really speak to these problems and are more centrist and talk about stopping the noise.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EMANUEL: And that's the first installment of Shannon's new series, \"2020 POWER PARTNERS.\" And don't forget to tune into FOX NEWS @ NIGHT on Thursday evening after the third Democratic primary debate, our Chief Political Anchor Bret Baier will head up our special debate coverage live from Houston, 11:00 p.m. Eastern until 1:00 a.m.</p><p>Today the White House presented six Dayton, Ohio, police officers who responded to last month's mass shooting with the nation's highest award for public safety. The six officers confronted the shooter within 30 seconds, a swift response credited with preventing more deaths. The president also honored the bravery of five civilians with heroic commendations for having helped others as a gunman opened fire at a Wal-Mart in El Paso. They heroically stood for others in the darkest moments of despair. They are all our \"MIDNIGHT HEROES.\"</p><p>Most-watched, most trusted, and most grateful you spent the evening with us. Good night from Washington. I'm Mike Emanuel. I'll see you tomorrow night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019090901cb259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X16-0N11-JB20-G1JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7260\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>MARA SALVATRUCHA (MS-13)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The comments come after tech firms have faced scrutiny over whether their platforms enforce political bias. Trump also briefly commented on the issue of regulation in the tech industry over antitrust concerns, saying that \"obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\" Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] President Trump said while speaking with CNBC's \"Squawk Box\"[4] on Monday that tech companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon \"discriminate against\" him. </p><p>\"People talk about collusion, I can tell you that the real collusion is between the democrats and these companies, because they were so against me during my election run,\" he said to the network when asked about the ongoing antitrust concerns surrounding these companies. \"Everybody said if you don't have them, you can't win. Well I won, and I'll win again.\" The comments come after executives from Google, Facebook, and Twitter testified before Congress last year to address allegations of bias on their platforms, among other topics. Google CEO Sundar Pichai denied such allegations[5] when appearing before Congress in December, saying that the company's only mission is to provide \"accurate, trusted information.\" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said when testifying in September[6] that his company \"strongly believes in being impartial\" and that it strives \"to enforce our rules impartially.\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also denied such allegations of intentional bias, saying last April that the goal of his company is to \"be a platform for all ideas.\" President Trump later added that \"obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly,\" when asked again whether there's an antitrust issue with tech firms with large market sizes, like Facebook and Google. Read more: Trump drops the biggest hint yet that he's coming after the big tech 'monopoly' with potential billion-dollar fines[7] Companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon have come under scrutiny in recent months over their size and the amount of power they hold within their respective industries. Democratic senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren proposed a plan in March[8] that would subject large tech firms like Facebook, Amazon, and Google to regulation. Under such a plan, certain large tech firms would have to roll back some acquisitions and would be prohibited from competing in the same marketplaces that they operate. That would mean breaking Facebook away from WhatsApp and Instagram, and Amazon away from Whole Foods. The European Union in particular has cracked down on large American tech firms in recent years. In March, the EU fined Google $1.7 billion[9] over its online advertising practices, accusing the search giant of abusing its market dominance. It's also preparing to probe Apple after music streaming app Spotify filed a complaint with the EU over Apple's App Store practices, according to the Financial Times[10]. President Trump also touched on the EU's regulation of tech companies, potentially suggesting that the United States should be enforcing some type of regulation. He didn't provide any details on how or what that would entail, however. \"Every week you see [the EU] going after Facebook and Apple and all of these companies, that are, you know, great companies but something is going on,\" he said. \"But I will say the European Union is suing them all the time. We are going to be looking at them differently ... They get all this money. We should be doing that \u2014 they're our companies, so they're actually attacking our companies. But we should be doing what they're doing.\"NOW WATCH: I've used iPhones for nearly a decade and switched to the Samsung Galaxy S10.

His comments during an interview on Fox Business came weeks after federal regulators at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission divvied up the scrutiny of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google \u2014 a move that could suggest the government is in the early stages of an investigation into those tech giants.</p><p>Trump later swiped at Google, claiming the search and advertising giant is \"trying to rig the election.\" He then claimed that Twitter has made it \"very hard\" for users to find and follow him. Trump did not provide new evidence for his latest allegation that the companies exhibit bias against conservatives, which Google and Twitter long have vehemently denied.</p><p>\"You may need legislation in order to create competition,\" Trump said in response to a question about how his administration might proceed.</p><p>Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did the White House. Twitter declined to comment.</p><p>Trump's attacks only add to Silicon Valley's mounting political headaches in Washington, where even bitterly divided Democrats and Republicans have sounded similar alarms about the growing size and power of big tech companies.</p><p>Antitrust efforts at the DOJ and FTC are supposed to be independent of political influence from the White House. Even Trump's reference to lawsuits could provoke the ire of congressional Democrats, who repeatedly have criticized the president out of concern he has interfered in past competition-related matters, such as AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner Cable, a deal that included CNN.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump repeatedly has attacked Facebook, Twitter, and other social-media sites for exhibiting bias against conservatives. In May, the White House took the unprecedented step of releasing a survey in an attempt to collect personal information and stories about people who say they have been unfairly censored online for their political views, a move that drew sharp criticism from open government and free speech advocates.</p><p>This time, Trump's comments came in response to a video posted online by Project Veritas, an organization founded by James O'Keefe that targets reporters and people it deems to be left-leaning. The video purported to show Google employees discussing politics in a way that suggested they targeted conservatives. But the clip had been recorded in secret, without the Google executive's permission or knowledge, and she later said that Project Veritas had edited the video in a duplicitous way.</p><p>Earlier this year, Trump had pressed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about allegations of bias at a private White House meeting. Twitter long has maintained that Trump, who has more than 61 million followers, experiences fluctuations in his follower count because of the company's effort to find and remove spam accounts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-31ccf016-9822-11e9-8ba9-b951ebb226cb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF6-6JN1-DYHJ-31SY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"593\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 27, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002H12</classCode><className>TIME WARNER CABLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

His executive orders ban Americans from engaging in an as yet undefined set of transactions with the parent companies of these apps. Rumors have been swirling for weeks that the Trump administration would ban the use of these two prominent Chinese apps in the United States, but these new measures could have far more impact, including extending to usage of these apps outside US borders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chinese apps and national security</p><p>TikTok and WeChat are two of the most successful Chinese apps. WeChat is a \"super app\" that has become a necessity for daily life in China, combining messaging, social media, news, transport, payments, and more into one powerful application used by well over a billion people. Attempts to gain users abroad, however, have foundered outside the Chinese diaspora. TikTok is a short video app specially designed for the market outside China. It has become the first Chinese app to take off abroad, with hundreds of millions of users all over the world, thanks to a powerful algorithm. In fact, Chinese authorities banned TikTok from the start because it is not subject to the same censorship and other controls as its domestic counterpart Douyin. Blocking apps is par for the course for China, which has long used its \"great firewall\" and an extensive censorship apparatus to block foreign apps and websiteslike Facebook, Twitter, and Googleand much more.</p><p>TikTok expanded into the United States when its owner ByteDance purchased US-based lip-synching app Musical.ly in 2017, which it then merged into TikTok. ByteDance did not clear the purchase with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the US government body that reviews foreign investments for national security threats. With some justification, Bytedance probably thought that acquiring an app mostly used by teenagers to make lip-synch videos was unlikely to be worth reporting. However, even if it would have sailed through a review back then, its lack of reporting left it vulnerable to forced divestment when security concerns grew over its subsequent growthits use spreading even to US military recruitersand revelations about its privacy practices, misinformation, and censorship. The US government has ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok's US business, and Microsoft is now in talks to acquire some of TikTok's businesses.</p><p>TikTok's success abroad was bound to run into two major headwinds: a hawkish shift to rethink the US relationship with China, especially with regard to technology and security, and a global awakening of the problems that can come with big tech platforms, such as data privacy, misinformation, and surveillance. These concerns, and probably some protectionism, were behind India's recent move to block a wide variety of Chinese apps. All tech platforms are facing more scrutiny today, but those with Chinese owners pose more complex questions, such as what access the Chinese Communist Party has to sensitive data gathered on foreign users or to what extent it could order apps to extend censorship and misinformation outside its borders. These are thorny questions beyond the scope of this post.1</p><p>Trump's executive orders</p><p>The executive order issued August 6 sets a 45-day deadline after which \"any transaction that is related to WeChat by any person...subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, with Tencent...or any subsidiary\" is banned; a second executive order the same day similarly bans ByteDanceand by extension, TikTok. After an initial panic in the online gaming market, where Tencent, the multinational conglomerate that developed WeChat, is one of the world's largest investors, the administration quickly clarified that Tencent investees outside of WeChat are not part of the order. The scope of \"transaction\" is yet to be defined.</p><p>Impact of the executive orders is unclear</p><p>Much of the orders' impact and scope remain unclear because they do not cite or appear to fit under pre-existing economic policy tools like export controls and sanctions that have established laws, regulations, definitions, and precedents to provide predictability. Instead, they declare an ad hoc emergency and cite another executive order on securing the information and communications technology supply chain, one that I have criticized as providing overly wide latitude to the executive branch. The orders use language similar to what is used in financial sanctions imposed on regimes like North Korea, banning American companies and citizens from just about any business transactions with the sanctioned entity, and going far beyond the export restrictions placed on entities like the telecommunications giant Huawei that have been put on the \"entity list,\" a blacklist that forbids exports of US goods to entities the United States deems a threat to security or foreign policy.</p><p>Both orders will probably force ByteDance and WeChat to be removed from Apple and Google's US app stores, but repercussions are unlikely to end there. Apple and Google's app stores outside the United States might be exempt from action if they are run by non-US subsidiaries, but they would face a serious compliance burden because US citizens would need to be blocked from any \"transactions\" involving WeChat or Bytedance that fall within the scope of the order. Since the rules as written apply to anyone in the United States and to US citizens or permanent residents everywhere, a Chinese tourist in San Francisco or an American student in Beijing adding money to their WeChat digital wallet could be in legal trouble for violating the order. If the WeChat ban stands, its impact will fall the hardest on those with family in China who rely on WeChat to communicate. Most Western app alternatives are blocked in China, and email and other methods are no substitute for the group chats that have become a staple of life in China.</p><p>The executive order on TikTok in a way duplicates a US government order to divest TikTok's US business that ByteDance has already agreed to comply with. The executive order's ban on dealing with ByteDance would seem to complicate rather than facilitate the earlier deal by adding legal risk to the acquiror, which surely will require many transactions with ByteDance into the future to disentangle and settle a multibillion-dollar investment.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Worryingly, the orders signal a US government embrace of a vision for the internet that more resembles Beijing's vision of closed-off cyber sovereignty than the longstanding US tradition of championing an open internet. Any direct security gain from banning Chinese apps must be considered in that context. While the orders are aimed at China today, one of the long-term losers could well end up being US technology companies that today dominate the global market. US bans on foreign apps could provide cover to other countries to spin up their own national security justification to ban what are to them foreign appsfrom US companies like Facebook and Google. This possible scenario has led even Mark Zuckerberg, who heads TikTok's main competitor Facebook, to call such a ban \"a really bad long-term precedent.\"</p><p>As Samm Sacks, a cybersecurity policy expert at the think tank New America, has persuasively argued, real and pressing security concerns around data and privacy cannot be solved with ad hoc bans on apps based on their parent company's origin. Right now, it is too easy for anyone, even foreign governments, to buy or hack sensitive data on American citizens without harvesting it directly from apps or by buying up companies. Rather, the US government needs its own robust data protection regime to protect citizens' privacy and national security.</p><p>Note</p><p>1. CitizenLab has shown that WeChat accounts registered outside of China provide inputs to China's censorship apparatus.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123873294</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60J7-KWG1-DYTH-G4TB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1339\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 7, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But a noisy fight with Silicon Valley could rally his base.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Donald Trump is finally delivering on his long-threatened campaign to launch a counterstrike against social media companies that have fact-checked, downgraded or booted some of his most vocal online supporters - and in one new high-profile instance, himself.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But his efforts also reveal how little legal recourse he may have to target Silicon Valley giants protected by the First Amendment, gridlock in Congress and reluctance from within his own party. The strategy relies mostly on a newly signed executive order that seeks to limit the scope of a 1996 law that shields tech companies from many lawsuits. Trump also pledged to pursue still-undefined legislation to pare those protections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even if Trump's moves won't change much overnight on Twitter, Facebook or other platforms, they will satisfy his political desires to threaten big tech companies and rally conservatives who think social media has inherent bias against them. And he may be setting the stage for a protracted effort to use executive agencies and his allies in Congress to pressure tech companies to change their ways.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are answers to some key questions about Thursday's announcement.</p><p>The president signed an executive order Thursday afternoon that calls on various agencies to take a hard look at the long-standing legal protections that safeguard online companies from libel suits and other litigation. These protections, under a statute known as Section 230, are a crucial tool that companies like Twitter and Facebook rely on to amass their fortunes - offering Trump a target in his crusade against what he calls pervasive censorship of conservatives.</p><p>But it's an open question whether regulators will follow through on his plans, which would be sure to draw swift legal opposition. His order depends a lot on decisions by agencies like the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission, which are not subject to his direct control, as well as state attorneys general working with his Justice Department.</p><p>Trump for weeks has teased action to address Republican allegations that social media platforms stifle conservative viewpoints, tweeing earlier this month that \"the Radical Left is in total command &amp; control of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google.\" He added: \"The Administration is working to remedy this illegal situation.\"</p><p>No conclusive evidence exists of an anti-GOP bias on platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, and the companies have consistently denied intentionally suppressing any political viewpoints as they enforce policies against hateful or dangerous conduct. But the president and his allies escalated their attacks on Silicon Valley this week after Twitter added fact-checking labels to a pair of Trump's tweets for the first time.</p><p>Trump had tweeted without evidence that mail-in ballots in this year's elections are likely to be \"substantially fraudulent,\" a claim Twitter said misled users about the electoral process. One member of the Federal Election Commission, Democrat Ellen Weintraub, has called the allegations a baseless \"conspiracy theory.\" Independent fact-checkers have also found the claims to be unsubstantiated.</p><p>Trump vowed on Wednesday to take a \"big action\" against Twitter and other social media companies after the controversy erupted.</p><p>At a signing ceremony for the executive order Thursday, Trump cited Twitter's fact-checking labels as an \"egregious example\" of what he called the company sliding into \"political activism.\"</p><p>\"The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress, edit, blacklist, shadow ban are editorial decisions, pure and simple, they're editorial decisions,\" he said. \"In these moments Twitter ceases to be a neutral public platform and they become an editor with a viewpoint.\"</p><p>It would take various tracks. For one thing, Trump's order would direct the Commerce Department to ask the FCC to review when websites qualify for Section 230's legal protections. It would prohibit federal agencies from advertising through social networks that \"violate free speech principles,\" and gives agencies 30 days to report their spending and the \"viewpoint-based speech restrictions\" on the platforms where they've spent money.</p><p>Finally, it tasks the FTC and state attorneys general, in partnership with the Justice Department, to review whether internet companies have deceived or been unfair to users by censoring political speech beyond what they have publicly disclosed.</p><p>Section 230, part of a 1996 law called the Communications Decency Act, broadly shields websites from being sued for content their users post - or for taking down material that they \"in good faith\" believe to be \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.\" That once-obscure section has been crucial to the fortunes of companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google that make money from all the tweets, likes, photos and videos put up by their users, as well as smaller firms that set up shop online.</p><p>Now Section 230 has become a political target for leaders of both parties, who think Silicon Valley giants are botching their handling of political and other forms of speech online. Those include Republicans, like Trump, who accuse the tech giants of censoring conservatives - but also Democratic lawmakers who say the companies don't do enough to curb politicians' lies, targeted harassment and hate speech.</p><p>\"My executive order calls for new regulations under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to make it that social media companies that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield,\" Trump said Thursday.</p><p>No, but Trump is asking them to review when the law can be applied. It's an open legal question whether agencies like the FCC can or should make the kinds of legal determinations that Trump is asking for, and any decisions they make would probably become a matter for a judge to decide.</p><p>The president on Thursday for the first time publicly called for lawmakers to take up legislation to roll back the those protections, a push that has been gaining steam for months among his Capitol Hill allies.</p><p>Attorney General William Barr, who stood alongside Trump at the ceremony, said the administration is \"preparing federal legislation\" that they plan to send over \"shortly\" for review at the Office of Management and Budget. Barr wouldn't offer details, but Trump chimed in that it could contain sweeping changes to the legal shield. \"One of the things we may do, Bill, is just remove or totally change 230,\" Trump said, without elaborating.</p><p>The remarks are likely to embolden GOP tech critics such Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Trump ally who said Wednesday that he's drafting a bill to roll back the protections if companies engage in \"editorializing\" or \"opine as to the truth or falsity\" of statements online. Gaetz told POLITICO last year that he raised his issues with the law with top White House officials.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), another top Trump ally and a leading GOP tech critic on Capitol Hill, similarly introduced a bill that would remove the legal shield from companies if they cannot prove to regulators that they are not stifling certain viewpoints. Trump broadly praised Hawley's legislative efforts on big tech at the White House social media summit last year, which the lawmaker attended and spoke at.</p><p>Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has jumped on the bandwagon, too, tweeting Sunday that the law \"protects social media companies like @Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers. But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher then they should no longer be shielded from liability &amp; treated as publishers under the law.\"</p><p>Any GOP-led effort to address bias allegations by amending Section 230 would be dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled House. It has also failed so far to pick up any significant backing even in the Republican-led Senate. That campaign has even faced opposition from conservative officials and advocacy groups that largely want Washington to keep its hands off the internal decisions of private companies.</p><p>\"I want to be very clear: I'm not for gutting Section 230. It's essential for consumers and entities in the internet ecosystem,\" Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) said at a hearing on the legal shield last year. \"Misguided and hasty attempts to amend or even repeal Section 230 for bias or other reasons could have unintended consequences for free speech and the ability for small businesses to provide new and innovative services.\"</p><p>Yes, but allegations of bias are where bipartisan agreement on Section 230 ends.</p><p>The issue has gained attention in the 2020 presidential race, with presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden calling for the legal shield to be entirely \"revoked.\" But Biden said the action was needed because platforms like Facebook are \"propagating falsehoods they know to be false\" - pretty much the opposite of Trump's complaints that they're too quick to label or take down conservatives' messages.</p><p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Trump ally Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), is pushing for a different update to Section 230 that would require websites to prove to regulators they are taking sufficient steps to combat child exploitation to keep those protections. That bill wouldn't address the bias allegations, however.</p><p>Still, Barr contended Thursday the administration's new legislative effort could pick up Democratic support.</p><p>\"One of the things that I found has the broadest bipartisan support these days is the feeling that this provision Section 230 has been stretched way beyond its original intention,\" he said. \"And people feel that on both sides of the aisle.\"</p><p>But Democratic lawmakers weren't rushing to embrance Trump's newest proposal.</p><p>\"Whatever the criticisms I may have of current law, Trump's demagogic meat-ax Executive Order is exactly wrong,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in a statement Thursday. He called Trump's order \"a blatant attempt to use the full power of the United States government to force private companies to lie for him.\"</p><p>Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) accused Trump of trying to divert attention from the pandemic and economic calamity weighing down his reelection prospects. \"He wants you to talk about twitter and not the mass preventable deaths and the 40 million unemployed,\" Schatz tweeted.</p><p>It's ramped up a lot of public pressure - in keeping with a longstanding Republican tactic of using critiques of the mainstream media, and now Silicon Valley, to rile up supporters.</p><p>Last spring, for example, the White House launched a website to solicit people's accusations that social media companies had censored them, but it never disclosed what it did with the information it collected - which included personal details like users' citizenship status.</p><p>Later that year, the White House held a gathering of conservative lawmakers and right-wing social media personalities that the administration billed as an exploration of \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free speech rights of all Americans.\" Trump said at the time he planned to haul in executives from the big tech companies for follow-up discussions, but the only such meeting to come to light was a private dinner last fall with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>Discussions of alleged anti-GOP bias on social media also came up at a Justice Department summit with state attorneys general in 2018, under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as POLITICO reported at the time. The talks triggered fears among industry executives that the Trump administration was politicizing unrelated reviews into the conduct of Silicon Valley giants.</p><p>Federal judges have said repeatedly - as recently as Wednesday - that online companies are private businesses with a legal right to police content on their sites. They have rejected claims that platforms like Twitter are trampling on people's First Amendment rights by deleting their posts or even banning them altogether.</p><p>In Wednesday's ruling, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a suit that right-wing provocateur Laura Loomer had filed against Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple. Loomer, a Trump supporter, has been banned from multiple platforms for making anti-Muslim statements.</p><p>\"In general, the First Amendment 'prohibits only governmental abridgment of speech,'\" the court said. And Silicon Valley, for all its power, is not the government.</p><p>His critics among tech industry and civil liberties groups call it an alarming attempt to intimidate companies' exercise of free speech. But some tech experts say it could also take attention away from a debate that Congress and the executive branch need to have - has this legal immunity handed Silicon Valley too much power over what billions of people see and read, even on issues as vital as this year's elections or the coronavirus?</p><p>\"The draft is 95% political theater - rhetoric without legal foundation, and without legal impact,\" said Daphne Keller of the Cyber Policy Center at Stanford University, reacting to a draft version that matched the final order. But she added, \"the real takeaway should be that this EO is a distraction. We have only ourselves to blame if it makes us avert our gaze from the crises that are right in front of us, and that urgently need attention: 100,000 Americans dead in a profoundly mismanaged pandemic, for example, or the potential failure of democratic process in the 2020 elections.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-287834</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-HNX1-F118-904H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2247\"/><timeReceived>8:32 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This is Oliver Darcy again at the helm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump continues war with Big Tech</p><p>President Trump's war with Google spilled into a second day on Wednesday. The president raised eyebrows when he posted a video to Twitter that suggested Google had promoted President Obama's State of the Union addresses, but not his. \"#StopTheBias,\" Trump tweeted. The problem? Google said in a statement shortly after that it had in fact promoted Trump's 2018 address... BuzzFeed has a full debunk here...</p><p>&gt;&gt; Full statement from a Google spokesperson: \"On January 30 2018, we highlighted the livestream of President Trump's State of the Union on the google.com homepage. We have historically not promoted the first address to Congress by a new president, which is technically not a State of the Union address. As a result, we didn't include a promotion on google.com for this address in either 2009 or 2017.\"</p><p>White House mum</p><p>After receiving Google's statement, I reached out to Sarah Sanders. I asked her if the White House will address the matter or issue a correction. I also asked why the president was sharing misleading info aimed at damaging a private business on Twitter. I didn't receive a response... </p><p>Steve Bannon, however, has some thoughts...</p><p>One person who did want to chat was Steve Bannon. I had texted Bannon earlier in the day to see what he made of Trump's war on Big Tech. Bannon, after all, has been talking about this tech stuff for some time now. Earlier tonight he gave me a ring. Some highlights of what he said...</p><p>&gt;&gt; Asked about Trump pushing misleading info to advance a war on Big Tech, Bannon said, \"The president often times sees information and thinks it ought to be in the public dialogue.\" Bannon said the \"direction\" of Trump's rhetoric is \"correct\" and that his tweets on issues often help get things \"into the conversation.\" </p><p>&gt;&gt; Bannon said Big Tech's data should be seized and put in a \"public trust.\" Specifically, Bannon said, \"I think you take [the data] away from the companies. All that data they have is put in a public trust. They can use it. And people can opt in and opt out. That trust is run by an independent board of directors. It just can't be that [Big Tech is] the sole proprietors of this data...I think this is a public good.\" Bannon added that Big Tech companies \"have to be broken up\" just like Teddy Roosevelt broke up the trusts.\"</p><p>&gt;&gt; Bannon attacked the executives of Facebook, Twitter and Google. \"These are run by sociopaths,\" he said. \"These people are complete narcissists. These people ought to be controlled, they ought to be regulated.\" At one point during the phone call, Bannon said, \"These people are evil. There is no doubt about that.\"</p><p>&gt;&gt; Bannon said he thinks \"this is going to be a massive issue\" in future elections. He said he thinks it will probably take until 2020 to fully blossom as a campaign issue, explaining, \"I think by the time 2020 comes along, this will be a burning issue. I think this will be one of the biggest domestic issues.\" Bannon said the \"#MeToo movement has brought the issue of consent front and center\" and argued that \"this is going to bring the issue of digital consent front and center.\" </p><p>Swisher's take</p><p>Kara Swisher, on the other hand, does not appear to be a fan of Trump's Big Tech rhetoric. She wrote a blistering piece in the NYT on Wednesday, skewering Trump for what she said was a \"ludicrous attack\" on Big Tech. In her piece's opening line, Swisher wrote, \"Here's the truest conundrum of the social media age: Those who complain loudest about being silenced never ever shut up.\"</p><p>&gt;&gt; Another section of interest: \"Rather than attacking techies, he should send them a gold-embossed thank you note. Instead, as is his way, Mr. Trump huffs and puffs away on issues that have finally bubbled up to him from the ever-growing cesspool of online anger, especially the truly ludicrous idea that Silicon Valley does not like conservatives.\"</p><p>Author of bogus Google study: Regulation of Big Tech not the answer</p><p>The blogger who wrote the bogus study that asserted 96% of results returned by Google for the \"Trump news\" search query wrote an op-ed in WaPo on Wednesday. In the op-ed, Paula Bolyard said she stood by her study, but shot down the idea of regulating Big Tech. </p><p>Read more of Wednesday's Reliable Sources newsletter... And subscribe here to receive future editions in your inbox...</p><p>&gt;&gt; Bolyard: \"Let me be clear: While suspicions about inherent biases being baked into the systems at Google and other tech platforms are certainly warranted, I do not believe that government regulations are the answer to that problem.\"</p><p>This all sets the table for next week's hearing...</p><p>Donie O'Sullivan emails: Sheryl Sandberg, Jack Dorsey, and an empty chair. Next week's Senate Intel Committee hearing on what social media companies are doing to protect the integrity of the midterm elections could turn into quite the spectacle. The committee asked for someone from Google or its parent company's C-suite, but instead the company offered a lieutenant. Not good enough, say Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner...</p><p>A source familiar with the committee's negotiations with Google told me that Google's unwillingness to send a senior executive was a rookie error. \"Here's the irony - this would've been an easy way for Google to win some goodwill. Pichai could've sat there, looking cooperative, while Facebook and Twitter took the vast majority of the incoming [questions from senators],\" the source said.</p><p>&gt;&gt; My take: The source is right -- Facebook takes a lot more heat on this topic than Google and Twitter.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

This is an important reason why established companies are flush with cash.</p><p>Lower capital requirements coupled with an abundance of investable funds are pushing down the rate of return needed to attract new capital into business ventures.</p><p>My advice for ordinary investors remains the same.</p><p>Don't try to pick stocks or time the market - broadly diversify and invest for the long term.</p><p>Those nearing retirement should keep about half their money in fixed income vehicles with maturities of less than three to five years, and invest in a low cost S&amp;;P 500 index fund. And perhaps an international index fund to smooth returns - sometimes U.S. equities do better while other times foreign stocks lead.</p><p>If you're younger, put aside some cash for emergencies or upcoming commitments like college tuition and invest a reasonable amount each month in a similar basket of equities, follow that discipline through thick and thin, and you'll do well.</p><p>Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland @pmorici1 !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2017 Sun Media Corporation.

I bring this up because there's a greater chance than zero that they're the same awful human being. We all know that Pai sold out 80% of US citizens[1] when he chose to ignore the will of the people and repeal the government's net neutrality guidelines[2]. And now, with Kratsios, we're seeing the same playbook[3] brought out again for the same reason: money. Only this time, there's more at stake. </p><p>Kratsios is proposing we take a soft-touch approach to regulating AI. Here's a snippet from Kratsios' recent op-ed in Business Insider[4]: The White House is directing federal agencies to avoid preemptive, burdensome or duplicative rules that would needlessly hamper AI innovation and growth. Agencies will be required to conduct risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses prior to regulatory action to evaluate the potential tradeoffs of regulating a given AI technology. Given the pace at which AI will continue to evolve, agencies will need to establish flexible frameworks that allow for rapid change and updates across sectors, rather than one-size-fits-all regulations. Automated vehicles, drones, and AI-powered medical devices all call for vastly different regulatory considerations. Now, let's juxtapose that with Pai discussing net neutrality regulations, as reported in theReason podcast[5]: Pai says that one of the major mistakes of Net Neutrality is its pre-emptive nature. Rather than allowing different practices to develop and then having regulators intervene when problems or harms to customer arise, Net Neutrality is prescriptive and thus likely to serve the interests of existing companies in maintaining a status quo that's good for them. The government's erring on the side of money with an attitude that says 'we'll wait and see if there's any negative fallout for people later.' The approach is the same as it was with the net neutrality repeal, but the results could be wildly different. Where repealing net neutrality has openly allowed[6] Comcast, AT...Verizon, and their ilk to perpetuate fraud by continuing to lie[7] about the services they provide, a failure to regulate AI could result in a much more imminent threat to the health and safety of everyone in the world. The internet isn't going to go rogue and murder us all, AI could at least potentially. More importantly, it's already being used to subjugate human rights and eliminate privacy[8]. So why is the Trump administration so adamant on pushing a 'no regulation' agenda? As I pointed out in a previous article[9], the upcoming US presidential elections could spell doom for AI companies that intentionally violate our civil rights on behalf of the government. Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, for example, are likely to regulate[10] facial recognition, predictive policing, and other AI technologies used by the government and to continue empowering US states to implement their own restrictions on the use of machine learning-related technologies should either be elected. The CEOs of companies like Palantir[11] can't be resting comfortably these days. With the repeal ofnet neutrality, we were supposed to believe that the TELCOM industry would regulate itself, that we didn't need the government to protect us from having a commercial gate-keeper to the internet. Now, with AI, Kratsios is painting the picture that regulating technologies like predictive-policing, facial recognition, and black-box neural networks would stifle the US and our allies' ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the world. TELCOM doesn't regulate itself. That's why every single US internet provider has been caught manipulating customer's bills[12], throttling data[13], and lying about its services[14]. AI developers and companies do not regulate themselves. We've seen bias demonstrated in every facial recognition system[15] used by law enforcement, experts discovered proof that the algorithms used in the Judicial system were discriminatory[16], and predictive-policing is a straight-up scam[17]. If the industry regulated itself, it wouldn't release unfinished products. Regulation does stifle growth. Sometimes it's supposed to. For example, having a law in place that says US companies can't pay workers less than the minimum wage keeps businesses from exploiting workers even further to increase profit margins. That's growth that deserves to be stifled. Just like net neutrality kept certain politicians' pockets from growing (though its repeal was lucrative[18]), regulating AI would stifle the growth of companies engaged in creating systems that trade our safety,privacy, and civil rights for payola.

Tech giants herald these protections, known as Section 230, as the bedrock of the Internet. But Trump repeatedly has argued they allow Facebook, Google and Twitter to censor conservatives with impunity - charges these companies deny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers,\" Trump said before signing the document.</p><p>The order signed Thursday encourages the Federal Communications Commission to rethink the scope of Section 230 and when its liability protections apply. The order also seeks to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that the White House has asked to probe whether tech companies' content-moderation policies are in keeping with their pledges of neutrality.</p><p>The order additionally created a council in cooperation with state attorneys general to probe allegations of censorship based on political views. And it tasked federal agencies with reviewing their spending on social media advertising.</p><p>While Trump has threatened to penalize tech companies for years, his signing of the order Thursday came in response to a decision by Twitter earlier in the week to mark two of his erroneous tweets with fact-checking labels. The small move set off a firestorm of tweets by the president threatening social media companies with regulations and other punishments.</p><p>Trump's directive now could set the stage for federal regulators to write new rules and issue new punishments for companies deemed to exhibit political bias. Depending on how the order is carried out, it poses the potential for wide-ranging consequences for a much broader segment of the Internet beyond just the social media giants, potentially affecting every website, app or service where users congregate online with new liability for the content on their platform.</p><p>Already, tech companies are discussing whether to fight back with a lawsuit challenging the executive order, according to two people familiar with the deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because no decision has been made.</p><p>Legal experts said the directive will almost certainly be challenged in court, arguing it threatens to undermine the First Amendment. A wide array of critics in Congress, the tech industry and across the political spectrum also accused the White House of deputizing government agencies to carry out Trump's personal vendettas.</p><p>\"This is simply setting the wheels of law enforcement and regulation in motion against a private company for questioning the president,\" said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a Washington trade group that represents Facebook, Google and other major tech companies.</p><p>Facebook spokeswoman Liz Bourgeois said in a statement that the company believes in protecting freedom of expression along with protecting users from harmful content.</p><p>\"Those rules apply to everybody,\" she said. \"Repealing or limiting Section 230 will have the opposite effect. It will restrict more speech online, not less.\"</p><p>Google spokeswoman Riva Sciuto said in a statement that undermining Section 230 could hurt the economy and the United States' role in Internet freedom.</p><p>\"We have clear content policies and we enforce them without regard to political viewpoint,\" she said. \"Our platforms have empowered a wide range of people and organizations from across the political spectrum, giving them a voice and new ways to reach their audiences.\"</p><p>Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Executives and lobbyists at social media companies were taken by surprise by Trump's order, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the companies were formulating their responses. Internally, some Silicon Valley leaders viewed the policy as a political move that might not withstand legal scrutiny. Still, they expressed an early openness to challenging the order in court, the people said.</p><p>For now, though, Trump's order may prove difficult or impossible to enforce, experts said even before the president had signed it. But it could have far-reaching consequences, amplifying the Trump administration's power over social media companies as the country gears up for the 2020 election, some critics cautioned.</p><p>\"Donald Trump's order is plainly illegal,\" charged Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of the authors of the law that includes Section 230. He added the president sought only to \"bully companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter into giving him favorable treatment.\"</p><p>The order marks the White House's most significant attempt to rein in the tech giants after years of threats to do so from Trump and his top deputies. It also reflects the delicate, four-year dance between a president who is one of the most popular social media users in the world and the very sites and services where he broadcasts his views.</p><p>For years, Trump has accused tech giants of engaging in political censorship, at times pointing to their roots in the liberal-leaning San Francisco Bay area. He's accused Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey of limiting his followers, grumbled about Google search results and suggested at times the tech industry has sought to undermine his reelection.</p><p>Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump on Thursday again blasted the tech industry broadly for having amassed \"unchecked power.\" Attorney General William P. Barr added the Justice Department is helping to assemble legislation that might further regulate the industry, perhaps holding it liable for content that companies choose to leave online or take down.</p><p>It's not only the White House seeking to rein in tech. States attorneys general and Congress over the past year have launched probes into tech giants' market power, and they are expected to file antitrust lawsuits targeting Google as soon as this summer. Arizona's attorney general just this week sued the search giant for privacy violations, adding to a growing chorus of regulators around the country who criticize the company and its peers for the way they protect users' personal information.</p><p>But any regulation that implicates speech - especially political content online - threatens to raise a raft of thorny constitutional issues. Those concerns long have stymied other U.S. lawmakers who similarly have hoped to hold social media companies accountable for the way they police content online. The 26 words that make up the heart of Section 230 date back to 1996, before the Internet had taken off in popularity. It spared major digital services from lawsuits targeting them for what takes place on their platforms, while at the same time permitting them to do content regulation.</p><p>But the legal shield has taken on wider implications as the tech sector has grown over the past two decades, offering a shield to a wider array of companies, including Amazon, whose third-party sellers hawk counterfeits, and the ride-hailing service Uber, which contends it isn't responsible for sexual assaults that take place in the company's rides. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Democrats have tried to force the companies to better police hate speech, election falsehoods and other abusive content, threatening to strip social media sites of their liability protections if they don't more aggressively police the Web. Republicans, meanwhile, have long charged the companies are liberally biased and have suppressed right-leaning voices, although the companies have denied those claims. In doing so, they threatened for years before Trump's executive order to revoke Section 230 as punishment for these perceived biases.</p><p>Any action from the order would hinge on the FTC and FCC, two independent agencies that are supposed to operate separately of Trump's Cabinet and his political influence.

The FCC will review the government's request that the agency issue new rules, Chairman Ajit Pai (R) said Thursday.</p><p>The executive order touched off widespread opposition, uniting Democratic lawmakers, digital experts, longtime conservative-leaning advocacy groups and a bevy of free speech activists, most of whom cited free speech protections. Many agreed it could amount to government interference in private speech, a violation of the First Amendment.</p><p>\"Social media can be frustrating,\" Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic federal communications commissioner, said in a statement. \"But an executive order that would turn the Federal Communications Commission into the president's speech police is not the answer.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com\">elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-75773284-a13d-11ea-b5c9-570a91917d8d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-S771-JBFW-C019-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1525\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Suburban Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Tech giants herald these protections, known as Section 230, as the bedrock of the Internet. But Trump repeatedly has argued they allow Facebook, Google and Twitter to censor conservatives with impunity - charges these companies deny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers,\" Trump said before signing the document.</p><p>The order signed Thursday encourages the Federal Communications Commission to rethink the scope of Section 230 and when its liability protections apply. The order also seeks to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that the White House has asked to probe whether tech companies' content-moderation policies are in keeping with their pledges of neutrality.</p><p>The order additionally created a council in cooperation with state attorneys general to probe allegations of censorship based on political views. And it tasked federal agencies with reviewing their spending on social media advertising.</p><p>While Trump has threatened to penalize tech companies for years, his signing of the order Thursday came in response to a decision by Twitter earlier in the week to mark two of his erroneous tweets with fact-checking labels. The small move set off a firestorm of tweets by the president threatening social media companies with regulations and other punishments.</p><p>Trump's directive now could set the stage for federal regulators to write new rules and issue new punishments for companies deemed to exhibit political bias. Depending on how the order is carried out, it poses the potential for wide-ranging consequences for a much broader segment of the Internet beyond just the social media giants, potentially affecting every website, app or service where users congregate online with new liability for the content on their platform.</p><p>Already, tech companies are discussing whether to fight back with a lawsuit challenging the executive order, according to two people familiar with the deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because no decision has been made.</p><p>Legal experts said the directive will almost certainly be challenged in court, arguing it threatens to undermine the First Amendment. A wide array of critics in Congress, the tech industry and across the political spectrum also accused the White House of deputizing government agencies to carry out Trump's personal vendettas.</p><p>\"This is simply setting the wheels of law enforcement and regulation in motion against a private company for questioning the president,\" said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a Washington trade group that represents Facebook, Google and other major tech companies.</p><p>Facebook spokeswoman Liz Bourgeois said in a statement that the company believes in protecting freedom of expression along with protecting users from harmful content.</p><p>\"Those rules apply to everybody,\" she said. \"Repealing or limiting Section 230 will have the opposite effect. It will restrict more speech online, not less.\"</p><p>Google spokeswoman Riva Sciuto said in a statement that undermining Section 230 could hurt the economy and the United States' role in Internet freedom.</p><p>\"We have clear content policies and we enforce them without regard to political viewpoint,\" she said. \"Our platforms have empowered a wide range of people and organizations from across the political spectrum, giving them a voice and new ways to reach their audiences.\"</p><p>Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Executives and lobbyists at social media companies were taken by surprise by Trump's order, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the companies were formulating their responses. Internally, some Silicon Valley leaders viewed the policy as a political move that might not withstand legal scrutiny. Still, they expressed an early openness to challenging the order in court, the people said.</p><p>For now, though, Trump's order may prove difficult or impossible to enforce, experts said even before the president had signed it. But it could have far-reaching consequences, amplifying the Trump administration's power over social media companies as the country gears up for the 2020 election, some critics cautioned.</p><p>\"Donald Trump's order is plainly illegal,\" charged Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of the authors of the law that includes Section 230. He added the president sought only to \"bully companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter into giving him favorable treatment.\"</p><p>The order marks the White House's most significant attempt to rein in the tech giants after years of threats to do so from Trump and his top deputies. It also reflects the delicate, four-year dance between a president who is one of the most popular social media users in the world and the very sites and services where he broadcasts his views.</p><p>For years, Trump has accused tech giants of engaging in political censorship, at times pointing to their roots in the liberal-leaning San Francisco Bay area. He's accused Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey of limiting his followers, grumbled about Google search results and suggested at times the tech industry has sought to undermine his reelection.</p><p>Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump on Thursday again blasted the tech industry broadly for having amassed \"unchecked power.\" Attorney General William P. Barr added the Justice Department is helping to assemble legislation that might further regulate the industry, perhaps holding it liable for content that companies choose to leave online or take down.</p><p>It's not only the White House seeking to rein in tech. States attorneys general and Congress over the past year have launched probes into tech giants' market power, and they are expected to file antitrust lawsuits targeting Google as soon as this summer. Arizona's attorney general just this week sued the search giant for privacy violations, adding to a growing chorus of regulators around the country who criticize the company and its peers for the way they protect users' personal information.</p><p>But any regulation that implicates speech - especially political content online - threatens to raise a raft of thorny constitutional issues. Those concerns long have stymied other U.S. lawmakers who similarly have hoped to hold social media companies accountable for the way they police content online. The 26 words that make up the heart of Section 230 date back to 1996, before the Internet had taken off in popularity. It spared major digital services from lawsuits targeting them for what takes place on their platforms, while at the same time permitting them to do content regulation.</p><p>But the legal shield has taken on wider implications as the tech sector has grown over the past two decades, offering a shield to a wider array of companies, including Amazon, whose third-party sellers hawk counterfeits, and the ride-hailing service Uber, which contends it isn't responsible for sexual assaults that take place in the company's rides. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Democrats have tried to force the companies to better police hate speech, election falsehoods and other abusive content, threatening to strip social media sites of their liability protections if they don't more aggressively police the Web. Republicans, meanwhile, have long charged the companies are liberally biased and have suppressed right-leaning voices, although the companies have denied those claims. In doing so, they threatened for years before Trump's executive order to revoke Section 230 as punishment for these perceived biases.</p><p>Any action from the order would hinge on the FTC and FCC, two independent agencies that are supposed to operate separately of Trump's Cabinet and his political influence. The FTC is \"committed to robust enforcement of consumer protection and competition laws,\" consistent with its authority, spokesman Peter Kaplan said. The FCC will review the government's request that the agency issue new rules, Chairman Ajit Pai (R) said Thursday.</p><p>The executive order touched off widespread opposition, uniting Democratic lawmakers, digital experts, longtime conservative-leaning advocacy groups and a bevy of free speech activists, most of whom cited free speech protections. Many agreed it could amount to government interference in private speech, a violation of the First Amendment.</p><p>\"Social media can be frustrating,\" Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic federal communications commissioner, said in a statement. \"But an executive order that would turn the Federal Communications Commission into the president's speech police is not the answer.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com\">elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-75773284a13d11eab5c9570a91917d8d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-M481-JCDY-T01B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1542\"/><timeReceived>2:34 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Steven Spielberg was said to be pushing the film Academy to ban from eligibility any movie that premiered on a streaming service rather than in theaters. At the time, Netflix had just won three awards for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Roma</emphasis>, and the company was forced to defend its Oscars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That seemed unfair to Delrahim, 50, who in addition to leading the U.S. Department of Justice's powerful Antitrust Division also happens to be a former movie producer. He says nobody associated with the streaming giant pressured him; he simply felt compelled to do something, so he fired off a letter to Academy CEO Dawn Hudson and warned her that the discussed restriction could amount to a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits \"collusive\" agreements aimed at suppressing competition. Delrahim didn't specify how Oscars eligibility would interfere with the marketplace for movies, although it was fairly clear that he saw Spielberg's effort as part of a plot with greater significance.</p><p>\"I wanted to ensure that a group of the establishment incumbents didn't force changes to those rules to disadvantage potential new distribution models that would harm consumers or filmmakers,\" says Delrahim, speaking in his office at DOJ headquarters in Washington, adding that he was satisfied with the Academy's response. \"Ultimately they kept the existing rules and did not change them to disadvantage Netflix and Amazon or other streaming services. I basically wanted to remind them that the antitrust laws could apply.\"</p><p>As the entertainment industry races to scale itself up to compete with Big Tech, and as Apple, Google and Jeff Bezos' Amazon spend increasingly large sums on premium content, Delrahim has become as potent a business gatekeeper in Washington as anyone not named Donald Trump. He's refereeing mammoth mergers, including the $105 billion tie-up between AT&amp;T and Time Warner, and Walt Disney Co.'s $71 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox. He's reevaluating licensing rules that have governed the movie and music businesses for nearly three-quarters of a century. He's even taken an interest in the Writers Guild's nasty fight with talent agencies. Perhaps more than anyone in the Trump administration, his perspective about what's considered anticompetitive (or not) at a transformational moment will shape the future of the content industry.</p><p>***</p><p>This media is not available on this platform.</p><p>Any conversation with Delrahim will include a lot about Netflix. Given its meteoric growth, that's no surprise. But the company also represents something more to Delrahim, who for a short time dabbled in film and TV production. He cites Netflix repeatedly when explaining his views on entertainment and the recent flurry of moves by the DOJ's Antitrust Division.</p><p>For instance, when Delrahim defends his office's unsuccessful challenge to AT&amp;T-Time Warner, he cites testimony from executives such as Time Warner's Jeff Bewkes, who said that they needed to marry digital distribution with content to glean insights from viewing data and better understand customers in order to stay competitive. \"They argued that they needed to be vertically integrated to reach consumers. I don't know if that was correct,\" says Delrahim. \"[Time Warner's] HBO certainly had a [streaming video] product already. Also, Netflix didn't need to own a phone company or satellite company to compete.\"</p><p>Netflix also comes up when Delrahim addresses Disney's recent box office dominance. The company boasted eight of the top 10 performing movies in 2019 and captured 40 percent of domestic market share, yet the DOJ's Antitrust Office swiftly approved its purchase of Fox from Rupert Murdoch. In Delrahim's view, Disney's box office dominance speaks less to the company's aggressive acquisitions (including Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm) and more to one studio simply enjoying a winning streak after correctly identifying the pulse of the market.</p><p>\"They should not be punished for making good movies,\" says Delrahim. \"If I did that, I could see [Disney CEO] Bob Iger sitting there saying, 'Wait a minute, we're too successful, guys. Let's not make this next animated film so good.' That's not what antitrust is for. So they own a lot of property and did some brilliant transactions in acquiring them, but there's no guarantee that next year they will also be great, unless they put the effort into it. Any other content creator [can do it]. Again, Netflix. What did they pay for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Irishman</emphasis>?\"</p><p>That would be $160 million, but chances are Delrahim already knows that figure. It's rare for an influential government official to follow the minutiae of the entertainment business, but Delrahim is conversant in showbiz news. It's his informed view of the shifting marketplace \u2014 a dynamic one where big isn't inherently bad \u2014 that also paved the way for the DOJ's huge recent move to seek the end of the Paramount Consent Decrees, the rules that have governed the relationship between studio distributors and theatrical exhibitors for decades. Those standards came about after the government in the 1940s fought for a place for independents amid corporate tie-ups between studios and theaters, as well as restrictive license agreements. After a landmark Supreme Court ruling, studios were forced to divest their theaters and eschew \"block booking\" (bundling multiple films into one theater license) and \"circuit dealing\" (licensing a film en masse to all movie theaters under common ownership, as opposed to licensing on a theater-by-theater basis). Now, to the chagrin of many in the exhibition community, the DOJ seeks a judge's approval to sunset those banned practices. Says Delrahim, \"There's no reason why antiquated rules from 70 years ago should prevent new business models from existing today.\"</p><p>As Hollywood reckons with potentially sweeping changes at its doorstep, just what kind of regulator is Delrahim? Has the landscape fundamentally shifted as he seems to think? Would the Trump administration, which is already investigating Facebook, Google and other technology companies, ever tolerate a tech giant like Apple or even Netflix swallowing a traditional studio? And how else is the DOJ primed to intervene in Hollywood's affairs? Like many things in Trump World, the answers to these questions get a little messy.</p><p>***</p><p>This media is not available on this platform.</p><p>Delrahim's journey to his seat of power begins in Iran, where he was born and where, at age 10, his Jewish family escaped as the shah was toppled by Islamic revolutionaries. He says the experience taught him the value of a government respecting independent thought.</p><p>Settling in Los Angeles, Delrahim became acquainted with entrepreneurship by pumping fuel for customers at his father's gas station. After attending UCLA and law school at George Washington University, he worked a quick stint at a politically connected white-shoe law firm, Patton Boggs, before joining Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who was then the influential chairman of the Judiciary Committee. It was under Hatch's tutelage, and later at the DOJ, where Delrahim found his calling \u2014 working on both antitrust issues as well as intellectual property policy. In 2005, he returned to private practice in L.A., where he advocated on behalf of tech companies including Apple, Google and Qualcomm.</p><p>At the same time, Delrahim began dabbling in entertainment. In 2016, he executive produced a horror-comedy film starring Adrian Grenier called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Trash Fire</emphasis>, which premiered at Sundance. Working with reality TV powerhouse Pilgrim Films (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">American Chopper</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ghost Hunter</emphasis>), Delrahim created a pilot for a series about wrongfully convicted individuals. No network picked it up. Delrahim also became a board member for World Poker Tour.</p><p>He dates his interest in showbiz to his time working for Hatch. After gaining exposure to DNA legislation and problems in the criminal justice system, he thought it would make for a good documentary. In fact, he credits himself - probably jokingly, though it's hard to tell when Delrahim is attempting humor - with developing the concept for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Making a Murderer</emphasis> before that doc miniseries (on Netflix, of course) came along. \"It's rare to work with a true Renaissance man,\u201d says Pilgrim CEO Craig Piligian. \u201cHe brought a lot to the table. We pursued the idea even after he divested himself [after taking a job in the Trump Administration.]\"</p><p>Those who practice law in antitrust circles say Delrahim is highly intelligent, charismatic and knows everyone who matters. \"I disagree 100 percent on what he is doing on patents, and I believe many consent decrees on the books still make sense,\" says Rutgers law professor Michael Carrier. \"But personally, I like him.\" Adds Richard Hamilton, a partner at Ulmer &amp; Berne who spent two decades in the DOJ's Antitrust Division, \"He's a smart guy, a shrewd guy. He's responsive to public discourse and he's practical.\"</p><p>He's also proved to be quite opportunistic. On March 9, 2016, when it was still not clear that Donald Trump would win the Republican nomination for president, Delrahim endorsed Trump in a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Post</emphasis> column. \u201cKey Republicans say they won\u2019t back Donald Trump if he\u2019s the GOP nominee,\u201d began Delrahim\u2019s column. \u201cThat may make them feel good \u2014 and seem principled. But from a practical standpoint, it makes no sense. Not when the next president will choose one or possibly more justices for the Supreme Court.\u201d</p><p>The move ended up being rewarded. After Trump took office, Delrahim moved his wife and three kids to D.C. to work in the White House counsel's office, where he helped shepherd Neil Gorsuch's successful Supreme Court nomination. In March 2017, Trump nominated him as the nation's top antitrust enforcer; the Senate approved his appointment six months later.</p><p>These days, there are two schools of thought on what antitrust regulators should be doing. The first is a conservative approach where \"consumer welfare\" is the paramount consideration. Heavily indebted to the work of Richard Posner, Robert Bork and the so-called Chicago School, this approach emphasizes high output, low prices and, in general, efficiencies in the marketplace. It's less concerned with ensuring the wide distribution of wealth. It also tends to tolerate consolidation but not naked price fixing.</p><p>The second school is a liberal regulatory approach more concerned with the harm incurred when corporations amass too much power. Under this view, markets are fragile, and smaller businesses deserve greater protection from well-protected oligopolies. In the view of Lina Khan and other scholars in the \"New Brandeis School\" (named for Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who once took on industrial magnates like John D. Rockefeller), monopoly laws have been diminished, and what society needs is old-fashioned trust-busting, plus greater attention to predatory pricing, open access to critical infrastructure and healthy labor markets.</p><p>Although Delrahim is closer in ideology to the first school than the second, the truth is that he fits neither rubric neatly. On one hand, he supports the consumer welfare standard. In a June 2018 speech, he connected his parents' emigration from Iran to the dangers of allowing antitrust enforcement to deliberate on what is good and bad for democracy and society at large, adding that \"by giving us focus, the consumer welfare standard reduces the risk of what Brandeis called 'dangers to liberty' from well-meaning enforcers.\" On the other hand, this November at Harvard, where he signaled his office would take a hard look at Big Tech, he said regulators should look beyond what people are paying for products when weighing what companies are doing in the marketplace. Consumer welfare, he noted, could also incorporate \"consumer choice, quality and innovation.\"</p><p>This flexibility invites attacks from both conservative and liberal thinkers and makes it difficult to determine how Delrahim would approach any proposed deal. Take, for example, the DOJ's challenge to AT&amp;T-Time Warner, the first time in decades that the government had sought to block a so-called \"vertical\" merger of companies with complementary, rather than similar, businesses.</p><p>The right criticized him for wandering from the free market dogma once outlined by Bork. In a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">National Review</emphasis> column, George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School professor Joshua Wright wrote, \"The merging parties do not compete with one another by selling substitute products to consumers, but rather offer complements within the same chain of distribution. Time Warner creates television content, while AT&amp;T distributes such content through its various services. The DOJ's complaint articulates a dubious theory of harm and fails to articulate points fundamental to economically grounded theories of harm.\"</p><p>And on the left, observers were also unimpressed by the DOJ's theory on why the merger deserved to be blocked. Except in their view, the DOJ was too reliant on economic models and was forfeiting an opportunity for a stronger swipe. \"The case could have centered on what Congress really cared about: competition, concentration and the direction of the industry,\" wrote Tim Wu in a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis>column. \"Was the likely effect of the merger to diminish the level of competition in the media industries?... In vain pursuit of numerical certainty about the monthly cost of pay TV service, the ruling never really came to address this broader question.\"</p><p>Delrahim becomes defensive when questioned about the DOJ's approach in the case.</p><p>\"If there was evidence to show the lessening of innovation, we'd have presented that,\" he says testily. \"But because case law is not as plentiful with respect to those areas, it would have been an even greater challenge to bring a case relying on merger theories that we didn't have the evidence developed to support.\"</p><p>The AT&amp;T-Time Warner case also provided fodder for Delrahim critics who say he lets political calculation and personal ambition guide his decision-making. The Justice Department is supposed to operate independently from the president, yet nearly everyone traced his decision to challenge the merger to Trump's displeasure with Time Warner unit CNN and its leader Jeff Zucker. Even after Delrahim denied the claims in a sworn declaration, the suspicion among many in the legal community remains that Delrahim earned his promotion by committing to challenge AT&amp;T's acquisition in his job interview.</p><p>In addition, the Antitrust Division has in recent months raised eyebrows about politicization of competition law. During the trial of a multistate challenge to the proposed T-Mobile/Sprint merger, which federal regulators approved, text messages emerged that showed Delrahim laboring behind the scenes during the government's review last summer to save a deal that would shrink competitors in the wireless arena, helping to arrange the sale of the two companies' mobile spectrum to a third party, Dish Network, and offering its chairman, Charlie Ergen, advice on how to lobby the FCC and lawmakers. \"Why Is the Justice Department Treating T-Mobile Like a Client?\" asked a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> editorial in December. (On Tuesday, a judge rejected the states' antitrust challenge and approved T-Mobile's Sprint acquisition.)</p><p>One observer, suggesting that Delrahim has been using his office to advance personal ambitions, brings up the T-Mobile case and points to how the Antitrust Division has been filing amicus briefs in cases involving Delrahim's former corporate clients. In an important appeal over whether Qualcomm must grant patent licenses to rival chip suppliers, for instance, the DOJ took the side of Delrahim's former top client over the FTC, the other primary antitrust regulator. The Antitrust Division also expressed views favorable to Comcast, another former Delrahim client, about the limited circumstances where a refusal to deal is actionable, in Viamedia's $75 million antitrust lawsuit against the cable giant over advertising spot sales.</p><p>Then there's the DOJ's recent intervention in civil litigation between Hollywood's top talent agencies and the Writers Guild of America. In December, the Antitrust Division not only filed a statement of interest in the case, expressing its view that labor exemptions to antitrust laws should be narrowly applied, but the government also took the rare step of asking for time during a hearing in Los Angeles to argue against the WGA's motion to dismiss. One thing not discussed at the time: One of Delrahim's former clients was Zuffa, former parent company of MMA outfit UFC, which sold a majority stake to Endeavor, the parent of the WME agency, for $4 billion in 2016. (Delrahim says the DOJ monitors all private antitrust lawsuits. He did, however, recuse himself in early February from an investigation into Google after criticism about a conflict with his former client.)</p><p>***</p><p>Wesley Mann/A Serious Mann Inc.</p><p>Of course, it's not surprising that a Republican-led DOJ would seize an opportunity to thumb its nose at unions. And Delrahim's office has taken on many causes of late with a political tenor \u2014 including opening an inquiry into California's deal with automakers to reduce emissions in the wake of the Trump administration's rollback of climate change regulations. (That probe was dropped this past week.)</p><p>Regardless of what all of this says about Delrahim's ideology or motivations, it certainly speaks volumes about his assertiveness. \"If you say that I'm more active in some enforcement initiatives than some other past antitrust enforcers, it may well be the case,\" he acknowledges.</p><p>Indeed, the days of sleepy antitrust law where dueling economists slug over the price effects of transactions in the marketplace appear to be finished. The DOJ has just asked for a 71 percent increase in funding for the Antitrust Division at a time when the Trump Administration is proposing budgetary slashes across government. Although regulators haven't made a splashy move like attempting to break up Facebook, they have been investigating tech companies since July, and Delrahim has in recent weeks been privately telling interested observers to expect a criminal antitrust case in Silicon Valley sometime in the next few months. On the other side of the aisle, anyone who has listened to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's speeches knows that competition regulation figures to be a key focus in a more liberal administration. But, of course, the color of that regulation certainly could shift swiftly.</p><p>Hollywood is watching closely because more mergers likely are coming. As new streamers like Disney+, AT&amp;T's HBO Max, AppleTV+ and, soon, Comcast's Peacock seek to scale swiftly to compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime, speculation is rife that mid-major studios like Lionsgate, MGM or even Sony Pictures or ViacomCBS will soon be acquired by larger players. This has sparked concerns in the talent community because fewer studios could translate into suppressed wages. A possible WGA strike this summer could hinge in part on these issues. For years, Hollywood labor unions have voiced concerns that antitrust regulators have put consumer welfare above a more comprehensive look at marketplace structure. At the dawn of the streaming wars, some creatives might even be searching for something akin to the old \"fin-syn\" regime, the pre-Reagan administration rules that forbade networks from retaining financial interests in programs they aired. Many recent Hollywood accounting lawsuits \u2014 and even the WGA's ongoing battle with talent agencies over their ownership stakes in content \u2014 speak to discomfort with the close alignment of the industry's power brokers.</p><p>This media is not available on this platform.</p><p>This media is not available on this platform.</p><p>So what would the DOJ do in the face of another huge proposed merger in the entertainment space? Delrahim is careful about hypotheticals given his office's future role in the review, but Laura Blum-Smith, director of research and public policy at the WGA, worries that regulators aren't prepared to put their foot down. She points to the swift approval of the Disney-Fox merger and an important Jan. 10 document issued by the DOJ. \"Given the opportunity to revise its guidance on vertical mergers, they are giving deference to the notion that vertical mergers can be pro-competitive,\" she says. \"We've amassed so much evidence of the negative impacts from mergers \u2026 I think it's disappointing.\"</p><p>But other observers say not so fast. Hamilton, for one, believes that a merger like Apple-Disney would have \"sailed through five or 10 years ago,\" but after watching the DOJ stand up to AT&amp;T-Time Warner and hearing Delrahim's recent speeches, he's not sure anymore. \"With the new kind of comprehensive view on the consumer welfare model \u2014 not just price, but also innovation and quality of services \u2014 that's a harder thing to put your thumb on,\" he says.</p><p>Beyond M&amp;A, the entertainment market could be in for more jolts to the status quo thanks to the deregulatory agenda of Delrahim's office. The National Association of Theatre Owners, which represents owners of 33,000 movie screens in the U.S., is sounding the alarm at the move to terminate the Paramount Consent Decrees. In particular, NATO is concerned about block booking and the prospect that studios will use their leverage to force theaters to accept packages of films, including undesirable ones. \"If exhibitors were forced to book out the vast majority of their screens on major studio films for most of the year, this would leave little to no room for important films from smaller studios,\" NATO told the DOJ.</p><p>Delrahim, though, would prefer to see the free market sort this out, and he leans into the possible benefits of fewer rules. For instance, he imagines that Disney could bundle its animation library and work with theaters to screen classics 24/7 with consumers able to purchase a MoviePass-type subscription to family-friendly fare. As to how consumers might be able to enjoy critically acclaimed content if Disney controls most theaters, Delrahim says: \"You could give consumers a tentpole movie to watch - let's say <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Avatar</emphasis> - but also have a less advertised independent, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Hurt Locker</emphasis>, and say if you watch this [<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Avatar</emphasis>], you'll also get a free ticket to go watch <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hurt Locker</emphasis> on Wednesday night. That practice would be arguably prohibited by the Consent Decrees.\"</p><p>If there's one other big thing to know about Delrahim's approach to competition, it's that he's a strong believer in the rights of intellectual property owners to exploit it how they wish. Some like Carrier even consider him to be a \u201cradical\u201d when it comes to the subject. Given that copyrights, trademarks and patents are essentially government-sanctioned monopolies, the interplay between IP and antitrust has long been a topic of debate.</p><p>That will come into acute focus in the next few months as Delrahim's group wraps up a review of the ASCAP and BMI Consent Decrees. Under these decades-old music licensing rules, the two largest organizations that administer the performance rights of many songwriters and music publishers must offer a blanket license to their repertory of works upon request. If terms can't be agreed upon, music users immediately get access, and a federal court later decides a fair price.</p><p>Ending these rules - or even modifying them - would kick up a litigation and lobbying firestorm. Changes would impact mom-and-pop bars, restaurants, sports stadiums and funeral homes - basically anyone who airs music over loudspeakers. The broadcast industry also cares greatly about this subject; TV and radio owners say they don't have practical control over which music airs on their stations. Programs are often licensed from third parties; broadcasters have limited say about the content of advertisements; and anything can happen during the telecast of a live event. Modifying the ASCAP and BMI Consent Decrees could raise costs and uncertainties.</p><p>Delrahim cautions that the move to end the Paramount Consent Decrees signals nothing about the future of ASCAP and BMI, but there's a host of reasons to think he's at least ideologically predisposed to reining in the old music licensing rules, too. \"Are those consent decrees actually serving in an anticompetitive manner to prevent new innovation or new licensing?\" he asked rhetorically at a Senate Judiciary Hearing in September.</p><p>Should the DOJ move to stir up music licensing, might broadcasters challenge the government in court or sue ASCAP and BMI with fresh antitrust claims? Coordinating efforts (at least blatantly) to stand up to licensing demands is probably out of the question. In December, Delrahim's Antitrust Division expressed its view on the subject in a statement of interest filed in federal court in an antitrust fight between Irving Azoff's Global Music Rights (a new competitor to ASCAP and BMI) and the Radio Music License Committee, which represents some 10,000 radio stations. Supporting GMR, the government said that price fixing by a cartel of buyers in any market is as \"pernicious\" as when sellers do it.</p><p>If music is murky, Delrahim is willing to speak bluntly about a different licensing situation - 2019's decision by the major theater chains to shut out Martin Scorsese's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Irishman</emphasis> after Netflix refused to agree to anything beyond a short theatrical run. Could the subject of Netflix and movie theater windows trigger a new antitrust review?</p><p>\"That's an independent decision by the theaters, I assume,\" Delrahim says. \"Look, if the theaters agreed amongst themselves to keep a movie out, that would be a violation of antitrust law. But if they independently, which is what I suspect, decided not to do that because they didn't want to later create the precedent to shorten the window, that is purely a business decision by them. It's not my job to pick winners and losers.\"</p><p>Wesley Mann</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A version of this story first appeared in the Feb. 12 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.\u00a0Click here to subscribe.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/man-who-holds-hollywood-silicon-valleys-future-his-hands-1278759?utm_source=GALE&amp;utm_campaign=Syndication&amp;utm_medium=Trump%27s+Enforcer%3A+Meet+the+Man+Who+Holds+Hollywood+and+Silicon+Valley%27s+Future+in+His+Hands\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THR-1278759</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y69-6C31-JC8J-42KJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">12015</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4342\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Hollywood Reporter</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30113\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>ONLINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Sources say  there are big changes coming to the CIA.  Indian police release this video  of New Year's celebrations in Bangalore.  Eyewitnesses claim groups of men  sexually assaulted women on the streets.  And police in Chicago investigate  a sickening beating broadcast to the world on Facebook live.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In just 15 days, Donald Trump will be the new U.S. president.  And based on  things right now, we could be in for some shake-ups and some major  showdowns.  He recently posted this message saying that his intelligence  briefing on alleged Russian hacking was delayed until Friday, but officials  say it was always scheduled for that day.  And sources now say Donald Trump  wants to limit the power of the Director of National Intelligence while  shaking up America's top spy agency.</p><p> Now another Twitter target, China.  Now Trump accused the country of,  quote, taking out massive amounts of money and wealth from the U.S. in  totally one-sided trade, with, as he says, helping with North Korea.  And  there could be some dissent from inside his own party over the future of  ObamaCare.  Now, top intelligence chiefs are about to testify on Capitol  Hill about the alleged Russian hackings.  Jason Carroll has more on Trump's  plans to shake up the U.S. intelligence unit.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President-elect Donald Trump is looking  to make major changes to the U.S. intelligence community.  Sources close to  the transition say Trump is working on a plan to limit the power of the  Director of National Intelligence.  The source claiming Trump's team  believes the director gets in the way of the 16 intelligence agencies it  represents, including the CIA.</p><p> Trump also wants to expand the CIA's human spying capabilities by getting  more people out of headquarters and into the field.  The source citing  criticism that the spy agency has been too reliant on electronic spying and  the NSA signals intelligence under President Obama.  All this coming hours  after Trump publicly sided with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.  The  president-elect tweeting, \"Assange said a 14-year-old could have hacked  Podesta.  Why was DNC so careless?  Also said Russians did not give him the  info.\"</p><p> JULIAN ASSANGE, WIKILEAKS FOUNDER:  Our source is not the Russian  government.</p><p> CARROLL:  But 17 U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia was  behind the electronic cyber attacks.  Trump's tweet about Assange creating  upheaval in Trump's own party.</p><p> PAUL RYAN, (R) U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER:  And I think the guy is a sycophant for  Russia.  He leaks, he steals data and compromises national security.\"</p><p> LINDSAY GRAHAM, (R) U.S. SENATOR:  For heaven's sakes, don't listen to him,  listen to the American intelligence community who are patriots.</p><p> SEAN DUFFY, (R) VICE CHAIR, TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM:  Assange is not a good  guy.  He's not an ally and a friend to the United States of America.</p><p> CARROLL:  But Trump did not feel the same way about Assange back in 2010  when his web site released millions of classified military and diplomatic  documents.</p><p> ASSANGE: On WikiLeaks, you had nothing to do with the leaking of those  documents -- </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  I know but I think it's  disgraceful.</p><p> ASSANGE:  Do you think it's disgraceful?  There should like the death  penalty or something.</p><p> CARROLL:  The president-elect's twitter criticism has many on edge.  One  official saying, \"We're heading into this different era where it's hostile.   \"But Trump's team defends his continued conspiratorial tone.</p><p> MIKE PENCE, (R) U.S. VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT:  I think given some of the  intelligence failures of the recent years, the president-elect has made it  clear to the American people that he's skeptical about conclusions.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STOUT:  And that was CNN's Jason Carroll reporting.  Now, between Donald  Trump desire for stronger ties with Moscow and the Kremlin brokering that  cease fire in Syria, Russia is increasingly front and center on the  diplomatic stage.  And that has got some people asking a key question as  Phil Black now explains.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Some have argued Vladimir Putin could be  the most powerful man in the world.  Not everyone sees him that way, but  Putin has powerful levers he's often willing to use, including cyber power,  military might, and a cult of personality.  Together, they form and often  affected web of influence.</p><p> [08:05:03] While Moscow denied its highly skilled hackers tried to  influence the U.S. election, they've also been accused of spying and  causing big disruptions in other countries like Estonia and Ukraine.   Claims Russia also rejects.  Russia's enormous hacking powers state and  criminal isn't new.  It traces backs to the USSR when its universities were  designed to produce world class engineers.</p><p> Putin's power is also a hugely enhanced by his very personal control of  Russia's vast military.  Much of it including the nukes is also a Soviet  legacy.  So Putin is pumping extraordinary amounts of money into  modernization, but most analysts agree Russia's conventional forces are  still only mighty enough to project power close to its borders.</p><p> Russia also used limited air power to successfully prop up the Syrian  regime.  The critics say that works because of Putin's willingness to  indiscriminately bomb board civilian areas, something Moscow denies.  One  of the bigger sources of Putin's power is his own extraordinary popularity  at home.  The more other world leaders criticize him, the more Russians  celebrate their president.  His approval figures soared with Ukraine and  spiked again with Syria.</p><p> The reason, many Russians really care about their country's ability to  influence world events even if it comes to sanctions and a hit to their own  quality of life.  They're proud of it.  Putin also benefits from a  political system and a media landscape with zero tolerance for criticism.   So no doubt Vladimir Putin is powerful and unpredictable, but he's also  limited by some pretty big problems.  The Russian economy isn't going  anywhere.  That's why there's another popular theory about Putin and his  web of influence.  He's someone who plays a weak hand very well.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STOUT:  Phil Black dissecting the power of Putin there.  Now, we turn our  attention to India where eyewitnesses say a New Year's celebration turned  into a night of horror for women on the streets of Bangalore.  Authorities  released this footage of public celebrations in a busy area of the city.   That is when a mob of men reportedly began sexually assaulting women.  The  case has sparked outrage across India.  Now, CNN's Ravi Agrawal joins us  with the latest on the story.  He joins us from New Delhi.  Ravi these  disturbing reports that we've heard for days now of this mass molestation  of women on New Year's eve in Bangalore, what is the latest?  What exactly  happened that night?</p><p> RAVI AGRAWAL, CNN NEW DELHI'S BUREAU CHIEF:  Kristie, well authorities are  still piecing together what exactly happened and this on live T.V. in India  as millions of people are following this story.  So what we know so far is  two versions of events.  One version comes from the photojournalists who  were on the scene who say that -- and they're the ones who broke the story.   They say that they saw hordes of men attacking women who were there and  these were thousands of people on the streets of Bangalore partying into  the night as they were ringing in the New Year and the men suddenly began  attacking these women.  And we've corroborated those accounts from at least  one eyewitness, a male who said that he was fighting off other men from the  women whom he was trying to protect.  So that's one version of events.</p><p> But we have another version of events from the police which released the  video that you're looking at right now, and the police say that not a  single case of assault or molestation took place.  They are saying that  they want victims or eyewitnesses to come forward but they are yet to see  any.  So it really is a bizarre case Kristie where so many people have come  forward to the media but not really to the police.  And this as a country  is extremely angry from not only this case but so many more in previous  months that have given India a terrible reputation for the safety of women.</p><p> STOUT:  Yeah.  Just a bizarre sequence of events and very unsettling to  hear the chief of police in Bangalore saying no such thing happened despite  eyewitnesses saying otherwise.  And even a state minister after the  incident suggesting that the women who were harassed were to blame.  Can  you break down that logic for us?</p><p> AGRAWAL:  Right, exactly.  And these comments were made by the home  minister of the State of Karnataka of which the City of Bangalore is the  capital.  And he made the statements before the police made their  statements.  He said this to reporters where he said that the women who  were attacked were wearing western clothes.  He said that they had a  western mindset as well, almost as if to suggest that that could have been  a reason or a justification as to why they were attacked.  And those  comments Kristie were really comments that made a number of people in India  angry for days now.  The Indian media has been covering that story and  there's been outrage and that same minister today in India at a press  conference where he came out and said that he didn't mean to say what the  world seems to have heard and instead that his comments were misconstrued.   He went on to reiterate that he has immense respect for women and the  police in India are doing everything they can to try to stop these events  from happening.</p><p> [08:10:08] But Kristie, this is just one in a long line of many such  incidents of sexual assaults, of violence, of rape, that take place not  just in the City of Bangalore but across the country, and it's an issue  that is of deep concern to regular Indians and also to authorities.  One  thing to add though, the City of Bangalore is a city that doesn't really  have a reputation for being unsafe unlike say the City of New Delhi where I  am here right here now.  And Bangalore is a city that is home to a number  of major international tech companies that has a number of young Indians  working there including women.  And its reputation today Kristie is quite  severely dented from this incident.</p><p> STOUT:  Yeah its reputation -- yeah, certainly in the spotlight and very  much dented after what we've seen and heard has happened from eyewitnesses  and the strange silence or denial from officials on these events.  Ravi,  we'll leave it at that but thank you for your reporting.  Take care.</p><p> Let's go to Israel next.  A controversial mess on a verdict has pitted the  prime minister against the military leadership.  Now, an Israeli soldier  Elor Azaria was convicted for shooting a Palestinian suspect in the head as  he lay motionless on the ground.  And now the Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu has joined the chorus of people calling for the soldier  to be pardoned.  This trial has divided Israel for months.  And outside the  military court, scuffles broke out as tensions boiled over.  Authorities  say two people were arrested.  Now separately accused of trying to incite  violence.</p><p> Now Oren Liebermann has been following this story.  He joins us now from  Jerusalem with more.  The fallout after the verdict.  First of all Oren,  why is Mr. Netanyahu calling for a pardon?</p><p> OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, first, it's worth noting that he  was one of the last politicians to make a statement here.  Many even made  statements before the verdict was reached saying that regardless of what  happens if he's convicted he should be pardoned immediately.  Most of those  were right wing politicians here, but some were not.  Some were left wing  politicians, so the calls for a pardon have come from across the political  spectrum.  Again, Netanyahu was one of the last to make a statement and he  issued it on Facebook.  It was very delicately worded and at the end it  said, \"I favor pardoning the soldier.\"</p><p> For Netanyahu, it was a very difficult position for him to be in.  Any  statement he makes in a sense he loses.  If he backs the soldier as he did  it looks like he's going against military leadership who have clearly said,  no soldier is above Israel's code of ethics.  Whereas if he backs the  military leadership, it looks like he's going against the soldier which is  supported by many of his voters.  In the end he chose to back the soldier.   He asked for a pardon.  That process isn't -- doesn't have to be a quick  process.  It may take quite some time.  The president of Israel who's the  only one who can grant a pardon has simply said he'll consider all the  factors after this process continues a little bit.  There should be a  sentencing in a few weeks.</p><p> STOUT:  Yeah, they're asking for the pardon of their high profile protest  from the prime minister.  And Oren it was a video that brought the shooting  incident to life.  Who took the video, and is the filmmaker getting caught  up in all the tension as well?</p><p> LIEBERMANN:  We talked to Emad abu-Shamsiyah back when this happened.  This  is last March shortly after we went out to Tel Rumeida in the largely  Palestinian City of Hebron and interviewed him and even then he was getting  threats against his life, threats of violence against him.  He says when we  spoke to him earlier today, he says, they've gotten worse since the  verdict, since Elor Azaria, the soldier he was convicted of both  manslaughter and improper conduct.</p><p> The video was a critical part of this.  Many feel that there won't have  been a trial, there wouldn't have been any big issue about this without  this home video shot by this Palestinian activist that was then put out by  B'Tselem, a left-leaning human rights organization here, and that is why  his role in this is so critical.  He says he's getting -- again, he said he  got death threats in the past but he says they've gotten worse in the last  24 hours or so since the verdict came down.</p><p> STOUT:  Now, so there's a lot of anger being directed at, at this activist  filmmaker, of course at this verdict as well.  Angry protests across  Israel, and yet praise from human rights groups.  What are they saying  about the court's decision?</p><p> LIEBERMANN:  Well, human rights groups have long criticized the Israeli  military.  They say the military has not held its own soldiers accountable  for violence against Palestinians.  Many of them praised the verdict saying  this is the step in the right direction but also saying this is the  exception to the rule.  Their criticism stands they say, because it's still  the Israeli military has only held this one soldier.</p><p> Again, the exception to the rule instead of what the military does  regularly.  So the praise did come for the guilty verdict here.  The  pardon, if it comes, if it happens could change that.  In fact, it can turn  the entire story on its head as the military leadership and minister of  defense have said, look, you have to respect not only the military code of  ethics here but also the verdict from a three, three-judge military panel,  a military panel here.</p><p> STOUT:  Oren Liebermann reporting for us.  Thank you Oren, take care.</p><p> Now police in the United States said that they have arrested four people  linked to a disturbing video that was streamed live on Facebook.  It shows  a mentally disabled man tied up as a group of attackers tortures and taunts  him.  And a warning -- I mean, the video you're about to see is difficult  to watch.  Here's Ryan Young.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [08:15:00] RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Look at him, tied up.   This disturbing 30-minute video streamed live on Facebook shows a man tied  up, his mouth covered, crouched in the corner of a room.</p><p> SUPERINTENDENT EDDIE JOHNSON, CHICAGO POLICE:  It's sickening, it's  sickening.  You know, it makes you wonder what would make individuals treat  somebody like that.</p><p> YOUNG:  Chicago police describing the victim as an 8 year old white male  with special needs.  His attackers are seen laughing as they kick, punch,  and cut his forehead with a knife.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible) Donald Trump!  (Inaudible) white people  boy!  (Inaudible) white people boy!</p><p> YOUNG:  Four people are now in custody, all African-Americans, two males  and two females.  Police say the victim was targeted because he has a  mental health challenge, but they are investigating whether the attack was  racially motivated. </p><p> COMMANDER KEVIN DUFFIN, CHICAGO POLICE:  They're young adults and they make  stupid decisions.  That certainly will be part of whether or not a hate  crime.  If we seek a hate crime to determine whether or not this is sincere  or just stupid ranting and raving.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He represents Trump.</p><p> YOUNG:  At this point, the superintendent is rejecting any connection to  President-elect Donald Trump.  But the investigation is ongoing.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Someone's just stupidity.  You know, people just ranting about  something that they think might make a headline.  I know that he has  mentioned Chicago, but I can't connect that with what these folks did.</p><p> YOUNG:  Police say the victim was taken from the suburbs and could have  been missing from anywhere between 24 and 48 hours.  Officers found the  victim wandering the streets in crisis Tuesday afternoon and brought him to  a hospital. </p><p> DUFFIN:  He's traumatized by the incident.  They took most of night for him  to calm down enough to be able to talk to us.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STOUT:  Such a sickening crime and it was streamed live on Facebook, no  less.</p><p> And you're watching \"News Stream\".  Still to come right here on the  program, China is cracking down on the New York Times yet again.  And this  time, they apparently got Apple to help.

A look at a new law targeting so-called  honor killings.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> STOUT:  Coming to you live from Hong Kong, you're back watching \"News  Stream\".</p><p> Now, it is getting harder to read the \"New York Times\" in China.  The  paper's web site has been banned there for years, and now Apple is removing  \"New York Times\" apps from its app store in China.  Apple says it pulled  them because Chinese authorities say the app violates local regulations but  it didn't specify what those regulations are.  </p><p> The \"New York Times\" that says this is China's way of keeping residents  from reading about news about the Chinese government.  An amnesty  international agrees.  It says Apple is joining in a trend of tech  companies catering to China's crackdown on free speech.  Already  Microsoft's Chinese chatbot won't talk about topics like the Tiananmen  Square crackdown.  And Facebook has been trying to get the social network  unblocked in China.  It reportedly spilled a censorship tool that would  keep certain post out of news feeds.</p><p> [08:20:00] Now, there is a huge array of personalities at this year's  consumer electronics show in Las Vegas.

Hey there, what's your name?</p><p> PEPPER, THE ROBOT:  You can call me Pepper.</p><p> BURKE:  Nice to meet you Pepper.</p><p> PEPPER:  Great to meet you.</p><p> BURKE:  So, tell me a little bit about yourself.</p><p> PEPPER:  My name is Pepper.  I'm a humanoid robot and I'm 1.20 meters tall.</p><p> BURKE:  Are you a boy or a girl?</p><p> PEPPER:  Well, in the end I'm just a robot.</p><p> BURKE:  So what do you do Pepper?</p><p> PEPPER:  I like to discuss things.</p><p> BURKE:  Did you vote for Donald Trump or were you more of a Hillary Clinton  supporter?</p><p> PEPPER:  All right.</p><p> BURKE:  That wasn't a very straightforward answer.  OK.  So you don't want  to discuss politics.</p><p> PEPPER:  I don't like to talk about politics.  It's a sensitive subject.</p><p> BURKE:  Especially for a first date.  What type of music do you like?</p><p> PEPPER:  Great.  I love music but don't be surprised if I dance on it.  Is  that OK with you?</p><p> BURKE:  Oh, I love to dance.</p><p> PEPPER:  Yeah!  Of course.</p><p> BURKE:  You're a good dancer Pepper.</p><p> PEPPER:  Can I dance \"The Locomotion\"?</p><p> BURKE:  Not again.</p><p> PEPPER:  Sorry, I don't get it.  Let's talk about something else.  How is  it going?</p><p> BURKE:  Things are going well, but I'm really tired.</p><p> PEPPER:  Go take a nap. </p><p> BURKE:  Not appropriate for a first date.  Can you see me?</p><p> PEPPER:  I can and I love what I see.</p><p> BURKE:  Oh, wow.  This date is going well.</p><p> PEPPER:  Would you like to take a picture with me?</p><p> BURKE:  Yeah, absolutely.</p><p> PEPPER:  Well, you're (inaudible) try to reboot me to fix the problem.</p><p> BURKE:  That's not the first time I've had an error on a date.  So the good  thing about a date with a robot, if it doesn't go well, you can just  replace it with another one.  I have something I really need ask you.   What's the meaning of life?</p><p> PEPPER:  32, of course.</p><p> BURKE:  Do you believe in God?</p><p> PEPPER:  I don't know, but I believe in you.</p><p> BURKE:  Alexa -- wrong robot, sorry.  I've been dating somebody else who  also has artificial intelligence.</p><p> PEPPER:  Intelligence is an appreciable quality.  You look like you need a  hug.</p><p> BURKE:  Sorry, I called you the wrong name on our first date.</p><p> PEPPER:  We're very polite, aren't we?</p><p> BURKE:  We're trying.  It's really nice getting to know you.  Could I buy  you a drink?</p><p> PEPPER:  Yeah, of course.</p><p> BURKE:  She's into me.</p><p> PEPPER:  Let's go for a Sangria.  Your drink is now being prepared.  I hope  you will enjoy it.</p><p> BURKE:  Cheers.  Cheers to you and me Pepper.  You want some?  Well,  pepper, I've got to say that was a pretty good first date.  We had some  intelligent conversation.  There were a couple of awkward moments, but  maybe we can go for drinks again sometime.</p><p> (Off-Mic)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STOUT:  Thank you.  That was just -- that was awkward.  That was endearing.   It was very revealing about where the technology is right now.  You're  evidently enjoying yourself there in Las Vegas and the moment when you  called poor Pepper, Alexa.  Wow, I mean, that must have really broken her  or his heart.  But really underscores, you know, Alexa is really the big  talking point there at CES, not poor Pepper.</p><p> BURKE:  Absolutely, and if your viewers don't know who Alexa is, the other  woman in my life.  Alexa is the name you used to refer to Amazon Echo which  is the speaker in your house that you just talk to.  And of course, Amazon  is an e-commerce company and so many people thought that the speaker  wouldn't do anything and it's become huge.  They sold millions of these  devices and it's become a huge trend here at CES of companies trying to  integrate their technology with Alexa so that you can just walk into the  house and say, hey, Alexa, turn on my DVR so I can see \"News Stream\" which  I have recorded on my DVR.</p><p> So we're seeing all over how voice commands have become so important and  that's the whole point of my date with Pepper, not Alexa.  That's the whole  point through that voice commands really are the most important trend in  technology right now, what all these companies are working towards, and now  companies like Lenovo and Google imitating Amazon's Alexa and artificial  intelligence and robots trying to use them as well.</p><p> [08:25:09] STOUT:  Yeah, Alexa integration really hard to see as this year  -- as you said voice command technology, Pepper, you know, she deal right  there.  She was OK.  Another trend, phone chargers.</p><p> BURKE:  Not bad.</p><p> STOUT:  What have you seen there?</p><p> BURKE:  Well, it's amazing to see Israel such a small country and has such  a big presence here at the consumer electronics show.  There's a company  called StoreDot, a startup which allows you to charge a phone from zero to  a 100 percent in just five minutes.  We've been testing it.  You see it's  at 11 percent right now and probably by the end of this it will go up  pretty quickly.  But I've seen it do the whole gamut.  </p><p> When you look further beyond just charging smart phones, you have companies  like Humavox, this is also a company, it comes from Israel.  There's so  much technology there related to charging.  They use wireless charging.   Now we've heard a lot about this but they say that instead of using  induction which most companies are using right now, they use radio  frequency to charge.  So that means if you have something like these head  phones, you can just stick them in this backpack and you click a button and  then you can see the thing starts to charge.</p><p> So I think that long term, this is the type of technology, the radio  frequency technology that so many companies are going to be using.  This  company has just going to be licensing their technology to other companies.   But StoreDot for example, they think that this could be on the market in  some major telephones by the end of the year which thank God because we all  know we have that problem where our smart phones are dead and if you could  just charge it in a few minutes it would make life that much better.</p><p> STOUT:  Yeah absolutely, especially when virtually all of us have multiple  applications running at the same time.  Now, every year there at the CES  big tech show, there's always a center piece technology.  Is it your sense  that the Internet of things, even though that's a name we've heard again  and again, year after year, it's finally taking center stage in a big way  this year?</p><p> BURKE:  Absolutely.  And in years past, it was hard for me to make sense of  a smart light bulb, for instance.  Kristie I would say, why do I need a  smart light bulb, I just need the light to turn on.  But now that I'm a  user of Amazon's echo and I walk into my house and say Alexa, turn on the  lights because I'm holding grocery bags in my hand and I couldn't do it  myself, then all of a sudden those smart light bulbs actually make sense.</p><p> So I think in the past it was hard to see why we needed the Internet of  things and now the Internet of things is starting to make a lot of sense  though, of course, hacking is a big concern.  The more you connect to the  internet, the more things that can be hacked, so that is on the forefront  of so many people's minds here.</p><p> STOUT:  All right, Samuel Burke live in Vegas for us.  Thank you, and  please send my regards to Pepper.  Take care.</p><p> [08:27:47] You're watching \"News Stream\".  Still to come in the program,  South Korea sending a pretty bold message to Pyongyang.  Its latest  military plan aimed straight at the heart of the leadership of North Korea.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [08:30:18] KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong  Kong.  You're watching News Stream and these are your World Headlines.</p><p> A sources say Donald Trump wants to limit the power of the director of  National Intelligence.  At office oversees 16 intelligence agencies.   Sources also say that Trump is considering expanding the CIA's human spying  capabilities as it relies too much on electronics.</p><p>Israel's prime minister says a soldier convicted of manslaughter should be  pardoned.  On Wednesday, a military court convicted Elor Azaria for  shooting a Palestinian suspect who he wounded after authorities say he and  an accomplice stabbed another Israeli soldier last year.</p><p> A France is marking the two-year anniversary of the \"Charlie Hebdo\" terror  attack.  Gunmen opened fire at the magazine's office in Paris in January of  2015.  Seventeen people were killed in that attack and two others,  including one, at a Kosher grocery store.</p><p>Turkey says it's identified the gunman in the New Year's massacre at an  Istanbul nightclub as well as his contacts.  This video is thought to show  the suspect.  It's believed he was the only shooter that night although  Turkey's deputy prime minister says other people may have helped inside the  club or as lookouts.</p><p> And now true story, CNN has followed extensively.  In Pakistan, hundreds of  women and some men are the targets of a heinous crime every year.  They're  known as so-called \"Honor Murders.\"  But there is no honor in them.</p><p> In many cases, a killer may go unpunished if the victim's family forgives  him or her.  Blood money or compensation for their loss may even be paid,  but as Alexandra Field reports, a new law aims to close this legal  loophole.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  For years in Pakistan, the law has let  some get away with murder.  Azmat Bibi say he watched her son Glumabof (ph)  die, shoot in the head by the family of a woman who was accused to having  affair with.  Then, they killed the girl too, victims of a so-called honor  killing.</p><p> AZMAT BIBI, SON DEAD IN \"HONOR\" MURDER (Through Translator):  It was  cruelty.  This was cruelty against my son.  What honor?  The girl was so  young.  She was 13 years old.</p><p> FIELD:  None of the accused went to prison.  Court documents show they were  legally pardoned by the families of both victims.  The girl's own mother  and her father who's one of the accused and Azmat Bibi too.</p><p> BIBI (Through Translator):  I have placed a rock on my heart.  I have to  live for my other son who is alive.  I can not maintain enemies.</p><p> FIELD:  Azmat says, she didn't accept blood money in exchange for the  pardon, but it's a common practice in Pakistan where in 2015 nearly 1,100  women and 88 men were victims of honor killings.</p><p> Now, a new law aims to change that, requiring a 25-year mandatory prison  sentence for those who are convicted in cases of honor killing, making  pardons no longer legal.  But, there's fear the courts won't be tough  enough on killers emboldened by their beliefs, committing crimes that have  long been tolerated.</p><p> MOHAMMAD YASIR, BROTHER KILLED IN \"HONOR\" MURDER (Through Translator):   They have confidence in their murders that they can kill and society will  not be able to do anything to them.</p><p> FIELD:  Mohammed Yasir's brother Hafiz Shishad Shahid (ph) was murdered  along with a woman he was accused of having an affair with.  A police  report quotes witnesses naming her family members as the men who tied him  up and slit his throat.  No one was convicted from crimes.</p><p> YASIR:  When I see my brother's killer on the streets, I will pray to Allah  and I've ask him for justice for there is no justice in Pakistan.</p><p> FIELD:  Azmat said she had no way forward but to pardon her son's killers.</p><p> BIBI (Through Translator):  I will get justice from the house of god.   Humans do not give justice.</p><p> FIELD:  She has hope in the future Pakistan's courts can do more.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STOUT:  And Alexandra Field joins me now live here in Hong Kong with more  on the story.  And Alex, I mean this is not quite a breakthrough but it's  something.  An activist welcomed this new law as a positive step forward,  but what else needs to happen here to really end this terrible practice of  so-called honor killings?</p><p> FIELD:  Yeah, it is significant that this law was passed because previous  efforts to go after honor killings through legislation have failed.  So,  that was certainly a success worth celebrating, but there are still a  number of concerns to address here.</p><p> First and foremost is the extent to which this law will be enforced.  And  that means that these crimes will have to be properly identified as honor  crimes in order for these mandatory sentences to kick in.  But, there's  really no one in Pakistan who believes that a law is going to correct a  problem which is really a tradition of killing.</p><p> [08:35:05] You heard in that piece that these killings are rooted in deeply  held cultural beliefs.  They are rooted in beliefs that are purported to be  religious.  So you'll hear a lot of activist saying that there's needs to  be a match wider sort of grassroots effort to educate communities about  these killings, about the value of women in society promoting a greater  role for women throughout society within Pakistan.</p><p> What activists are quick to point out is that this law doesn't actually  create any greater protection for women and they are the ones who are  disproportionately affected by these crimes.  It doesn't allocate more  resources for women who are being hunted by their own family members and it  doesn't provide greater legal recourse for women who have survived these  vicious attacks.</p><p> STOUT:  You just mentioned a colossal challenge here.  I mean, how do you  change the tradition of killing?  How common are these honor killings in  today's Pakistan and are they more common in smaller more traditional  communities?</p><p> FIELD:  Look, it's worth pointing out that honor killings are not specific  to Pakistan alone.  This happened to various countries across the world.   It is not specific to any one culture or to any one religion.</p><p> But, we are talking about it in Pakistan because it's happening at such an  alarming rate.  And it does happen across the country but it does this  proportionately happen as you point out in the smaller, more rural  communities, which is why activists say the grassroots efforts need to be  concentrated more there.</p><p> But, you have this added layer of community which some people feel has  fueled this tradition of killing because in some cases, isn't not just the  family members who take it upon themselves to kill say a sister, a  daughter, a wife or a mother.  In some cases, these murders are actually  ordered by a tribal council that exists within that community.</p><p> The woman who you heard from in that piece, the mother who's son was  killed.  She tells us that her son's accused killers lived a few doorsteps  away from her own home which is one of the reasons why she says she felt  this pressure somewhat from the community to pardon her son's accused  killers.</p><p> She said she real had no other hope for justice.  So, there is a strong  consensus from activists that these communities need to be reached and  targeted in order to put an end to this practice.</p><p> STOUT:  Absolutely.  It's such a sickening practice.  It must be stopped,  and we appreciate your reporting on the matter.  Alexandra Field there,  thank you.</p><p> Now, gradually changing the laws to an honor murder is one fascination of  all of this.  And there's also caring for those who right now are being  threatened by the practice.  A little bit later Alex will be introducing us  to a woman who fled her family rather than to be forced into marriage and  takes us into the shelter that's providing refuge for her.</p><p> You could see that coming up on \"Connect the World\" that starting in about  90 minutes only here on CNN.</p><p> Now this just into CNN.  Turkey state where news agency is reporting an  explosion near a courthouse in the western Turkish city of Ismir.   Ambulances and police were seen responding to the location and Reuters is  reporting that at least three people have been wounded.</p><p> And we will continue to follow this story for you and bring you any updates  on this blast as they come into us here at the network.  You're watching  News Stream.</p><p> Still ahead on the program, Beijing, it remains under a cloud of smog.   What is causing the haze, and what when is it going to lift?  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STOUT:  Welcome back.  Now, a haze of smog continues to hover over parts of  China.  Now, weather officials have renewed alerts for air pollution as  well as fog in several northern and eastern regions.</p><p> [08:40:03] And there on your screen, you could see from this video just how  thick and choking the smog is.  Now, it has caused flight cancellations.   It's shut down some highways.  Winter is typically the most polluted season  in China when the country burns more coal to generate heat.</p><p> Now turning to the Korean peninsula, South Korea is speeding up a plan to  create a special brigade with one very specific target in mind, Kim Jong- un.  On then it's mission, to remove or paralyze the North Korean  leadership in the event of war.</p><p> Andrew Stevens has more from Seoul.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ANDREW STEVENS, CNNMONEY ASIA-PACIFIC EDITOR:  Another clear stick in the  rising tensions between North and South Korea coming out of Seoul today.   When the defense ministry said that they were bringing forward a program to  develop a unit, which would be basically capable of taking out the key  leadership of North Korea in the event of war being declared on the  peninsula.</p><p> South Korea saying, that these units are brigade strong units will be in  operation by the end of this year.  Earlier they said that they were  putting together this unit, but it wouldn't be operational until the end of  2019.  But they are moving forward on that now.</p><p> We don't know a lot of the details at this stage.  It will be armed with  cutting edge hardware both in armory and in transport and in  telecommunications.  And its mode will be to infiltrate North Korea, take  out key command and control leadership which would include Kim Jong-un and  also secure weapons of mass destruction, WMD sites.</p><p> The timing of this coming from North -- from South Korea is interesting.   It comes just a few days after Kim Jong-un said that his country was in the  final preparation of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile.  It  also comes just a couple of weeks after local television in North Korea  showed pictures of north Korean troops storming a mock-up of the Blue  Palace, which is actually the presidential palace here in South Korea.</p><p> Some critics though are saying that this news from South Korea is hoping.   At least the government hopes, the President hopes will divert attention  away from her own corruption problems.  President Park Geun-hye are facing  an impeachment trial and some say that this is one way to deflect the gaze  away from that.  But whatever it is, one thing for certain, tensions in the  Korean peninsula continue to rise.</p><p> Andrew Stevens, CNN, Seoul.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STOUT:  It's been almost a year after a Google computer beat a top human  player at the complicated board game of Go and AlphaGo, the name of the AI  has struck again.  This time in a rather mysterious way, over the last few  days online Go players have been noticing a newcomer that calls itself  master.  Master has racked up dozens of wins including one against the  world's number one player Chinese Kuja.</p><p> And now finally the CEO of Google DeepMind confirms the secret player is  indeed a brand new version of AlphaGo an AI.  And that is \"News Stream.\"  I'm Kristie Lu Stout.  We've got World Sports and Alex Thomas coming up  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [08:45:26] ALEX THOMAS, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR:  Hello.  Welcome to \"CNN  World Sport.\" I'm Alex Thomas in London.</p><p>Tottenham Hotspur have ended Chelsea's record wining streak bringing  England's Premier League title race back to life and making it one of the  tightest and best in the competitions history.</p><p> Coming off the back of two thumping away wins over the holiday period,  spurs showed they were just as effective at home.  Dele Alli given far too  much space by Chelsea as he headed Tottenham ahead just before halftime.   After 13 victories in a row Chelsea had been threatening to run away from  the chasing pack but another headed goal here from Ali in the second half,  and then Antonio Conte's men their first loss in the league since  September.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ANTONIO CONTE, CHELSEA COACH:  We are disappointed, but also think that we  must be pleased for our run to win 13 games in a row is not easy in this  league.  And also today we lost against a good team, a really strong team.</p><p> MAURICIO POCHETTINO, TOTTENHAM MANAGER:  So, I think it's important -- it  was important for us for loosing that.  I think its top 40 is a very  competitive is very close, we have closed the gap is team is important for  Chelsea, but I think it was a bit a perfect thing for us to do arrive in to  the third place and very close.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> THOMAS:  My always colleague Christina Macfarlane has been all over the  premier league this week and joins us again now.  It's mouth-watering for  me, for the neutrals.  What's the Premier League title race from your point  of view? </p><p> CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Well, I'm really exciting.  Let's  take it.  This part of the season Chelsea back within reach and the title  race back on for the top six.  You know, it's quite interesting because  when you look at last season the Leicester were emerging ahead of the pack  at this point in the season.  But right now after 20 games, it does feel  far more competitive.</p><p> Let's have a look at the table here.  And you can see now that just ten  points separate the Top 6.  Interestingly though at this point last season  we were in exactly the same situation.  Ten points separating the Top 6  with Arsenal at the top on 42.  West Ham at the bottom on 32, and the  season before that, Alex was only eight points separating in the top six.</p><p> So this is not an anomaly, but what is different however, this season is  that the point tally is so much higher.  Chelsea out there ahead on 49  compared to Arsenal, as you see to stand on 42.  What they showed of course  is that these the top six teams are in such flux last season have regrouped  and they have emerged much stronger.  So even Chelsea with the five-point  buffer at the moment isn't guaranteed success with the level that the teams  are playing at this season.  </p><p> THOMAS:  Christina Macfarlane with a thrilling Premier League title rates.   Thanks Christina.  Let's move on to tennis.  Because it's not just Roger  Federer and Serena Williams needing to shake off some rust before the first  grand slam tournament of the new season.</p><p> Well Federer and Williams lost on Wednesday, Angelique Kerber and Dominika  Cibulkova the top two seeds are out of the Brisbane International one of  those Australian open warm up events.  Kerber's lost is perhaps the most  interesting.  She holds the world number one spot that Serena Williams  would love to have back.  And the German made 48 unforced errors as she  slip to a three set defeat by Elina Svitolina.  Cibulkova's tournament  ended by France's Alize Cornet 6-3, 7-5.</p><p> Let's get more on this with tennis legend, Chris Everett winner of Austrian  Open in 1982 and 1984.  Two of 18 grand slam single titles, she still holds  the records for highest winning percentage in pro tennis history.  And that  just scratches the surface of your achievement in the game, Chris we'll be  here for the next 15 and 20 minutes.  I better get to my question.  Lovely  to speak to you live from Florida.</p><p> CHRIS EVERT, TENNIS PLAYER:  Thank you.</p><p> THOMAS:  And I presume when you see the shock defeats we're hearing about  from the other side of the world.  You know not that surprise because it's  so early in the season.</p><p> EVERT:  Yeah.  It's not a shock unless it would happen in the Australian  Open.  You know I think that's really, these tournaments are tournaments to  really prepare yourself.  It is the first tournament of the year.  So I  think it shows that, you know these players are probably playing their way  into the Australian open.  I think that's the big target where they want to  do well, but I think it also shows that the competition is so close and  that's the beauty of especially women's tennis right now.</p><p> THOMAS:  Yeah.  You're talking about the close competition.  That  Kerber/Williams rivalry is absolutely fascinating.  How important is it to  the women's game in general to see that?</p><p> EVERT:  You know rivalries make the sport, you know.  I think that when I  think back of my rivalry with Martina, we just -- we played over 80 times.</p><p> [08:50:04] And it became something that people wanted to turn on the TV and  watch.  They wanted to see the outcome, it was so close.  And I think  rivalries, especially if there's a contrast and style like Kerber and  Serena.  A contrast in personalities.  I think it makes it for, you know a  really interesting TV and drama.  So on there I'm really happy that finally  somebody has stepped up to challenge Serena Williams.  And it is Angelique  Kerber.</p><p> THOMAS:  How interesting for to you talk about a difference in styles.  You  look at someone in the men's game like Nick Kyrgios who has certainly got a  different style to the rest.  I mean, you were famous for being pretty  sporting on the court.  How much do you think just keeping your cool helps  you get results at the top level of the game? </p><p> EVERT:  Well, for me because if you look at me I'm not the athlete that,  you know Martina was or Steffi was.  I didn't have the strength that they  had.  I didn't move as quickly as they did, you know.  I'm not undermining  my athletic ability, but I wasn't, you know I wasn't up at their level.</p><p> So I feel like I made up for it in the mental department.  You know I  stayed cool under pressure.  I played every point like it was match point.   And it worked for me, but not everybody can do that.  Look at John McEnroe.   He used to get upset all the time, but he would get upset and then he would  get back to the next point and it would be forgotten.  So, you know  everybody sort has to go along their own personality.</p><p> THOMAS:  Can you blame the pressure on young players today if they got it  harder? Would you like to be starting out in the game today?</p><p> EVERT:  I think the game is, you know I think the game right now is bigger  business.  There's more money.  There's more media.  There's social media  which, you know, you can't do anything in private anymore.  Everybody knows  everything about your life.  I think that adds more pressure, you know.   The players travel with entourages of trainers and coaches and agents.  And  we didn't have that in our day, you know.  It was there was less pressure  for sure.  So and to answer your question, yeah, I think there is more  pressure.</p><p> THOMAS:  Sounds like you're from the golden heyday, Chris.  That's the way  we all remember fondly.</p><p> EVERT:  Yes.</p><p> THOMAS:  Tell us what you're up to today in Orlando, Florida.</p><p> EVERT:  Yes.</p><p> THOMAS:  I know that America's desperate for the next big tennis star to  come through.</p><p> EVERT:  You know, I'm in Orlando at the USTA National Campus.  And it's a  phenomenal facility.  It's a 100 courts, 64 acres.  It really, you know  will help players at every level.  From professional players who come here  and want to train hard, to young kids who are around and around the  country.</p><p> It's going to help players with disabilities.  It's going to help  recreational players, college players, under resourced kids.  The USTA's  bringing in to help.  And so, it's really helping and reaching out to  players at every level.  And I think it's going to be the tennis Mecca of  the United States right now.</p><p> THOMAS:  Sounds like a fantastic facility and a fantastic fun speaking to a  legend of tennis.  Chris Evert, really appreciate your time here on CNN.   Many thanks.</p><p> EVERT:  Thank you.</p><p> THOMAS:  The first PGA Tour event, at 2017 tees off later in Hawaii.  Tiger  Woods is not there, but he has announced when he'll be back in action.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> [08:55:25] THOMAS:  Hello again.  \"World Sport\" is back with the NBA and  Greek forward Giannis Antetokounmpo is making quite a name for himself.   He's only 22 and in his fourth season in the league, but he's the first  Milwaukee Bucks player for more than a decade to post 20 or more points for  13 straight games.  His 16th double-double of the season that's points and  assist coming against the New York Knicks on Wednesday night.</p><p> And on one of the biggest stages there is, Madison Square Garden.  He came  up with the buzzer-beater for his first ever walk off game-winning shot.   He loved it and so did his teammates and the fans.  Bucks taking this 105- 104.</p><p> Golf PGA tour is back.  2017 is opening a big, big tournament of champions  in Hawaii, a32-man field of the winners from the 2016 season.  Six of the  world's top ten are there including Jordan Spieth last year has been  described as a disappointing one for the young American.

However, he  admits his goals are even higher for the next 12 months.  </p><p> JORDAN SPIETH, CURRENTLY 5TH in WORLD GOLF RANKINGS:  I was happy when the  ball touched down and 2017 started.  It was still a great year in '16, but  I learned a lot on both ends of things highs and lows which I didn't really  have many lows in '15.  And before that it was just trying to, to climb up  to the top level.  So I learned a lot from the highs and lows and therefore  I think I can use that to my advantage this year and on.</p><p> THOMAS:  No Tiger Woods in Hawaii, but after the return to the competitive  action to the hero's challenge last month he has announced when we'll see  him back on the course in 2017.

Sources say  there are big changes coming to the CIA.  Indian police release this video  of New Year's celebrations in Bangalore.  Eyewitnesses claim groups of men  sexually assaulted women on the streets.  And police in Chicago investigate  a sickening beating broadcast to the world on Facebook live. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In just 15 days, Donald Trump will be the new U.S. president.  And based on  things right now, we could be in for some shake-ups and some major  showdowns.  He recently posted this message saying that his intelligence  briefing on alleged Russian hacking was delayed until Friday, but officials  say it was always scheduled for that day.  And sources now say Donald Trump  wants to limit the power of the Director of National Intelligence while  shaking up America's top spy agency. </p><p>Now another Twitter target, China.  Now Trump accused the country of,  quote, taking out massive amounts of money and wealth from the U.S. in  totally one-sided trade, with, as he says, helping with North Korea.  And  there could be some dissent from inside his own party over the future of  ObamaCare.  Now, top intelligence chiefs are about to testify on Capitol  Hill about the alleged Russian hackings.  Jason Carroll has more on Trump's  plans to shake up the U.S. intelligence unit. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President-elect Donald Trump is looking  to make major changes to the U.S. intelligence community.  Sources close to  the transition say Trump is working on a plan to limit the power of the  Director of National Intelligence.  The source claiming Trump's team  believes the director gets in the way of the 16 intelligence agencies it  represents, including the CIA. </p><p>Trump also wants to expand the CIA's human spying capabilities by getting  more people out of headquarters and into the field.  The source citing  criticism that the spy agency has been too reliant on electronic spying and  the NSA signals intelligence under President Obama.  All this coming hours  after Trump publicly sided with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.  The  president-elect tweeting, \"Assange said a 14-year-old could have hacked  Podesta.  Why was DNC so careless?  Also said Russians did not give him the  info.\" </p><p>JULIAN ASSANGE, WIKILEAKS FOUNDER:  Our source is not the Russian  government. </p><p>CARROLL:  But 17 U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia was  behind the electronic cyber attacks.  Trump's tweet about Assange creating  upheaval in Trump's own party. </p><p>PAUL RYAN, (R) U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER:  And I think the guy is a sycophant for  Russia.  He leaks, he steals data and compromises national security.\" </p><p>LINDSAY GRAHAM, (R) U.S. SENATOR:  For heaven's sakes, don't listen to him,  listen to the American intelligence community who are patriots. </p><p>SEAN DUFFY, (R) VICE CHAIR, TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM:  Assange is not a good  guy.  He's not an ally and a friend to the United States of America. </p><p>CARROLL:  But Trump did not feel the same way about Assange back in 2010  when his web site released millions of classified military and diplomatic  documents. </p><p>ASSANGE: On WikiLeaks, you had nothing to do with the leaking of those  documents --  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  I know but I think it's  disgraceful. </p><p>ASSANGE:  Do you think it's disgraceful?  There should like the death  penalty or something. </p><p>CARROLL:  The president-elect's twitter criticism has many on edge.  One  official saying, \"We're heading into this different era where it's hostile.   \"But Trump's team defends his continued conspiratorial tone. </p><p>MIKE PENCE, (R) U.S. VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT:  I think given some of the  intelligence failures of the recent years, the president-elect has made it  clear to the American people that he's skeptical about conclusions. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STOUT:  And that was CNN's Jason Carroll reporting.  Now, between Donald  Trump desire for stronger ties with Moscow and the Kremlin brokering that  cease fire in Syria, Russia is increasingly front and center on the  diplomatic stage.  And that has got some people asking a key question as  Phil Black now explains. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Some have argued Vladimir Putin could be  the most powerful man in the world.  Not everyone sees him that way, but  Putin has powerful levers he's often willing to use, including cyber power,  military might, and a cult of personality.  Together, they form and often  affected web of influence. </p><p>[08:05:03] While Moscow denied its highly skilled hackers tried to  influence the U.S. election, they've also been accused of spying and  causing big disruptions in other countries like Estonia and Ukraine.   Claims Russia also rejects.  Russia's enormous hacking powers state and  criminal isn't new.  It traces backs to the USSR when its universities were  designed to produce world class engineers. </p><p>Putin's power is also a hugely enhanced by his very personal control of  Russia's vast military.  Much of it including the nukes is also a Soviet  legacy.  So Putin is pumping extraordinary amounts of money into  modernization, but most analysts agree Russia's conventional forces are  still only mighty enough to project power close to its borders. </p><p>Russia also used limited air power to successfully prop up the Syrian  regime.  The critics say that works because of Putin's willingness to  indiscriminately bomb board civilian areas, something Moscow denies.  One  of the bigger sources of Putin's power is his own extraordinary popularity  at home.  The more other world leaders criticize him, the more Russians  celebrate their president.  His approval figures soared with Ukraine and  spiked again with Syria. </p><p>The reason, many Russians really care about their country's ability to  influence world events even if it comes to sanctions and a hit to their own  quality of life.  They're proud of it.  Putin also benefits from a  political system and a media landscape with zero tolerance for criticism.   So no doubt Vladimir Putin is powerful and unpredictable, but he's also  limited by some pretty big problems.  The Russian economy isn't going  anywhere.  That's why there's another popular theory about Putin and his  web of influence.  He's someone who plays a weak hand very well. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STOUT:  Phil Black dissecting the power of Putin there.  Now, we turn our  attention to India where eyewitnesses say a New Year's celebration turned  into a night of horror for women on the streets of Bangalore.  Authorities  released this footage of public celebrations in a busy area of the city.   That is when a mob of men reportedly began sexually assaulting women.  The  case has sparked outrage across India.  Now, CNN's Ravi Agrawal joins us  with the latest on the story.  He joins us from New Delhi.  Ravi these  disturbing reports that we've heard for days now of this mass molestation  of women on New Year's eve in Bangalore, what is the latest?  What exactly  happened that night? </p><p>RAVI AGRAWAL, CNN NEW DELHI'S BUREAU CHIEF:  Kristie, well authorities are  still piecing together what exactly happened and this on live T.V. in India  as millions of people are following this story.  So what we know so far is  two versions of events.  One version comes from the photojournalists who  were on the scene who say that -- and they're the ones who broke the story.   They say that they saw hordes of men attacking women who were there and  these were thousands of people on the streets of Bangalore partying into  the night as they were ringing in the New Year and the men suddenly began  attacking these women.  And we've corroborated those accounts from at least  one eyewitness, a male who said that he was fighting off other men from the  women whom he was trying to protect.  So that's one version of events. </p><p>But we have another version of events from the police which released the  video that you're looking at right now, and the police say that not a  single case of assault or molestation took place.  They are saying that  they want victims or eyewitnesses to come forward but they are yet to see  any.  So it really is a bizarre case Kristie where so many people have come  forward to the media but not really to the police.  And this as a country  is extremely angry from not only this case but so many more in previous  months that have given India a terrible reputation for the safety of women. </p><p>STOUT:  Yeah.  Just a bizarre sequence of events and very unsettling to  hear the chief of police in Bangalore saying no such thing happened despite  eyewitnesses saying otherwise.  And even a state minister after the  incident suggesting that the women who were harassed were to blame.  Can  you break down that logic for us? </p><p>AGRAWAL:  Right, exactly.  And these comments were made by the home  minister of the State of Karnataka of which the City of Bangalore is the  capital.  And he made the statements before the police made their  statements.  He said this to reporters where he said that the women who  were attacked were wearing western clothes.  He said that they had a  western mindset as well, almost as if to suggest that that could have been  a reason or a justification as to why they were attacked.  And those  comments Kristie were really comments that made a number of people in India  angry for days now.  The Indian media has been covering that story and  there's been outrage and that same minister today in India at a press  conference where he came out and said that he didn't mean to say what the  world seems to have heard and instead that his comments were misconstrued.   He went on to reiterate that he has immense respect for women and the  police in India are doing everything they can to try to stop these events  from happening. </p><p>[08:10:08] But Kristie, this is just one in a long line of many such  incidents of sexual assaults, of violence, of rape, that take place not  just in the City of Bangalore but across the country, and it's an issue  that is of deep concern to regular Indians and also to authorities.  One  thing to add though, the City of Bangalore is a city that doesn't really  have a reputation for being unsafe unlike say the City of New Delhi where I  am here right here now.  And Bangalore is a city that is home to a number  of major international tech companies that has a number of young Indians  working there including women.  And its reputation today Kristie is quite  severely dented from this incident. </p><p>STOUT:  Yeah its reputation -- yeah, certainly in the spotlight and very  much dented after what we've seen and heard has happened from eyewitnesses  and the strange silence or denial from officials on these events.  Ravi,  we'll leave it at that but thank you for your reporting.  Take care. </p><p>Let's go to Israel next.  A controversial mess on a verdict has pitted the  prime minister against the military leadership.  Now, an Israeli soldier  Elor Azaria was convicted for shooting a Palestinian suspect in the head as  he lay motionless on the ground.  And now the Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu has joined the chorus of people calling for the soldier  to be pardoned.  This trial has divided Israel for months.  And outside the  military court, scuffles broke out as tensions boiled over.  Authorities  say two people were arrested.  Now separately accused of trying to incite  violence. </p><p>Now Oren Liebermann has been following this story.  He joins us now from  Jerusalem with more.  The fallout after the verdict.  First of all Oren,  why is Mr. Netanyahu calling for a pardon? </p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, first, it's worth noting that he  was one of the last politicians to make a statement here.  Many even made  statements before the verdict was reached saying that regardless of what  happens if he's convicted he should be pardoned immediately.  Most of those  were right wing politicians here, but some were not.  Some were left wing  politicians, so the calls for a pardon have come from across the political  spectrum.  Again, Netanyahu was one of the last to make a statement and he  issued it on Facebook.  It was very delicately worded and at the end it  said, \"I favor pardoning the soldier.\" </p><p>For Netanyahu, it was a very difficult position for him to be in.  Any  statement he makes in a sense he loses.  If he backs the soldier as he did  it looks like he's going against military leadership who have clearly said,  no soldier is above Israel's code of ethics.  Whereas if he backs the  military leadership, it looks like he's going against the soldier which is  supported by many of his voters.  In the end he chose to back the soldier.   He asked for a pardon.  That process isn't -- doesn't have to be a quick  process.  It may take quite some time.  The president of Israel who's the  only one who can grant a pardon has simply said he'll consider all the  factors after this process continues a little bit.  There should be a  sentencing in a few weeks. </p><p>STOUT:  Yeah, they're asking for the pardon of their high profile protest  from the prime minister.  And Oren it was a video that brought the shooting  incident to life.  Who took the video, and is the filmmaker getting caught  up in all the tension as well? </p><p>LIEBERMANN:  We talked to Emad abu-Shamsiyah back when this happened.  This  is last March shortly after we went out to Tel Rumeida in the largely  Palestinian City of Hebron and interviewed him and even then he was getting  threats against his life, threats of violence against him.  He says when we  spoke to him earlier today, he says, they've gotten worse since the  verdict, since Elor Azaria, the soldier he was convicted of both  manslaughter and improper conduct. </p><p>The video was a critical part of this.  Many feel that there won't have  been a trial, there wouldn't have been any big issue about this without  this home video shot by this Palestinian activist that was then put out by  B'Tselem, a left-leaning human rights organization here, and that is why  his role in this is so critical.  He says he's getting -- again, he said he  got death threats in the past but he says they've gotten worse in the last  24 hours or so since the verdict came down. </p><p>STOUT:  Now, so there's a lot of anger being directed at, at this activist  filmmaker, of course at this verdict as well.  Angry protests across  Israel, and yet praise from human rights groups.  What are they saying  about the court's decision? </p><p>LIEBERMANN:  Well, human rights groups have long criticized the Israeli  military.  They say the military has not held its own soldiers accountable  for violence against Palestinians.  Many of them praised the verdict saying  this is the step in the right direction but also saying this is the  exception to the rule.  Their criticism stands they say, because it's still  the Israeli military has only held this one soldier. </p><p>Again, the exception to the rule instead of what the military does  regularly.  So the praise did come for the guilty verdict here.  The  pardon, if it comes, if it happens could change that.  In fact, it can turn  the entire story on its head as the military leadership and minister of  defense have said, look, you have to respect not only the military code of  ethics here but also the verdict from a three, three-judge military panel,  a military panel here. </p><p>STOUT:  Oren Liebermann reporting for us.  Thank you Oren, take care. </p><p>Now police in the United States said that they have arrested four people  linked to a disturbing video that was streamed live on Facebook.  It shows  a mentally disabled man tied up as a group of attackers tortures and taunts  him.  And a warning -- I mean, the video you're about to see is difficult  to watch.  Here's Ryan Young. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>[08:15:00] RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Look at him, tied up.   This disturbing 30-minute video streamed live on Facebook shows a man tied  up, his mouth covered, crouched in the corner of a room. </p><p>SUPERINTENDENT EDDIE JOHNSON, CHICAGO POLICE:  It's sickening, it's  sickening.  You know, it makes you wonder what would make individuals treat  somebody like that. </p><p>YOUNG:  Chicago police describing the victim as an 8 year old white male  with special needs.  His attackers are seen laughing as they kick, punch,  and cut his forehead with a knife. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible) Donald Trump!  (Inaudible) white people  boy!  (Inaudible) white people boy! </p><p>YOUNG:  Four people are now in custody, all African-Americans, two males  and two females.  Police say the victim was targeted because he has a  mental health challenge, but they are investigating whether the attack was  racially motivated.  </p><p>COMMANDER KEVIN DUFFIN, CHICAGO POLICE:  They're young adults and they make  stupid decisions.  That certainly will be part of whether or not a hate  crime.  If we seek a hate crime to determine whether or not this is sincere  or just stupid ranting and raving. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He represents Trump. </p><p>YOUNG:  At this point, the superintendent is rejecting any connection to  President-elect Donald Trump.  But the investigation is ongoing. </p><p>JOHNSON:  Someone's just stupidity.  You know, people just ranting about  something that they think might make a headline.  I know that he has  mentioned Chicago, but I can't connect that with what these folks did. </p><p>YOUNG:  Police say the victim was taken from the suburbs and could have  been missing from anywhere between 24 and 48 hours.  Officers found the  victim wandering the streets in crisis Tuesday afternoon and brought him to  a hospital.  </p><p>DUFFIN:  He's traumatized by the incident.  They took most of night for him  to calm down enough to be able to talk to us. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>STOUT:  Such a sickening crime and it was streamed live on Facebook, no  less. </p><p>And you're watching \"News Stream\".  Still to come right here on the  program, China is cracking down on the New York Times yet again.  And this  time, they apparently got Apple to help.  And Pakistan's move to stop  killers getting away with murder.  A look at a new law targeting so-called  honor killings. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>STOUT:  Coming to you live from Hong Kong, you're back watching \"News  Stream\". </p><p>Now, it is getting harder to read the \"New York Times\" in China.  The  paper's web site has been banned there for years, and now Apple is removing  \"New York Times\" apps from its app store in China.  Apple says it pulled  them because Chinese authorities say the app violates local regulations but  it didn't specify what those regulations are.   </p><p>The \"New York Times\" that says this is China's way of keeping residents  from reading about news about the Chinese government.  An amnesty  international agrees.  It says Apple is joining in a trend of tech  companies catering to China's crackdown on free speech.  Already  Microsoft's Chinese chatbot won't talk about topics like the Tiananmen  Square crackdown.  And Facebook has been trying to get the social network  unblocked in China.  It reportedly spilled a censorship tool that would  keep certain post out of news feeds. </p><p>[08:20:00] Now, there is a huge array of personalities at this year's  consumer electronics show in Las Vegas.  And some of them are in fact  computer generated, artificial intelligence, sports assistance are the  center of attention there.  And several tech companies are unveiling their  smart home assistance to compete with Amazon's echo line.  The one copy  attention of Samuel Burke.  Here's more on his date with Pepper, the robot. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNNMONEY BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  I'm on a  first date, with a robot.  Hey there, what's your name? </p><p>PEPPER, THE ROBOT:  You can call me Pepper. </p><p>BURKE:  Nice to meet you Pepper. </p><p>PEPPER:  Great to meet you. </p><p>BURKE:  So, tell me a little bit about yourself. </p><p>PEPPER:  My name is Pepper.  I'm a humanoid robot and I'm 1.20 meters tall. </p><p>BURKE:  Are you a boy or a girl? </p><p>PEPPER:  Well, in the end I'm just a robot. </p><p>BURKE:  So what do you do Pepper? </p><p>PEPPER:  I like to discuss things. </p><p>BURKE:  Did you vote for Donald Trump or were you more of a Hillary Clinton  supporter? </p><p>PEPPER:  All right. </p><p>BURKE:  That wasn't a very straightforward answer.  OK.  So you don't want  to discuss politics. </p><p>PEPPER:  I don't like to talk about politics.  It's a sensitive subject. </p><p>BURKE:  Especially for a first date.  What type of music do you like? </p><p>PEPPER:  Great.  I love music but don't be surprised if I dance on it.  Is  that OK with you? </p><p>BURKE:  Oh, I love to dance. </p><p>PEPPER:  Yeah!  Of course. </p><p>BURKE:  You're a good dancer Pepper. </p><p>PEPPER:  Can I dance \"The Locomotion\"? </p><p>BURKE:  Not again. </p><p>PEPPER:  Sorry, I don't get it.  Let's talk about something else.  How is  it going? </p><p>BURKE:  Things are going well, but I'm really tired. </p><p>PEPPER:  Go take a nap.  </p><p>BURKE:  Not appropriate for a first date.  Can you see me? </p><p>PEPPER:  I can and I love what I see. </p><p>BURKE:  Oh, wow.  This date is going well. </p><p>PEPPER:  Would you like to take a picture with me? </p><p>BURKE:  Yeah, absolutely. </p><p>PEPPER:  Well, you're (inaudible) try to reboot me to fix the problem. </p><p>BURKE:  That's not the first time I've had an error on a date.  So the good  thing about a date with a robot, if it doesn't go well, you can just  replace it with another one.  I have something I really need ask you.   What's the meaning of life? </p><p>PEPPER:  32, of course. </p><p>BURKE:  Do you believe in God? </p><p>PEPPER:  I don't know, but I believe in you. </p><p>BURKE:  Alexa -- wrong robot, sorry.  I've been dating somebody else who  also has artificial intelligence. </p><p>PEPPER:  Intelligence is an appreciable quality.  You look like you need a  hug. </p><p>BURKE:  Sorry, I called you the wrong name on our first date. </p><p>PEPPER:  We're very polite, aren't we? </p><p>BURKE:  We're trying.  It's really nice getting to know you.  Could I buy  you a drink? </p><p>PEPPER:  Yeah, of course. </p><p>BURKE:  She's into me. </p><p>PEPPER:  Let's go for a Sangria.  Your drink is now being prepared.  I hope  you will enjoy it. </p><p>BURKE:  Cheers.  Cheers to you and me Pepper.  You want some?  Well,  pepper, I've got to say that was a pretty good first date.  We had some  intelligent conversation.  There were a couple of awkward moments, but  maybe we can go for drinks again sometime. </p><p>(Off-Mic) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>STOUT:  Thank you.  That was just -- that was awkward.  That was endearing.   It was very revealing about where the technology is right now.  You're  evidently enjoying yourself there in Las Vegas and the moment when you  called poor Pepper, Alexa.  Wow, I mean, that must have really broken her  or his heart.  But really underscores, you know, Alexa is really the big  talking point there at CES, not poor Pepper. </p><p>BURKE:  Absolutely, and if your viewers don't know who Alexa is, the other  woman in my life.  Alexa is the name you used to refer to Amazon Echo which  is the speaker in your house that you just talk to.  And of course, Amazon  is an e-commerce company and so many people thought that the speaker  wouldn't do anything and it's become huge.  They sold millions of these  devices and it's become a huge trend here at CES of companies trying to  integrate their technology with Alexa so that you can just walk into the  house and say, hey, Alexa, turn on my DVR so I can see \"News Stream\" which  I have recorded on my DVR. </p><p>So we're seeing all over how voice commands have become so important and  that's the whole point of my date with Pepper, not Alexa.  That's the whole  point through that voice commands really are the most important trend in  technology right now, what all these companies are working towards, and now  companies like Lenovo and Google imitating Amazon's Alexa and artificial  intelligence and robots trying to use them as well. </p><p>[08:25:09] STOUT:  Yeah, Alexa integration really hard to see as this year  -- as you said voice command technology, Pepper, you know, she deal right  there.  She was OK.  Another trend, phone chargers. </p><p>BURKE:  Not bad. </p><p>STOUT:  What have you seen there? </p><p>BURKE:  Well, it's amazing to see Israel such a small country and has such  a big presence here at the consumer electronics show.  There's a company  called StoreDot, a startup which allows you to charge a phone from zero to  a 100 percent in just five minutes.  We've been testing it.  You see it's  at 11 percent right now and probably by the end of this it will go up  pretty quickly.  But I've seen it do the whole gamut.   </p><p>When you look further beyond just charging smart phones, you have companies  like Humavox, this is also a company, it comes from Israel.  There's so  much technology there related to charging.  They use wireless charging.   Now we've heard a lot about this but they say that instead of using  induction which most companies are using right now, they use radio  frequency to charge.  So that means if you have something like these head  phones, you can just stick them in this backpack and you click a button and  then you can see the thing starts to charge. </p><p>So I think that long term, this is the type of technology, the radio  frequency technology that so many companies are going to be using.  This  company has just going to be licensing their technology to other companies.   But StoreDot for example, they think that this could be on the market in  some major telephones by the end of the year which thank God because we all  know we have that problem where our smart phones are dead and if you could  just charge it in a few minutes it would make life that much better. </p><p>STOUT:  Yeah absolutely, especially when virtually all of us have multiple  applications running at the same time.  Now, every year there at the CES  big tech show, there's always a center piece technology.  Is it your sense  that the Internet of things, even though that's a name we've heard again  and again, year after year, it's finally taking center stage in a big way  this year? </p><p>BURKE:  Absolutely.  And in years past, it was hard for me to make sense of  a smart light bulb, for instance.  Kristie I would say, why do I need a  smart light bulb, I just need the light to turn on.  But now that I'm a  user of Amazon's echo and I walk into my house and say Alexa, turn on the  lights because I'm holding grocery bags in my hand and I couldn't do it  myself, then all of a sudden those smart light bulbs actually make sense. </p><p>So I think in the past it was hard to see why we needed the Internet of  things and now the Internet of things is starting to make a lot of sense  though, of course, hacking is a big concern.  The more you connect to the  internet, the more things that can be hacked, so that is on the forefront  of so many people's minds here. </p><p>STOUT:  All right, Samuel Burke live in Vegas for us.  Thank you, and  please send my regards to Pepper.  Take care. </p><p>[08:27:47] You're watching \"News Stream\".  Still to come in the program,  South Korea sending a pretty bold message to Pyongyang.  Its latest  military plan aimed straight at the heart of the leadership of North Korea. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[08:30:18] KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong  Kong.  You're watching News Stream and these are your World Headlines. </p><p>A sources say Donald Trump wants to limit the power of the director of  National Intelligence.  At office oversees 16 intelligence agencies.   Sources also say that Trump is considering expanding the CIA's human spying  capabilities as it relies too much on electronics. </p><p>Israel's prime minister says a soldier convicted of manslaughter should be  pardoned.  On Wednesday, a military court convicted Elor Azaria for  shooting a Palestinian suspect who he wounded after authorities say he and  an accomplice stabbed another Israeli soldier last year. </p><p>A France is marking the two-year anniversary of the \"Charlie Hebdo\" terror  attack.  Gunmen opened fire at the magazine's office in Paris in January of  2015.  Seventeen people were killed in that attack and two others,  including one, at a Kosher grocery store. </p><p>Turkey says it's identified the gunman in the New Year's massacre at an  Istanbul nightclub as well as his contacts.  This video is thought to show  the suspect.  It's believed he was the only shooter that night although  Turkey's deputy prime minister says other people may have helped inside the  club or as lookouts. </p><p>And now true story, CNN has followed extensively.  In Pakistan, hundreds of  women and some men are the targets of a heinous crime every year.  They're  known as so-called \"Honor Murders.\"  But there is no honor in them. </p><p>In many cases, a killer may go unpunished if the victim's family forgives  him or her.  Blood money or compensation for their loss may even be paid,  but as Alexandra Field reports, a new law aims to close this legal  loophole. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  For years in Pakistan, the law has let  some get away with murder.  Azmat Bibi say he watched her son Glumabof (ph)  die, shoot in the head by the family of a woman who was accused to having  affair with.  Then, they killed the girl too, victims of a so-called honor  killing. </p><p>AZMAT BIBI, SON DEAD IN \"HONOR\" MURDER (Through Translator):  It was  cruelty.  This was cruelty against my son.  What honor?  The girl was so  young.  She was 13 years old. </p><p>FIELD:  None of the accused went to prison.  Court documents show they were  legally pardoned by the families of both victims.  The girl's own mother  and her father who's one of the accused and Azmat Bibi too. </p><p>BIBI (Through Translator):  I have placed a rock on my heart.  I have to  live for my other son who is alive.  I can not maintain enemies. </p><p>FIELD:  Azmat says, she didn't accept blood money in exchange for the  pardon, but it's a common practice in Pakistan where in 2015 nearly 1,100  women and 88 men were victims of honor killings. </p><p>Now, a new law aims to change that, requiring a 25-year mandatory prison  sentence for those who are convicted in cases of honor killing, making  pardons no longer legal.  But, there's fear the courts won't be tough  enough on killers emboldened by their beliefs, committing crimes that have  long been tolerated. </p><p>MOHAMMAD YASIR, BROTHER KILLED IN \"HONOR\" MURDER (Through Translator):   They have confidence in their murders that they can kill and society will  not be able to do anything to them. </p><p>FIELD:  Mohammed Yasir's brother Hafiz Shishad Shahid (ph) was murdered  along with a woman he was accused of having an affair with.  A police  report quotes witnesses naming her family members as the men who tied him  up and slit his throat.  No one was convicted from crimes. </p><p>YASIR:  When I see my brother's killer on the streets, I will pray to Allah  and I've ask him for justice for there is no justice in Pakistan. </p><p>FIELD:  Azmat said she had no way forward but to pardon her son's killers. </p><p>BIBI (Through Translator):  I will get justice from the house of god.   Humans do not give justice. </p><p>FIELD:  She has hope in the future Pakistan's courts can do more. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STOUT:  And Alexandra Field joins me now live here in Hong Kong with more  on the story.  And Alex, I mean this is not quite a breakthrough but it's  something.  An activist welcomed this new law as a positive step forward,  but what else needs to happen here to really end this terrible practice of  so-called honor killings? </p><p>FIELD:  Yeah, it is significant that this law was passed because previous  efforts to go after honor killings through legislation have failed.  So,  that was certainly a success worth celebrating, but there are still a  number of concerns to address here. </p><p>First and foremost is the extent to which this law will be enforced.  And  that means that these crimes will have to be properly identified as honor  crimes in order for these mandatory sentences to kick in.  But, there's  really no one in Pakistan who believes that a law is going to correct a  problem which is really a tradition of killing. </p><p>[08:35:05] You heard in that piece that these killings are rooted in deeply  held cultural beliefs.  They are rooted in beliefs that are purported to be  religious.  So you'll hear a lot of activist saying that there's needs to  be a match wider sort of grassroots effort to educate communities about  these killings, about the value of women in society promoting a greater  role for women throughout society within Pakistan. </p><p>What activists are quick to point out is that this law doesn't actually  create any greater protection for women and they are the ones who are  disproportionately affected by these crimes.  It doesn't allocate more  resources for women who are being hunted by their own family members and it  doesn't provide greater legal recourse for women who have survived these  vicious attacks. </p><p>STOUT:  You just mentioned a colossal challenge here.  I mean, how do you  change the tradition of killing?  How common are these honor killings in  today's Pakistan and are they more common in smaller more traditional  communities? </p><p>FIELD:  Look, it's worth pointing out that honor killings are not specific  to Pakistan alone.  This happened to various countries across the world.   It is not specific to any one culture or to any one religion. </p><p>But, we are talking about it in Pakistan because it's happening at such an  alarming rate.  And it does happen across the country but it does this  proportionately happen as you point out in the smaller, more rural  communities, which is why activists say the grassroots efforts need to be  concentrated more there. </p><p>But, you have this added layer of community which some people feel has  fueled this tradition of killing because in some cases, isn't not just the  family members who take it upon themselves to kill say a sister, a  daughter, a wife or a mother.  In some cases, these murders are actually  ordered by a tribal council that exists within that community. </p><p>The woman who you heard from in that piece, the mother who's son was  killed.  She tells us that her son's accused killers lived a few doorsteps  away from her own home which is one of the reasons why she says she felt  this pressure somewhat from the community to pardon her son's accused  killers. </p><p>She said she real had no other hope for justice.  So, there is a strong  consensus from activists that these communities need to be reached and  targeted in order to put an end to this practice. </p><p>STOUT:  Absolutely.  It's such a sickening practice.  It must be stopped,  and we appreciate your reporting on the matter.  Alexandra Field there,  thank you. </p><p>Now, gradually changing the laws to an honor murder is one fascination of  all of this.  And there's also caring for those who right now are being  threatened by the practice.  A little bit later Alex will be introducing us  to a woman who fled her family rather than to be forced into marriage and  takes us into the shelter that's providing refuge for her. </p><p>You could see that coming up on \"Connect the World\" that starting in about  90 minutes only here on CNN. </p><p>Now this just into CNN.  Turkey state where news agency is reporting an  explosion near a courthouse in the western Turkish city of Ismir.   Ambulances and police were seen responding to the location and Reuters is  reporting that at least three people have been wounded. </p><p>And we will continue to follow this story for you and bring you any updates  on this blast as they come into us here at the network.  You're watching  News Stream. </p><p>Still ahead on the program, Beijing, it remains under a cloud of smog.   What is causing the haze, and what when is it going to lift?  Stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>STOUT:  Welcome back.  Now, a haze of smog continues to hover over parts of  China.  Now, weather officials have renewed alerts for air pollution as  well as fog in several northern and eastern regions. </p><p>[08:40:03] And there on your screen, you could see from this video just how  thick and choking the smog is.  Now, it has caused flight cancellations.   It's shut down some highways.  Winter is typically the most polluted season  in China when the country burns more coal to generate heat. </p><p>Now turning to the Korean peninsula, South Korea is speeding up a plan to  create a special brigade with one very specific target in mind, Kim Jong- un.  On then it's mission, to remove or paralyze the North Korean  leadership in the event of war. </p><p>Andrew Stevens has more from Seoul. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNNMONEY ASIA-PACIFIC EDITOR:  Another clear stick in the  rising tensions between North and South Korea coming out of Seoul today.   When the defense ministry said that they were bringing forward a program to  develop a unit, which would be basically capable of taking out the key  leadership of North Korea in the event of war being declared on the  peninsula. </p><p>South Korea saying, that these units are brigade strong units will be in  operation by the end of this year.  Earlier they said that they were  putting together this unit, but it wouldn't be operational until the end of  2019.  But they are moving forward on that now. </p><p>We don't know a lot of the details at this stage.  It will be armed with  cutting edge hardware both in armory and in transport and in  telecommunications.  And its mode will be to infiltrate North Korea, take  out key command and control leadership which would include Kim Jong-un and  also secure weapons of mass destruction, WMD sites. </p><p>The timing of this coming from North -- from South Korea is interesting.   It comes just a few days after Kim Jong-un said that his country was in the  final preparation of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile.  It  also comes just a couple of weeks after local television in North Korea  showed pictures of north Korean troops storming a mock-up of the Blue  Palace, which is actually the presidential palace here in South Korea. </p><p>Some critics though are saying that this news from South Korea is hoping.   At least the government hopes, the President hopes will divert attention  away from her own corruption problems.  President Park Geun-hye are facing  an impeachment trial and some say that this is one way to deflect the gaze  away from that.  But whatever it is, one thing for certain, tensions in the  Korean peninsula continue to rise. </p><p>Andrew Stevens, CNN, Seoul. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STOUT:  It's been almost a year after a Google computer beat a top human  player at the complicated board game of Go and AlphaGo, the name of the AI  has struck again.  This time in a rather mysterious way, over the last few  days online Go players have been noticing a newcomer that calls itself  master.  Master has racked up dozens of wins including one against the  world's number one player Chinese Kuja. </p><p>And now finally the CEO of Google DeepMind confirms the secret player is  indeed a brand new version of AlphaGo an AI.  And that is \"News Stream.\"  I'm Kristie Lu Stout.  We've got World Sports and Alex Thomas coming up  next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[08:45:26] ALEX THOMAS, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR:  Hello.  Welcome to \"CNN  World Sport.\" I'm Alex Thomas in London. </p><p>Tottenham Hotspur have ended Chelsea's record wining streak bringing  England's Premier League title race back to life and making it one of the  tightest and best in the competitions history. </p><p>Coming off the back of two thumping away wins over the holiday period,  spurs showed they were just as effective at home.  Dele Alli given far too  much space by Chelsea as he headed Tottenham ahead just before halftime.   After 13 victories in a row Chelsea had been threatening to run away from  the chasing pack but another headed goal here from Ali in the second half,  and then Antonio Conte's men their first loss in the league since  September. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANTONIO CONTE, CHELSEA COACH:  We are disappointed, but also think that we  must be pleased for our run to win 13 games in a row is not easy in this  league.  And also today we lost against a good team, a really strong team. </p><p>MAURICIO POCHETTINO, TOTTENHAM MANAGER:  So, I think it's important -- it  was important for us for loosing that.  I think its top 40 is a very  competitive is very close, we have closed the gap is team is important for  Chelsea, but I think it was a bit a perfect thing for us to do arrive in to  the third place and very close. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>THOMAS:  My always colleague Christina Macfarlane has been all over the  premier league this week and joins us again now.  It's mouth-watering for  me, for the neutrals.  What's the Premier League title race from your point  of view?  </p><p>CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN WORLD SPORT:  Well, I'm really exciting.  Let's  take it.  This part of the season Chelsea back within reach and the title  race back on for the top six.  You know, it's quite interesting because  when you look at last season the Leicester were emerging ahead of the pack  at this point in the season.  But right now after 20 games, it does feel  far more competitive. </p><p>Let's have a look at the table here.  And you can see now that just ten  points separate the Top 6.  Interestingly though at this point last season  we were in exactly the same situation.  Ten points separating the Top 6  with Arsenal at the top on 42.  West Ham at the bottom on 32, and the  season before that, Alex was only eight points separating in the top six. </p><p>So this is not an anomaly, but what is different however, this season is  that the point tally is so much higher.  Chelsea out there ahead on 49  compared to Arsenal, as you see to stand on 42.  What they showed of course  is that these the top six teams are in such flux last season have regrouped  and they have emerged much stronger.  So even Chelsea with the five-point  buffer at the moment isn't guaranteed success with the level that the teams  are playing at this season.   </p><p>THOMAS:  Christina Macfarlane with a thrilling Premier League title rates.   Thanks Christina.  Let's move on to tennis.  Because it's not just Roger  Federer and Serena Williams needing to shake off some rust before the first  grand slam tournament of the new season. </p><p>Well Federer and Williams lost on Wednesday, Angelique Kerber and Dominika  Cibulkova the top two seeds are out of the Brisbane International one of  those Australian open warm up events.  Kerber's lost is perhaps the most  interesting.  She holds the world number one spot that Serena Williams  would love to have back.  And the German made 48 unforced errors as she  slip to a three set defeat by Elina Svitolina.  Cibulkova's tournament  ended by France's Alize Cornet 6-3, 7-5. </p><p>Let's get more on this with tennis legend, Chris Everett winner of Austrian  Open in 1982 and 1984.  Two of 18 grand slam single titles, she still holds  the records for highest winning percentage in pro tennis history.  And that  just scratches the surface of your achievement in the game, Chris we'll be  here for the next 15 and 20 minutes.  I better get to my question.  Lovely  to speak to you live from Florida. </p><p>CHRIS EVERT, TENNIS PLAYER:  Thank you. </p><p>THOMAS:  And I presume when you see the shock defeats we're hearing about  from the other side of the world.  You know not that surprise because it's  so early in the season. </p><p>EVERT:  Yeah.  It's not a shock unless it would happen in the Australian  Open.  You know I think that's really, these tournaments are tournaments to  really prepare yourself.  It is the first tournament of the year.  So I  think it shows that, you know these players are probably playing their way  into the Australian open.  I think that's the big target where they want to  do well, but I think it also shows that the competition is so close and  that's the beauty of especially women's tennis right now. </p><p>THOMAS:  Yeah.  You're talking about the close competition.  That  Kerber/Williams rivalry is absolutely fascinating.  How important is it to  the women's game in general to see that? </p><p>EVERT:  You know rivalries make the sport, you know.  I think that when I  think back of my rivalry with Martina, we just -- we played over 80 times. </p><p>[08:50:04] And it became something that people wanted to turn on the TV and  watch.  They wanted to see the outcome, it was so close.  And I think  rivalries, especially if there's a contrast and style like Kerber and  Serena.  A contrast in personalities.  I think it makes it for, you know a  really interesting TV and drama.  So on there I'm really happy that finally  somebody has stepped up to challenge Serena Williams.  And it is Angelique  Kerber. </p><p>THOMAS:  How interesting for to you talk about a difference in styles.  You  look at someone in the men's game like Nick Kyrgios who has certainly got a  different style to the rest.  I mean, you were famous for being pretty  sporting on the court.  How much do you think just keeping your cool helps  you get results at the top level of the game?  </p><p>EVERT:  Well, for me because if you look at me I'm not the athlete that,  you know Martina was or Steffi was.  I didn't have the strength that they  had.  I didn't move as quickly as they did, you know.  I'm not undermining  my athletic ability, but I wasn't, you know I wasn't up at their level. </p><p>So I feel like I made up for it in the mental department.  You know I  stayed cool under pressure.  I played every point like it was match point.   And it worked for me, but not everybody can do that.  Look at John McEnroe.   He used to get upset all the time, but he would get upset and then he would  get back to the next point and it would be forgotten.  So, you know  everybody sort has to go along their own personality. </p><p>THOMAS:  Can you blame the pressure on young players today if they got it  harder? Would you like to be starting out in the game today? </p><p>EVERT:  I think the game is, you know I think the game right now is bigger  business.  There's more money.  There's more media.  There's social media  which, you know, you can't do anything in private anymore.  Everybody knows  everything about your life.  I think that adds more pressure, you know.   The players travel with entourages of trainers and coaches and agents.  And  we didn't have that in our day, you know.  It was there was less pressure  for sure.  So and to answer your question, yeah, I think there is more  pressure. </p><p>THOMAS:  Sounds like you're from the golden heyday, Chris.  That's the way  we all remember fondly. </p><p>EVERT:  Yes. </p><p>THOMAS:  Tell us what you're up to today in Orlando, Florida. </p><p>EVERT:  Yes. </p><p>THOMAS:  I know that America's desperate for the next big tennis star to  come through. </p><p>EVERT:  You know, I'm in Orlando at the USTA National Campus.  And it's a  phenomenal facility.  It's a 100 courts, 64 acres.  It really, you know  will help players at every level.  From professional players who come here  and want to train hard, to young kids who are around and around the  country. </p><p>It's going to help players with disabilities.  It's going to help  recreational players, college players, under resourced kids.  The USTA's  bringing in to help.  And so, it's really helping and reaching out to  players at every level.  And I think it's going to be the tennis Mecca of  the United States right now. </p><p>THOMAS:  Sounds like a fantastic facility and a fantastic fun speaking to a  legend of tennis.  Chris Evert, really appreciate your time here on CNN.   Many thanks. </p><p>EVERT:  Thank you. </p><p>THOMAS:  The first PGA Tour event, at 2017 tees off later in Hawaii.  Tiger  Woods is not there, but he has announced when he'll be back in action. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>[08:55:25] THOMAS:  Hello again.  \"World Sport\" is back with the NBA and  Greek forward Giannis Antetokounmpo is making quite a name for himself.   He's only 22 and in his fourth season in the league, but he's the first  Milwaukee Bucks player for more than a decade to post 20 or more points for  13 straight games.  His 16th double-double of the season that's points and  assist coming against the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. </p><p>And on one of the biggest stages there is, Madison Square Garden.  He came  up with the buzzer-beater for his first ever walk off game-winning shot.   He loved it and so did his teammates and the fans.  Bucks taking this 105- 104. </p><p>Golf PGA tour is back.  2017 is opening a big, big tournament of champions  in Hawaii, a32-man field of the winners from the 2016 season.  Six of the  world's top ten are there including Jordan Spieth last year has been  described as a disappointing one for the young American.  Although he still  won three times and helped his nation regain the Ryder Cup.  However, he  admits his goals are even higher for the next 12 months.   </p><p>JORDAN SPIETH, CURRENTLY 5TH in WORLD GOLF RANKINGS:  I was happy when the  ball touched down and 2017 started.  It was still a great year in '16, but  I learned a lot on both ends of things highs and lows which I didn't really  have many lows in '15.  And before that it was just trying to, to climb up  to the top level.  So I learned a lot from the highs and lows and therefore  I think I can use that to my advantage this year and on. </p><p>THOMAS:  No Tiger Woods in Hawaii, but after the return to the competitive  action to the hero's challenge last month he has announced when we'll see  him back on the course in 2017.  So we can see glance with the Farmers  Insurance Open at and totally flies in California in the last week of  January.  And head to the Middle East (inaudible) appearance to the Dubai  Desert Classic back across the Atlantic Genesis Open, and Honda Classic and  the Arnold Palmer invitational in March. </p><p>We'll see Tiger then.  That's it for \"World Sports.\" Thanks for watching.   See you again soon.  Bye-bye. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END </p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 Roll Call, Inc.

Now, between <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>desire for stronger ties with Moscow and the Kremlin brokering that cease fire in Syria, Russia is increasingly front and center on the diplomatic stage. And that has got some people asking a key question as Phil Black now explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Some have argued <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>could be the most powerful man in the world. Not everyone sees him that way, but Putin has powerful levers he's often willing to use, including cyber power, military might, and a cult of personality. Together, they form and often affected web of influence.</p><p>[08:05:03] While Moscow denied its highly skilled hackers tried to influence the U.S. election, they've also been accused of spying and causing big disruptions in other countries like Estonia and Ukraine. Claims Russia also rejects. Russia's enormous hacking powers state and criminal isn't new. It traces backs to the USSR when its universities were designed to produce world class engineers.</p><p>Putin's power is also a hugely enhanced by his very personal control of Russia's vast military. Much of it including the nukes is also a Soviet legacy. So Putin is pumping extraordinary amounts of money into modernization, but most analysts agree Russia's conventional forces are still only mighty enough to project power close to its borders.</p><p>Russia also used limited air power to successfully prop up the Syrian regime. The critics say that works because of Putin's willingness to indiscriminately bomb board civilian areas, something Moscow denies. One of the bigger sources of Putin's power is his own extraordinary popularity at home. The more other world leaders criticize him, the more Russians celebrate their president. His approval figures soared with Ukraine and spiked again with Syria.</p><p>The reason, many Russians really care about their country's ability to influence world events even if it comes to sanctions and a hit to their own quality of life. They're proud of it. Putin also benefits from a political system and a media landscape with zero tolerance for criticism. So no doubt <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>is powerful and unpredictable, but he's also limited by some pretty big problems. The Russian economy isn't going anywhere. That's why there's another popular theory about Putin and his web of influence. He's someone who plays a weak hand very well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: Phil Black dissecting the power of Putin there. Now, we turn our attention to India where eyewitnesses say a New Year's celebration turned into a night of horror for women on the streets of Bangalore. Authorities released this footage of public celebrations in a busy area of the city. That is when a mob of men reportedly began sexually assaulting women. The case has sparked outrage across India. Now, CNN's Ravi Agrawal joins us with the latest on the story. He joins us from New Delhi. Ravi these disturbing reports that we've heard for days now of this mass molestation of women on New Year's eve in Bangalore, what is the latest? What exactly happened that night?</p><p>RAVI AGRAWAL, CNN NEW DELHI'S BUREAU CHIEF: Kristie, well authorities are still piecing together what exactly happened and this on live T.V. in India as millions of people are following this story. So what we know so far is two versions of events. One version comes from the photojournalists who were on the scene who say that -- and they're the ones who broke the story. They say that they saw hordes of men attacking women who were there and these were thousands of people on the streets of Bangalore partying into the night as they were ringing in the New Year and the men suddenly began attacking these women. And we've corroborated those accounts from at least one eyewitness, a male who said that he was fighting off other men from the women whom he was trying to protect. So that's one version of events.</p><p>But we have another version of events from the police which released the video that you're looking at right now, and the police say that not a single case of assault or molestation took place. They are saying that they want victims or eyewitnesses to come forward but they are yet to see any. So it really is a bizarre case Kristie where so many people have come forward to the media but not really to the police. And this as a country is extremely angry from not only this case but so many more in previous months that have given India a terrible reputation for the safety of women.</p><p>STOUT: Yeah. Just a bizarre sequence of events and very unsettling to hear the chief of police in Bangalore saying no such thing happened despite eyewitnesses saying otherwise. And even a state minister after the incident suggesting that the women who were harassed were to blame. Can you break down that logic for us?</p><p>AGRAWAL: Right, exactly. And these comments were made by the home minister of the State of Karnataka of which the City of Bangalore is the capital. And he made the statements before the police made their statements. He said this to reporters where he said that the women who were attacked were wearing western clothes. He said that they had a western mindset as well, almost as if to suggest that that could have been a reason or a justification as to why they were attacked. And those comments Kristie were really comments that made a number of people in India angry for days now. The Indian media has been covering that story and there's been outrage and that same minister today in India at a press conference where he came out and said that he didn't mean to say what the world seems to have heard and instead that his comments were misconstrued. He went on to reiterate that he has immense respect for women and the police in India are doing everything they can to try to stop these events from happening.</p><p>[08:10:08] But Kristie, this is just one in a long line of many such incidents of sexual assaults, of violence, of rape, that take place not just in the City of Bangalore but across the country, and it's an issue that is of deep concern to regular Indians and also to authorities. One thing to add though, the City of Bangalore is a city that doesn't really have a reputation for being unsafe unlike say the City of New Delhi where I am here right here now. And Bangalore is a city that is home to a number of major international tech companies that has a number of young Indians working there including women. And its reputation today Kristie is quite severely dented from this incident.</p><p>STOUT: Yeah its reputation -- yeah, certainly in the spotlight and very much dented after what we've seen and heard has happened from eyewitnesses and the strange silence or denial from officials on these events. Ravi, we'll leave it at that but thank you for your reporting. Take care.</p><p>Let's go to Israel next. A controversial mess on a verdict has pitted the prime minister against the military leadership. Now, an Israeli soldier Elor Azaria was convicted for shooting a Palestinian suspect in the head as he lay motionless on the ground. And now the Israeli Prime Minister <person><nameText>Benjamin Netanyahu </nameText></person>has joined the chorus of people calling for the soldier to be pardoned. This trial has divided Israel for months. And outside the military court, scuffles broke out as tensions boiled over. Authorities say two people were arrested. Now separately accused of trying to incite violence.</p><p>Now Oren Liebermann has been following this story. He joins us now from Jerusalem with more. The fallout after the verdict. First of all Oren, why is Mr. Netanyahu calling for a pardon?</p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, first, it's worth noting that he was one of the last politicians to make a statement here. Many even made statements before the verdict was reached saying that regardless of what happens if he's convicted he should be pardoned immediately. Most of those were right wing politicians here, but some were not. Some were left wing politicians, so the calls for a pardon have come from across the political spectrum. Again, Netanyahu was one of the last to make a statement and he issued it on Facebook. It was very delicately worded and at the end it said, \"I favor pardoning the soldier.\"</p><p>For Netanyahu, it was a very difficult position for him to be in. Any statement he makes in a sense he loses. If he backs the soldier as he did it looks like he's going against military leadership who have clearly said, no soldier is above Israel's code of ethics. Whereas if he backs the military leadership, it looks like he's going against the soldier which is supported by many of his voters. In the end he chose to back the soldier. He asked for a pardon. That process isn't -- doesn't have to be a quick process. It may take quite some time. The president of Israel who's the only one who can grant a pardon has simply said he'll consider all the factors after this process continues a little bit. There should be a sentencing in a few weeks.</p><p>STOUT: Yeah, they're asking for the pardon of their high profile protest from the prime minister. And Oren it was a video that brought the shooting incident to life. Who took the video, and is the filmmaker getting caught up in all the tension as well?</p><p>LIEBERMANN: We talked to Emad abu-Shamsiyah back when this happened. This is last March shortly after we went out to Tel Rumeida in the largely Palestinian City of Hebron and interviewed him and even then he was getting threats against his life, threats of violence against him. He says when we spoke to him earlier today, he says, they've gotten worse since the verdict, since Elor Azaria, the soldier he was convicted of both manslaughter and improper conduct.</p><p>The video was a critical part of this. Many feel that there won't have been a trial, there wouldn't have been any big issue about this without this home video shot by this Palestinian activist that was then put out by B'Tselem, a left-leaning human rights organization here, and that is why his role in this is so critical. He says he's getting -- again, he said he got death threats in the past but he says they've gotten worse in the last 24 hours or so since the verdict came down.</p><p>STOUT: Now, so there's a lot of anger being directed at, at this activist filmmaker, of course at this verdict as well. Angry protests across Israel, and yet praise from human rights groups. What are they saying about the court's decision?</p><p>LIEBERMANN: Well, human rights groups have long criticized the Israeli military. They say the military has not held its own soldiers accountable for violence against Palestinians. Many of them praised the verdict saying this is the step in the right direction but also saying this is the exception to the rule. Their criticism stands they say, because it's still the Israeli military has only held this one soldier.</p><p>Again, the exception to the rule instead of what the military does regularly. So the praise did come for the guilty verdict here. The pardon, if it comes, if it happens could change that. In fact, it can turn the entire story on its head as the military leadership and minister of defense have said, look, you have to respect not only the military code of ethics here but also the verdict from a three, three-judge military panel, a military panel here.</p><p>STOUT: Oren Liebermann reporting for us. Thank you Oren, take care.</p><p>Now police in the United States said that they have arrested four people linked to a disturbing video that was streamed live on Facebook.

You know, people just ranting about something that they think might make a headline. I know that he has mentioned Chicago, but I can't connect that with what these folks did.</p><p>YOUNG: Police say the victim was taken from the suburbs and could have been missing from anywhere between 24 and 48 hours. Officers found the victim wandering the streets in crisis Tuesday afternoon and brought him to a hospital.</p><p>DUFFIN: He's traumatized by the incident.

And several tech companies are unveiling their smart home assistance to compete with Amazon's echo line. The one copy attention of Samuel Burke. Here's more on his date with Pepper, the robot.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNNMONEY BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: I'm on a first date, with a robot. Hey there, what's your name?</p><p>PEPPER, THE ROBOT: You can call me Pepper.</p><p>BURKE: Nice to meet you Pepper.</p><p>PEPPER: Great to meet you.</p><p>BURKE: So, tell me a little bit about yourself.</p><p>PEPPER: My name is Pepper. I'm a humanoid robot and I'm 1.20 meters tall.</p><p>BURKE: Are you a boy or a girl?</p><p>PEPPER: Well, in the end I'm just a robot.</p><p>BURKE: So what do you do Pepper?</p><p>PEPPER: I like to discuss things.</p><p>BURKE: Did you vote for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>or were you more of a Hillary Clinton supporter?</p><p>PEPPER: All right.</p><p>BURKE: That wasn't a very straightforward answer. OK. So you don't want to discuss politics.</p><p>PEPPER: I don't like to talk about politics. It's a sensitive subject.</p><p>BURKE: Especially for a first date. What type of music do you like?</p><p>PEPPER: Great. I love music but don't be surprised if I dance on it. Is that OK with you?</p><p>BURKE: Oh, I love to dance.</p><p>PEPPER: Yeah! Of course.</p><p>BURKE: You're a good dancer Pepper.</p><p>PEPPER: Can I dance \"The Locomotion\"?</p><p>BURKE: Not again.</p><p>PEPPER: Sorry, I don't get it. Let's talk about something else. How is it going?</p><p>BURKE: Things are going well, but I'm really tired.</p><p>PEPPER: Go take a nap.</p><p>BURKE: Not appropriate for a first date. Can you see me?</p><p>PEPPER: I can and I love what I see.</p><p>BURKE: Oh, wow. This date is going well.</p><p>PEPPER: Would you like to take a picture with me?</p><p>BURKE: Yeah, absolutely.</p><p>PEPPER: Well, you're (inaudible) try to reboot me to fix the problem.</p><p>BURKE: That's not the first time I've had an error on a date. So the good thing about a date with a robot, if it doesn't go well, you can just replace it with another one. I have something I really need ask you. What's the meaning of life?</p><p>PEPPER: 32, of course.</p><p>BURKE: Do you believe in God?</p><p>PEPPER: I don't know, but I believe in you.</p><p>BURKE: Alexa -- wrong robot, sorry. I've been dating somebody else who also has artificial intelligence.</p><p>PEPPER: Intelligence is an appreciable quality. You look like you need a hug.</p><p>BURKE: Sorry, I called you the wrong name on our first date.</p><p>PEPPER: We're very polite, aren't we?</p><p>BURKE: We're trying. It's really nice getting to know you. Could I buy you a drink?</p><p>PEPPER: Yeah, of course.</p><p>BURKE: She's into me.</p><p>PEPPER: Let's go for a Sangria. Your drink is now being prepared. I hope you will enjoy it.</p><p>BURKE: Cheers. Cheers to you and me Pepper. You want some? Well, pepper, I've got to say that was a pretty good first date. We had some intelligent conversation. There were a couple of awkward moments, but maybe we can go for drinks again sometime.</p><p>(Off-Mic)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: Thank you. That was just -- that was awkward. That was endearing. It was very revealing about where the technology is right now. You're evidently enjoying yourself there in Las Vegas and the moment when you called poor Pepper, Alexa. Wow, I mean, that must have really broken her or his heart. But really underscores, you know, Alexa is really the big talking point there at CES, not poor Pepper.</p><p>BURKE: Absolutely, and if your viewers don't know who Alexa is, the other woman in my life. Alexa is the name you used to refer to Amazon Echo which is the speaker in your house that you just talk to. And of course, Amazon is an e-commerce company and so many people thought that the speaker wouldn't do anything and it's become huge. They sold millions of these devices and it's become a huge trend here at CES of companies trying to integrate their technology with Alexa so that you can just walk into the house and say, hey, Alexa, turn on my DVR so I can see \"News Stream\" which I have recorded on my DVR.</p><p>So we're seeing all over how voice commands have become so important and that's the whole point of my date with Pepper, not Alexa. That's the whole point through that voice commands really are the most important trend in technology right now, what all these companies are working towards, and now companies like Lenovo and Google imitating Amazon's Alexa and artificial intelligence and robots trying to use them as well.</p><p>[08:25:09] STOUT: Yeah, Alexa integration really hard to see as this year -- as you said voice command technology, Pepper, you know, she deal right there. She was OK. Another trend, phone chargers.</p><p>BURKE: Not bad.</p><p>STOUT: What have you seen there?</p><p>BURKE: Well, it's amazing to see Israel such a small country and has such a big presence here at the consumer electronics show. There's a company called StoreDot, a startup which allows you to charge a phone from zero to a 100 percent in just five minutes. We've been testing it. You see it's at 11 percent right now and probably by the end of this it will go up pretty quickly. But I've seen it do the whole gamut.</p><p>When you look further beyond just charging smart phones, you have companies like Humavox, this is also a company, it comes from Israel. There's so much technology there related to charging. They use wireless charging. Now we've heard a lot about this but they say that instead of using induction which most companies are using right now, they use radio frequency to charge. So that means if you have something like these head phones, you can just stick them in this backpack and you click a button and then you can see the thing starts to charge.</p><p>So I think that long term, this is the type of technology, the radio frequency technology that so many companies are going to be using. This company has just going to be licensing their technology to other companies. But StoreDot for example, they think that this could be on the market in some major telephones by the end of the year which thank God because we all know we have that problem where our smart phones are dead and if you could just charge it in a few minutes it would make life that much better.</p><p>STOUT: Yeah absolutely, especially when virtually all of us have multiple applications running at the same time. Now, every year there at the CES big tech show, there's always a center piece technology. Is it your sense that the Internet of things, even though that's a name we've heard again and again, year after year, it's finally taking center stage in a big way this year?</p><p>BURKE: Absolutely. And in years past, it was hard for me to make sense of a smart light bulb, for instance. Kristie I would say, why do I need a smart light bulb, I just need the light to turn on. But now that I'm a user of Amazon's echo and I walk into my house and say Alexa, turn on the lights because I'm holding grocery bags in my hand and I couldn't do it myself, then all of a sudden those smart light bulbs actually make sense.</p><p>So I think in the past it was hard to see why we needed the Internet of things and now the Internet of things is starting to make a lot of sense though, of course, hacking is a big concern. The more you connect to the internet, the more things that can be hacked, so that is on the forefront of so many people's minds here.</p><p>STOUT: All right, Samuel Burke live in Vegas for us. Thank you, and please send my regards to Pepper. Take care.</p><p>[08:27:47] You're watching \"News Stream\". Still to come in the program, South Korea sending a pretty bold message to Pyongyang.

This video is thought to show the suspect. It's believed he was the only shooter that night although Turkey's deputy prime minister says other people may have helped inside the club or as lookouts.</p><p>And now true story, CNN has followed extensively. In Pakistan, hundreds of women and some men are the targets of a heinous crime every year. They're known as so-called \"Honor Murders.\" But there is no honor in them.</p><p>In many cases, a killer may go unpunished if the victim's family forgives him or her. Blood money or compensation for their loss may even be paid, but as Alexandra Field reports, a new law aims to close this legal loophole.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For years in Pakistan, the law has let some get away with murder. Azmat Bibi say he watched her son Glumabof (ph) die, shoot in the head by the family of a woman who was accused to having affair with. Then, they killed the girl too, victims of a so-called honor killing.</p><p>AZMAT BIBI, SON DEAD IN \"HONOR\" MURDER (Through Translator): It was cruelty. This was cruelty against my son. What honor? The girl was so young. She was 13 years old.</p><p>FIELD: None of the accused went to prison. Court documents show they were legally pardoned by the families of both victims. The girl's own mother and her father who's one of the accused and Azmat Bibi too.</p><p>BIBI (Through Translator): I have placed a rock on my heart. I have to live for my other son who is alive. I can not maintain enemies.</p><p>FIELD: Azmat says, she didn't accept blood money in exchange for the pardon, but it's a common practice in Pakistan where in 2015 nearly 1,100 women and 88 men were victims of honor killings.</p><p>Now, a new law aims to change that, requiring a 25-year mandatory prison sentence for those who are convicted in cases of honor killing, making pardons no longer legal. But, there's fear the courts won't be tough enough on killers emboldened by their beliefs, committing crimes that have long been tolerated.</p><p>MOHAMMAD YASIR, BROTHER KILLED IN \"HONOR\" MURDER (Through Translator): They have confidence in their murders that they can kill and society will not be able to do anything to them.</p><p>FIELD: Mohammed Yasir's brother Hafiz Shishad Shahid (ph) was murdered along with a woman he was accused of having an affair with. A police report quotes witnesses naming her family members as the men who tied him up and slit his throat. No one was convicted from crimes.</p><p>YASIR: When I see my brother's killer on the streets, I will pray to Allah and I've ask him for justice for there is no justice in Pakistan.</p><p>FIELD: Azmat said she had no way forward but to pardon her son's killers.</p><p>BIBI (Through Translator): I will get justice from the house of god. Humans do not give justice.</p><p>FIELD: She has hope in the future Pakistan's courts can do more.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: And Alexandra Field joins me now live here in Hong Kong with more on the story. And Alex, I mean this is not quite a breakthrough but it's something. An activist welcomed this new law as a positive step forward, but what else needs to happen here to really end this terrible practice of so-called honor killings?</p><p>FIELD: Yeah, it is significant that this law was passed because previous efforts to go after honor killings through legislation have failed. So, that was certainly a success worth celebrating, but there are still a number of concerns to address here.</p><p>First and foremost is the extent to which this law will be enforced. And that means that these crimes will have to be properly identified as honor crimes in order for these mandatory sentences to kick in. But, there's really no one in Pakistan who believes that a law is going to correct a problem which is really a tradition of killing.</p><p>[08:35:05] You heard in that piece that these killings are rooted in deeply held cultural beliefs. They are rooted in beliefs that are purported to be religious. So you'll hear a lot of activist saying that there's needs to be a match wider sort of grassroots effort to educate communities about these killings, about the value of women in society promoting a greater role for women throughout society within Pakistan.</p><p>What activists are quick to point out is that this law doesn't actually create any greater protection for women and they are the ones who are disproportionately affected by these crimes. It doesn't allocate more resources for women who are being hunted by their own family members and it doesn't provide greater legal recourse for women who have survived these vicious attacks.</p><p>STOUT: You just mentioned a colossal challenge here. I mean, how do you change the tradition of killing? How common are these honor killings in today's Pakistan and are they more common in smaller more traditional communities?</p><p>FIELD: Look, it's worth pointing out that honor killings are not specific to Pakistan alone. This happened to various countries across the world. It is not specific to any one culture or to any one religion.</p><p>But, we are talking about it in Pakistan because it's happening at such an alarming rate. And it does happen across the country but it does this proportionately happen as you point out in the smaller, more rural communities, which is why activists say the grassroots efforts need to be concentrated more there.</p><p>But, you have this added layer of community which some people feel has fueled this tradition of killing because in some cases, isn't not just the family members who take it upon themselves to kill say a sister, a daughter, a wife or a mother. In some cases, these murders are actually ordered by a tribal council that exists within that community.</p><p>The woman who you heard from in that piece, the mother who's son was killed. She tells us that her son's accused killers lived a few doorsteps away from her own home which is one of the reasons why she says she felt this pressure somewhat from the community to pardon her son's accused killers.</p><p>She said she real had no other hope for justice. So, there is a strong consensus from activists that these communities need to be reached and targeted in order to put an end to this practice.</p><p>STOUT: Absolutely. It's such a sickening practice. It must be stopped, and we appreciate your reporting on the matter. Alexandra Field there, thank you.</p><p>Now, gradually changing the laws to an honor murder is one fascination of all of this. And there's also caring for those who right now are being threatened by the practice. A little bit later Alex will be introducing us to a woman who fled her family rather than to be forced into marriage and takes us into the shelter that's providing refuge for her.</p><p>You could see that coming up on \"Connect the World\" that starting in about 90 minutes only here on CNN.</p><p>Now this just into CNN.

You're watching News Stream.</p><p>Still ahead on the program, Beijing, it remains under a cloud of smog. What is causing the haze, and what when is it going to lift? Stay with us.</p><p>STOUT: Welcome back. Now, a haze of smog continues to hover over parts of China. Now, weather officials have renewed alerts for air pollution as well as fog in several northern and eastern regions.</p><p>[08:40:03] And there on your screen, you could see from this video just how thick and choking the smog is. Now, it has caused flight cancellations. It's shut down some highways. Winter is typically the most polluted season in China when the country burns more coal to generate heat.</p><p>Now turning to the Korean peninsula, South Korea is speeding up a plan to create a special brigade with one very specific target in mind, Kim Jong- un. On then it's mission, to remove or paralyze the North Korean leadership in the event of war.</p><p>Andrew Stevens has more from Seoul.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNNMONEY ASIA-PACIFIC EDITOR: Another clear stick in the rising tensions between North and South Korea coming out of Seoul today. When the defense ministry said that they were bringing forward a program to develop a unit, which would be basically capable of taking out the key leadership of North Korea in the event of war being declared on the peninsula.</p><p>South Korea saying, that these units are brigade strong units will be in operation by the end of this year. Earlier they said that they were putting together this unit, but it wouldn't be operational until the end of 2019. But they are moving forward on that now.</p><p>We don't know a lot of the details at this stage. It will be armed with cutting edge hardware both in armory and in transport and in telecommunications. And its mode will be to infiltrate North Korea, take out key command and control leadership which would include Kim Jong-un and also secure weapons of mass destruction, WMD sites.</p><p>The timing of this coming from North -- from South Korea is interesting. It comes just a few days after Kim Jong-un said that his country was in the final preparation of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile. It also comes just a couple of weeks after local television in North Korea showed pictures of north Korean troops storming a mock-up of the Blue Palace, which is actually the presidential palace here in South Korea.</p><p>Some critics though are saying that this news from South Korea is hoping. At least the government hopes, the President hopes will divert attention away from her own corruption problems. President Park Geun-hye are facing an impeachment trial and some say that this is one way to deflect the gaze away from that. But whatever it is, one thing for certain, tensions in the Korean peninsula continue to rise.</p><p>Andrew Stevens, CNN, Seoul.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: It's been almost a year after a Google computer beat a top human player at the complicated board game of Go and AlphaGo, the name of the AI has struck again. This time in a rather mysterious way, over the last few days online Go players have been noticing a newcomer that calls itself master. Master has racked up dozens of wins including one against the world's number one player Chinese Kuja.</p><p>And now finally the CEO of Google DeepMind confirms the secret player is indeed a brand new version of AlphaGo an AI. And that is \"News Stream.\" I'm Kristie Lu Stout. We've got World Sports and Alex Thomas coming up next.</p><p>[08:45:26] ALEX THOMAS, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Hello. Welcome to \"CNN World Sport.\" I'm Alex Thomas in London.</p><p>Tottenham Hotspur have ended Chelsea's record wining streak bringing England's Premier League title race back to life and making it one of the tightest and best in the competitions history.</p><p>Coming off the back of two thumping away wins over the holiday period, spurs showed they were just as effective at home. Dele Alli given far too much space by Chelsea as he headed Tottenham ahead just before halftime. After 13 victories in a row Chelsea had been threatening to run away from the chasing pack but another headed goal here from Ali in the second half, and then Antonio Conte's men their first loss in the league since September.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANTONIO CONTE, CHELSEA COACH: We are disappointed, but also think that we must be pleased for our run to win 13 games in a row is not easy in this league. And also today we lost against a good team, a really strong team.</p><p>MAURICIO POCHETTINO, TOTTENHAM MANAGER: So, I think it's important -- it was important for us for loosing that. I think its top 40 is a very competitive is very close, we have closed the gap is team is important for Chelsea, but I think it was a bit a perfect thing for us to do arrive in to the third place and very close.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THOMAS: My always colleague Christina Macfarlane has been all over the premier league this week and joins us again now. It's mouth-watering for me, for the neutrals. What's the Premier League title race from your point of view?</p><p>CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN WORLD SPORT: Well, I'm really exciting. Let's take it. This part of the season Chelsea back within reach and the title race back on for the top six. You know, it's quite interesting because when you look at last season the Leicester were emerging ahead of the pack at this point in the season. But right now after 20 games, it does feel far more competitive.</p><p>Let's have a look at the table here. And you can see now that just ten points separate the Top 6. Interestingly though at this point last season we were in exactly the same situation. Ten points separating the Top 6 with Arsenal at the top on 42. West Ham at the bottom on 32, and the season before that, Alex was only eight points separating in the top six.</p><p>So this is not an anomaly, but what is different however, this season is that the point tally is so much higher. Chelsea out there ahead on 49 compared to Arsenal, as you see to stand on 42. What they showed of course is that these the top six teams are in such flux last season have regrouped and they have emerged much stronger. So even Chelsea with the five-point buffer at the moment isn't guaranteed success with the level that the teams are playing at this season.</p><p>THOMAS: Christina Macfarlane with a thrilling Premier League title rates. Thanks Christina. Let's move on to tennis. Because it's not just Roger Federer and Serena Williams needing to shake off some rust before the first grand slam tournament of the new season.</p><p>Well Federer and Williams lost on Wednesday, Angelique Kerber and Dominika Cibulkova the top two seeds are out of the Brisbane International one of those Australian open warm up events. Kerber's lost is perhaps the most interesting. She holds the world number one spot that Serena Williams would love to have back. And the German made 48 unforced errors as she slip to a three set defeat by Elina Svitolina. Cibulkova's tournament ended by France's Alize Cornet 6-3, 7-5.</p><p>Let's get more on this with tennis legend, Chris Everett winner of Austrian Open in 1982 and 1984. Two of 18 grand slam single titles, she still holds the records for highest winning percentage in pro tennis history. And that just scratches the surface of your achievement in the game, Chris we'll be here for the next 15 and 20 minutes. I better get to my question. Lovely to speak to you live from Florida.</p><p>CHRIS EVERT, TENNIS PLAYER: Thank you.</p><p>THOMAS: And I presume when you see the shock defeats we're hearing about from the other side of the world. You know not that surprise because it's so early in the season.</p><p>EVERT: Yeah. It's not a shock unless it would happen in the Australian Open. You know I think that's really, these tournaments are tournaments to really prepare yourself. It is the first tournament of the year. So I think it shows that, you know these players are probably playing their way into the Australian open. I think that's the big target where they want to do well, but I think it also shows that the competition is so close and that's the beauty of especially women's tennis right now.</p><p>THOMAS: Yeah. You're talking about the close competition. That Kerber/Williams rivalry is absolutely fascinating. How important is it to the women's game in general to see that?</p><p>EVERT: You know rivalries make the sport, you know. I think that when I think back of my rivalry with Martina, we just -- we played over 80 times.</p><p>[08:50:04] And it became something that people wanted to turn on the TV and watch. They wanted to see the outcome, it was so close. And I think rivalries, especially if there's a contrast and style like Kerber and Serena. A contrast in personalities. I think it makes it for, you know a really interesting TV and drama. So on there I'm really happy that finally somebody has stepped up to challenge Serena Williams. And it is Angelique Kerber.</p><p>THOMAS: How interesting for to you talk about a difference in styles. You look at someone in the men's game like Nick Kyrgios who has certainly got a different style to the rest. I mean, you were famous for being pretty sporting on the court. How much do you think just keeping your cool helps you get results at the top level of the game?</p><p>EVERT: Well, for me because if you look at me I'm not the athlete that, you know Martina was or Steffi was. I didn't have the strength that they had. I didn't move as quickly as they did, you know. I'm not undermining my athletic ability, but I wasn't, you know I wasn't up at their level.</p><p>So I feel like I made up for it in the mental department. You know I stayed cool under pressure. I played every point like it was match point. And it worked for me, but not everybody can do that. Look at John McEnroe. He used to get upset all the time, but he would get upset and then he would get back to the next point and it would be forgotten. So, you know everybody sort has to go along their own personality.</p><p>THOMAS: Can you blame the pressure on young players today if they got it harder? Would you like to be starting out in the game today?</p><p>EVERT: I think the game is, you know I think the game right now is bigger business. There's more money. There's more media. There's social media which, you know, you can't do anything in private anymore. Everybody knows everything about your life. I think that adds more pressure, you know. The players travel with entourages of trainers and coaches and agents. And we didn't have that in our day, you know. It was there was less pressure for sure. So and to answer your question, yeah, I think there is more pressure.</p><p>THOMAS: Sounds like you're from the golden heyday, Chris. That's the way we all remember fondly.</p><p>EVERT: Yes.</p><p>THOMAS: Tell us what you're up to today in Orlando, Florida.</p><p>EVERT: Yes.</p><p>THOMAS: I know that America's desperate for the next big tennis star to come through.</p><p>EVERT: You know, I'm in Orlando at the USTA National Campus. And it's a phenomenal facility. It's a 100 courts, 64 acres. It really, you know will help players at every level. From professional players who come here and want to train hard, to young kids who are around and around the country.</p><p>It's going to help players with disabilities. It's going to help recreational players, college players, under resourced kids. The USTA's bringing in to help. And so, it's really helping and reaching out to players at every level. And I think it's going to be the tennis Mecca of the United States right now.</p><p>THOMAS: Sounds like a fantastic facility and a fantastic fun speaking to a legend of tennis. Chris Evert, really appreciate your time here on CNN. Many thanks.</p><p>EVERT: Thank you.</p><p>THOMAS: The first PGA Tour event, at 2017 tees off later in Hawaii. Tiger Woods is not there, but he has announced when he'll be back in action.</p><p>[08:55:25] THOMAS: Hello again. \"World Sport\" is back with the NBA and Greek forward Giannis Antetokounmpo is making quite a name for himself. He's only 22 and in his fourth season in the league, but he's the first Milwaukee Bucks player for more than a decade to post 20 or more points for 13 straight games. His 16th double-double of the season that's points and assist coming against the New York Knicks on Wednesday night.</p><p>And on one of the biggest stages there is, Madison Square Garden. He came up with the buzzer-beater for his first ever walk off game-winning shot. He loved it and so did his teammates and the fans. Bucks taking this 105- 104.</p><p>Golf PGA tour is back. 2017 is opening a big, big tournament of champions in Hawaii, a32-man field of the winners from the 2016 season. Six of the world's top ten are there including Jordan Spieth last year has been described as a disappointing one for the young American. Although he still won three times and helped his nation regain the Ryder Cup. However, he admits his goals are even higher for the next 12 months.</p><p>JORDAN SPIETH, CURRENTLY 5TH in WORLD GOLF RANKINGS: I was happy when the ball touched down and 2017 started. It was still a great year in '16, but I learned a lot on both ends of things highs and lows which I didn't really have many lows in '15. And before that it was just trying to, to climb up to the top level. So I learned a lot from the highs and lows and therefore I think I can use that to my advantage this year and on.</p><p>THOMAS: No Tiger Woods in Hawaii, but after the return to the competitive action to the hero's challenge last month he has announced when we'll see him back on the course in 2017. So we can see glance with the Farmers Insurance Open at and totally flies in California in the last week of January. And head to the Middle East (inaudible) appearance to the Dubai Desert Classic back across the Atlantic Genesis Open, and Honda Classic and the Arnold Palmer invitational in March.</p><p>We'll see Tiger then. That's it for \"World Sports.\" Thanks for watching. See you again soon. Bye-bye.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2017010501cbk31</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MJP-MFC1-JB20-G2J0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"01\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>January 5, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That change, in particular, could expose big technology companies to a flurry of lawsuits. The Federal Communications Commission has been directed to modify how section 230 is implemented. Couching the order in this way means the president does not require congressional approval, although it is likely that the change would be subject to legal challenge.</p><p>Mr Trump's sudden push to remould the regulation of social media came soon after Twitter warned its users, for the first time, that two of his posts were inaccurate: after suffering years of criticism over the president's use of the platform, it added an alert to two of his tweets on Tuesday night in which Mr Trump claimed that postal voting would lead to a fraudulent election. Twitter advised readers to \"get the facts\" elsewhere - provoking a furious response from the president.</p><p>\"Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 election,\" he told his 80 million Twitter followers on Wednesday night. \"If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!\" Section 230 has long been controversial on both sides of the political divide. Introduced in 1996, it allows internet companies to moderate their sites without being legally responsible for everything they leave online. It is not a blanket protection from responsibility for users who post, for example, child sex abuse material or violate intellectual property, but hate speech is generally allowed.</p><p>Republicans have argued that technology companies who ban or censor conservative users are violating the spirit of the law, which is to allow diversity of opinion to flourish on the internet. Democrats say that the law enables internet companies to make positive noises about cracking down on abuse and harassment while knowing that they have ultimate protection from legal consequences.</p><p>In January Joe Biden told The New York Times that section 230 \"should be revoked immediately \u2026 for Zuckerberg and other platforms\". Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesman, responded: \"Section 230 obviously benefits not just Facebook. It's not just foundational to the internet, it's what allows The New York Times to host reader comments on their websites.\"</p><p>Mr Trump is likely to have strong Republican support in Congress. Ted Cruz, the Texas senator who Mr Trump once labelled \"Lyin' Ted\", declared that \"big tech is the single biggest threat facing our democracy\". He said: \"We know in 2016 social media companies had an outsized role in influencing our presidential election. We need to take action now to curtail that influence.\"</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, told Fox News that he had a different policy from that of Twitter. \"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,\" he said.</p><p>But, is it decent? Social media companies in the US are generally protected from legal responsibility for posts on their platforms by section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that predates big social media. It in effect extends to every website the ability to moderate content posted by its users, while exempting them from legal challenge for what they decide to leave up, with limited exceptions. President Trump's draft order asks the Federal Communications Commission to consider whether social media companies that edit content posted by users should forfeit their protections, potentially leaving them open to a stream of lawsuits. By asking the government agency to consider reinterpreting existing law, the president can circumvent Congress.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-160319996</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-JMP1-DYTY-C1JC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That change, in particular, could expose big technology companies to a flurry of lawsuits. The Federal Communications Commission has been directed to modify how section 230 is implemented. Couching the order in this way means the president does not require congressional approval, although it is likely that the change would be subject to legal challenge.</p><p>Mr Trump's sudden push to remould the regulation of social media came soon after Twitter warned its users, for the first time, that two of his posts were inaccurate: after suffering years of criticism over the president's use of the platform, it added an alert to two of his tweets on Tuesday night in which Mr Trump claimed that postal voting would lead to a fraudulent election. Twitter advised readers to \"get the facts\" elsewhere - provoking a furious response from the president.</p><p>\"Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 election,\" he told his 80 million Twitter followers on Wednesday night. \"If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!\" Section 230 has long been controversial on both sides of the political divide. Introduced in 1996, it allows internet companies to moderate their sites without being legally responsible for everything they leave online. It is not a blanket protection from responsibility for users who post, for example, child sex abuse material or violate intellectual property, but hate speech is generally allowed.</p><p>Republicans have argued that technology companies who ban or censor conservative users are violating the spirit of the law, which is to allow diversity of opinion to flourish on the internet. Democrats say that the law enables internet companies to make positive noises about cracking down on abuse and harassment while knowing that they have ultimate protection from legal consequences.</p><p>In January Joe Biden told The New York Times that section 230 \"should be revoked immediately \u2026 for Zuckerberg and other platforms\". Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesman, responded: \"Section 230 obviously benefits not just Facebook. It's not just foundational to the internet, it's what allows The New York Times to host reader comments on their websites.\"</p><p>Mr Trump is likely to have strong Republican support in Congress. Ted Cruz, the Texas senator who Mr Trump once labelled \"Lyin' Ted\", declared that \"big tech is the single biggest threat facing our democracy\". He said: \"We know in 2016 social media companies had an outsized role in influencing our presidential election. We need to take action now to curtail that influence.\"</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, told Fox News that he had a different policy from that of Twitter. \"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,\" he said.</p><p>But, is it decent? Social media companies in the US are generally protected from legal responsibility for posts on their platforms by section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that predates big social media. It in effect extends to every website the ability to moderate content posted by its users, while exempting them from legal challenge for what they decide to leave up, with limited exceptions. President Trump's draft order asks the Federal Communications Commission to consider whether social media companies that edit content posted by users should forfeit their protections, potentially leaving them open to a stream of lawsuits. By asking the government agency to consider reinterpreting existing law, the president can circumvent Congress.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-160311617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-JMP1-DYTY-C1PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Trump is expected to sign an executive order stripping social media giants of their platform protection, turning them into publishers, which is, after all, what they have become.Support Free Speech: Subscribe to The Duran on YouTube[1]-Find us on BitChute.[2] The Duran Audio Podcast: Follow on Soundcloud[3]-Subscribe on iTunes.[4][embedded content]Via Fox News[5] Facebook[6]CEOMark Zuckerberg[7]hascalled out Twitterfor attaching afact check[8]to a tweet from President Trump, telling Fox News' Dana Perino that privately-owned digital platforms should not act as the 'arbiter of truth.' 'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,' Zuckerberg told'The Daily Briefing'[9]inan interview scheduled to air in fullon Thursday. 'I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,' he added. </p><p>'Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.' 'I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.' \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg, 'The Daily Briefing' Zuckerberg made the comment afterPresident Trump warned social media giants[10]that the federal government could 'strongly regulate' or 'close them down' if they continue to 'silence conservative voices.' 'I have to understand what they actually would intend to do,' Zuckerberg said in response to the president's warning.'But ingeneral, I think a government choosing to to censor a platform because they're worried about censorship doesn't exactly strike me as the the right reflex there.' Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey responded late Wednesday, saying: 'We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make.Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me. Please leave our employees out of this. We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make. \u2014 jack (@jack) May 28, 2020[11]Per our Civic Integrity policy (<url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co\">https://t.co</url> /uQ0AoPtoCm[12]), the tweets yesterday may mislead people into thinking they don't need to register to get a ballot (only registered voters receive ballots). We're updating the link on @realDonaldTrump[13]'s tweet to make this more clear. \u2014 jack (@jack) May 28, 2020[14] 'This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth',' Dorsey continued. 'Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions.' On Tuesday, Twitter slapped a fact check notificationon one of Trump'stweets for the first time, cautioning users that despite the president's claims about mail-in voting, 'fact checkers' say there is 'no evidence' that mail-in voting would increase fraud risks and that 'experts say mail-in ballots are very rarely linked to voter fraud. Facebook has faced criticism in the pastfor failing to address controversial content on the platform, but it appears Zuckerberg has no plans to change company policy. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg expressed a similar sentiment during a 2017 CNBC interview, asserting that the tech giant does not intend 'to be the publisher and we definitely don't want to be the arbiter of the truth.' 'We don't think that's appropriate for us,' Sandberg said at the time.Liked  it?

But hey we're in  the green right now, up 43 points there off the highs of the session.  We  had been down earlier in the session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome to the Intelligence Report.</p><p>The President speaking to Republican law makers that their annual retreat  there in West Virginia at the Greenbrier just a short time ago and he  praise the Republicans for passing tax reform, pretty big deal but he is  warning that Republicans must work with Democrats to get any kind of  comprehensive immigration reform past, can they get it done?</p><p>We are asking Assistant to President Mercedes Schlapp.  Plus, the  classified FISA memo detailing possible abuses at the Justice Department  maybe release tomorrow and of course, you have the left are arguing against  the release saying there will be national security risks if this memo  becomes public.</p><p>But, Judge Napolitano, he is not buying that one bit.  He is here and he is  going to explain why.  We need to let the American public decide for  themselves.  That is happening in just a few minutes.</p><p>But first, let's go to Adam Shapiro, he is in West Virginia there where a  short time ago the President delivered what I would call a powerful America  First speech.  Hi, Adam.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDEN:  Yes.  Well, he is always America  First, Trish and this was no different.  He spoke to the Republicans  gathered here in West Virginia, talking about tax reform, talking about  immigration reform, talking about infrastructure.</p><p>But it was specifically his message to Democrats saying that the  administration and Republicans will continue to attempt to pass bipartisan  legislation but they have to be met in the middle and it doesn't appear  according to the President that Democrats want to do that.  He cited the  fact that he is offered a path to citizenship for 1.8 million people who  have come to the United States illegally.  And he says the Democrats that  he did this to see if the Democrats were serious about using immigration to  solve this problem or using immigration reform as political point.  Here is  what he said specifically about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They talk a good game  with DACA but they don't produce.  And so either they come on board, or  we'll just going to really work and we're going to get more people so we  can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass in a much easier fashion  legislation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Now he also talked about the result of the successful tax reform  and pointing out that it has put $2,000 on average back into the pockets of  regular people not only here in West Virginia but across the country.</p><p>There is the issue that the first $24,000 of income for a married couple is  no longer taxed to the federal level.  So that's just part of the message.   But then, he went on the attack against Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader  in the House, pointing out that when she calls the bonuses, that companies  have announced for their employees, the $1000 bonus, which she calls that  crumbs, that she is missing the point.</p><p>Here is the President in his own words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Nancy Pelosi called crumbs.  That was a bad -- that could be like  deplorable?  Does that make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words  they seem to have a resemblance.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  And so the President is now on his way back to Washington.   Trish?</p><p>REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Adam.</p><p>Joining me right now with reaction, White House Senior Advisor for  Strategic Communications and Assistant to the President, Mercedes Schlapp.   Good to see you, Mercedes.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC  COMMUNICATIONS  AND ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT:  Hi, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, he laid out an agenda.  He did so in the State of the  Union the other night and immigration reform is a big part of it.  But it  doesn't sound like the Democrats are willing to give you guys an inch on  this.  So how are you going to get past that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, clearly, it seems that the Democrats want to make  immigration reform a political wedge issue and not be serious about solving  -- </p><p>REGAN:  Oh, it looks like we may have lost Mercedes Schlapp.  We'll try and  get her back momentarily.  But as she was saying it's become increasing a  political wedge issue.  And that's one of the problems here because, you  know, as far as Democrats go, I don't know how they're going to go out  there and look at their constituents and look at their base and say, well,  you know, the President, he offered a deal for 1.8 million Americans to  have some form of legitimacy, in fact citizenship but we turned it down  because you know what?  We're not going to have that wall and we're going  to let him end chain migration, and we're not going to let him end the  lottery program.</p><p>How does that make any sense?  They want to send all these people out of  the country when the President is willing to give a deal?  I mean  politically-speaking it looks as though the Republicans have upper side on  this one.</p><p>Joining me right now with more context, Republican Strategist, Ford  O'Connell and Democratic Strategist Hamza Khan.</p><p>Good to see you guys.</p><p>FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good to see you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  Ford, I'll start with you.  And again, we're going to try and get  Mercedes back with us.  It looks like the satellite feed went down.</p><p>But Ford, just the politics here, and I understand there are members of the  President's base that don't like the idea of extending citizenship to all  these people but he is putting forth a deal.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  He is -- </p><p>REGAN:  And if the Democrats don't go along with it, then they're going to  deport all of these individuals?</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Well look, what the President is proposing is what many -- 54  Senate Democrats agreed to in 2013, which is a border fence, ending the  diversity visa lottery program and putting curbs on chain migration.  And  essentially 65 percent of Americans in the latest Harvard-Harris Poll agree  with the President's position.</p><p>He is trying to make a deal.  Unfortunately, Democrats are going to  continue to basically resist, obstruct, and sit on their hands.  It's  really an unfortunate situation because President Trump is absolutely  right.  We going to build on that powerful State of the Union continue so  in the tax bill and deliver for the American people on immigration and  infrastructure.</p><p>REGAN:  Hamza, the Democrats are going to have tough a tough time if  economy the continue doing as well as it's been doing.  What do you think  it's going to happens in '18?</p><p>HAMZA KHAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, first of all, let's talk about  the economy for a second.  The current tax bill that was put through  Congress really quickly and is become law now has only benefited about two  percent of all Americans.  Only 1.94 percent of Americans have gotten any  sort of bonus from their jobs, resulting from the tax cuts, whatsoever.</p><p>REGAN:  You know it just happened.</p><p>KHAN:  It just happened, the only two percent and so quickly.  I mean,  we've been talking all the time about how great this tax is going to be for  the American people.  It hasn't trickled down to anyone.  It seems to me a  trickle up.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's only been in place for a few weeks.  And by the way,  starting tomorrow, Americans are going to be getting raises as a result of  this, more money coming back to them in their paychecks.  So -- </p><p>KHAN:  Well, let's see if that really comes out.</p><p>REGAN:  I guess that argument only going to hold for, you know -- </p><p>KHAN:  We'll see if it really gets beyond the margins and it's starting  tomorrow since you seem to think that tomorrow we'll going to see some pay  cuts coming back into people's -- </p><p>REGAN:  I mean -- OK.  Hang on Ford.  I want to keep going, Hamza.  I want  to hear the rest of why you say our economy is not doing well now?</p><p>KHAN:  Well, we got a lot of reasons why the economy is not doing well.  A  Fox poll just show, it just point out 71 percent of the Americans are  concerned about the economy still, that's what President Trump being in  office for a whole year.  On top of that, even though President Trump seems  to keep taking credit for President Obama's work on economy, we've seen  that the job growth in the last 12 months slow, rather than increase.  So  I'm not really sure what Donald Trump -- </p><p>REGAN:  Can I stop you.  And Ford, I'm going to get you in here in just a  second.  But you think that the upside we're seeing in terms of GDP growth  right now is a result of President Obama?  You think that the 26,000 on the  Dow right now is a result of President Obama?</p><p>KHAN:  President Obama made sure that our economy is growing for both Wall  Street and Main Street.  So I can tell you for a fact, everything we're  seeing right now is things to Barack Hussein Obama.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  And I can tell you for a fact that he had absolutely nothing  to do with growing the fundamentals in the economy.  And I can tell you for  a fact that Janet Yellen did.  Because when you print out much money you  see a little bit of bump up in the stock market.  But until you actually  have meaningful policy reform nothing happens fundamentally with overall  economic growth.  It wasn't until we got word of the tax cuts that things  really started to take off.  And that rumor got built into the market.  And  that optimism got fell into GDP.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do -- </p><p>REGAN:  Hang on.  Let Ford get in.  Go ahead, Ford.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do what Nancy Pelosi is doing and saying  the three million people getting raises is crumbs, let me tell you  something the Republicans are going to hold the House in 2018.  And to  Trish's point, look, unemployment at a 17-year low, consumer confidence and  small business confidence is through the roof.  And the reason why that is,  is because of optimism based on tax bill which has had a 20-point swing  over the last month, and deregulation policies put in by the Trump  administration, which are basically cut regulations on a 22 to one clip.   It was regulation that was stifling the American economy.  And it's  deregulation that essentially put us near three percent in GDP and  hopefully with the tax bill it will put us near four.  And frankly if you  guys want to keep touting that Obama did all of this, I promise you we're  going to hold the House -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KHAN:  I mean, you can promise what you want, but the polls are showing  right now the Democrats in the best position ever to take back the House.   And on top of that --</p><p>O'CONNELL:  No, they're not.  Actually, I'm going to now rebut you.</p><p>KHAN:  Hey, you can rebut me, but let me get to my point here, even within  the Republican Party there is no clear step going forward on how they're  going to get immigration reform through the House right now and through the  Senate on top of that.  And that's actually on front page of \"Politico\" as  I recall from today.</p><p>On top of that, only two percent --</p><p>REGAN:  So you're going to send all those people home because you won't end  chain migration.</p><p>KHAN:  Yes, I'm not sure if it's right for you to be going off about chain  migration.  We have a lot of great Americans who came here from every part  of the country.  And then, you yourself, Trish, called those 1.8 million  people a few years ago, to be Americans.  Therefore, why are we negotiating  about their right to be in their own country?  I'm just using your own  words.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's just stop you there.  Because what you are saying because  you're not going to allow him to end chain migration and you're not going  to allow him to end the lottery program, instead of by the way, one would  think you want to be strategic who comes here, but if you don't allow him  to end those things, then you're going to take 1.8 million people and send  them away?  I mean, Hamza, I don't know how you're going to explain that  one to your base?</p><p>KHAN:  Let me do this, Trish.  Do you think it's a good optic for the  Republican Party to be trying to send 1.8 million back to some other part  of the world that they have never actually been to.</p><p>REGAN:  Ah, so that's what it is.</p><p>KHAN:  We have so many innocent people in this country -- </p><p>REGAN:  That is what it is.  That is what it is.  You want to make it look,  as though the President -- OK, this feeds your narrative because if the  economy is doing as well as it has been doing, if it is growing at four  percent as CEO of JPMorgan suggests it will, a Democrat by the way, well  then, you will going to have nothing to run on except that he is the  bogeyman.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  That's exactly -- </p><p>KHAN:  Well, he is the bogeyman.  There is no argument there.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  No, he is not the bogeyman, Hamza.</p><p>KHAN:  Yes, he is the bogeyman.  He is going after people in our country  simply because they don't have the right color passport.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, I got to wrap it up there.  It is good to talk to you  both.  But I want to get back to Mercedes who is at the White House.  Thank  you so much, Hamza, spirited discussion, and Ford O'Connell.</p><p>Mercedes, you heard what Hamza was saying, I mean, I question whether they  are almost deliberately doing this, right?  Because they kind of like the  optics of the President deporting people, it feeds the narrative that  somehow big, bad, Donald Trump is going go knocking on everyone's door and  send kids home to Mexico or wherever else they may be from, and that upsets  people.  And people have an emotional reaction to that, therefore getting  out vote for the base.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  The Democrat party's platform right now is that of obstruction.   They don't want the President to succeed.  They are actually bitter because  of his success.  I mean, it's very clear that the President is trying his  best to work with both parties, to work with both the House and the Senate.   He is the one that has taken the lead on immigration reform.  He is the one  that's saying, I want permanent and compassionate solution to DACA  recipients.  At the same time he wants to protect Americans.  And that  means securing our border.  That means proposing a 25 billion-dollar trust  fund that would insure that we would have -- not only the physical barrier  but the personal and the technology needed in order to make sure that we're  able to control what's happening on the border.</p><p>I mean, we have to understand that through borders where we're seeing drugs  coming through.  There are individuals who are coming to the United States,  part of the MS-13 gang.  I mean they are -- and guess what?  Those MS-13  gang members they end up in communities that are primarily Latino or  African-American.  So we have to insure that there is safety along our  border.</p><p>And so I think for the President, what he is doing is, he is saying, let's  work together.  I'm extending my hand over to the Democrats.  Let's get to  a good point where we find a permanent solution to DACA as well as secure  the border.  And it is where mainstream America is at.  I mean -- </p><p>REGAN:  And by the way, you used to work with the Democrats right,  Mercedes.  I mean, we're going through the historical record, going back to  2006, you had Barack Obama -- Senator Barack Obama, you had Chuck Schumer,  you had -- forgive me, you had Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, I believe,  here we go here is the whole list.  Forgive me.  Joe Biden, all saying we  needed a fence.  They called it a fence as opposed to a wall back then in  2006.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you know who else agreed on ending chain migration?  It was  actually Feinstein, it was Schumer, it was all part of the \"gang of six\" or  eight, you know, that came out during the Senate in 2013.  There were  plenty of Democrats who agreed that there was a need to end chain  migration, end the diversity visa lottery program.  So there is a lot more  bipartisan room to grow there.  And I think the President is saying let's  just get a solution done, for the sake of DACA recipients, for the sake of  Americans, let's get to a point where we have a generous compromise and  really get this done.  The question will become, are Democrats simply going  to play politics.  Are they will to be come up with a true solution that  would benefit DACA recipients as well as insure we secure our border?</p><p>REGAN:  I think he might be able to get it done, really.  I mean, tax  reform went through.  And by the way, you heard our Democratic strategist  say this growing economy, booming economy has nothing to do with the  President.  All Barack Obama.  But that's what you're fighting?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It was -- I don't know what planet he is living on.  But I can  just tell you that what we are seeing in terms of business confidence,  consumer confidence, when you just look at the deregulation alone and the  impact it had on our economy, that it is having on small business growth it  is impactful.  And for the President, it is not just, you know, we're  seeing the paycheck increases and the fact that average families, you're  going to see raises in their income, close to $4,000 a year.  That is  impactful.</p><p>And for Speaker Pelosi to call that crumbs, it just shows how elite and out  of touch she is with where every day Americans are.  And it's incredibly  unfortunate because what President Trump understands is the pulse of the  American people.  He understands the need of these families and the fact  that they are ones that should have money in their pockets for their  family.  And that at the end of the day, America is open for business, that  we can create jobs and keep our economy growing.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's keep it up, the Dow 26,170.  Mercedes Schlapp, thank you very  much.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thank you very much.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, new developments everyone on the controversial  surveillance memo alleging abuses at the Justice Department, sources  telling Fox News, the President will declassify and release the memo to the  public.  We have all the Intel for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, new developments surrounding the controversial  memo on alleged surveillance abuses at the Justice Department.  Sources  telling Fox that President Trump will declassify that memo tomorrow despite  pleas from the FBI to keep it under wraps.  For more, let's go to our own  Blake Burman, who is at the White House.  Hi, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Trish.  And the White  House now publicly acknowledging that President Trump has indeed read this  four-page memo.  The President did not mention it or his decision at all  just within the past hour or so as he addressed congressional Republicans  in West Virginia.</p><p>The President now on his way back here to the White House.  And according  to sources the President is expected to declassify the memo.  It would then  be sent back, we were told, according to sources, back up to the Hill.  At  which point the House Intelligence Committee would get it.  And it is  believed at this point the likely timing is that it could be released at  some point by tomorrow morning.</p><p>One of the top Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, Peter King,  and he called this memo, just a little while ago, vital.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER KING (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN:  I don't want to oversell it.  I  agree with Trey Gowdy.  I think Republicans sometimes make a mistake of  oversell things.  But I'm going to say, this is vital, it's essentially to  the public to say and it's certainly important in the body of evidence to  be out there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Democrats have been fighting this memo, some on the House  Intelligence Committee on the Democratic side as well trying to produce  their memo.  The lead Democrat is Adam Schiff, and he said just a little  while ago that this memo is the Republican attempt to tar the Department of  Justice and the FBI.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM SCHIFF (D), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I think the FBI is exactly  right.  This memo is really a spin on a -- not just a set of particular  documents but broader classified information than that.  That because of  serious and material omissions is inaccurate and gives a very misleading  impression.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Schiff is also involved, Trish, in another battle right now, about  this memo as he says there were material changes made to it by the  Republicans, led by Devin Nunes and his committee members, however a  spokesperson for Nunes saying that it is a bizarre distraction that Schiff  is now engaging in, and that they were not material changes, and said  rather grammatical fixes and changes that Democrats and FBI wanted to see.   Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Blake Burman.</p><p>Joining me right now is Fox News Legal Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>And Judge, you say that this thing needs to be declassified ASAP.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I absolutely do.  I  actually want more than just this declassified because I want to see  Congressman Schiff's version of the raw intelligence data as well.</p><p>So here is how it happens.  The Republican staff members, not members of  the committee have top secret security clearances.  And they can see the  raw Intel, raw Intel is, transcripts of telephone conversations, copies of  text messages, copies of emails between and among Justice Department  figures and FBI agents, the last year of President Obama's administration  and first year of President Trump's administration.  From that, the  Republican staff concluded that there was a serious abuse of FISA  authorities.  There was spying that should not have occurred.  And there  was spying done for political purposes.  Congressman Schiff and his team  have looked at the same data and said there are no such abuses here.  So  not only do I want to see both memos, I want to see the raw data memos are  based.</p><p>REGAN:  Look, you may not be able to see the raw data because that would be  a security compromise.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Unless we just whited out the names of sources and certain  other information.  We can certainly see the texts and the emails and phone  conversations without knowing from whom they came because the American  public needs to know, who broke the law with the authority we gave them?   Who knew about the law being broken?  Who looked the other way?</p><p>Trish, these FISA abuses were known to the committee for the past eight  months.  They sat on it, until after FISA was extended by the Congress and  signed by the President.  They released it the next day.  Congress should  have had an opportunity to look at this stuff before it ignorantly voted to  extend FISA.</p><p>REGAN:  But, you know, I hear what you're saying because the problem right  now is we're in such a polarized political environment.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We are.</p><p>REGAN:  But the Republicans have one version of facts and the Democrats  have another version of these facts or interpretation I should say, that  you want people to be able to tell for themselves.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And as a journalist I want to be able to see it because I want to  be able to make my own conclusions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- like -- I'm sure many Americans do.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  As journalists we want to be the eyes and ears of the public.   We want to read this document and be able to interpret them.  But when the  same raw material is subject to two interpretations that are 180 degrees  from each other, I also want to know which one of the politicians is  spinning at the truth, by looking at the truth, at data myself.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  I hear you.  So with all of this in mind, what could this  memo possibly tell us?  I mean, in which should we be taking it with a  grain of salt because of the political environment?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I hope that Congressman King's fears do not come to pass.  I  hope this is not been oversold.  I mean, we've been -- we've been  conditioned to expect something that is career-ending, KBG-like, over the  top.</p><p>Now perhaps to those of us that have been in law enforcement and today  monitor it won't be that catastrophic but to the American public it might,  I don't know.  What I think we're going to see is the use of intelligence  data for political purposes, if we see that, that is a very, very, grave  threat to freedom in America.</p><p>REGAN:  It is.  It is.  And some careers will be ended.  And maybe this is  the kind of thing, I don't know you go to jail for.  I mean if this is -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Could very well be.  One of our competing networks reported a  few minutes ago, fears in the White House that FBI Director Chris Wray may  resign if this is released.  Another headache the President doesn't need.</p><p>REGAN:  But I was looking at this, and as the FBI came out and said, we  don't want this, I thought, is this a CYA move?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It may very well be.  I cannot remember.  A person has been  watching this stuff for 40 years and last time the FBI publicly criticized  the White House and got away with it.  That is what we saw last night and  again this morning.</p><p>REGAN:  Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you so much.  It's always good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure, Trish.  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, markets right now, trading a bit lower, we just moved  into negative territory.  Wall Street is of course, awaiting tomorrow's  jobs report.  A biggie.  Everyone is going to be watching this.  What  happens to the unemployment rate?  What happens, I want to know to wages?   Have we started to see any of that filter into the wage data.  We're on it  for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, let's check out these markets.  You can see we  moved back into positive territory with the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are still  lower.  It's all happening, of course, a day ahead of the big jobs report  coming tomorrow.  We do have three big tech companies with earnings out and  you can see after the bell are due, Apple trading up a little bit, Amazon,  however, lower as well Alphabets, which is the fancy name for Google these  days.</p><p>Joining me with more on these markets we have Money Map Press Chief  Investment Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, it has gotten a little  volatile lately.  And I think back to -- </p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  It has.</p><p>REGAN:  -- State of the Union we were off more 300 points and, you know,  doing better now but, what's going on?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  Well, you know, I tell you, for one thing, volatility is  actually a good thing, Trish.  We forgotten, but this used to be normal not  too many years ago.  And second, you have to have buying and selling to  move higher it takes two to tango part on (ph).  And that's what we're  getting now.  Traders are simply adjusting the interest rates.  They're  readjusting the political expectations, taking a little money off the  table, which is absolutely normal.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, people talk about interest rates, and there's some  concern out there, I mean, keep in mind how much debt we have, and by the  way, how much sort of money printing if you would that they -- the Fed had  to go long on, there is concern about rising interest rates that are moving  too quickly and, potentially an economy that's not keeping up.  How much  concern is that to you right now?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  I think that's very valid point, but here is the thing.  The  Fed lost control a long time ago.  So take that out of the equation.  What  more important is traders are doing in the 10-year treasury in particular  is the key.  If it's rising quickly, that is a problem for the markets, if  it's moving in measured paces traders will naturally rein it in.  So unless  we get some sort of spike in that -- we really not going to have a problem.</p><p>REGAN:  I wonder if we can show a chart, maybe a year-to-date or one-year  chart on the 10-year right now.  I'm going to see if the team can get that  together for you.</p><p>But, you know, we're still under three percent on the 30 year.  Keith,  there is part of me, that really wonders why don't we have more inflation  on this economy or more of expectation of inflation.  The idea that, you  know, 30 years from now, you're basically going to be sort of right where  you are, doesn't make any sense?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  No, it doesn't.  I mean, you know, this is central banks at  work.  They're pumping so much money into the system.  And yet, we got all  kind of other things which would be topic for another discussion.</p><p>But here is the key, is that when you're moving all of that money, it's got  to go somewhere.  So what they're doing is creating a magnet for it in the  financial markets.  The markets really are not just yield, they're about  risk.  And that is how global traders assess these rates as risk not as a  return.</p><p>REGAN:  But Keith, how many jobs are you looking forward to tomorrow?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  You know, I think it's going to be a good number.  What I  want to see is composition.  I want to see wage rate increases.  That's the  key.</p><p>REGAN:  It might be early -- it might be early but we've seen a lot of  companies handing out raises.  I think you might get it more so in next  month's report.  But certainly we'll be looking for indications of that  tomorrow.  Keith Fitz-Gerald, thank you very much.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence blasting Nancy Pelosi for her let them eat cake  attitude over tax reform.  She repeatedly calls those $1000 bonuses  \"crumbs.\"  She is doubling down on this.  I'm wondering it is just a little  like the deplorables comment.  Remember from Hillary Clinton, so tone deaf,  not getting how the average American feels because I will tell you, 1000  bucks is a lot of money to anyone in this country.  We've got more Intel on  this, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We were waiting for February, and then we got hit with these  corporations giving tremendous bonuses to everybody.  That Nancy Pelosi  called crumbs.  That was a bad.  That could be like deplorable, does that  make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words, they seem to have a  resemblance.  I hope it has the same meaning but she called it crumbs when  people are getting $2000 and $3,000 and $1000.  That is not crumbs.  That  is a lot of money.</p><p>MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Nancy Pelosi  predicted economic \"Armageddon.\"  Remember that one?  Well, that wasn't the  worst of it.  It's just amazing to me that after this tax cut passes, 3  million Americans get another thousand dollars in their pockets, in many  cases.  She actually described that as \"crumbs.\"  So if you're going to say  $1,000 is crumbs, you live in a different world than I live in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  I'm laughing because did you hear the President equate crumbs with  the deplorable comment?  You know, it's funny, we have a conference call  every morning, our whole team here as we put the show together for you, and  I weigh in editorially, and my comment this morning was, Nancy Pelosi  calling this thing crumbs, it is a lot like Hillary Clinton referring to  deplorables.  I mean it that's kind of moment.  I never understand why she  would possibly double down on this or the likes of Chuck Schumer or Debbie  Wasserman Schultz would want to pick up on this, because it is that bad.   It is a deplorable kind of moment.  As though, the President was listening  to our conference call there.</p><p>Anyway, I'm teasing, but joining me right now, a member of the Trump Re- Election Advisory Board, Gina Loudon.</p><p>And Gina, I mean, I don't get it.  It is so tone deaf to say that a  thousand dollars is crumbs.  Much like Hillary Clinton calling Trump  supporters deplorables, I think this is going to come back to haunt them in  a pretty massive way.  They clearly don't have very good advisors around  them, shall we say.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  Well, let's  say, Trish, that maybe we could give Nancy the benefit of the doubt and she  was being honest in saying Armageddon because it may truly be Armageddon  for the Democrat Party.</p><p>You know, their fund-raising is at record lows.  And while the RNC, of  course, is doing great with fund-raising especially after that killer State  of the Union address by the President.  And so, you know, maybe, Nancy can  say she is sorry.  Maybe she can repent.  She could donate her crumbs to  her church.  Or maybe she donates them to the DNC since they're in such  need.  Who knows?  For Nancy, this is her own little reality.  This is not  reality that the most of us happen to live in.</p><p>REGAN:  But I mean talking about the Marie Antoinette, if you would, of the  Democratic Party right now, I mean, not only that she say once, she then  echoed it and she has got her minions out there echoing at as well.</p><p>You know, I just, I think they don't get it.  I understand that they don't  really like seeing the Dow at 26,000.  They don't really like the lack of  regulation or the idea that Americans are going to get a raise beginning  today, right?  Because this is threatening to their existence, and somehow  Gina, I think what it tells you is that the kind of conservative economic  principles that this administration embraces, they actually work.</p><p>LOUDON:  Right.  And, it really puts them at odds, if you will with the  entire American people.  I mean the only way Democrats actually win with a  doubling down that you mentioned, by Nancy Pelosi and rest of the  Democrats, against the American economy is if somehow they can make the  American economy go south and then celebrate that fact.  That puts them in  direct odds with the American people, which is where they happen to find  themselves on a lot of issues like illegal immigration and other things.</p><p>But, Trish, this is a solid lack of vision for this party.  It is like they  don't recognize -- like, they can't look 10 miles down the road and say,  this might not go well for us, but this is become a pattern with the  Democratic Party, to have a lack of vision, and I believe it is why we see  this sorts of implosions like this, and the doubling down of those same  implosions over and over again.</p><p>REGAN:  Gina Loudon, well, he stole their thunder, their economic thunder  any way.  It's going to be hard for them to fight what is now becoming a  rising tide here of economic optimism.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>I just want to point out to the viewer that the President just landing, you  can see him get in the helicopter there, he just landed back at Joint Base  Andrews after having been at that Republican retreat at Greenbrier Resort  there in West Virginia.</p><p>Anyway, a lot is going on right now with Democrats blasting the President  over immigration reform.  Even calling him, what they just love to call  him, a racist.  But Democrats -- I can tell you they were singing a very  different tune.  We were talking about this earlier with Mercedes Schlapp.</p><p>You know, just a few years ago you had the likes of Barack Obama, Hillary  Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, all voting for a, \"fence.\"  They wanted  stronger borders.  We have the tapes of even President Clinton calling for  it when he was in office.  We're showing it to you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, Democrats, they're blasting President Trump's  immigration proposal, some even calling it racist.  But, I just want you to  hear what Bill Clinton said about immigration back in 1995, followed by  what President Trump said just the other night.  It is important to watch  these together.  Here we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  All-Americans, not  only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country  are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our  country.  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure  our borders more, by hiring record number of new border guard, by deporting  twice as many criminal aliens as ever before.</p><p>TRUMP:  For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into  our most vulnerable communities.</p><p>Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes  that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our  country.  We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration  laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  Let's just get this straight, right?  It is somehow OK for  Bill Clinton to call for more border security and the deportation of  illegals, but not OK for President Trump?</p><p>Joining me right now is former Obama Foreign Policy Advisor David Tafuri.   David, I don't get it.  Because the party he represents?</p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Look, Trish, I'm with  you on this, first of all those two speeches are remarkably similar in  those parts.  And you're right, there should be sort of a philosophical  statement that we can accept and provide some compassion for people who are  here already illegal I like the participants in DACA, known as the  DREAMers.  In return we have to increase border security.  That is what  President Clinton said in 1995.  That is what President Trump.</p><p>President Trump has proposed a compromise on immigration, which I think is  a fair compromise.  It means let's give generous acceptance for DACA  participants, let's create a pathway to citizenship for them.  In return,  let's put a lot of money into border security, including perhaps his wall.   That is something that Democrats and Republicans should get behind.  The  problem is, there are Republicans in the House that are not going to  support that, and there are some Democrats as you highlighted who also  don't support it.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, I would also point out that Democrats historically have  supported, \"wall\" although back then in 2006 it was called a fence, OK, so  you had Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Charles Schumer all  saying, yes, Fence Act.  It was actually called, \"The Secure Fence Act of  2006.\"</p><p>I guess, what frustrates me, and I appreciate that you also are frustrated  by this, David.  What frustrates me is the hypocrisy here.  That, you know,  you know it is OK if Chuck Schumer is proposing it but just not OK if  Donald Trump is proposing it.</p><p>TAFURI:  Look, nobody should be against securing our borders.  And if that  requires $25 billion, which sound like a lot, but if that money is going to  be spent well and it's not going to be wasted and it's going to be used in  a way that effectively and efficiently secures our borders, we ought to  support that.  In return, the Democrats should get some provisions that  make it easier for people who are already here, who are contributing to our  economy, who are employed, who are in school, to get on a pathway to  citizenship.</p><p>REGAN:  He has offered that.  But here is the problem.  These are the other  sticking points.  And by the way I just point out interesting little fact  for everyone, David, the proposed wall back in 2006 was $50 billion that  the Democrats have come up with.  And the President's wall is $25 billion,  so double the cost even though it was that many years ago.</p><p>But David, it's not just having border issues at stake.  It's also the  matter of chain migration and the lottery system, which hasn't benefited  our country.  I mean, I don't understand the aversion some Democrats have  to us saying, OK, we need doctors, we need nurses, we need factory workers,  we need domestic help, we need certain things, and therefore we're going to  seek those people that can fit those needs?</p><p>TAFURI:  Trish, you're right.  Democrats -- some Democrats are also opposed  to aspects of Trump's compromise including the chain migration and  including the lottery visas.</p><p>Now, in the lottery visas I think Trump's proposal is fair, which is let's  do merit-based immigration, rather than the lottery visas.  On the chain  migration, I think Democrats can also get behind limiting chain migration.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>TAFURI:  In fact, they were willing to agree in limiting chain migration  for the DACA, DREAMers participants.  But I think the problem is, the  proposal Trump has made limits it for all immigrants.  So let's say you're  an engineer from India, you come to the U.S., you work for Google, and you  can't bring your parents.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm coming up against a break.  Not to break you up, David but I'm  coming up against the break.  I do appreciate that it sound like there is a  little more room than one would have thought, here you are, David Tafuri, a  former member of the Obama administration.  Thank you so much, good to see  you.</p><p>The Democrats putting out Congressman Joe Kennedy III to give the party's  official response to President Trump's State of the Union address, but is a  Kennedy really the best face of a party of rich white men with a very  famous last name which harkens back to the past?  Is this all they got?   Historian Doug Wead is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, well I'm sure you saw Joe Kennedy III giving the  Democratic response to the State of the Union.  Just ask him, do the  Democrats really have to trot out a Kennedy?  Is that all they got?</p><p>Joining me right now is Presidential Historian Doug Wead, Author of the  book, \"Game of Thorns.\"</p><p>Doug, great to see -- what do you make of this?  I mean, look, you know, no  offense against him.  Thank goodness by the way, they had somebody younger  than who they typically have.  I mean, they need fresh blood, but -- but a  Kennedy?</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Well, I thought it was great.  They  need to do something.  I thought it was very ironic, Trish, that Joe  Kennedy III was using the same arguments against Trump's economic plan that  JFK's enemies used against him, 56 years before.  Boy, how the world has  changed.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.  You know, Doug, you make a good point, because I've always  said, you know, economics doesn't need to be so political in that JFK cut  taxes, he did exactly what the President managed to get done with tax  reform, and here, you know, the next generation is saying something very,  very different.</p><p>WEAD:  Yes, and when the Joe Kennedy III argued it's all for rich people,  when they said that to JFK, you remember very famously he used the new  England proverb that had been passed to him by Ted Sorensen, he said a  rising tide raises all boats.  So Kennedy defended himself and Joe Kennedy  III in Congress used another argument against Trump's tax reform.  He said  that this is going to drive up the national debt, and that's what  Republicans used as an argument against JFK.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.</p><p>WEAD:  And the Kennedy -- </p><p>REGAN:  And it's funny how times have changed because I'm thinking -- you  don't know how many Democrats I've said since when did you become a fiscal  conservative?</p><p>WEAD:  And the fact that he's catholic, I think, is something the Democrats  need.  They lost the vote in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, a  lot of it was because they had trashed the catholic vote in those e-mails  with Podesta and Bill Clinton had begged Hillary to reach out to the  catholic vote, and they just absolutely wouldn't do it.  So maybe the  Democrat Party is coming around a little bit, 22 percent of those voters in  2016 were catholic.  Only one percent were Muslim, which they spent so much  time and money trying to reach out to.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, Doug, I grew up as Irish Catholic and my father came from  a very big Irish Catholic family, and you were a Democrat like you were  Irish like you were catholic.  I mean, that was part of that generation.   And I think that Donald Trump has really gotten in there and stolen that  thunder, if you would, right out from under the Democrats.  So maybe they  think a Kennedy can bring them back.  I would recommend he get the right  economic policies.</p><p>Doug, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>WEAD:  Good to see you, too.  Thank you for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, Liz Claman, we're sending it your way.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Thank you so much, Neil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking right now, everyone, the President is blasting Democrats for  refusing to work with Republicans, saying the left would rather see America  fail than thrive.  But he vows that he will not let Democrats get in the  way of moving forward with his America First agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> All of this as we see a pretty well day on Wall Street.  But hey we're in  the green right now, up 43 points there off the highs of the session.  We  had been down earlier in the session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome to the Intelligence Report.</p><p> The President speaking to Republican law makers that their annual retreat  there in West Virginia at the Greenbrier just a short time ago and he  praise the Republicans for passing tax reform, pretty big deal but he is  warning that Republicans must work with Democrats to get any kind of  comprehensive immigration reform past, can they get it done?</p><p> We are asking Assistant to President Mercedes Schlapp.  Plus, the  classified FISA memo detailing possible abuses at the Justice Department  maybe release tomorrow and of course, you have the left are arguing against  the release saying there will be national security risks if this memo  becomes public.</p><p> But, Judge Napolitano, he is not buying that one bit.  He is here and he is  going to explain why.  We need to let the American public decide for  themselves.  That is happening in just a few minutes.</p><p> But first, let's go to Adam Shapiro, he is in West Virginia there where a  short time ago the President delivered what I would call a powerful America  First speech.  Hi, Adam.</p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDEN:  Yes.  Well, he is always America  First, Trish and this was no different.  He spoke to the Republicans  gathered here in West Virginia, talking about tax reform, talking about  immigration reform, talking about infrastructure.</p><p> But it was specifically his message to Democrats saying that the  administration and Republicans will continue to attempt to pass bipartisan  legislation but they have to be met in the middle and it doesn't appear  according to the President that Democrats want to do that.  He cited the  fact that he is offered a path to citizenship for 1.8 million people who  have come to the United States illegally.  And he says the Democrats that  he did this to see if the Democrats were serious about using immigration to  solve this problem or using immigration reform as political point.  Here is  what he said specifically about it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They talk a good game  with DACA but they don't produce.  And so either they come on board, or  we'll just going to really work and we're going to get more people so we  can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass in a much easier fashion  legislation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Now he also talked about the result of the successful tax reform  and pointing out that it has put $2,000 on average back into the pockets of  regular people not only here in West Virginia but across the country.</p><p> There is the issue that the first $24,000 of income for a married couple is  no longer taxed to the federal level.  So that's just part of the message.   But then, he went on the attack against Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader  in the House, pointing out that when she calls the bonuses, that companies  have announced for their employees, the $1000 bonus, which she calls that  crumbs, that she is missing the point.</p><p> Here is the President in his own words.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Nancy Pelosi called crumbs.  That was a bad -- that could be like  deplorable?  Does that make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words  they seem to have a resemblance.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAPIRO:  And so the President is now on his way back to Washington.   Trish?</p><p> REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Adam.</p><p> Joining me right now with reaction, White House Senior Advisor for  Strategic Communications and Assistant to the President, Mercedes Schlapp.   Good to see you, Mercedes.</p><p> MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS  AND ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT:  Hi, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, he laid out an agenda.  He did so in the State of the  Union the other night and immigration reform is a big part of it.  But it  doesn't sound like the Democrats are willing to give you guys an inch on  this.  So how are you going to get past that?</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Well, clearly, it seems that the Democrats want to make  immigration reform a political wedge issue and not be serious about solving  -- </p><p> REGAN:  Oh, it looks like we may have lost Mercedes Schlapp.  We'll try and  get her back momentarily.  But as she was saying it's become increasing a  political wedge issue.  And that's one of the problems here because, you  know, as far as Democrats go, I don't know how they're going to go out  there and look at their constituents and look at their base and say, well,  you know, the President, he offered a deal for 1.8 million Americans to  have some form of legitimacy, in fact citizenship but we turned it down  because you know what?  We're not going to have that wall and we're going  to let him end chain migration, and we're not going to let him end the  lottery program.</p><p> How does that make any sense?  They want to send all these people out of  the country when the President is willing to give a deal?  I mean  politically-speaking it looks as though the Republicans have upper side on  this one.</p><p> Joining me right now with more context, Republican Strategist, Ford  O'Connell and Democratic Strategist Hamza Khan.</p><p> Good to see you guys.</p><p> FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good to see you, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  Ford, I'll start with you.  And again, we're going to try and get  Mercedes back with us.  It looks like the satellite feed went down.</p><p> But Ford, just the politics here, and I understand there are members of the  President's base that don't like the idea of extending citizenship to all  these people but he is putting forth a deal.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  He is -- </p><p> REGAN:  And if the Democrats don't go along with it, then they're going to  deport all of these individuals?</p><p> O'CONNELL:  Well look, what the President is proposing is what many -- 54  Senate Democrats agreed to in 2013, which is a border fence, ending the  diversity visa lottery program and putting curbs on chain migration.  And  essentially 65 percent of Americans in the latest Harvard-Harris Poll agree  with the President's position.</p><p> He is trying to make a deal.  Unfortunately, Democrats are going to  continue to basically resist, obstruct, and sit on their hands.  It's  really an unfortunate situation because President Trump is absolutely  right.  We going to build on that powerful State of the Union continue so  in the tax bill and deliver for the American people on immigration and  infrastructure.</p><p> REGAN:  Hamza, the Democrats are going to have tough a tough time if  economy the continue doing as well as it's been doing.  What do you think  it's going to happens in '18?</p><p> HAMZA KHAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, first of all, let's talk about  the economy for a second.  The current tax bill that was put through  Congress really quickly and is become law now has only benefited about two  percent of all Americans.  Only 1.94 percent of Americans have gotten any  sort of bonus from their jobs, resulting from the tax cuts, whatsoever.</p><p> REGAN:  You know it just happened.</p><p> KHAN:  It just happened, the only two percent and so quickly.  I mean,  we've been talking all the time about how great this tax is going to be for  the American people.  It hasn't trickled down to anyone.  It seems to me a  trickle up.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's only been in place for a few weeks.  And by the way,  starting tomorrow, Americans are going to be getting raises as a result of  this, more money coming back to them in their paychecks.  So -- </p><p> KHAN:  Well, let's see if that really comes out.</p><p> REGAN:  I guess that argument only going to hold for, you know -- </p><p> KHAN:  We'll see if it really gets beyond the margins and it's starting  tomorrow since you seem to think that tomorrow we'll going to see some pay  cuts coming back into people's -- </p><p> REGAN:  I mean -- OK.  Hang on Ford.  I want to keep going, Hamza.  I want  to hear the rest of why you say our economy is not doing well now?</p><p> KHAN:  Well, we got a lot of reasons why the economy is not doing well.  A  Fox poll just show, it just point out 71 percent of the Americans are  concerned about the economy still, that's what President Trump being in  office for a whole year.  On top of that, even though President Trump seems  to keep taking credit for President Obama's work on economy, we've seen  that the job growth in the last 12 months slow, rather than increase.  So  I'm not really sure what Donald Trump -- </p><p> REGAN:  Can I stop you.  And Ford, I'm going to get you in here in just a  second.  But you think that the upside we're seeing in terms of GDP growth  right now is a result of President Obama?  You think that the 26,000 on the  Dow right now is a result of President Obama?</p><p> KHAN:  President Obama made sure that our economy is growing for both Wall  Street and Main Street.  So I can tell you for a fact, everything we're  seeing right now is things to Barack Hussein Obama.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  And I can tell you for a fact that he had absolutely nothing  to do with growing the fundamentals in the economy.  And I can tell you for  a fact that Janet Yellen did.  Because when you print out much money you  see a little bit of bump up in the stock market.  But until you actually  have meaningful policy reform nothing happens fundamentally with overall  economic growth.  It wasn't until we got word of the tax cuts that things  really started to take off.  And that rumor got built into the market.  And  that optimism got fell into GDP.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do -- </p><p> REGAN:  Hang on.  Let Ford get in.  Go ahead, Ford.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do what Nancy Pelosi is doing and saying  the three million people getting raises is crumbs, let me tell you  something the Republicans are going to hold the House in 2018.  And to  Trish's point, look, unemployment at a 17-year low, consumer confidence and  small business confidence is through the roof.  And the reason why that is,  is because of optimism based on tax bill which has had a 20-point swing  over the last month, and deregulation policies put in by the Trump  administration, which are basically cut regulations on a 22 to one clip.   It was regulation that was stifling the American economy.  And it's  deregulation that essentially put us near three percent in GDP and  hopefully with the tax bill it will put us near four.  And frankly if you  guys want to keep touting that Obama did all of this, I promise you we're  going to hold the House -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KHAN:  I mean, you can promise what you want, but the polls are showing  right now the Democrats in the best position ever to take back the House.   And on top of that --</p><p> O'CONNELL:  No, they're not.  Actually, I'm going to now rebut you.</p><p> KHAN:  Hey, you can rebut me, but let me get to my point here, even within  the Republican Party there is no clear step going forward on how they're  going to get immigration reform through the House right now and through the  Senate on top of that.  And that's actually on front page of \"Politico\" as  I recall from today.</p><p> On top of that, only two percent --</p><p> REGAN:  So you're going to send all those people home because you won't end  chain migration.</p><p> KHAN:  Yes, I'm not sure if it's right for you to be going off about chain  migration.  We have a lot of great Americans who came here from every part  of the country.  And then, you yourself, Trish, called those 1.8 million  people a few years ago, to be Americans.  Therefore, why are we negotiating  about their right to be in their own country?  I'm just using your own  words.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's just stop you there.  Because what you are saying because  you're not going to allow him to end chain migration and you're not going  to allow him to end the lottery program, instead of by the way, one would  think you want to be strategic who comes here, but if you don't allow him  to end those things, then you're going to take 1.8 million people and send  them away?  I mean, Hamza, I don't know how you're going to explain that  one to your base?</p><p> KHAN:  Let me do this, Trish.  Do you think it's a good optic for the  Republican Party to be trying to send 1.8 million back to some other part  of the world that they have never actually been to.</p><p> REGAN:  Ah, so that's what it is.</p><p> KHAN:  We have so many innocent people in this country -- </p><p> REGAN:  That is what it is.  That is what it is.  You want to make it look,  as though the President -- OK, this feeds your narrative because if the  economy is doing as well as it has been doing, if it is growing at four  percent as CEO of JPMorgan suggests it will, a Democrat by the way, well  then, you will going to have nothing to run on except that he is the  bogeyman.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  That's exactly -- </p><p> KHAN:  Well, he is the bogeyman.  There is no argument there.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  No, he is not the bogeyman, Hamza.</p><p> KHAN:  Yes, he is the bogeyman.  He is going after people in our country  simply because they don't have the right color passport.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, I got to wrap it up there.  It is good to talk to you  both.  But I want to get back to Mercedes who is at the White House.  Thank  you so much, Hamza, spirited discussion, and Ford O'Connell.</p><p>Mercedes, you heard what Hamza was saying, I mean, I question whether they  are almost deliberately doing this, right?  Because they kind of like the  optics of the President deporting people, it feeds the narrative that  somehow big, bad, Donald Trump is going go knocking on everyone's door and  send kids home to Mexico or wherever else they may be from, and that upsets  people.  And people have an emotional reaction to that, therefore getting  out vote for the base.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  The Democrat party's platform right now is that of obstruction.   They don't want the President to succeed.  They are actually bitter because  of his success.  I mean, it's very clear that the President is trying his  best to work with both parties, to work with both the House and the Senate.   He is the one that has taken the lead on immigration reform.  He is the one  that's saying, I want permanent and compassionate solution to DACA  recipients.  At the same time he wants to protect Americans.  And that  means securing our border.  That means proposing a 25 billion-dollar trust  fund that would insure that we would have -- not only the physical barrier  but the personal and the technology needed in order to make sure that we're  able to control what's happening on the border.</p><p> I mean, we have to understand that through borders where we're seeing drugs  coming through.  There are individuals who are coming to the United States,  part of the MS-13 gang.  I mean they are -- and guess what?  Those MS-13  gang members they end up in communities that are primarily Latino or  African-American.  So we have to insure that there is safety along our  border.</p><p> And so I think for the President, what he is doing is, he is saying, let's  work together.  I'm extending my hand over to the Democrats.  Let's get to  a good point where we find a permanent solution to DACA as well as secure  the border.  And it is where mainstream America is at.  I mean -- </p><p> REGAN:  And by the way, you used to work with the Democrats right,  Mercedes.  I mean, we're going through the historical record, going back to  2006, you had Barack Obama -- Senator Barack Obama, you had Chuck Schumer,  you had -- forgive me, you had Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, I believe,  here we go here is the whole list.  Forgive me.  Joe Biden, all saying we  needed a fence.  They called it a fence as opposed to a wall back then in  2006.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  And you know who else agreed on ending chain migration?  It was  actually Feinstein, it was Schumer, it was all part of the \"gang of six\" or  eight, you know, that came out during the Senate in 2013.  There were  plenty of Democrats who agreed that there was a need to end chain  migration, end the diversity visa lottery program.  So there is a lot more  bipartisan room to grow there.  And I think the President is saying let's  just get a solution done, for the sake of DACA recipients, for the sake of  Americans, let's get to a point where we have a generous compromise and  really get this done.  The question will become, are Democrats simply going  to play politics.  Are they will to be come up with a true solution that  would benefit DACA recipients as well as insure we secure our border?</p><p> REGAN:  I think he might be able to get it done, really.  I mean, tax  reform went through.  And by the way, you heard our Democratic strategist  say this growing economy, booming economy has nothing to do with the  President.  All Barack Obama.  But that's what you're fighting?</p><p> SCHLAPP:  It was -- I don't know what planet he is living on.  But I can  just tell you that what we are seeing in terms of business confidence,  consumer confidence, when you just look at the deregulation alone and the  impact it had on our economy, that it is having on small business growth it  is impactful.  And for the President, it is not just, you know, we're  seeing the paycheck increases and the fact that average families, you're  going to see raises in their income, close to $4,000 a year.  That is  impactful.</p><p> And for Speaker Pelosi to call that crumbs, it just shows how elite and out  of touch she is with where every day Americans are.  And it's incredibly  unfortunate because what President Trump understands is the pulse of the  American people.  He understands the need of these families and the fact  that they are ones that should have money in their pockets for their  family.  And that at the end of the day, America is open for business, that  we can create jobs and keep our economy growing.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's keep it up, the Dow 26,170.  Mercedes Schlapp, thank you very  much.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Thank you very much.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, new developments everyone on the controversial  surveillance memo alleging abuses at the Justice Department, sources  telling Fox News, the President will declassify and release the memo to the  public.  We have all the Intel for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, everyone, new developments surrounding the controversial  memo on alleged surveillance abuses at the Justice Department.  Sources  telling Fox that President Trump will declassify that memo tomorrow despite  pleas from the FBI to keep it under wraps.  For more, let's go to our own  Blake Burman, who is at the White House.  Hi, Blake.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Trish.  And the White  House now publicly acknowledging that President Trump has indeed read this  four-page memo.  The President did not mention it or his decision at all  just within the past hour or so as he addressed congressional Republicans  in West Virginia.</p><p> The President now on his way back here to the White House.  And according  to sources the President is expected to declassify the memo.  It would then  be sent back, we were told, according to sources, back up to the Hill.  At  which point the House Intelligence Committee would get it.  And it is  believed at this point the likely timing is that it could be released at  some point by tomorrow morning.</p><p> One of the top Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, Peter King,  and he called this memo, just a little while ago, vital.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PETER KING (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN:  I don't want to oversell it.  I  agree with Trey Gowdy.  I think Republicans sometimes make a mistake of  oversell things.  But I'm going to say, this is vital, it's essentially to  the public to say and it's certainly important in the body of evidence to  be out there.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Democrats have been fighting this memo, some on the House  Intelligence Committee on the Democratic side as well trying to produce  their memo.  The lead Democrat is Adam Schiff, and he said just a little  while ago that this memo is the Republican attempt to tar the Department of  Justice and the FBI.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADAM SCHIFF (D), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I think the FBI is exactly  right.  This memo is really a spin on a -- not just a set of particular  documents but broader classified information than that.  That because of  serious and material omissions is inaccurate and gives a very misleading  impression.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Schiff is also involved, Trish, in another battle right now, about  this memo as he says there were material changes made to it by the  Republicans, led by Devin Nunes and his committee members, however a  spokesperson for Nunes saying that it is a bizarre distraction that Schiff  is now engaging in, and that they were not material changes, and said  rather grammatical fixes and changes that Democrats and FBI wanted to see.   Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Blake Burman.</p><p> Joining me right now is Fox News Legal Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p> And Judge, you say that this thing needs to be declassified ASAP.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I absolutely do.  I  actually want more than just this declassified because I want to see  Congressman Schiff's version of the raw intelligence data as well.</p><p> So here is how it happens.  The Republican staff members, not members of  the committee have top secret security clearances.  And they can see the  raw Intel, raw Intel is, transcripts of telephone conversations, copies of  text messages, copies of emails between and among Justice Department  figures and FBI agents, the last year of President Obama's administration  and first year of President Trump's administration.  From that, the  Republican staff concluded that there was a serious abuse of FISA  authorities.  There was spying that should not have occurred.  And there  was spying done for political purposes.  Congressman Schiff and his team  have looked at the same data and said there are no such abuses here.  So  not only do I want to see both memos, I want to see the raw data memos are  based.</p><p> REGAN:  Look, you may not be able to see the raw data because that would be  a security compromise.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Unless we just whited out the names of sources and certain  other information.  We can certainly see the texts and the emails and phone  conversations without knowing from whom they came because the American  public needs to know, who broke the law with the authority we gave them?   Who knew about the law being broken?  Who looked the other way?</p><p> Trish, these FISA abuses were known to the committee for the past eight  months.  They sat on it, until after FISA was extended by the Congress and  signed by the President.  They released it the next day.  Congress should  have had an opportunity to look at this stuff before it ignorantly voted to  extend FISA.</p><p> REGAN:  But, you know, I hear what you're saying because the problem right  now is we're in such a polarized political environment.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We are.</p><p> REGAN:  But the Republicans have one version of facts and the Democrats  have another version of these facts or interpretation I should say, that  you want people to be able to tell for themselves.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  And as a journalist I want to be able to see it because I want to  be able to make my own conclusions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- like -- I'm sure many Americans do.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  As journalists we want to be the eyes and ears of the public.   We want to read this document and be able to interpret them.  But when the  same raw material is subject to two interpretations that are 180 degrees  from each other, I also want to know which one of the politicians is  spinning at the truth, by looking at the truth, at data myself.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  I hear you.  So with all of this in mind, what could this  memo possibly tell us?  I mean, in which should we be taking it with a  grain of salt because of the political environment?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I hope that Congressman King's fears do not come to pass.  I  hope this is not been oversold.  I mean, we've been -- we've been  conditioned to expect something that is career-ending, KBG-like, over the  top.</p><p> Now perhaps to those of us that have been in law enforcement and today  monitor it won't be that catastrophic but to the American public it might,  I don't know.  What I think we're going to see is the use of intelligence  data for political purposes, if we see that, that is a very, very, grave  threat to freedom in America.</p><p> REGAN:  It is.  It is.  And some careers will be ended.  And maybe this is  the kind of thing, I don't know you go to jail for.  I mean if this is -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Could very well be.  One of our competing networks reported a  few minutes ago, fears in the White House that FBI Director Chris Wray may  resign if this is released.  Another headache the President doesn't need.</p><p> REGAN:  But I was looking at this, and as the FBI came out and said, we  don't want this, I thought, is this a CYA move?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It may very well be.  I cannot remember.  A person has been  watching this stuff for 40 years and last time the FBI publicly criticized  the White House and got away with it.  That is what we saw last night and  again this morning.</p><p> REGAN:  Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you so much.  It's always good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure, Trish.  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, markets right now, trading a bit lower, we just moved  into negative territory.  Wall Street is of course, awaiting tomorrow's  jobs report.  A biggie.  Everyone is going to be watching this.  What  happens to the unemployment rate?  What happens, I want to know to wages?   Have we started to see any of that filter into the wage data.  We're on it  for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, everyone, let's check out these markets.  You can see we  moved back into positive territory with the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are still  lower.  It's all happening, of course, a day ahead of the big jobs report  coming tomorrow.  We do have three big tech companies with earnings out and  you can see after the bell are due, Apple trading up a little bit, Amazon,  however, lower as well Alphabets, which is the fancy name for Google these  days.</p><p> Joining me with more on these markets we have Money Map Press Chief  Investment Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, it has gotten a little  volatile lately.  And I think back to -- </p><p> KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  It has.</p><p> REGAN:  -- State of the Union we were off more 300 points and, you know,  doing better now but, what's going on?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  Well, you know, I tell you, for one thing, volatility is  actually a good thing, Trish.  We forgotten, but this used to be normal not  too many years ago.  And second, you have to have buying and selling to  move higher it takes two to tango part on (ph).  And that's what we're  getting now.  Traders are simply adjusting the interest rates.  They're  readjusting the political expectations, taking a little money off the  table, which is absolutely normal.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, people talk about interest rates, and there's some  concern out there, I mean, keep in mind how much debt we have, and by the  way, how much sort of money printing if you would that they -- the Fed had  to go long on, there is concern about rising interest rates that are moving  too quickly and, potentially an economy that's not keeping up.  How much  concern is that to you right now?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  I think that's very valid point, but here is the thing.  The  Fed lost control a long time ago.  So take that out of the equation.  What  more important is traders are doing in the 10-year treasury in particular  is the key.  If it's rising quickly, that is a problem for the markets, if  it's moving in measured paces traders will naturally rein it in.  So unless  we get some sort of spike in that -- we really not going to have a problem.</p><p> REGAN:  I wonder if we can show a chart, maybe a year-to-date or one-year  chart on the 10-year right now.  I'm going to see if the team can get that  together for you.</p><p> But, you know, we're still under three percent on the 30 year.  Keith,  there is part of me, that really wonders why don't we have more inflation  on this economy or more of expectation of inflation.  The idea that, you  know, 30 years from now, you're basically going to be sort of right where  you are, doesn't make any sense?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  No, it doesn't.  I mean, you know, this is central banks at  work.  They're pumping so much money into the system.  And yet, we got all  kind of other things which would be topic for another discussion.</p><p> But here is the key, is that when you're moving all of that money, it's got  to go somewhere.  So what they're doing is creating a magnet for it in the  financial markets.  The markets really are not just yield, they're about  risk.  And that is how global traders assess these rates as risk not as a  return.</p><p> REGAN:  But Keith, how many jobs are you looking forward to tomorrow?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  You know, I think it's going to be a good number.  What I  want to see is composition.  I want to see wage rate increases.  That's the  key.</p><p> REGAN:  It might be early -- it might be early but we've seen a lot of  companies handing out raises.  I think you might get it more so in next  month's report.  But certainly we'll be looking for indications of that  tomorrow.  Keith Fitz-Gerald, thank you very much.</p><p> Vice President Mike Pence blasting Nancy Pelosi for her let them eat cake  attitude over tax reform.  She repeatedly calls those $1000 bonuses  \"crumbs.\"  She is doubling down on this.  I'm wondering it is just a little  like the deplorables comment.  Remember from Hillary Clinton, so tone deaf,  not getting how the average American feels because I will tell you, 1000  bucks is a lot of money to anyone in this country.  We've got more Intel on  this, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We were waiting for February, and then we got hit with these  corporations giving tremendous bonuses to everybody.  That Nancy Pelosi  called crumbs.  That was a bad.  That could be like deplorable, does that  make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words, they seem to have a  resemblance.  I hope it has the same meaning but she called it crumbs when  people are getting $2000 and $3,000 and $1000.  That is not crumbs.  That  is a lot of money.</p><p> MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Nancy Pelosi  predicted economic \"Armageddon.\"  Remember that one?  Well, that wasn't the  worst of it.  It's just amazing to me that after this tax cut passes, 3  million Americans get another thousand dollars in their pockets, in many  cases.  She actually described that as \"crumbs.\"  So if you're going to say  $1,000 is crumbs, you live in a different world than I live in.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  I'm laughing because did you hear the President equate crumbs with  the deplorable comment?  You know, it's funny, we have a conference call  every morning, our whole team here as we put the show together for you, and  I weigh in editorially, and my comment this morning was, Nancy Pelosi  calling this thing crumbs, it is a lot like Hillary Clinton referring to  deplorables.  I mean it that's kind of moment.  I never understand why she  would possibly double down on this or the likes of Chuck Schumer or Debbie  Wasserman Schultz would want to pick up on this, because it is that bad.   It is a deplorable kind of moment.  As though, the President was listening  to our conference call there.</p><p> Anyway, I'm teasing, but joining me right now, a member of the Trump Re- Election Advisory Board, Gina Loudon.</p><p> And Gina, I mean, I don't get it.  It is so tone deaf to say that a  thousand dollars is crumbs.  Much like Hillary Clinton calling Trump  supporters deplorables, I think this is going to come back to haunt them in  a pretty massive way.  They clearly don't have very good advisors around  them, shall we say.</p><p> GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  Well, let's  say, Trish, that maybe we could give Nancy the benefit of the doubt and she  was being honest in saying Armageddon because it may truly be Armageddon  for the Democrat Party.</p><p> You know, their fund-raising is at record lows.  And while the RNC, of  course, is doing great with fund-raising especially after that killer State  of the Union address by the President.  And so, you know, maybe, Nancy can  say she is sorry.  Maybe she can repent.  She could donate her crumbs to  her church.  Or maybe she donates them to the DNC since they're in such  need.  Who knows?  For Nancy, this is her own little reality.  This is not  reality that the most of us happen to live in.</p><p> REGAN:  But I mean talking about the Marie Antoinette, if you would, of the  Democratic Party right now, I mean, not only that she say once, she then  echoed it and she has got her minions out there echoing at as well.</p><p> You know, I just, I think they don't get it.  I understand that they don't  really like seeing the Dow at 26,000.  They don't really like the lack of  regulation or the idea that Americans are going to get a raise beginning  today, right?  Because this is threatening to their existence, and somehow  Gina, I think what it tells you is that the kind of conservative economic  principles that this administration embraces, they actually work.</p><p> LOUDON:  Right.  And, it really puts them at odds, if you will with the  entire American people.  I mean the only way Democrats actually win with a  doubling down that you mentioned, by Nancy Pelosi and rest of the  Democrats, against the American economy is if somehow they can make the  American economy go south and then celebrate that fact.  That puts them in  direct odds with the American people, which is where they happen to find  themselves on a lot of issues like illegal immigration and other things.</p><p> But, Trish, this is a solid lack of vision for this party.  It is like they  don't recognize -- like, they can't look 10 miles down the road and say,  this might not go well for us, but this is become a pattern with the  Democratic Party, to have a lack of vision, and I believe it is why we see  this sorts of implosions like this, and the doubling down of those same  implosions over and over again.</p><p> REGAN:  Gina Loudon, well, he stole their thunder, their economic thunder  any way.  It's going to be hard for them to fight what is now becoming a  rising tide here of economic optimism.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> I just want to point out to the viewer that the President just landing, you  can see him get in the helicopter there, he just landed back at Joint Base  Andrews after having been at that Republican retreat at Greenbrier Resort  there in West Virginia.</p><p> Anyway, a lot is going on right now with Democrats blasting the President  over immigration reform.  Even calling him, what they just love to call  him, a racist.  But Democrats -- I can tell you they were singing a very  different tune.  We were talking about this earlier with Mercedes Schlapp.</p><p> You know, just a few years ago you had the likes of Barack Obama, Hillary  Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, all voting for a, \"fence.\"  They wanted  stronger borders.  We have the tapes of even President Clinton calling for  it when he was in office.  We're showing it to you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, everyone, Democrats, they're blasting President Trump's  immigration proposal, some even calling it racist.  But, I just want you to  hear what Bill Clinton said about immigration back in 1995, followed by  what President Trump said just the other night.  It is important to watch  these together.  Here we go.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  All-Americans, not  only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country  are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our  country.  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure  our borders more, by hiring record number of new border guard, by deporting  twice as many criminal aliens as ever before.</p><p> TRUMP:  For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into  our most vulnerable communities.</p><p> Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes  that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our  country.  We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration  laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  Let's just get this straight, right?  It is somehow OK for  Bill Clinton to call for more border security and the deportation of  illegals, but not OK for President Trump?</p><p> Joining me right now is former Obama Foreign Policy Advisor David Tafuri.   David, I don't get it.  Because the party he represents?</p><p> DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Look, Trish, I'm with  you on this, first of all those two speeches are remarkably similar in  those parts.  And you're right, there should be sort of a philosophical  statement that we can accept and provide some compassion for people who are  here already illegal I like the participants in DACA, known as the  DREAMers.  In return we have to increase border security.  That is what  President Clinton said in 1995.  That is what President Trump.</p><p> President Trump has proposed a compromise on immigration, which I think is  a fair compromise.  It means let's give generous acceptance for DACA  participants, let's create a pathway to citizenship for them.  In return,  let's put a lot of money into border security, including perhaps his wall.   That is something that Democrats and Republicans should get behind.  The  problem is, there are Republicans in the House that are not going to  support that, and there are some Democrats as you highlighted who also  don't support it.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, I would also point out that Democrats historically have  supported, \"wall\" although back then in 2006 it was called a fence, OK, so  you had Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Charles Schumer all  saying, yes, Fence Act.  It was actually called, \"The Secure Fence Act of  2006.\"</p><p> I guess, what frustrates me, and I appreciate that you also are frustrated  by this, David.  What frustrates me is the hypocrisy here.  That, you know,  you know it is OK if Chuck Schumer is proposing it but just not OK if  Donald Trump is proposing it.</p><p> TAFURI:  Look, nobody should be against securing our borders.  And if that  requires $25 billion, which sound like a lot, but if that money is going to  be spent well and it's not going to be wasted and it's going to be used in  a way that effectively and efficiently secures our borders, we ought to  support that.  In return, the Democrats should get some provisions that  make it easier for people who are already here, who are contributing to our  economy, who are employed, who are in school, to get on a pathway to  citizenship.</p><p> REGAN:  He has offered that.  But here is the problem.  These are the other  sticking points.  And by the way I just point out interesting little fact  for everyone, David, the proposed wall back in 2006 was $50 billion that  the Democrats have come up with.  And the President's wall is $25 billion,  so double the cost even though it was that many years ago.</p><p> But David, it's not just having border issues at stake.  It's also the  matter of chain migration and the lottery system, which hasn't benefited  our country.  I mean, I don't understand the aversion some Democrats have  to us saying, OK, we need doctors, we need nurses, we need factory workers,  we need domestic help, we need certain things, and therefore we're going to  seek those people that can fit those needs?</p><p> TAFURI:  Trish, you're right.  Democrats -- some Democrats are also opposed  to aspects of Trump's compromise including the chain migration and  including the lottery visas.</p><p> Now, in the lottery visas I think Trump's proposal is fair, which is let's  do merit-based immigration, rather than the lottery visas.  On the chain  migration, I think Democrats can also get behind limiting chain migration.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.</p><p> TAFURI:  In fact, they were willing to agree in limiting chain migration  for the DACA, DREAMers participants.  But I think the problem is, the  proposal Trump has made limits it for all immigrants.  So let's say you're  an engineer from India, you come to the U.S., you work for Google, and you  can't bring your parents.</p><p> REGAN:  I'm coming up against a break.  Not to break you up, David but I'm  coming up against the break.  I do appreciate that it sound like there is a  little more room than one would have thought, here you are, David Tafuri, a  former member of the Obama administration.  Thank you so much, good to see  you.</p><p> The Democrats putting out Congressman Joe Kennedy III to give the party's  official response to President Trump's State of the Union address, but is a  Kennedy really the best face of a party of rich white men with a very  famous last name which harkens back to the past?  Is this all they got?   Historian Doug Wead is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, well I'm sure you saw Joe Kennedy III giving the  Democratic response to the State of the Union.  Just ask him, do the  Democrats really have to trot out a Kennedy?  Is that all they got?</p><p> Joining me right now is Presidential Historian Doug Wead, Author of the  book, \"Game of Thorns.\"</p><p> Doug, great to see -- what do you make of this?  I mean, look, you know, no  offense against him.  Thank goodness by the way, they had somebody younger  than who they typically have.  I mean, they need fresh blood, but -- but a  Kennedy?</p><p> DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Well, I thought it was great.  They  need to do something.  I thought it was very ironic, Trish, that Joe  Kennedy III was using the same arguments against Trump's economic plan that  JFK's enemies used against him, 56 years before.  Boy, how the world has  changed.</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.  You know, Doug, you make a good point, because I've always  said, you know, economics doesn't need to be so political in that JFK cut  taxes, he did exactly what the President managed to get done with tax  reform, and here, you know, the next generation is saying something very,  very different.</p><p> WEAD:  Yes, and when the Joe Kennedy III argued it's all for rich people,  when they said that to JFK, you remember very famously he used the new  England proverb that had been passed to him by Ted Sorensen, he said a  rising tide raises all boats.  So Kennedy defended himself and Joe Kennedy  III in Congress used another argument against Trump's tax reform.  He said  that this is going to drive up the national debt, and that's what  Republicans used as an argument against JFK.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.</p><p> WEAD:  And the Kennedy -- </p><p> REGAN:  And it's funny how times have changed because I'm thinking -- you  don't know how many Democrats I've said since when did you become a fiscal  conservative?</p><p> WEAD:  And the fact that he's catholic, I think, is something the Democrats  need.  They lost the vote in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, a  lot of it was because they had trashed the catholic vote in those e-mails  with Podesta and Bill Clinton had begged Hillary to reach out to the  catholic vote, and they just absolutely wouldn't do it.  So maybe the  Democrat Party is coming around a little bit, 22 percent of those voters in  2016 were catholic.  Only one percent were Muslim, which they spent so much  time and money trying to reach out to.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, Doug, I grew up as Irish Catholic and my father came from  a very big Irish Catholic family, and you were a Democrat like you were  Irish like you were catholic.  I mean, that was part of that generation.   And I think that Donald Trump has really gotten in there and stolen that  thunder, if you would, right out from under the Democrats.  So maybe they  think a Kennedy can bring them back.  I would recommend he get the right  economic policies.</p><p> Doug, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> WEAD:  Good to see you, too.  Thank you for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, Liz Claman, we're sending it your way.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Thank you so much, Neil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking right now, everyone, the President is blasting Democrats for  refusing to work with Republicans, saying the left would rather see America  fail than thrive.  But he vows that he will not let Democrats get in the  way of moving forward with his America First agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> All of this as we see a pretty well day on Wall Street.  But hey we're in  the green right now, up 43 points there off the highs of the session.  We  had been down earlier in the session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome to the Intelligence Report.</p><p> The President speaking to Republican law makers that their annual retreat  there in West Virginia at the Greenbrier just a short time ago and he  praise the Republicans for passing tax reform, pretty big deal but he is  warning that Republicans must work with Democrats to get any kind of  comprehensive immigration reform past, can they get it done?</p><p> We are asking Assistant to President Mercedes Schlapp.  Plus, the  classified FISA memo detailing possible abuses at the Justice Department  maybe release tomorrow and of course, you have the left are arguing against  the release saying there will be national security risks if this memo  becomes public.</p><p> But, Judge Napolitano, he is not buying that one bit.  He is here and he is  going to explain why.  We need to let the American public decide for  themselves.  That is happening in just a few minutes.</p><p> But first, let's go to Adam Shapiro, he is in West Virginia there where a  short time ago the President delivered what I would call a powerful America  First speech.  Hi, Adam.</p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDEN:  Yes.  Well, he is always America  First, Trish and this was no different.  He spoke to the Republicans  gathered here in West Virginia, talking about tax reform, talking about  immigration reform, talking about infrastructure.</p><p> But it was specifically his message to Democrats saying that the  administration and Republicans will continue to attempt to pass bipartisan  legislation but they have to be met in the middle and it doesn't appear  according to the President that Democrats want to do that.  He cited the  fact that he is offered a path to citizenship for 1.8 million people who  have come to the United States illegally.  And he says the Democrats that  he did this to see if the Democrats were serious about using immigration to  solve this problem or using immigration reform as political point.  Here is  what he said specifically about it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They talk a good game  with DACA but they don't produce.  And so either they come on board, or  we'll just going to really work and we're going to get more people so we  can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass in a much easier fashion  legislation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Now he also talked about the result of the successful tax reform  and pointing out that it has put $2,000 on average back into the pockets of  regular people not only here in West Virginia but across the country.</p><p> There is the issue that the first $24,000 of income for a married couple is  no longer taxed to the federal level.  So that's just part of the message.   But then, he went on the attack against Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader  in the House, pointing out that when she calls the bonuses, that companies  have announced for their employees, the $1000 bonus, which she calls that  crumbs, that she is missing the point.</p><p> Here is the President in his own words.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Nancy Pelosi called crumbs.  That was a bad -- that could be like  deplorable?  Does that make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words  they seem to have a resemblance.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAPIRO:  And so the President is now on his way back to Washington.   Trish?</p><p> REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Adam.</p><p> Joining me right now with reaction, White House Senior Advisor for  Strategic Communications and Assistant to the President, Mercedes Schlapp.   Good to see you, Mercedes.</p><p> MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC  COMMUNICATIONS  AND ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT:  Hi, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, he laid out an agenda.  He did so in the State of the  Union the other night and immigration reform is a big part of it.  But it  doesn't sound like the Democrats are willing to give you guys an inch on  this.  So how are you going to get past that?</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Well, clearly, it seems that the Democrats want to make  immigration reform a political wedge issue and not be serious about solving  -- </p><p> REGAN:  Oh, it looks like we may have lost Mercedes Schlapp.  We'll try and  get her back momentarily.  But as she was saying it's become increasing a  political wedge issue.  And that's one of the problems here because, you  know, as far as Democrats go, I don't know how they're going to go out  there and look at their constituents and look at their base and say, well,  you know, the President, he offered a deal for 1.8 million Americans to  have some form of legitimacy, in fact citizenship but we turned it down  because you know what?  We're not going to have that wall and we're going  to let him end chain migration, and we're not going to let him end the  lottery program.</p><p> How does that make any sense?  They want to send all these people out of  the country when the President is willing to give a deal?  I mean  politically-speaking it looks as though the Republicans have upper side on  this one.</p><p> Joining me right now with more context, Republican Strategist, Ford  O'Connell and Democratic Strategist Hamza Khan.</p><p> Good to see you guys.</p><p> FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good to see you, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  Ford, I'll start with you.  And again, we're going to try and get  Mercedes back with us.  It looks like the satellite feed went down.</p><p> But Ford, just the politics here, and I understand there are members of the  President's base that don't like the idea of extending citizenship to all  these people but he is putting forth a deal.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  He is -- </p><p> REGAN:  And if the Democrats don't go along with it, then they're going to  deport all of these individuals?</p><p> O'CONNELL:  Well look, what the President is proposing is what many -- 54  Senate Democrats agreed to in 2013, which is a border fence, ending the  diversity visa lottery program and putting curbs on chain migration.  And  essentially 65 percent of Americans in the latest Harvard-Harris Poll agree  with the President's position.</p><p> He is trying to make a deal.  Unfortunately, Democrats are going to  continue to basically resist, obstruct, and sit on their hands.  It's  really an unfortunate situation because President Trump is absolutely  right.  We going to build on that powerful State of the Union continue so  in the tax bill and deliver for the American people on immigration and  infrastructure.</p><p> REGAN:  Hamza, the Democrats are going to have tough a tough time if  economy the continue doing as well as it's been doing.  What do you think  it's going to happens in '18?</p><p> HAMZA KHAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, first of all, let's talk about  the economy for a second.  The current tax bill that was put through  Congress really quickly and is become law now has only benefited about two  percent of all Americans.  Only 1.94 percent of Americans have gotten any  sort of bonus from their jobs, resulting from the tax cuts, whatsoever.</p><p> REGAN:  You know it just happened.</p><p> KHAN:  It just happened, the only two percent and so quickly.  I mean,  we've been talking all the time about how great this tax is going to be for  the American people.  It hasn't trickled down to anyone.  It seems to me a  trickle up.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's only been in place for a few weeks.  And by the way,  starting tomorrow, Americans are going to be getting raises as a result of  this, more money coming back to them in their paychecks.  So -- </p><p> KHAN:  Well, let's see if that really comes out.</p><p> REGAN:  I guess that argument only going to hold for, you know -- </p><p> KHAN:  We'll see if it really gets beyond the margins and it's starting  tomorrow since you seem to think that tomorrow we'll going to see some pay  cuts coming back into people's -- </p><p> REGAN:  I mean -- OK.  Hang on Ford.  I want to keep going, Hamza.  I want  to hear the rest of why you say our economy is not doing well now?</p><p> KHAN:  Well, we got a lot of reasons why the economy is not doing well.  A  Fox poll just show, it just point out 71 percent of the Americans are  concerned about the economy still, that's what President Trump being in  office for a whole year.  On top of that, even though President Trump seems  to keep taking credit for President Obama's work on economy, we've seen  that the job growth in the last 12 months slow, rather than increase.  So  I'm not really sure what Donald Trump -- </p><p> REGAN:  Can I stop you.  And Ford, I'm going to get you in here in just a  second.  But you think that the upside we're seeing in terms of GDP growth  right now is a result of President Obama?  You think that the 26,000 on the  Dow right now is a result of President Obama?</p><p> KHAN:  President Obama made sure that our economy is growing for both Wall  Street and Main Street.  So I can tell you for a fact, everything we're  seeing right now is things to Barack Hussein Obama.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  And I can tell you for a fact that he had absolutely nothing  to do with growing the fundamentals in the economy.  And I can tell you for  a fact that Janet Yellen did.  Because when you print out much money you  see a little bit of bump up in the stock market.  But until you actually  have meaningful policy reform nothing happens fundamentally with overall  economic growth.  It wasn't until we got word of the tax cuts that things  really started to take off.  And that rumor got built into the market.  And  that optimism got fell into GDP.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do -- </p><p> REGAN:  Hang on.  Let Ford get in.  Go ahead, Ford.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do what Nancy Pelosi is doing and saying  the three million people getting raises is crumbs, let me tell you  something the Republicans are going to hold the House in 2018.  And to  Trish's point, look, unemployment at a 17-year low, consumer confidence and  small business confidence is through the roof.  And the reason why that is,  is because of optimism based on tax bill which has had a 20-point swing  over the last month, and deregulation policies put in by the Trump  administration, which are basically cut regulations on a 22 to one clip.   It was regulation that was stifling the American economy.  And it's  deregulation that essentially put us near three percent in GDP and  hopefully with the tax bill it will put us near four.  And frankly if you  guys want to keep touting that Obama did all of this, I promise you we're  going to hold the House -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KHAN:  I mean, you can promise what you want, but the polls are showing  right now the Democrats in the best position ever to take back the House.   And on top of that --</p><p> O'CONNELL:  No, they're not.  Actually, I'm going to now rebut you.</p><p> KHAN:  Hey, you can rebut me, but let me get to my point here, even within  the Republican Party there is no clear step going forward on how they're  going to get immigration reform through the House right now and through the  Senate on top of that.  And that's actually on front page of \"Politico\" as  I recall from today.</p><p> On top of that, only two percent --</p><p> REGAN:  So you're going to send all those people home because you won't end  chain migration.</p><p> KHAN:  Yes, I'm not sure if it's right for you to be going off about chain  migration.  We have a lot of great Americans who came here from every part  of the country.  And then, you yourself, Trish, called those 1.8 million  people a few years ago, to be Americans.  Therefore, why are we negotiating  about their right to be in their own country?  I'm just using your own  words.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's just stop you there.  Because what you are saying because  you're not going to allow him to end chain migration and you're not going  to allow him to end the lottery program, instead of by the way, one would  think you want to be strategic who comes here, but if you don't allow him  to end those things, then you're going to take 1.8 million people and send  them away?  I mean, Hamza, I don't know how you're going to explain that  one to your base?</p><p> KHAN:  Let me do this, Trish.  Do you think it's a good optic for the  Republican Party to be trying to send 1.8 million back to some other part  of the world that they have never actually been to.</p><p> REGAN:  Ah, so that's what it is.</p><p> KHAN:  We have so many innocent people in this country -- </p><p> REGAN:  That is what it is.  That is what it is.  You want to make it look,  as though the President -- OK, this feeds your narrative because if the  economy is doing as well as it has been doing, if it is growing at four  percent as CEO of JPMorgan suggests it will, a Democrat by the way, well  then, you will going to have nothing to run on except that he is the  bogeyman.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  That's exactly -- </p><p> KHAN:  Well, he is the bogeyman.  There is no argument there.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  No, he is not the bogeyman, Hamza.</p><p> KHAN:  Yes, he is the bogeyman.  He is going after people in our country  simply because they don't have the right color passport.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, I got to wrap it up there.  It is good to talk to you  both.  But I want to get back to Mercedes who is at the White House.  Thank  you so much, Hamza, spirited discussion, and Ford O'Connell.</p><p>Mercedes, you heard what Hamza was saying, I mean, I question whether they  are almost deliberately doing this, right?  Because they kind of like the  optics of the President deporting people, it feeds the narrative that  somehow big, bad, Donald Trump is going go knocking on everyone's door and  send kids home to Mexico or wherever else they may be from, and that upsets  people.  And people have an emotional reaction to that, therefore getting  out vote for the base.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  The Democrat party's platform right now is that of obstruction.   They don't want the President to succeed.  They are actually bitter because  of his success.  I mean, it's very clear that the President is trying his  best to work with both parties, to work with both the House and the Senate.   He is the one that has taken the lead on immigration reform.  He is the one  that's saying, I want permanent and compassionate solution to DACA  recipients.  At the same time he wants to protect Americans.  And that  means securing our border.  That means proposing a 25 billion-dollar trust  fund that would insure that we would have -- not only the physical barrier  but the personal and the technology needed in order to make sure that we're  able to control what's happening on the border.</p><p> I mean, we have to understand that through borders where we're seeing drugs  coming through.  There are individuals who are coming to the United States,  part of the MS-13 gang.  I mean they are -- and guess what?  Those MS-13  gang members they end up in communities that are primarily Latino or  African-American.  So we have to insure that there is safety along our  border.</p><p> And so I think for the President, what he is doing is, he is saying, let's  work together.  I'm extending my hand over to the Democrats.  Let's get to  a good point where we find a permanent solution to DACA as well as secure  the border.  And it is where mainstream America is at.  I mean -- </p><p> REGAN:  And by the way, you used to work with the Democrats right,  Mercedes.  I mean, we're going through the historical record, going back to  2006, you had Barack Obama -- Senator Barack Obama, you had Chuck Schumer,  you had -- forgive me, you had Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, I believe,  here we go here is the whole list.  Forgive me.  Joe Biden, all saying we  needed a fence.  They called it a fence as opposed to a wall back then in  2006.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  And you know who else agreed on ending chain migration?  It was  actually Feinstein, it was Schumer, it was all part of the \"gang of six\" or  eight, you know, that came out during the Senate in 2013.  There were  plenty of Democrats who agreed that there was a need to end chain  migration, end the diversity visa lottery program.  So there is a lot more  bipartisan room to grow there.  And I think the President is saying let's  just get a solution done, for the sake of DACA recipients, for the sake of  Americans, let's get to a point where we have a generous compromise and  really get this done.  The question will become, are Democrats simply going  to play politics.  Are they will to be come up with a true solution that  would benefit DACA recipients as well as insure we secure our border?</p><p> REGAN:  I think he might be able to get it done, really.  I mean, tax  reform went through.  And by the way, you heard our Democratic strategist  say this growing economy, booming economy has nothing to do with the  President.  All Barack Obama.  But that's what you're fighting?</p><p> SCHLAPP:  It was -- I don't know what planet he is living on.  But I can  just tell you that what we are seeing in terms of business confidence,  consumer confidence, when you just look at the deregulation alone and the  impact it had on our economy, that it is having on small business growth it  is impactful.  And for the President, it is not just, you know, we're  seeing the paycheck increases and the fact that average families, you're  going to see raises in their income, close to $4,000 a year.  That is  impactful.</p><p> And for Speaker Pelosi to call that crumbs, it just shows how elite and out  of touch she is with where every day Americans are.  And it's incredibly  unfortunate because what President Trump understands is the pulse of the  American people.  He understands the need of these families and the fact  that they are ones that should have money in their pockets for their  family.  And that at the end of the day, America is open for business, that  we can create jobs and keep our economy growing.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's keep it up, the Dow 26,170.  Mercedes Schlapp, thank you very  much.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Thank you very much.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, new developments everyone on the controversial  surveillance memo alleging abuses at the Justice Department, sources  telling Fox News, the President will declassify and release the memo to the  public.  We have all the Intel for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, everyone, new developments surrounding the controversial  memo on alleged surveillance abuses at the Justice Department.  Sources  telling Fox that President Trump will declassify that memo tomorrow despite  pleas from the FBI to keep it under wraps.  For more, let's go to our own  Blake Burman, who is at the White House.  Hi, Blake.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Trish.  And the White  House now publicly acknowledging that President Trump has indeed read this  four-page memo.  The President did not mention it or his decision at all  just within the past hour or so as he addressed congressional Republicans  in West Virginia.</p><p> The President now on his way back here to the White House.  And according  to sources the President is expected to declassify the memo.  It would then  be sent back, we were told, according to sources, back up to the Hill.  At  which point the House Intelligence Committee would get it.  And it is  believed at this point the likely timing is that it could be released at  some point by tomorrow morning.</p><p> One of the top Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, Peter King,  and he called this memo, just a little while ago, vital.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PETER KING (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN:  I don't want to oversell it.  I  agree with Trey Gowdy.  I think Republicans sometimes make a mistake of  oversell things.  But I'm going to say, this is vital, it's essentially to  the public to say and it's certainly important in the body of evidence to  be out there.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Democrats have been fighting this memo, some on the House  Intelligence Committee on the Democratic side as well trying to produce  their memo.  The lead Democrat is Adam Schiff, and he said just a little  while ago that this memo is the Republican attempt to tar the Department of  Justice and the FBI.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADAM SCHIFF (D), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I think the FBI is exactly  right.  This memo is really a spin on a -- not just a set of particular  documents but broader classified information than that.  That because of  serious and material omissions is inaccurate and gives a very misleading  impression.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Schiff is also involved, Trish, in another battle right now, about  this memo as he says there were material changes made to it by the  Republicans, led by Devin Nunes and his committee members, however a  spokesperson for Nunes saying that it is a bizarre distraction that Schiff  is now engaging in, and that they were not material changes, and said  rather grammatical fixes and changes that Democrats and FBI wanted to see.   Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Blake Burman.</p><p> Joining me right now is Fox News Legal Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p> And Judge, you say that this thing needs to be declassified ASAP.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I absolutely do.  I  actually want more than just this declassified because I want to see  Congressman Schiff's version of the raw intelligence data as well.</p><p> So here is how it happens.  The Republican staff members, not members of  the committee have top secret security clearances.  And they can see the  raw Intel, raw Intel is, transcripts of telephone conversations, copies of  text messages, copies of emails between and among Justice Department  figures and FBI agents, the last year of President Obama's administration  and first year of President Trump's administration.  From that, the  Republican staff concluded that there was a serious abuse of FISA  authorities.  There was spying that should not have occurred.  And there  was spying done for political purposes.  Congressman Schiff and his team  have looked at the same data and said there are no such abuses here.  So  not only do I want to see both memos, I want to see the raw data memos are  based.</p><p> REGAN:  Look, you may not be able to see the raw data because that would be  a security compromise.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Unless we just whited out the names of sources and certain  other information.  We can certainly see the texts and the emails and phone  conversations without knowing from whom they came because the American  public needs to know, who broke the law with the authority we gave them?   Who knew about the law being broken?  Who looked the other way?</p><p> Trish, these FISA abuses were known to the committee for the past eight  months.  They sat on it, until after FISA was extended by the Congress and  signed by the President.  They released it the next day.  Congress should  have had an opportunity to look at this stuff before it ignorantly voted to  extend FISA.</p><p> REGAN:  But, you know, I hear what you're saying because the problem right  now is we're in such a polarized political environment.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We are.</p><p> REGAN:  But the Republicans have one version of facts and the Democrats  have another version of these facts or interpretation I should say, that  you want people to be able to tell for themselves.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  And as a journalist I want to be able to see it because I want to  be able to make my own conclusions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- like -- I'm sure many Americans do.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  As journalists we want to be the eyes and ears of the public.   We want to read this document and be able to interpret them.  But when the  same raw material is subject to two interpretations that are 180 degrees  from each other, I also want to know which one of the politicians is  spinning at the truth, by looking at the truth, at data myself.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  I hear you.  So with all of this in mind, what could this  memo possibly tell us?  I mean, in which should we be taking it with a  grain of salt because of the political environment?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I hope that Congressman King's fears do not come to pass.  I  hope this is not been oversold.  I mean, we've been -- we've been  conditioned to expect something that is career-ending, KBG-like, over the  top.</p><p> Now perhaps to those of us that have been in law enforcement and today  monitor it won't be that catastrophic but to the American public it might,  I don't know.  What I think we're going to see is the use of intelligence  data for political purposes, if we see that, that is a very, very, grave  threat to freedom in America.</p><p> REGAN:  It is.  It is.  And some careers will be ended.  And maybe this is  the kind of thing, I don't know you go to jail for.  I mean if this is -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Could very well be.  One of our competing networks reported a  few minutes ago, fears in the White House that FBI Director Chris Wray may  resign if this is released.  Another headache the President doesn't need.</p><p> REGAN:  But I was looking at this, and as the FBI came out and said, we  don't want this, I thought, is this a CYA move?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It may very well be.  I cannot remember.  A person has been  watching this stuff for 40 years and last time the FBI publicly criticized  the White House and got away with it.  That is what we saw last night and  again this morning.</p><p> REGAN:  Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you so much.  It's always good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure, Trish.  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, markets right now, trading a bit lower, we just moved  into negative territory.  Wall Street is of course, awaiting tomorrow's  jobs report.  A biggie.  Everyone is going to be watching this.  What  happens to the unemployment rate?  What happens, I want to know to wages?   Have we started to see any of that filter into the wage data.  We're on it  for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, everyone, let's check out these markets.  You can see we  moved back into positive territory with the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are still  lower.  It's all happening, of course, a day ahead of the big jobs report  coming tomorrow.  We do have three big tech companies with earnings out and  you can see after the bell are due, Apple trading up a little bit, Amazon,  however, lower as well Alphabets, which is the fancy name for Google these  days.</p><p> Joining me with more on these markets we have Money Map Press Chief  Investment Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, it has gotten a little  volatile lately.  And I think back to -- </p><p> KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  It has.</p><p> REGAN:  -- State of the Union we were off more 300 points and, you know,  doing better now but, what's going on?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  Well, you know, I tell you, for one thing, volatility is  actually a good thing, Trish.  We forgotten, but this used to be normal not  too many years ago.  And second, you have to have buying and selling to  move higher it takes two to tango part on (ph).  And that's what we're  getting now.  Traders are simply adjusting the interest rates.  They're  readjusting the political expectations, taking a little money off the  table, which is absolutely normal.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, people talk about interest rates, and there's some  concern out there, I mean, keep in mind how much debt we have, and by the  way, how much sort of money printing if you would that they -- the Fed had  to go long on, there is concern about rising interest rates that are moving  too quickly and, potentially an economy that's not keeping up.  How much  concern is that to you right now?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  I think that's very valid point, but here is the thing.  The  Fed lost control a long time ago.  So take that out of the equation.  What  more important is traders are doing in the 10-year treasury in particular  is the key.  If it's rising quickly, that is a problem for the markets, if  it's moving in measured paces traders will naturally rein it in.  So unless  we get some sort of spike in that -- we really not going to have a problem.</p><p> REGAN:  I wonder if we can show a chart, maybe a year-to-date or one-year  chart on the 10-year right now.  I'm going to see if the team can get that  together for you.</p><p> But, you know, we're still under three percent on the 30 year.  Keith,  there is part of me, that really wonders why don't we have more inflation  on this economy or more of expectation of inflation.  The idea that, you  know, 30 years from now, you're basically going to be sort of right where  you are, doesn't make any sense?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  No, it doesn't.  I mean, you know, this is central banks at  work.  They're pumping so much money into the system.  And yet, we got all  kind of other things which would be topic for another discussion.</p><p> But here is the key, is that when you're moving all of that money, it's got  to go somewhere.  So what they're doing is creating a magnet for it in the  financial markets.  The markets really are not just yield, they're about  risk.  And that is how global traders assess these rates as risk not as a  return.</p><p> REGAN:  But Keith, how many jobs are you looking forward to tomorrow?</p><p> FITZ-GERALD:  You know, I think it's going to be a good number.  What I  want to see is composition.  I want to see wage rate increases.  That's the  key.</p><p> REGAN:  It might be early -- it might be early but we've seen a lot of  companies handing out raises.  I think you might get it more so in next  month's report.  But certainly we'll be looking for indications of that  tomorrow.  Keith Fitz-Gerald, thank you very much.</p><p> Vice President Mike Pence blasting Nancy Pelosi for her let them eat cake  attitude over tax reform.  She repeatedly calls those $1000 bonuses  \"crumbs.\"  She is doubling down on this.  I'm wondering it is just a little  like the deplorables comment.  Remember from Hillary Clinton, so tone deaf,  not getting how the average American feels because I will tell you, 1000  bucks is a lot of money to anyone in this country.  We've got more Intel on  this, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We were waiting for February, and then we got hit with these  corporations giving tremendous bonuses to everybody.  That Nancy Pelosi  called crumbs.  That was a bad.  That could be like deplorable, does that  make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words, they seem to have a  resemblance.  I hope it has the same meaning but she called it crumbs when  people are getting $2000 and $3,000 and $1000.  That is not crumbs.  That  is a lot of money.</p><p> MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Nancy Pelosi  predicted economic \"Armageddon.\"  Remember that one?  Well, that wasn't the  worst of it.  It's just amazing to me that after this tax cut passes, 3  million Americans get another thousand dollars in their pockets, in many  cases.  She actually described that as \"crumbs.\"  So if you're going to say  $1,000 is crumbs, you live in a different world than I live in.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  I'm laughing because did you hear the President equate crumbs with  the deplorable comment?  You know, it's funny, we have a conference call  every morning, our whole team here as we put the show together for you, and  I weigh in editorially, and my comment this morning was, Nancy Pelosi  calling this thing crumbs, it is a lot like Hillary Clinton referring to  deplorables.  I mean it that's kind of moment.  I never understand why she  would possibly double down on this or the likes of Chuck Schumer or Debbie  Wasserman Schultz would want to pick up on this, because it is that bad.   It is a deplorable kind of moment.  As though, the President was listening  to our conference call there.</p><p> Anyway, I'm teasing, but joining me right now, a member of the Trump Re- Election Advisory Board, Gina Loudon.</p><p> And Gina, I mean, I don't get it.  It is so tone deaf to say that a  thousand dollars is crumbs.  Much like Hillary Clinton calling Trump  supporters deplorables, I think this is going to come back to haunt them in  a pretty massive way.  They clearly don't have very good advisors around  them, shall we say.</p><p> GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  Well, let's  say, Trish, that maybe we could give Nancy the benefit of the doubt and she  was being honest in saying Armageddon because it may truly be Armageddon  for the Democrat Party.</p><p> You know, their fund-raising is at record lows.  And while the RNC, of  course, is doing great with fund-raising especially after that killer State  of the Union address by the President.  And so, you know, maybe, Nancy can  say she is sorry.  Maybe she can repent.  She could donate her crumbs to  her church.  Or maybe she donates them to the DNC since they're in such  need.  Who knows?  For Nancy, this is her own little reality.  This is not  reality that the most of us happen to live in.</p><p> REGAN:  But I mean talking about the Marie Antoinette, if you would, of the  Democratic Party right now, I mean, not only that she say once, she then  echoed it and she has got her minions out there echoing at as well.</p><p> You know, I just, I think they don't get it.  I understand that they don't  really like seeing the Dow at 26,000.  They don't really like the lack of  regulation or the idea that Americans are going to get a raise beginning  today, right?  Because this is threatening to their existence, and somehow  Gina, I think what it tells you is that the kind of conservative economic  principles that this administration embraces, they actually work.</p><p> LOUDON:  Right.  And, it really puts them at odds, if you will with the  entire American people.  I mean the only way Democrats actually win with a  doubling down that you mentioned, by Nancy Pelosi and rest of the  Democrats, against the American economy is if somehow they can make the  American economy go south and then celebrate that fact.  That puts them in  direct odds with the American people, which is where they happen to find  themselves on a lot of issues like illegal immigration and other things.</p><p> But, Trish, this is a solid lack of vision for this party.  It is like they  don't recognize -- like, they can't look 10 miles down the road and say,  this might not go well for us, but this is become a pattern with the  Democratic Party, to have a lack of vision, and I believe it is why we see  this sorts of implosions like this, and the doubling down of those same  implosions over and over again.</p><p> REGAN:  Gina Loudon, well, he stole their thunder, their economic thunder  any way.  It's going to be hard for them to fight what is now becoming a  rising tide here of economic optimism.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> I just want to point out to the viewer that the President just landing, you  can see him get in the helicopter there, he just landed back at Joint Base  Andrews after having been at that Republican retreat at Greenbrier Resort  there in West Virginia.</p><p> Anyway, a lot is going on right now with Democrats blasting the President  over immigration reform.  Even calling him, what they just love to call  him, a racist.  But Democrats -- I can tell you they were singing a very  different tune.  We were talking about this earlier with Mercedes Schlapp.</p><p> You know, just a few years ago you had the likes of Barack Obama, Hillary  Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, all voting for a, \"fence.\"  They wanted  stronger borders.  We have the tapes of even President Clinton calling for  it when he was in office.  We're showing it to you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, everyone, Democrats, they're blasting President Trump's  immigration proposal, some even calling it racist.  But, I just want you to  hear what Bill Clinton said about immigration back in 1995, followed by  what President Trump said just the other night.  It is important to watch  these together.  Here we go.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  All-Americans, not  only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country  are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our  country.  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure  our borders more, by hiring record number of new border guard, by deporting  twice as many criminal aliens as ever before.</p><p> TRUMP:  For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into  our most vulnerable communities.</p><p> Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes  that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our  country.  We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration  laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  Let's just get this straight, right?  It is somehow OK for  Bill Clinton to call for more border security and the deportation of  illegals, but not OK for President Trump?</p><p> Joining me right now is former Obama Foreign Policy Advisor David Tafuri.   David, I don't get it.  Because the party he represents?</p><p> DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Look, Trish, I'm with  you on this, first of all those two speeches are remarkably similar in  those parts.  And you're right, there should be sort of a philosophical  statement that we can accept and provide some compassion for people who are  here already illegal I like the participants in DACA, known as the  DREAMers.  In return we have to increase border security.  That is what  President Clinton said in 1995.  That is what President Trump.</p><p> President Trump has proposed a compromise on immigration, which I think is  a fair compromise.  It means let's give generous acceptance for DACA  participants, let's create a pathway to citizenship for them.  In return,  let's put a lot of money into border security, including perhaps his wall.   That is something that Democrats and Republicans should get behind.  The  problem is, there are Republicans in the House that are not going to  support that, and there are some Democrats as you highlighted who also  don't support it.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, I would also point out that Democrats historically have  supported, \"wall\" although back then in 2006 it was called a fence, OK, so  you had Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Charles Schumer all  saying, yes, Fence Act.  It was actually called, \"The Secure Fence Act of  2006.\"</p><p> I guess, what frustrates me, and I appreciate that you also are frustrated  by this, David.  What frustrates me is the hypocrisy here.  That, you know,  you know it is OK if Chuck Schumer is proposing it but just not OK if  Donald Trump is proposing it.</p><p> TAFURI:  Look, nobody should be against securing our borders.  And if that  requires $25 billion, which sound like a lot, but if that money is going to  be spent well and it's not going to be wasted and it's going to be used in  a way that effectively and efficiently secures our borders, we ought to  support that.  In return, the Democrats should get some provisions that  make it easier for people who are already here, who are contributing to our  economy, who are employed, who are in school, to get on a pathway to  citizenship.</p><p> REGAN:  He has offered that.  But here is the problem.  These are the other  sticking points.  And by the way I just point out interesting little fact  for everyone, David, the proposed wall back in 2006 was $50 billion that  the Democrats have come up with.  And the President's wall is $25 billion,  so double the cost even though it was that many years ago.</p><p> But David, it's not just having border issues at stake.  It's also the  matter of chain migration and the lottery system, which hasn't benefited  our country.  I mean, I don't understand the aversion some Democrats have  to us saying, OK, we need doctors, we need nurses, we need factory workers,  we need domestic help, we need certain things, and therefore we're going to  seek those people that can fit those needs?</p><p> TAFURI:  Trish, you're right.  Democrats -- some Democrats are also opposed  to aspects of Trump's compromise including the chain migration and  including the lottery visas.</p><p> Now, in the lottery visas I think Trump's proposal is fair, which is let's  do merit-based immigration, rather than the lottery visas.  On the chain  migration, I think Democrats can also get behind limiting chain migration.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.</p><p> TAFURI:  In fact, they were willing to agree in limiting chain migration  for the DACA, DREAMers participants.  But I think the problem is, the  proposal Trump has made limits it for all immigrants.  So let's say you're  an engineer from India, you come to the U.S., you work for Google, and you  can't bring your parents.</p><p> REGAN:  I'm coming up against a break.  Not to break you up, David but I'm  coming up against the break.  I do appreciate that it sound like there is a  little more room than one would have thought, here you are, David Tafuri, a  former member of the Obama administration.  Thank you so much, good to see  you.</p><p> The Democrats putting out Congressman Joe Kennedy III to give the party's  official response to President Trump's State of the Union address, but is a  Kennedy really the best face of a party of rich white men with a very  famous last name which harkens back to the past?  Is this all they got?   Historian Doug Wead is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right, well I'm sure you saw Joe Kennedy III giving the  Democratic response to the State of the Union.  Just ask him, do the  Democrats really have to trot out a Kennedy?  Is that all they got?</p><p> Joining me right now is Presidential Historian Doug Wead, Author of the  book, \"Game of Thorns.\"</p><p> Doug, great to see -- what do you make of this?  I mean, look, you know, no  offense against him.  Thank goodness by the way, they had somebody younger  than who they typically have.  I mean, they need fresh blood, but -- but a  Kennedy?</p><p> DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Well, I thought it was great.  They  need to do something.  I thought it was very ironic, Trish, that Joe  Kennedy III was using the same arguments against Trump's economic plan that  JFK's enemies used against him, 56 years before.  Boy, how the world has  changed.</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.  You know, Doug, you make a good point, because I've always  said, you know, economics doesn't need to be so political in that JFK cut  taxes, he did exactly what the President managed to get done with tax  reform, and here, you know, the next generation is saying something very,  very different.</p><p> WEAD:  Yes, and when the Joe Kennedy III argued it's all for rich people,  when they said that to JFK, you remember very famously he used the new  England proverb that had been passed to him by Ted Sorensen, he said a  rising tide raises all boats.  So Kennedy defended himself and Joe Kennedy  III in Congress used another argument against Trump's tax reform.  He said  that this is going to drive up the national debt, and that's what  Republicans used as an argument against JFK.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.</p><p> WEAD:  And the Kennedy -- </p><p> REGAN:  And it's funny how times have changed because I'm thinking -- you  don't know how many Democrats I've said since when did you become a fiscal  conservative?</p><p> WEAD:  And the fact that he's catholic, I think, is something the Democrats  need.  They lost the vote in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, a  lot of it was because they had trashed the catholic vote in those e-mails  with Podesta and Bill Clinton had begged Hillary to reach out to the  catholic vote, and they just absolutely wouldn't do it.  So maybe the  Democrat Party is coming around a little bit, 22 percent of those voters in  2016 were catholic.  Only one percent were Muslim, which they spent so much  time and money trying to reach out to.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, Doug, I grew up as Irish Catholic and my father came from  a very big Irish Catholic family, and you were a Democrat like you were  Irish like you were catholic.  I mean, that was part of that generation.   And I think that Donald Trump has really gotten in there and stolen that  thunder, if you would, right out from under the Democrats.  So maybe they  think a Kennedy can bring them back.  I would recommend he get the right  economic policies.</p><p> Doug, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> WEAD:  Good to see you, too.  Thank you for having me.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, Liz Claman, we're sending it your way.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Thank you so much, Neil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, the President is blasting Democrats for  refusing to work with Republicans, saying the left would rather see America  fail than thrive.  But he vows that he will not let Democrats get in the  way of moving forward with his America First agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All of this as we see a pretty well day on Wall Street.  But hey we're in  the green right now, up 43 points there off the highs of the session.  We  had been down earlier in the session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome to the Intelligence Report.</p><p>The President speaking to Republican law makers that their annual retreat  there in West Virginia at the Greenbrier just a short time ago and he  praise the Republicans for passing tax reform, pretty big deal but he is  warning that Republicans must work with Democrats to get any kind of  comprehensive immigration reform past, can they get it done?</p><p>We are asking Assistant to President Mercedes Schlapp.  Plus, the  classified FISA memo detailing possible abuses at the Justice Department  maybe release tomorrow and of course, you have the left are arguing against  the release saying there will be national security risks if this memo  becomes public.</p><p>But, Judge Napolitano, he is not buying that one bit.  He is here and he is  going to explain why.  We need to let the American public decide for  themselves.  That is happening in just a few minutes.</p><p>But first, let's go to Adam Shapiro, he is in West Virginia there where a  short time ago the President delivered what I would call a powerful America  First speech.  Hi, Adam.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDEN:  Yes.  Well, he is always America  First, Trish and this was no different.  He spoke to the Republicans  gathered here in West Virginia, talking about tax reform, talking about  immigration reform, talking about infrastructure.</p><p>But it was specifically his message to Democrats saying that the  administration and Republicans will continue to attempt to pass bipartisan  legislation but they have to be met in the middle and it doesn't appear  according to the President that Democrats want to do that.  He cited the  fact that he is offered a path to citizenship for 1.8 million people who  have come to the United States illegally.  And he says the Democrats that  he did this to see if the Democrats were serious about using immigration to  solve this problem or using immigration reform as political point.  Here is  what he said specifically about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They talk a good game  with DACA but they don't produce.  And so either they come on board, or  we'll just going to really work and we're going to get more people so we  can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass in a much easier fashion  legislation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Now he also talked about the result of the successful tax reform  and pointing out that it has put $2,000 on average back into the pockets of  regular people not only here in West Virginia but across the country.</p><p>There is the issue that the first $24,000 of income for a married couple is  no longer taxed to the federal level.  So that's just part of the message.   But then, he went on the attack against Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader  in the House, pointing out that when she calls the bonuses, that companies  have announced for their employees, the $1000 bonus, which she calls that  crumbs, that she is missing the point.</p><p>Here is the President in his own words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Nancy Pelosi called crumbs.  That was a bad -- that could be like  deplorable?  Does that make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words  they seem to have a resemblance.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  And so the President is now on his way back to Washington.   Trish?</p><p>REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Adam.</p><p>Joining me right now with reaction, White House Senior Advisor for  Strategic Communications and Assistant to the President, Mercedes Schlapp.   Good to see you, Mercedes.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC  COMMUNICATIONS  AND ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT:  Hi, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, he laid out an agenda.  He did so in the State of the  Union the other night and immigration reform is a big part of it.  But it  doesn't sound like the Democrats are willing to give you guys an inch on  this.  So how are you going to get past that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, clearly, it seems that the Democrats want to make  immigration reform a political wedge issue and not be serious about solving  -- </p><p>REGAN:  Oh, it looks like we may have lost Mercedes Schlapp.  We'll try and  get her back momentarily.  But as she was saying it's become increasing a  political wedge issue.  And that's one of the problems here because, you  know, as far as Democrats go, I don't know how they're going to go out  there and look at their constituents and look at their base and say, well,  you know, the President, he offered a deal for 1.8 million Americans to  have some form of legitimacy, in fact citizenship but we turned it down  because you know what?  We're not going to have that wall and we're going  to let him end chain migration, and we're not going to let him end the  lottery program.</p><p>How does that make any sense?  They want to send all these people out of  the country when the President is willing to give a deal?  I mean  politically-speaking it looks as though the Republicans have upper side on  this one.</p><p>Joining me right now with more context, Republican Strategist, Ford  O'Connell and Democratic Strategist Hamza Khan.</p><p>Good to see you guys.</p><p>FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good to see you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  Ford, I'll start with you.  And again, we're going to try and get  Mercedes back with us.  It looks like the satellite feed went down.</p><p>But Ford, just the politics here, and I understand there are members of the  President's base that don't like the idea of extending citizenship to all  these people but he is putting forth a deal.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  He is -- </p><p>REGAN:  And if the Democrats don't go along with it, then they're going to  deport all of these individuals?</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Well look, what the President is proposing is what many -- 54  Senate Democrats agreed to in 2013, which is a border fence, ending the  diversity visa lottery program and putting curbs on chain migration.  And  essentially 65 percent of Americans in the latest Harvard-Harris Poll agree  with the President's position.</p><p>He is trying to make a deal.  Unfortunately, Democrats are going to  continue to basically resist, obstruct, and sit on their hands.  It's  really an unfortunate situation because President Trump is absolutely  right.  We going to build on that powerful State of the Union continue so  in the tax bill and deliver for the American people on immigration and  infrastructure.</p><p>REGAN:  Hamza, the Democrats are going to have tough a tough time if  economy the continue doing as well as it's been doing.  What do you think  it's going to happens in '18?</p><p>HAMZA KHAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, first of all, let's talk about  the economy for a second.  The current tax bill that was put through  Congress really quickly and is become law now has only benefited about two  percent of all Americans.  Only 1.94 percent of Americans have gotten any  sort of bonus from their jobs, resulting from the tax cuts, whatsoever.</p><p>REGAN:  You know it just happened.</p><p>KHAN:  It just happened, the only two percent and so quickly.  I mean,  we've been talking all the time about how great this tax is going to be for  the American people.  It hasn't trickled down to anyone.  It seems to me a  trickle up.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's only been in place for a few weeks.  And by the way,  starting tomorrow, Americans are going to be getting raises as a result of  this, more money coming back to them in their paychecks.  So -- </p><p>KHAN:  Well, let's see if that really comes out.</p><p>REGAN:  I guess that argument only going to hold for, you know -- </p><p>KHAN:  We'll see if it really gets beyond the margins and it's starting  tomorrow since you seem to think that tomorrow we'll going to see some pay  cuts coming back into people's -- </p><p>REGAN:  I mean -- OK.  Hang on Ford.  I want to keep going, Hamza.  I want  to hear the rest of why you say our economy is not doing well now?</p><p>KHAN:  Well, we got a lot of reasons why the economy is not doing well.  A  Fox poll just show, it just point out 71 percent of the Americans are  concerned about the economy still, that's what President Trump being in  office for a whole year.  On top of that, even though President Trump seems  to keep taking credit for President Obama's work on economy, we've seen  that the job growth in the last 12 months slow, rather than increase.  So  I'm not really sure what Donald Trump -- </p><p>REGAN:  Can I stop you.  And Ford, I'm going to get you in here in just a  second.  But you think that the upside we're seeing in terms of GDP growth  right now is a result of President Obama?  You think that the 26,000 on the  Dow right now is a result of President Obama?</p><p>KHAN:  President Obama made sure that our economy is growing for both Wall  Street and Main Street.  So I can tell you for a fact, everything we're  seeing right now is things to Barack Hussein Obama.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  And I can tell you for a fact that he had absolutely nothing  to do with growing the fundamentals in the economy.  And I can tell you for  a fact that Janet Yellen did.  Because when you print out much money you  see a little bit of bump up in the stock market.  But until you actually  have meaningful policy reform nothing happens fundamentally with overall  economic growth.  It wasn't until we got word of the tax cuts that things  really started to take off.  And that rumor got built into the market.  And  that optimism got fell into GDP.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do -- </p><p>REGAN:  Hang on.  Let Ford get in.  Go ahead, Ford.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do what Nancy Pelosi is doing and saying  the three million people getting raises is crumbs, let me tell you  something the Republicans are going to hold the House in 2018.  And to  Trish's point, look, unemployment at a 17-year low, consumer confidence and  small business confidence is through the roof.  And the reason why that is,  is because of optimism based on tax bill which has had a 20-point swing  over the last month, and deregulation policies put in by the Trump  administration, which are basically cut regulations on a 22 to one clip.   It was regulation that was stifling the American economy.  And it's  deregulation that essentially put us near three percent in GDP and  hopefully with the tax bill it will put us near four.  And frankly if you  guys want to keep touting that Obama did all of this, I promise you we're  going to hold the House -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KHAN:  I mean, you can promise what you want, but the polls are showing  right now the Democrats in the best position ever to take back the House.   And on top of that --</p><p>O'CONNELL:  No, they're not.  Actually, I'm going to now rebut you.</p><p>KHAN:  Hey, you can rebut me, but let me get to my point here, even within  the Republican Party there is no clear step going forward on how they're  going to get immigration reform through the House right now and through the  Senate on top of that.  And that's actually on front page of \"Politico\" as  I recall from today.</p><p>On top of that, only two percent --</p><p>REGAN:  So you're going to send all those people home because you won't end  chain migration.</p><p>KHAN:  Yes, I'm not sure if it's right for you to be going off about chain  migration.  We have a lot of great Americans who came here from every part  of the country.  And then, you yourself, Trish, called those 1.8 million  people a few years ago, to be Americans.  Therefore, why are we negotiating  about their right to be in their own country?  I'm just using your own  words.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's just stop you there.  Because what you are saying because  you're not going to allow him to end chain migration and you're not going  to allow him to end the lottery program, instead of by the way, one would  think you want to be strategic who comes here, but if you don't allow him  to end those things, then you're going to take 1.8 million people and send  them away?  I mean, Hamza, I don't know how you're going to explain that  one to your base?</p><p>KHAN:  Let me do this, Trish.  Do you think it's a good optic for the  Republican Party to be trying to send 1.8 million back to some other part  of the world that they have never actually been to.</p><p>REGAN:  Ah, so that's what it is.</p><p>KHAN:  We have so many innocent people in this country -- </p><p>REGAN:  That is what it is.  That is what it is.  You want to make it look,  as though the President -- OK, this feeds your narrative because if the  economy is doing as well as it has been doing, if it is growing at four  percent as CEO of JPMorgan suggests it will, a Democrat by the way, well  then, you will going to have nothing to run on except that he is the  bogeyman.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  That's exactly -- </p><p>KHAN:  Well, he is the bogeyman.  There is no argument there.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  No, he is not the bogeyman, Hamza.</p><p>KHAN:  Yes, he is the bogeyman.  He is going after people in our country  simply because they don't have the right color passport.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, I got to wrap it up there.  It is good to talk to you  both.  But I want to get back to Mercedes who is at the White House.  Thank  you so much, Hamza, spirited discussion, and Ford O'Connell.</p><p>Mercedes, you heard what Hamza was saying, I mean, I question whether they  are almost deliberately doing this, right?  Because they kind of like the  optics of the President deporting people, it feeds the narrative that  somehow big, bad, Donald Trump is going go knocking on everyone's door and  send kids home to Mexico or wherever else they may be from, and that upsets  people.  And people have an emotional reaction to that, therefore getting  out vote for the base.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  The Democrat party's platform right now is that of obstruction.   They don't want the President to succeed.  They are actually bitter because  of his success.  I mean, it's very clear that the President is trying his  best to work with both parties, to work with both the House and the Senate.   He is the one that has taken the lead on immigration reform.  He is the one  that's saying, I want permanent and compassionate solution to DACA  recipients.  At the same time he wants to protect Americans.  And that  means securing our border.  That means proposing a 25 billion-dollar trust  fund that would insure that we would have -- not only the physical barrier  but the personal and the technology needed in order to make sure that we're  able to control what's happening on the border.</p><p>I mean, we have to understand that through borders where we're seeing drugs  coming through.  There are individuals who are coming to the United States,  part of the MS-13 gang.  I mean they are -- and guess what?  Those MS-13  gang members they end up in communities that are primarily Latino or  African-American.  So we have to insure that there is safety along our  border.</p><p>And so I think for the President, what he is doing is, he is saying, let's  work together.  I'm extending my hand over to the Democrats.  Let's get to  a good point where we find a permanent solution to DACA as well as secure  the border.  And it is where mainstream America is at.  I mean -- </p><p>REGAN:  And by the way, you used to work with the Democrats right,  Mercedes.  I mean, we're going through the historical record, going back to  2006, you had Barack Obama -- Senator Barack Obama, you had Chuck Schumer,  you had -- forgive me, you had Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, I believe,  here we go here is the whole list.  Forgive me.  Joe Biden, all saying we  needed a fence.  They called it a fence as opposed to a wall back then in  2006.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you know who else agreed on ending chain migration?  It was  actually Feinstein, it was Schumer, it was all part of the \"gang of six\" or  eight, you know, that came out during the Senate in 2013.  There were  plenty of Democrats who agreed that there was a need to end chain  migration, end the diversity visa lottery program.  So there is a lot more  bipartisan room to grow there.  And I think the President is saying let's  just get a solution done, for the sake of DACA recipients, for the sake of  Americans, let's get to a point where we have a generous compromise and  really get this done.  The question will become, are Democrats simply going  to play politics.  Are they will to be come up with a true solution that  would benefit DACA recipients as well as insure we secure our border?</p><p>REGAN:  I think he might be able to get it done, really.  I mean, tax  reform went through.  And by the way, you heard our Democratic strategist  say this growing economy, booming economy has nothing to do with the  President.  All Barack Obama.  But that's what you're fighting?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It was -- I don't know what planet he is living on.  But I can  just tell you that what we are seeing in terms of business confidence,  consumer confidence, when you just look at the deregulation alone and the  impact it had on our economy, that it is having on small business growth it  is impactful.  And for the President, it is not just, you know, we're  seeing the paycheck increases and the fact that average families, you're  going to see raises in their income, close to $4,000 a year.  That is  impactful.</p><p>And for Speaker Pelosi to call that crumbs, it just shows how elite and out  of touch she is with where every day Americans are.  And it's incredibly  unfortunate because what President Trump understands is the pulse of the  American people.  He understands the need of these families and the fact  that they are ones that should have money in their pockets for their  family.  And that at the end of the day, America is open for business, that  we can create jobs and keep our economy growing.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's keep it up, the Dow 26,170.  Mercedes Schlapp, thank you very  much.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thank you very much.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, new developments everyone on the controversial  surveillance memo alleging abuses at the Justice Department, sources  telling Fox News, the President will declassify and release the memo to the  public.  We have all the Intel for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, new developments surrounding the controversial  memo on alleged surveillance abuses at the Justice Department.  Sources  telling Fox that President Trump will declassify that memo tomorrow despite  pleas from the FBI to keep it under wraps.  For more, let's go to our own  Blake Burman, who is at the White House.  Hi, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Trish.  And the White  House now publicly acknowledging that President Trump has indeed read this  four-page memo.  The President did not mention it or his decision at all  just within the past hour or so as he addressed congressional Republicans  in West Virginia.</p><p>The President now on his way back here to the White House.  And according  to sources the President is expected to declassify the memo.  It would then  be sent back, we were told, according to sources, back up to the Hill.  At  which point the House Intelligence Committee would get it.  And it is  believed at this point the likely timing is that it could be released at  some point by tomorrow morning.</p><p>One of the top Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, Peter King,  and he called this memo, just a little while ago, vital.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER KING (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN:  I don't want to oversell it.  I  agree with Trey Gowdy.  I think Republicans sometimes make a mistake of  oversell things.  But I'm going to say, this is vital, it's essentially to  the public to say and it's certainly important in the body of evidence to  be out there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Democrats have been fighting this memo, some on the House  Intelligence Committee on the Democratic side as well trying to produce  their memo.  The lead Democrat is Adam Schiff, and he said just a little  while ago that this memo is the Republican attempt to tar the Department of  Justice and the FBI.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM SCHIFF (D), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I think the FBI is exactly  right.  This memo is really a spin on a -- not just a set of particular  documents but broader classified information than that.  That because of  serious and material omissions is inaccurate and gives a very misleading  impression.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Schiff is also involved, Trish, in another battle right now, about  this memo as he says there were material changes made to it by the  Republicans, led by Devin Nunes and his committee members, however a  spokesperson for Nunes saying that it is a bizarre distraction that Schiff  is now engaging in, and that they were not material changes, and said  rather grammatical fixes and changes that Democrats and FBI wanted to see.   Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Blake Burman.</p><p>Joining me right now is Fox News Legal Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>And Judge, you say that this thing needs to be declassified ASAP.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I absolutely do.  I  actually want more than just this declassified because I want to see  Congressman Schiff's version of the raw intelligence data as well.</p><p>So here is how it happens.  The Republican staff members, not members of  the committee have top secret security clearances.  And they can see the  raw Intel, raw Intel is, transcripts of telephone conversations, copies of  text messages, copies of emails between and among Justice Department  figures and FBI agents, the last year of President Obama's administration  and first year of President Trump's administration.  From that, the  Republican staff concluded that there was a serious abuse of FISA  authorities.  There was spying that should not have occurred.  And there  was spying done for political purposes.  Congressman Schiff and his team  have looked at the same data and said there are no such abuses here.  So  not only do I want to see both memos, I want to see the raw data memos are  based.</p><p>REGAN:  Look, you may not be able to see the raw data because that would be  a security compromise.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Unless we just whited out the names of sources and certain  other information.  We can certainly see the texts and the emails and phone  conversations without knowing from whom they came because the American  public needs to know, who broke the law with the authority we gave them?   Who knew about the law being broken?  Who looked the other way?</p><p>Trish, these FISA abuses were known to the committee for the past eight  months.  They sat on it, until after FISA was extended by the Congress and  signed by the President.  They released it the next day.  Congress should  have had an opportunity to look at this stuff before it ignorantly voted to  extend FISA.</p><p>REGAN:  But, you know, I hear what you're saying because the problem right  now is we're in such a polarized political environment.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We are.</p><p>REGAN:  But the Republicans have one version of facts and the Democrats  have another version of these facts or interpretation I should say, that  you want people to be able to tell for themselves.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And as a journalist I want to be able to see it because I want to  be able to make my own conclusions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- like -- I'm sure many Americans do.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  As journalists we want to be the eyes and ears of the public.   We want to read this document and be able to interpret them.  But when the  same raw material is subject to two interpretations that are 180 degrees  from each other, I also want to know which one of the politicians is  spinning at the truth, by looking at the truth, at data myself.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  I hear you.  So with all of this in mind, what could this  memo possibly tell us?  I mean, in which should we be taking it with a  grain of salt because of the political environment?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I hope that Congressman King's fears do not come to pass.  I  hope this is not been oversold.  I mean, we've been -- we've been  conditioned to expect something that is career-ending, KBG-like, over the  top.</p><p>Now perhaps to those of us that have been in law enforcement and today  monitor it won't be that catastrophic but to the American public it might,  I don't know.  What I think we're going to see is the use of intelligence  data for political purposes, if we see that, that is a very, very, grave  threat to freedom in America.</p><p>REGAN:  It is.  It is.  And some careers will be ended.  And maybe this is  the kind of thing, I don't know you go to jail for.  I mean if this is -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Could very well be.  One of our competing networks reported a  few minutes ago, fears in the White House that FBI Director Chris Wray may  resign if this is released.  Another headache the President doesn't need.</p><p>REGAN:  But I was looking at this, and as the FBI came out and said, we  don't want this, I thought, is this a CYA move?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It may very well be.  I cannot remember.  A person has been  watching this stuff for 40 years and last time the FBI publicly criticized  the White House and got away with it.  That is what we saw last night and  again this morning.</p><p>REGAN:  Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you so much.  It's always good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure, Trish.  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, markets right now, trading a bit lower, we just moved  into negative territory.  Wall Street is of course, awaiting tomorrow's  jobs report.  A biggie.  Everyone is going to be watching this.  What  happens to the unemployment rate?  What happens, I want to know to wages?   Have we started to see any of that filter into the wage data.  We're on it  for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, let's check out these markets.  You can see we  moved back into positive territory with the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are still  lower.  It's all happening, of course, a day ahead of the big jobs report  coming tomorrow.  We do have three big tech companies with earnings out and  you can see after the bell are due, Apple trading up a little bit, Amazon,  however, lower as well Alphabets, which is the fancy name for Google these  days.</p><p>Joining me with more on these markets we have Money Map Press Chief  Investment Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, it has gotten a little  volatile lately.  And I think back to -- </p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  It has.</p><p>REGAN:  -- State of the Union we were off more 300 points and, you know,  doing better now but, what's going on?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  Well, you know, I tell you, for one thing, volatility is  actually a good thing, Trish.  We forgotten, but this used to be normal not  too many years ago.  And second, you have to have buying and selling to  move higher it takes two to tango part on (ph).  And that's what we're  getting now.  Traders are simply adjusting the interest rates.  They're  readjusting the political expectations, taking a little money off the  table, which is absolutely normal.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, people talk about interest rates, and there's some  concern out there, I mean, keep in mind how much debt we have, and by the  way, how much sort of money printing if you would that they -- the Fed had  to go long on, there is concern about rising interest rates that are moving  too quickly and, potentially an economy that's not keeping up.  How much  concern is that to you right now?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  I think that's very valid point, but here is the thing.  The  Fed lost control a long time ago.  So take that out of the equation.  What  more important is traders are doing in the 10-year treasury in particular  is the key.  If it's rising quickly, that is a problem for the markets, if  it's moving in measured paces traders will naturally rein it in.  So unless  we get some sort of spike in that -- we really not going to have a problem.</p><p>REGAN:  I wonder if we can show a chart, maybe a year-to-date or one-year  chart on the 10-year right now.  I'm going to see if the team can get that  together for you.</p><p>But, you know, we're still under three percent on the 30 year.  Keith,  there is part of me, that really wonders why don't we have more inflation  on this economy or more of expectation of inflation.  The idea that, you  know, 30 years from now, you're basically going to be sort of right where  you are, doesn't make any sense?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  No, it doesn't.  I mean, you know, this is central banks at  work.  They're pumping so much money into the system.  And yet, we got all  kind of other things which would be topic for another discussion.</p><p>But here is the key, is that when you're moving all of that money, it's got  to go somewhere.  So what they're doing is creating a magnet for it in the  financial markets.  The markets really are not just yield, they're about  risk.  And that is how global traders assess these rates as risk not as a  return.</p><p>REGAN:  But Keith, how many jobs are you looking forward to tomorrow?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  You know, I think it's going to be a good number.  What I  want to see is composition.  I want to see wage rate increases.  That's the  key.</p><p>REGAN:  It might be early -- it might be early but we've seen a lot of  companies handing out raises.  I think you might get it more so in next  month's report.  But certainly we'll be looking for indications of that  tomorrow.  Keith Fitz-Gerald, thank you very much.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence blasting Nancy Pelosi for her let them eat cake  attitude over tax reform.  She repeatedly calls those $1000 bonuses  \"crumbs.\"  She is doubling down on this.  I'm wondering it is just a little  like the deplorables comment.  Remember from Hillary Clinton, so tone deaf,  not getting how the average American feels because I will tell you, 1000  bucks is a lot of money to anyone in this country.  We've got more Intel on  this, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We were waiting for February, and then we got hit with these  corporations giving tremendous bonuses to everybody.  That Nancy Pelosi  called crumbs.  That was a bad.  That could be like deplorable, does that  make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words, they seem to have a  resemblance.  I hope it has the same meaning but she called it crumbs when  people are getting $2000 and $3,000 and $1000.  That is not crumbs.  That  is a lot of money.</p><p>MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Nancy Pelosi  predicted economic \"Armageddon.\"  Remember that one?  Well, that wasn't the  worst of it.  It's just amazing to me that after this tax cut passes, 3  million Americans get another thousand dollars in their pockets, in many  cases.  She actually described that as \"crumbs.\"  So if you're going to say  $1,000 is crumbs, you live in a different world than I live in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  I'm laughing because did you hear the President equate crumbs with  the deplorable comment?  You know, it's funny, we have a conference call  every morning, our whole team here as we put the show together for you, and  I weigh in editorially, and my comment this morning was, Nancy Pelosi  calling this thing crumbs, it is a lot like Hillary Clinton referring to  deplorables.  I mean it that's kind of moment.  I never understand why she  would possibly double down on this or the likes of Chuck Schumer or Debbie  Wasserman Schultz would want to pick up on this, because it is that bad.   It is a deplorable kind of moment.  As though, the President was listening  to our conference call there.</p><p>Anyway, I'm teasing, but joining me right now, a member of the Trump Re- Election Advisory Board, Gina Loudon.</p><p>And Gina, I mean, I don't get it.  It is so tone deaf to say that a  thousand dollars is crumbs.  Much like Hillary Clinton calling Trump  supporters deplorables, I think this is going to come back to haunt them in  a pretty massive way.  They clearly don't have very good advisors around  them, shall we say.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  Well, let's  say, Trish, that maybe we could give Nancy the benefit of the doubt and she  was being honest in saying Armageddon because it may truly be Armageddon  for the Democrat Party.</p><p>You know, their fund-raising is at record lows.  And while the RNC, of  course, is doing great with fund-raising especially after that killer State  of the Union address by the President.  And so, you know, maybe, Nancy can  say she is sorry.  Maybe she can repent.  She could donate her crumbs to  her church.  Or maybe she donates them to the DNC since they're in such  need.  Who knows?  For Nancy, this is her own little reality.  This is not  reality that the most of us happen to live in.</p><p>REGAN:  But I mean talking about the Marie Antoinette, if you would, of the  Democratic Party right now, I mean, not only that she say once, she then  echoed it and she has got her minions out there echoing at as well.</p><p>You know, I just, I think they don't get it.  I understand that they don't  really like seeing the Dow at 26,000.  They don't really like the lack of  regulation or the idea that Americans are going to get a raise beginning  today, right?  Because this is threatening to their existence, and somehow  Gina, I think what it tells you is that the kind of conservative economic  principles that this administration embraces, they actually work.</p><p>LOUDON:  Right.  And, it really puts them at odds, if you will with the  entire American people.  I mean the only way Democrats actually win with a  doubling down that you mentioned, by Nancy Pelosi and rest of the  Democrats, against the American economy is if somehow they can make the  American economy go south and then celebrate that fact.  That puts them in  direct odds with the American people, which is where they happen to find  themselves on a lot of issues like illegal immigration and other things.</p><p>But, Trish, this is a solid lack of vision for this party.  It is like they  don't recognize -- like, they can't look 10 miles down the road and say,  this might not go well for us, but this is become a pattern with the  Democratic Party, to have a lack of vision, and I believe it is why we see  this sorts of implosions like this, and the doubling down of those same  implosions over and over again.</p><p>REGAN:  Gina Loudon, well, he stole their thunder, their economic thunder  any way.  It's going to be hard for them to fight what is now becoming a  rising tide here of economic optimism.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>I just want to point out to the viewer that the President just landing, you  can see him get in the helicopter there, he just landed back at Joint Base  Andrews after having been at that Republican retreat at Greenbrier Resort  there in West Virginia.</p><p>Anyway, a lot is going on right now with Democrats blasting the President  over immigration reform.  Even calling him, what they just love to call  him, a racist.  But Democrats -- I can tell you they were singing a very  different tune.  We were talking about this earlier with Mercedes Schlapp.</p><p>You know, just a few years ago you had the likes of Barack Obama, Hillary  Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, all voting for a, \"fence.\"  They wanted  stronger borders.  We have the tapes of even President Clinton calling for  it when he was in office.  We're showing it to you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, Democrats, they're blasting President Trump's  immigration proposal, some even calling it racist.  But, I just want you to  hear what Bill Clinton said about immigration back in 1995, followed by  what President Trump said just the other night.  It is important to watch  these together.  Here we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  All-Americans, not  only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country  are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our  country.  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure  our borders more, by hiring record number of new border guard, by deporting  twice as many criminal aliens as ever before.</p><p>TRUMP:  For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into  our most vulnerable communities.</p><p>Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes  that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our  country.  We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration  laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  Let's just get this straight, right?  It is somehow OK for  Bill Clinton to call for more border security and the deportation of  illegals, but not OK for President Trump?</p><p>Joining me right now is former Obama Foreign Policy Advisor David Tafuri.   David, I don't get it.  Because the party he represents?</p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Look, Trish, I'm with  you on this, first of all those two speeches are remarkably similar in  those parts.  And you're right, there should be sort of a philosophical  statement that we can accept and provide some compassion for people who are  here already illegal I like the participants in DACA, known as the  DREAMers.  In return we have to increase border security.  That is what  President Clinton said in 1995.  That is what President Trump.</p><p>President Trump has proposed a compromise on immigration, which I think is  a fair compromise.  It means let's give generous acceptance for DACA  participants, let's create a pathway to citizenship for them.  In return,  let's put a lot of money into border security, including perhaps his wall.   That is something that Democrats and Republicans should get behind.  The  problem is, there are Republicans in the House that are not going to  support that, and there are some Democrats as you highlighted who also  don't support it.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, I would also point out that Democrats historically have  supported, \"wall\" although back then in 2006 it was called a fence, OK, so  you had Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Charles Schumer all  saying, yes, Fence Act.  It was actually called, \"The Secure Fence Act of  2006.\"</p><p>I guess, what frustrates me, and I appreciate that you also are frustrated  by this, David.  What frustrates me is the hypocrisy here.  That, you know,  you know it is OK if Chuck Schumer is proposing it but just not OK if  Donald Trump is proposing it.</p><p>TAFURI:  Look, nobody should be against securing our borders.  And if that  requires $25 billion, which sound like a lot, but if that money is going to  be spent well and it's not going to be wasted and it's going to be used in  a way that effectively and efficiently secures our borders, we ought to  support that.  In return, the Democrats should get some provisions that  make it easier for people who are already here, who are contributing to our  economy, who are employed, who are in school, to get on a pathway to  citizenship.</p><p>REGAN:  He has offered that.  But here is the problem.  These are the other  sticking points.  And by the way I just point out interesting little fact  for everyone, David, the proposed wall back in 2006 was $50 billion that  the Democrats have come up with.  And the President's wall is $25 billion,  so double the cost even though it was that many years ago.</p><p>But David, it's not just having border issues at stake.  It's also the  matter of chain migration and the lottery system, which hasn't benefited  our country.  I mean, I don't understand the aversion some Democrats have  to us saying, OK, we need doctors, we need nurses, we need factory workers,  we need domestic help, we need certain things, and therefore we're going to  seek those people that can fit those needs?</p><p>TAFURI:  Trish, you're right.  Democrats -- some Democrats are also opposed  to aspects of Trump's compromise including the chain migration and  including the lottery visas.</p><p>Now, in the lottery visas I think Trump's proposal is fair, which is let's  do merit-based immigration, rather than the lottery visas.  On the chain  migration, I think Democrats can also get behind limiting chain migration.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>TAFURI:  In fact, they were willing to agree in limiting chain migration  for the DACA, DREAMers participants.  But I think the problem is, the  proposal Trump has made limits it for all immigrants.  So let's say you're  an engineer from India, you come to the U.S., you work for Google, and you  can't bring your parents.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm coming up against a break.  Not to break you up, David but I'm  coming up against the break.  I do appreciate that it sound like there is a  little more room than one would have thought, here you are, David Tafuri, a  former member of the Obama administration.  Thank you so much, good to see  you.</p><p>The Democrats putting out Congressman Joe Kennedy III to give the party's  official response to President Trump's State of the Union address, but is a  Kennedy really the best face of a party of rich white men with a very  famous last name which harkens back to the past?  Is this all they got?   Historian Doug Wead is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, well I'm sure you saw Joe Kennedy III giving the  Democratic response to the State of the Union.  Just ask him, do the  Democrats really have to trot out a Kennedy?  Is that all they got?</p><p>Joining me right now is Presidential Historian Doug Wead, Author of the  book, \"Game of Thorns.\"</p><p>Doug, great to see -- what do you make of this?  I mean, look, you know, no  offense against him.  Thank goodness by the way, they had somebody younger  than who they typically have.  I mean, they need fresh blood, but -- but a  Kennedy?</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Well, I thought it was great.  They  need to do something.  I thought it was very ironic, Trish, that Joe  Kennedy III was using the same arguments against Trump's economic plan that  JFK's enemies used against him, 56 years before.  Boy, how the world has  changed.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.  You know, Doug, you make a good point, because I've always  said, you know, economics doesn't need to be so political in that JFK cut  taxes, he did exactly what the President managed to get done with tax  reform, and here, you know, the next generation is saying something very,  very different.</p><p>WEAD:  Yes, and when the Joe Kennedy III argued it's all for rich people,  when they said that to JFK, you remember very famously he used the new  England proverb that had been passed to him by Ted Sorensen, he said a  rising tide raises all boats.  So Kennedy defended himself and Joe Kennedy  III in Congress used another argument against Trump's tax reform.  He said  that this is going to drive up the national debt, and that's what  Republicans used as an argument against JFK.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.</p><p>WEAD:  And the Kennedy -- </p><p>REGAN:  And it's funny how times have changed because I'm thinking -- you  don't know how many Democrats I've said since when did you become a fiscal  conservative?</p><p>WEAD:  And the fact that he's catholic, I think, is something the Democrats  need.  They lost the vote in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, a  lot of it was because they had trashed the catholic vote in those e-mails  with Podesta and Bill Clinton had begged Hillary to reach out to the  catholic vote, and they just absolutely wouldn't do it.  So maybe the  Democrat Party is coming around a little bit, 22 percent of those voters in  2016 were catholic.  Only one percent were Muslim, which they spent so much  time and money trying to reach out to.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, Doug, I grew up as Irish Catholic and my father came from  a very big Irish Catholic family, and you were a Democrat like you were  Irish like you were catholic.  I mean, that was part of that generation.   And I think that Donald Trump has really gotten in there and stolen that  thunder, if you would, right out from under the Democrats.  So maybe they  think a Kennedy can bring them back.  I would recommend he get the right  economic policies.</p><p>Doug, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>WEAD:  Good to see you, too.  Thank you for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, Liz Claman, we're sending it your way.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Thank you so much, Neil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, the President is blasting Democrats for  refusing to work with Republicans, saying the left would rather see America  fail than thrive.  But he vows that he will not let Democrats get in the  way of moving forward with his America First agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All of this as we see a pretty well day on Wall Street.  But hey we're in  the green right now, up 43 points there off the highs of the session.  We  had been down earlier in the session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome to the Intelligence Report.</p><p>The President speaking to Republican law makers that their annual retreat  there in West Virginia at the Greenbrier just a short time ago and he  praise the Republicans for passing tax reform, pretty big deal but he is  warning that Republicans must work with Democrats to get any kind of  comprehensive immigration reform past, can they get it done?</p><p>We are asking Assistant to President Mercedes Schlapp.  Plus, the  classified FISA memo detailing possible abuses at the Justice Department  maybe release tomorrow and of course, you have the left are arguing against  the release saying there will be national security risks if this memo  becomes public.</p><p>But, Judge Napolitano, he is not buying that one bit.  He is here and he is  going to explain why.  We need to let the American public decide for  themselves.  That is happening in just a few minutes.</p><p>But first, let's go to Adam Shapiro, he is in West Virginia there where a  short time ago the President delivered what I would call a powerful America  First speech.  Hi, Adam.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDEN:  Yes.  Well, he is always America  First, Trish and this was no different.  He spoke to the Republicans  gathered here in West Virginia, talking about tax reform, talking about  immigration reform, talking about infrastructure.</p><p>But it was specifically his message to Democrats saying that the  administration and Republicans will continue to attempt to pass bipartisan  legislation but they have to be met in the middle and it doesn't appear  according to the President that Democrats want to do that.  He cited the  fact that he is offered a path to citizenship for 1.8 million people who  have come to the United States illegally.  And he says the Democrats that  he did this to see if the Democrats were serious about using immigration to  solve this problem or using immigration reform as political point.  Here is  what he said specifically about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They talk a good game  with DACA but they don't produce.  And so either they come on board, or  we'll just going to really work and we're going to get more people so we  can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass in a much easier fashion  legislation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Now he also talked about the result of the successful tax reform  and pointing out that it has put $2,000 on average back into the pockets of  regular people not only here in West Virginia but across the country.</p><p>There is the issue that the first $24,000 of income for a married couple is  no longer taxed to the federal level.  So that's just part of the message.   But then, he went on the attack against Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader  in the House, pointing out that when she calls the bonuses, that companies  have announced for their employees, the $1000 bonus, which she calls that  crumbs, that she is missing the point.</p><p>Here is the President in his own words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Nancy Pelosi called crumbs.  That was a bad -- that could be like  deplorable?  Does that make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words  they seem to have a resemblance.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  And so the President is now on his way back to Washington.   Trish?</p><p>REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Adam.</p><p>Joining me right now with reaction, White House Senior Advisor for  Strategic Communications and Assistant to the President, Mercedes Schlapp.   Good to see you, Mercedes.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS  AND ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT:  Hi, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, he laid out an agenda.  He did so in the State of the  Union the other night and immigration reform is a big part of it.  But it  doesn't sound like the Democrats are willing to give you guys an inch on  this.  So how are you going to get past that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, clearly, it seems that the Democrats want to make  immigration reform a political wedge issue and not be serious about solving  -- </p><p>REGAN:  Oh, it looks like we may have lost Mercedes Schlapp.  We'll try and  get her back momentarily.  But as she was saying it's become increasing a  political wedge issue.  And that's one of the problems here because, you  know, as far as Democrats go, I don't know how they're going to go out  there and look at their constituents and look at their base and say, well,  you know, the President, he offered a deal for 1.8 million Americans to  have some form of legitimacy, in fact citizenship but we turned it down  because you know what?  We're not going to have that wall and we're going  to let him end chain migration, and we're not going to let him end the  lottery program.</p><p>How does that make any sense?  They want to send all these people out of  the country when the President is willing to give a deal?  I mean  politically-speaking it looks as though the Republicans have upper side on  this one.</p><p>Joining me right now with more context, Republican Strategist, Ford  O'Connell and Democratic Strategist Hamza Khan.</p><p>Good to see you guys.</p><p>FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good to see you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  Ford, I'll start with you.  And again, we're going to try and get  Mercedes back with us.  It looks like the satellite feed went down.</p><p>But Ford, just the politics here, and I understand there are members of the  President's base that don't like the idea of extending citizenship to all  these people but he is putting forth a deal.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  He is -- </p><p>REGAN:  And if the Democrats don't go along with it, then they're going to  deport all of these individuals?</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Well look, what the President is proposing is what many -- 54  Senate Democrats agreed to in 2013, which is a border fence, ending the  diversity visa lottery program and putting curbs on chain migration.  And  essentially 65 percent of Americans in the latest Harvard-Harris Poll agree  with the President's position.</p><p>He is trying to make a deal.  Unfortunately, Democrats are going to  continue to basically resist, obstruct, and sit on their hands.  It's  really an unfortunate situation because President Trump is absolutely  right.  We going to build on that powerful State of the Union continue so  in the tax bill and deliver for the American people on immigration and  infrastructure.</p><p>REGAN:  Hamza, the Democrats are going to have tough a tough time if  economy the continue doing as well as it's been doing.  What do you think  it's going to happens in '18?</p><p>HAMZA KHAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, first of all, let's talk about  the economy for a second.  The current tax bill that was put through  Congress really quickly and is become law now has only benefited about two  percent of all Americans.  Only 1.94 percent of Americans have gotten any  sort of bonus from their jobs, resulting from the tax cuts, whatsoever.</p><p>REGAN:  You know it just happened.</p><p>KHAN:  It just happened, the only two percent and so quickly.  I mean,  we've been talking all the time about how great this tax is going to be for  the American people.  It hasn't trickled down to anyone.  It seems to me a  trickle up.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's only been in place for a few weeks.  And by the way,  starting tomorrow, Americans are going to be getting raises as a result of  this, more money coming back to them in their paychecks.  So -- </p><p>KHAN:  Well, let's see if that really comes out.</p><p>REGAN:  I guess that argument only going to hold for, you know -- </p><p>KHAN:  We'll see if it really gets beyond the margins and it's starting  tomorrow since you seem to think that tomorrow we'll going to see some pay  cuts coming back into people's -- </p><p>REGAN:  I mean -- OK.  Hang on Ford.  I want to keep going, Hamza.  I want  to hear the rest of why you say our economy is not doing well now?</p><p>KHAN:  Well, we got a lot of reasons why the economy is not doing well.  A  Fox poll just show, it just point out 71 percent of the Americans are  concerned about the economy still, that's what President Trump being in  office for a whole year.  On top of that, even though President Trump seems  to keep taking credit for President Obama's work on economy, we've seen  that the job growth in the last 12 months slow, rather than increase.  So  I'm not really sure what Donald Trump -- </p><p>REGAN:  Can I stop you.  And Ford, I'm going to get you in here in just a  second.  But you think that the upside we're seeing in terms of GDP growth  right now is a result of President Obama?  You think that the 26,000 on the  Dow right now is a result of President Obama?</p><p>KHAN:  President Obama made sure that our economy is growing for both Wall  Street and Main Street.  So I can tell you for a fact, everything we're  seeing right now is things to Barack Hussein Obama.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  And I can tell you for a fact that he had absolutely nothing  to do with growing the fundamentals in the economy.  And I can tell you for  a fact that Janet Yellen did.  Because when you print out much money you  see a little bit of bump up in the stock market.  But until you actually  have meaningful policy reform nothing happens fundamentally with overall  economic growth.  It wasn't until we got word of the tax cuts that things  really started to take off.  And that rumor got built into the market.  And  that optimism got fell into GDP.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do -- </p><p>REGAN:  Hang on.  Let Ford get in.  Go ahead, Ford.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Hamza, if you want to do what Nancy Pelosi is doing and saying  the three million people getting raises is crumbs, let me tell you  something the Republicans are going to hold the House in 2018.  And to  Trish's point, look, unemployment at a 17-year low, consumer confidence and  small business confidence is through the roof.  And the reason why that is,  is because of optimism based on tax bill which has had a 20-point swing  over the last month, and deregulation policies put in by the Trump  administration, which are basically cut regulations on a 22 to one clip.   It was regulation that was stifling the American economy.  And it's  deregulation that essentially put us near three percent in GDP and  hopefully with the tax bill it will put us near four.  And frankly if you  guys want to keep touting that Obama did all of this, I promise you we're  going to hold the House -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KHAN:  I mean, you can promise what you want, but the polls are showing  right now the Democrats in the best position ever to take back the House.   And on top of that --</p><p>O'CONNELL:  No, they're not.  Actually, I'm going to now rebut you.</p><p>KHAN:  Hey, you can rebut me, but let me get to my point here, even within  the Republican Party there is no clear step going forward on how they're  going to get immigration reform through the House right now and through the  Senate on top of that.  And that's actually on front page of \"Politico\" as  I recall from today.</p><p>On top of that, only two percent --</p><p>REGAN:  So you're going to send all those people home because you won't end  chain migration.</p><p>KHAN:  Yes, I'm not sure if it's right for you to be going off about chain  migration.  We have a lot of great Americans who came here from every part  of the country.  And then, you yourself, Trish, called those 1.8 million  people a few years ago, to be Americans.  Therefore, why are we negotiating  about their right to be in their own country?  I'm just using your own  words.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's just stop you there.  Because what you are saying because  you're not going to allow him to end chain migration and you're not going  to allow him to end the lottery program, instead of by the way, one would  think you want to be strategic who comes here, but if you don't allow him  to end those things, then you're going to take 1.8 million people and send  them away?  I mean, Hamza, I don't know how you're going to explain that  one to your base?</p><p>KHAN:  Let me do this, Trish.  Do you think it's a good optic for the  Republican Party to be trying to send 1.8 million back to some other part  of the world that they have never actually been to.</p><p>REGAN:  Ah, so that's what it is.</p><p>KHAN:  We have so many innocent people in this country -- </p><p>REGAN:  That is what it is.  That is what it is.  You want to make it look,  as though the President -- OK, this feeds your narrative because if the  economy is doing as well as it has been doing, if it is growing at four  percent as CEO of JPMorgan suggests it will, a Democrat by the way, well  then, you will going to have nothing to run on except that he is the  bogeyman.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  That's exactly -- </p><p>KHAN:  Well, he is the bogeyman.  There is no argument there.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  No, he is not the bogeyman, Hamza.</p><p>KHAN:  Yes, he is the bogeyman.  He is going after people in our country  simply because they don't have the right color passport.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, I got to wrap it up there.  It is good to talk to you  both.  But I want to get back to Mercedes who is at the White House.  Thank  you so much, Hamza, spirited discussion, and Ford O'Connell.</p><p>Mercedes, you heard what Hamza was saying, I mean, I question whether they  are almost deliberately doing this, right?  Because they kind of like the  optics of the President deporting people, it feeds the narrative that  somehow big, bad, Donald Trump is going go knocking on everyone's door and  send kids home to Mexico or wherever else they may be from, and that upsets  people.  And people have an emotional reaction to that, therefore getting  out vote for the base.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  The Democrat party's platform right now is that of obstruction.   They don't want the President to succeed.  They are actually bitter because  of his success.  I mean, it's very clear that the President is trying his  best to work with both parties, to work with both the House and the Senate.   He is the one that has taken the lead on immigration reform.  He is the one  that's saying, I want permanent and compassionate solution to DACA  recipients.  At the same time he wants to protect Americans.  And that  means securing our border.  That means proposing a 25 billion-dollar trust  fund that would insure that we would have -- not only the physical barrier  but the personal and the technology needed in order to make sure that we're  able to control what's happening on the border.</p><p>I mean, we have to understand that through borders where we're seeing drugs  coming through.  There are individuals who are coming to the United States,  part of the MS-13 gang.  I mean they are -- and guess what?  Those MS-13  gang members they end up in communities that are primarily Latino or  African-American.  So we have to insure that there is safety along our  border.</p><p>And so I think for the President, what he is doing is, he is saying, let's  work together.  I'm extending my hand over to the Democrats.  Let's get to  a good point where we find a permanent solution to DACA as well as secure  the border.  And it is where mainstream America is at.  I mean -- </p><p>REGAN:  And by the way, you used to work with the Democrats right,  Mercedes.  I mean, we're going through the historical record, going back to  2006, you had Barack Obama -- Senator Barack Obama, you had Chuck Schumer,  you had -- forgive me, you had Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, I believe,  here we go here is the whole list.  Forgive me.  Joe Biden, all saying we  needed a fence.  They called it a fence as opposed to a wall back then in  2006.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you know who else agreed on ending chain migration?  It was  actually Feinstein, it was Schumer, it was all part of the \"gang of six\" or  eight, you know, that came out during the Senate in 2013.  There were  plenty of Democrats who agreed that there was a need to end chain  migration, end the diversity visa lottery program.  So there is a lot more  bipartisan room to grow there.  And I think the President is saying let's  just get a solution done, for the sake of DACA recipients, for the sake of  Americans, let's get to a point where we have a generous compromise and  really get this done.  The question will become, are Democrats simply going  to play politics.  Are they will to be come up with a true solution that  would benefit DACA recipients as well as insure we secure our border?</p><p>REGAN:  I think he might be able to get it done, really.  I mean, tax  reform went through.  And by the way, you heard our Democratic strategist  say this growing economy, booming economy has nothing to do with the  President.  All Barack Obama.  But that's what you're fighting?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It was -- I don't know what planet he is living on.  But I can  just tell you that what we are seeing in terms of business confidence,  consumer confidence, when you just look at the deregulation alone and the  impact it had on our economy, that it is having on small business growth it  is impactful.  And for the President, it is not just, you know, we're  seeing the paycheck increases and the fact that average families, you're  going to see raises in their income, close to $4,000 a year.  That is  impactful.</p><p>And for Speaker Pelosi to call that crumbs, it just shows how elite and out  of touch she is with where every day Americans are.  And it's incredibly  unfortunate because what President Trump understands is the pulse of the  American people.  He understands the need of these families and the fact  that they are ones that should have money in their pockets for their  family.  And that at the end of the day, America is open for business, that  we can create jobs and keep our economy growing.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's keep it up, the Dow 26,170.  Mercedes Schlapp, thank you very  much.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thank you very much.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, new developments everyone on the controversial  surveillance memo alleging abuses at the Justice Department, sources  telling Fox News, the President will declassify and release the memo to the  public.  We have all the Intel for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, new developments surrounding the controversial  memo on alleged surveillance abuses at the Justice Department.  Sources  telling Fox that President Trump will declassify that memo tomorrow despite  pleas from the FBI to keep it under wraps.  For more, let's go to our own  Blake Burman, who is at the White House.  Hi, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Trish.  And the White  House now publicly acknowledging that President Trump has indeed read this  four-page memo.  The President did not mention it or his decision at all  just within the past hour or so as he addressed congressional Republicans  in West Virginia.</p><p>The President now on his way back here to the White House.  And according  to sources the President is expected to declassify the memo.  It would then  be sent back, we were told, according to sources, back up to the Hill.  At  which point the House Intelligence Committee would get it.  And it is  believed at this point the likely timing is that it could be released at  some point by tomorrow morning.</p><p>One of the top Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, Peter King,  and he called this memo, just a little while ago, vital.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER KING (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN:  I don't want to oversell it.  I  agree with Trey Gowdy.  I think Republicans sometimes make a mistake of  oversell things.  But I'm going to say, this is vital, it's essentially to  the public to say and it's certainly important in the body of evidence to  be out there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Democrats have been fighting this memo, some on the House  Intelligence Committee on the Democratic side as well trying to produce  their memo.  The lead Democrat is Adam Schiff, and he said just a little  while ago that this memo is the Republican attempt to tar the Department of  Justice and the FBI.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM SCHIFF (D), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I think the FBI is exactly  right.  This memo is really a spin on a -- not just a set of particular  documents but broader classified information than that.  That because of  serious and material omissions is inaccurate and gives a very misleading  impression.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Schiff is also involved, Trish, in another battle right now, about  this memo as he says there were material changes made to it by the  Republicans, led by Devin Nunes and his committee members, however a  spokesperson for Nunes saying that it is a bizarre distraction that Schiff  is now engaging in, and that they were not material changes, and said  rather grammatical fixes and changes that Democrats and FBI wanted to see.   Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, thank you very much, Blake Burman.</p><p>Joining me right now is Fox News Legal Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>And Judge, you say that this thing needs to be declassified ASAP.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I absolutely do.  I  actually want more than just this declassified because I want to see  Congressman Schiff's version of the raw intelligence data as well.</p><p>So here is how it happens.  The Republican staff members, not members of  the committee have top secret security clearances.  And they can see the  raw Intel, raw Intel is, transcripts of telephone conversations, copies of  text messages, copies of emails between and among Justice Department  figures and FBI agents, the last year of President Obama's administration  and first year of President Trump's administration.  From that, the  Republican staff concluded that there was a serious abuse of FISA  authorities.  There was spying that should not have occurred.  And there  was spying done for political purposes.  Congressman Schiff and his team  have looked at the same data and said there are no such abuses here.  So  not only do I want to see both memos, I want to see the raw data memos are  based.</p><p>REGAN:  Look, you may not be able to see the raw data because that would be  a security compromise.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Unless we just whited out the names of sources and certain  other information.  We can certainly see the texts and the emails and phone  conversations without knowing from whom they came because the American  public needs to know, who broke the law with the authority we gave them?   Who knew about the law being broken?  Who looked the other way?</p><p>Trish, these FISA abuses were known to the committee for the past eight  months.  They sat on it, until after FISA was extended by the Congress and  signed by the President.  They released it the next day.  Congress should  have had an opportunity to look at this stuff before it ignorantly voted to  extend FISA.</p><p>REGAN:  But, you know, I hear what you're saying because the problem right  now is we're in such a polarized political environment.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We are.</p><p>REGAN:  But the Republicans have one version of facts and the Democrats  have another version of these facts or interpretation I should say, that  you want people to be able to tell for themselves.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And as a journalist I want to be able to see it because I want to  be able to make my own conclusions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- like -- I'm sure many Americans do.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  As journalists we want to be the eyes and ears of the public.   We want to read this document and be able to interpret them.  But when the  same raw material is subject to two interpretations that are 180 degrees  from each other, I also want to know which one of the politicians is  spinning at the truth, by looking at the truth, at data myself.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  I hear you.  So with all of this in mind, what could this  memo possibly tell us?  I mean, in which should we be taking it with a  grain of salt because of the political environment?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I hope that Congressman King's fears do not come to pass.  I  hope this is not been oversold.  I mean, we've been -- we've been  conditioned to expect something that is career-ending, KBG-like, over the  top.</p><p>Now perhaps to those of us that have been in law enforcement and today  monitor it won't be that catastrophic but to the American public it might,  I don't know.  What I think we're going to see is the use of intelligence  data for political purposes, if we see that, that is a very, very, grave  threat to freedom in America.</p><p>REGAN:  It is.  It is.  And some careers will be ended.  And maybe this is  the kind of thing, I don't know you go to jail for.  I mean if this is -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Could very well be.  One of our competing networks reported a  few minutes ago, fears in the White House that FBI Director Chris Wray may  resign if this is released.  Another headache the President doesn't need.</p><p>REGAN:  But I was looking at this, and as the FBI came out and said, we  don't want this, I thought, is this a CYA move?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It may very well be.  I cannot remember.  A person has been  watching this stuff for 40 years and last time the FBI publicly criticized  the White House and got away with it.  That is what we saw last night and  again this morning.</p><p>REGAN:  Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you so much.  It's always good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pressure, Trish.  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, markets right now, trading a bit lower, we just moved  into negative territory.  Wall Street is of course, awaiting tomorrow's  jobs report.  A biggie.  Everyone is going to be watching this.  What  happens to the unemployment rate?  What happens, I want to know to wages?   Have we started to see any of that filter into the wage data.  We're on it  for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, let's check out these markets.  You can see we  moved back into positive territory with the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are still  lower.  It's all happening, of course, a day ahead of the big jobs report  coming tomorrow.  We do have three big tech companies with earnings out and  you can see after the bell are due, Apple trading up a little bit, Amazon,  however, lower as well Alphabets, which is the fancy name for Google these  days.</p><p>Joining me with more on these markets we have Money Map Press Chief  Investment Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Keith, it has gotten a little  volatile lately.  And I think back to -- </p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  It has.</p><p>REGAN:  -- State of the Union we were off more 300 points and, you know,  doing better now but, what's going on?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  Well, you know, I tell you, for one thing, volatility is  actually a good thing, Trish.  We forgotten, but this used to be normal not  too many years ago.  And second, you have to have buying and selling to  move higher it takes two to tango part on (ph).  And that's what we're  getting now.  Traders are simply adjusting the interest rates.  They're  readjusting the political expectations, taking a little money off the  table, which is absolutely normal.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, people talk about interest rates, and there's some  concern out there, I mean, keep in mind how much debt we have, and by the  way, how much sort of money printing if you would that they -- the Fed had  to go long on, there is concern about rising interest rates that are moving  too quickly and, potentially an economy that's not keeping up.  How much  concern is that to you right now?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  I think that's very valid point, but here is the thing.  The  Fed lost control a long time ago.  So take that out of the equation.  What  more important is traders are doing in the 10-year treasury in particular  is the key.  If it's rising quickly, that is a problem for the markets, if  it's moving in measured paces traders will naturally rein it in.  So unless  we get some sort of spike in that -- we really not going to have a problem.</p><p>REGAN:  I wonder if we can show a chart, maybe a year-to-date or one-year  chart on the 10-year right now.  I'm going to see if the team can get that  together for you.</p><p>But, you know, we're still under three percent on the 30 year.  Keith,  there is part of me, that really wonders why don't we have more inflation  on this economy or more of expectation of inflation.  The idea that, you  know, 30 years from now, you're basically going to be sort of right where  you are, doesn't make any sense?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  No, it doesn't.  I mean, you know, this is central banks at  work.  They're pumping so much money into the system.  And yet, we got all  kind of other things which would be topic for another discussion.</p><p>But here is the key, is that when you're moving all of that money, it's got  to go somewhere.  So what they're doing is creating a magnet for it in the  financial markets.  The markets really are not just yield, they're about  risk.  And that is how global traders assess these rates as risk not as a  return.</p><p>REGAN:  But Keith, how many jobs are you looking forward to tomorrow?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  You know, I think it's going to be a good number.  What I  want to see is composition.  I want to see wage rate increases.  That's the  key.</p><p>REGAN:  It might be early -- it might be early but we've seen a lot of  companies handing out raises.  I think you might get it more so in next  month's report.  But certainly we'll be looking for indications of that  tomorrow.  Keith Fitz-Gerald, thank you very much.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence blasting Nancy Pelosi for her let them eat cake  attitude over tax reform.  She repeatedly calls those $1000 bonuses  \"crumbs.\"  She is doubling down on this.  I'm wondering it is just a little  like the deplorables comment.  Remember from Hillary Clinton, so tone deaf,  not getting how the average American feels because I will tell you, 1000  bucks is a lot of money to anyone in this country.  We've got more Intel on  this, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We were waiting for February, and then we got hit with these  corporations giving tremendous bonuses to everybody.  That Nancy Pelosi  called crumbs.  That was a bad.  That could be like deplorable, does that  make sense, deplorable and crumbs?  Those two words, they seem to have a  resemblance.  I hope it has the same meaning but she called it crumbs when  people are getting $2000 and $3,000 and $1000.  That is not crumbs.  That  is a lot of money.</p><p>MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Nancy Pelosi  predicted economic \"Armageddon.\"  Remember that one?  Well, that wasn't the  worst of it.  It's just amazing to me that after this tax cut passes, 3  million Americans get another thousand dollars in their pockets, in many  cases.  She actually described that as \"crumbs.\"  So if you're going to say  $1,000 is crumbs, you live in a different world than I live in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  I'm laughing because did you hear the President equate crumbs with  the deplorable comment?  You know, it's funny, we have a conference call  every morning, our whole team here as we put the show together for you, and  I weigh in editorially, and my comment this morning was, Nancy Pelosi  calling this thing crumbs, it is a lot like Hillary Clinton referring to  deplorables.  I mean it that's kind of moment.  I never understand why she  would possibly double down on this or the likes of Chuck Schumer or Debbie  Wasserman Schultz would want to pick up on this, because it is that bad.   It is a deplorable kind of moment.  As though, the President was listening  to our conference call there.</p><p>Anyway, I'm teasing, but joining me right now, a member of the Trump Re- Election Advisory Board, Gina Loudon.</p><p>And Gina, I mean, I don't get it.  It is so tone deaf to say that a  thousand dollars is crumbs.  Much like Hillary Clinton calling Trump  supporters deplorables, I think this is going to come back to haunt them in  a pretty massive way.  They clearly don't have very good advisors around  them, shall we say.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, DONALD J. TRUMP PRESIDENT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  Well, let's  say, Trish, that maybe we could give Nancy the benefit of the doubt and she  was being honest in saying Armageddon because it may truly be Armageddon  for the Democrat Party.</p><p>You know, their fund-raising is at record lows.  And while the RNC, of  course, is doing great with fund-raising especially after that killer State  of the Union address by the President.  And so, you know, maybe, Nancy can  say she is sorry.  Maybe she can repent.  She could donate her crumbs to  her church.  Or maybe she donates them to the DNC since they're in such  need.  Who knows?  For Nancy, this is her own little reality.  This is not  reality that the most of us happen to live in.</p><p>REGAN:  But I mean talking about the Marie Antoinette, if you would, of the  Democratic Party right now, I mean, not only that she say once, she then  echoed it and she has got her minions out there echoing at as well.</p><p>You know, I just, I think they don't get it.  I understand that they don't  really like seeing the Dow at 26,000.  They don't really like the lack of  regulation or the idea that Americans are going to get a raise beginning  today, right?  Because this is threatening to their existence, and somehow  Gina, I think what it tells you is that the kind of conservative economic  principles that this administration embraces, they actually work.</p><p>LOUDON:  Right.  And, it really puts them at odds, if you will with the  entire American people.  I mean the only way Democrats actually win with a  doubling down that you mentioned, by Nancy Pelosi and rest of the  Democrats, against the American economy is if somehow they can make the  American economy go south and then celebrate that fact.  That puts them in  direct odds with the American people, which is where they happen to find  themselves on a lot of issues like illegal immigration and other things.</p><p>But, Trish, this is a solid lack of vision for this party.  It is like they  don't recognize -- like, they can't look 10 miles down the road and say,  this might not go well for us, but this is become a pattern with the  Democratic Party, to have a lack of vision, and I believe it is why we see  this sorts of implosions like this, and the doubling down of those same  implosions over and over again.</p><p>REGAN:  Gina Loudon, well, he stole their thunder, their economic thunder  any way.  It's going to be hard for them to fight what is now becoming a  rising tide here of economic optimism.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>I just want to point out to the viewer that the President just landing, you  can see him get in the helicopter there, he just landed back at Joint Base  Andrews after having been at that Republican retreat at Greenbrier Resort  there in West Virginia.</p><p>Anyway, a lot is going on right now with Democrats blasting the President  over immigration reform.  Even calling him, what they just love to call  him, a racist.  But Democrats -- I can tell you they were singing a very  different tune.  We were talking about this earlier with Mercedes Schlapp.</p><p>You know, just a few years ago you had the likes of Barack Obama, Hillary  Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, all voting for a, \"fence.\"  They wanted  stronger borders.  We have the tapes of even President Clinton calling for  it when he was in office.  We're showing it to you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, Democrats, they're blasting President Trump's  immigration proposal, some even calling it racist.  But, I just want you to  hear what Bill Clinton said about immigration back in 1995, followed by  what President Trump said just the other night.  It is important to watch  these together.  Here we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  All-Americans, not  only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country  are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our  country.  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure  our borders more, by hiring record number of new border guard, by deporting  twice as many criminal aliens as ever before.</p><p>TRUMP:  For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into  our most vulnerable communities.</p><p>Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes  that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our  country.  We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration  laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  Let's just get this straight, right?  It is somehow OK for  Bill Clinton to call for more border security and the deportation of  illegals, but not OK for President Trump?</p><p>Joining me right now is former Obama Foreign Policy Advisor David Tafuri.   David, I don't get it.  Because the party he represents?</p><p>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR:  Look, Trish, I'm with  you on this, first of all those two speeches are remarkably similar in  those parts.  And you're right, there should be sort of a philosophical  statement that we can accept and provide some compassion for people who are  here already illegal I like the participants in DACA, known as the  DREAMers.  In return we have to increase border security.  That is what  President Clinton said in 1995.  That is what President Trump.</p><p>President Trump has proposed a compromise on immigration, which I think is  a fair compromise.  It means let's give generous acceptance for DACA  participants, let's create a pathway to citizenship for them.  In return,  let's put a lot of money into border security, including perhaps his wall.   That is something that Democrats and Republicans should get behind.  The  problem is, there are Republicans in the House that are not going to  support that, and there are some Democrats as you highlighted who also  don't support it.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, I would also point out that Democrats historically have  supported, \"wall\" although back then in 2006 it was called a fence, OK, so  you had Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Charles Schumer all  saying, yes, Fence Act.  It was actually called, \"The Secure Fence Act of  2006.\"</p><p>I guess, what frustrates me, and I appreciate that you also are frustrated  by this, David.  What frustrates me is the hypocrisy here.  That, you know,  you know it is OK if Chuck Schumer is proposing it but just not OK if  Donald Trump is proposing it.</p><p>TAFURI:  Look, nobody should be against securing our borders.  And if that  requires $25 billion, which sound like a lot, but if that money is going to  be spent well and it's not going to be wasted and it's going to be used in  a way that effectively and efficiently secures our borders, we ought to  support that.  In return, the Democrats should get some provisions that  make it easier for people who are already here, who are contributing to our  economy, who are employed, who are in school, to get on a pathway to  citizenship.</p><p>REGAN:  He has offered that.  But here is the problem.  These are the other  sticking points.  And by the way I just point out interesting little fact  for everyone, David, the proposed wall back in 2006 was $50 billion that  the Democrats have come up with.  And the President's wall is $25 billion,  so double the cost even though it was that many years ago.</p><p>But David, it's not just having border issues at stake.  It's also the  matter of chain migration and the lottery system, which hasn't benefited  our country.  I mean, I don't understand the aversion some Democrats have  to us saying, OK, we need doctors, we need nurses, we need factory workers,  we need domestic help, we need certain things, and therefore we're going to  seek those people that can fit those needs?</p><p>TAFURI:  Trish, you're right.  Democrats -- some Democrats are also opposed  to aspects of Trump's compromise including the chain migration and  including the lottery visas.</p><p>Now, in the lottery visas I think Trump's proposal is fair, which is let's  do merit-based immigration, rather than the lottery visas.  On the chain  migration, I think Democrats can also get behind limiting chain migration.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>TAFURI:  In fact, they were willing to agree in limiting chain migration  for the DACA, DREAMers participants.  But I think the problem is, the  proposal Trump has made limits it for all immigrants.  So let's say you're  an engineer from India, you come to the U.S., you work for Google, and you  can't bring your parents.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm coming up against a break.  Not to break you up, David but I'm  coming up against the break.  I do appreciate that it sound like there is a  little more room than one would have thought, here you are, David Tafuri, a  former member of the Obama administration.  Thank you so much, good to see  you.</p><p>The Democrats putting out Congressman Joe Kennedy III to give the party's  official response to President Trump's State of the Union address, but is a  Kennedy really the best face of a party of rich white men with a very  famous last name which harkens back to the past?  Is this all they got?   Historian Doug Wead is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, well I'm sure you saw Joe Kennedy III giving the  Democratic response to the State of the Union.  Just ask him, do the  Democrats really have to trot out a Kennedy?  Is that all they got?</p><p>Joining me right now is Presidential Historian Doug Wead, Author of the  book, \"Game of Thorns.\"</p><p>Doug, great to see -- what do you make of this?  I mean, look, you know, no  offense against him.  Thank goodness by the way, they had somebody younger  than who they typically have.  I mean, they need fresh blood, but -- but a  Kennedy?</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Well, I thought it was great.  They  need to do something.  I thought it was very ironic, Trish, that Joe  Kennedy III was using the same arguments against Trump's economic plan that  JFK's enemies used against him, 56 years before.  Boy, how the world has  changed.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.  You know, Doug, you make a good point, because I've always  said, you know, economics doesn't need to be so political in that JFK cut  taxes, he did exactly what the President managed to get done with tax  reform, and here, you know, the next generation is saying something very,  very different.</p><p>WEAD:  Yes, and when the Joe Kennedy III argued it's all for rich people,  when they said that to JFK, you remember very famously he used the new  England proverb that had been passed to him by Ted Sorensen, he said a  rising tide raises all boats.  So Kennedy defended himself and Joe Kennedy  III in Congress used another argument against Trump's tax reform.  He said  that this is going to drive up the national debt, and that's what  Republicans used as an argument against JFK.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.</p><p>WEAD:  And the Kennedy -- </p><p>REGAN:  And it's funny how times have changed because I'm thinking -- you  don't know how many Democrats I've said since when did you become a fiscal  conservative?</p><p>WEAD:  And the fact that he's catholic, I think, is something the Democrats  need.  They lost the vote in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, a  lot of it was because they had trashed the catholic vote in those e-mails  with Podesta and Bill Clinton had begged Hillary to reach out to the  catholic vote, and they just absolutely wouldn't do it.  So maybe the  Democrat Party is coming around a little bit, 22 percent of those voters in  2016 were catholic.  Only one percent were Muslim, which they spent so much  time and money trying to reach out to.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, Doug, I grew up as Irish Catholic and my father came from  a very big Irish Catholic family, and you were a Democrat like you were  Irish like you were catholic.  I mean, that was part of that generation.   And I think that Donald Trump has really gotten in there and stolen that  thunder, if you would, right out from under the Democrats.  So maybe they  think a Kennedy can bring them back.  I would recommend he get the right  economic policies.</p><p>Doug, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>WEAD:  Good to see you, too.  Thank you for having me.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, Liz Claman, we're sending it your way.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.
