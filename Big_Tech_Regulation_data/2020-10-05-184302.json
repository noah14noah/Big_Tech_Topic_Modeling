He says it is not up to private companies to set the laws by which the rest of us operate online. It is absolutely right that companies like Facebook acknowledge the mistakes they have made and of course mistakes have been made. It is just that I do not think it is in any way conceivable, more than that, I do not think it is right for private companies to set the rules of the red for something which is as profoundly as important as how technology says Society. </p><p>-- rules of the road. It is not something that big tech companies from the United States or where there can and should do on their own. They spent made headlines for all the wrong reasons when 14-year-old Molly Russell took her own life. Earlier this year there was a huge outpouring of public solidarity with the father of Molly Russell, Ian. This is because, it is covered extensively on this programme can and should do on their own. They spent made headlines for all the wrong reasons when 14-year-old Molly Russell took her own life. Earlier this year there was a huge outpouring of public solidarity with the father of Molly Russell, Ian. This is because, it is covered extensively on this programme, where one reason she took her own life. It is a complicated area. Allowing some people to express themselves and sharing images of self-harm can be a way of alerting authorities about what is going on. Nick Clegg said Facebook had to change their position but for complex reasons. We try and well in academic experts and others to make sure that a platform like Instagram can also be a forceful bid, to save lives and say people from doing damage to themselves. Over the last year or so 3500 people who were in a state of immense distress and on the point of taking their own lives where reached by emergency services because of signals detected on social media. I hope over time we can get that balance right and learn from these awful, tragic events and be a tool for saving lives. What did he say about claims that Russia has interfered with various elections, including the EU referendum? He was remarkably emphatic about it. What is striking, there is concrete evidence that Russia didn't appear when it came to the election with Donald Trump. Russia tried to cede quite hard-line thoughts into public conversation and used Facebook to do it. With Brexit it has been a lot less clear. Nick Clegg was asked, is there a conspiracy? He said really clearly, no, there is not. There are some shades of grey. How do you define influence on a social media platform? There is one thing to say there is a troll farm in parts of Russia that it could also be that Russia and its state propaganda forces are hoping to grow conversation. Clegg was emphatic and said there is no interference. Depending on how you define interference, Russia did play a role. I accept we need to act but there is no evidence it happened in the Brexit referendum. The man two full analyses and all the data we had in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, following the same methodology as we did after the FBI notified Facebook of outside interference in the 2016 US presidential election. We share all of this information with a select committee in Westminster and elsewhere and found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There was an interesting question about when Sir Nick Clegg went over to Facebook. Was he cannot have any influence? Was he going to change things? When we first started talking about the issues, face that has come a long way on regulation. They are saying they want to be regulated. He is talking about hate speech, use of data.

We need to look at mental health provision. Young people spend 11,000 hours of their life in school. I'm not saying we can introduce a programme but the government, while they are doing something here which is great, they could go further and do some more statutory stuff in schools to make sure these messages ... and the UK is not the first are doing this. </p><p>Australia has an E safety Commissioner funded by the government. The government here is looking for tech companies to do that. I'm really interested how they are going to decide which platforms should be contributing to this regulator to fund it. That will be a really interesting process. There was a really interesting point Liam made earlier about Tommy Robinson who has been removed from Facebook and Twitter and been heavily restricted on YouTube so you cannot search for his content. Only last week he was given a stage outside Parliament to address thousands. This online off-line comparison, we need to be careful we are not chipping things the other way. What do you mean? For example Tommy Robinson has arrived apparently to stand in front of Parliament and spread his message to thousands in the crowd and get online we decided as a society, he should be banned and it's not acceptable his content is there. That's a fair point, there is a discrepancy. Let's remember what Facebook were live streaming. Tommy Robinson and a number of his colleagues dry to storm a constituency MPs office. I think we have got to make judgments where the boundaries lie but when you've got a business like Facebook that has allowed the live streaming of a massacre in Christchurch, you know there's something fundamentally broken with the model. That's why we say you can't deal with with one piece of this, this is a complex industry and dealing with one piece of that which the government has done today isn't going to make much of a difference in if you put in place the jigs of other regulations around hate speech, advertising money, around competition regulation, until you ship the whole system onto a new level, you are going to have some of the problems pop up in different formats. What's your view about this British woman in Dubai who wrote while she was in the UK on Facebook that someone else was a horse, she's going to Dubai, been detained, what would seem disproportionate to us is clearly proportionate in the UAE. One of the things that doesn't seem disproportionate, it we have this country of extraterritorial IT, you can't prosecute someone in this country. We have to be prosecute -- we have to be careful how we prosecute someone in this country for crimes committed abroad, the scope of the law is the boundary of our country. There are some exceptions around genocide, human rights laws, you have international courts to police some of that. But it's difficult to start writing laws for crimes committed elsewhere. Ian on e-mail says my seven-year-old wanted to learn Indonesian because she wanted to work to save the orangutan. She looked up Indonesian and she got a full pornographic image of an Indonesian woman, nothing was hidden. Someone else says we desperately need controls of Internet content to protect the vulnerable in society and we have a responsibility to do this. I am an adult with a mental illness. Two years ago Internet content groomed me during a depressive episode on how to take my own life. I almost succeeded, I was saved by my wife coming home early. I now have to live with life limiting injuries. There sites provide, as a number had people have said today, step-by-step instructions and have been on the Internet for years without any intervention. Why are people like me are not protected from this? Venus, can you answer for that stuff is still on websites? I think these companies are doing more and more to try and tackle it but we have to remember the scale of this issue. You've got 300 hours of YouTube content being uploaded every hour, 500 million tweets every hour. Is it even realistic that a regulator can make tech firms take this stuff down? There are certain the action that can be taken. For example it's about being fortunate as the Baroness said, its understanding where the risk lies in making sure the interventions are targeted to that risk. One of these things we are talking about, the big tech companies, the government has been very clear this will apply to all user generated content so this will apply to forums like mums net or comments below the line on say the daily mail website and so if we are going to throw it out so widely we need to be clear about what exactly we want these companies to tackle, how we want them to do it and making sure we are taking a risk based and proportionate response. OK. Very quick final word. Thinking about the people watching us now.

Only last week he was given a stage outside Parliament to address thousands. This online off-line comparison, we need to be careful we are not chipping things the other way. What do you mean? For example Tommy Robinson has arrived apparently to stand in front of Parliament and spread his message to thousands in the crowd and get online we decided as a society, he should be banned and it's not acceptable his content is there. That's a fair point, there is a discrepancy. Let's remember what Facebook were live streaming. Tommy Robinson and a number of his colleagues dry to storm a constituency MPs office. I think we have got to make judgments where the boundaries lie but when you've got a business like Facebook that has allowed the live streaming of a massacre in Christchurch, you know there's something fundamentally broken with the model. That's why we say you can't deal with with one piece of this, this is a complex industry and dealing with one piece of that which the government has done today isn't going to make much of a difference in if you put in place the jigs of other regulations around hate speech, advertising money, around competition regulation, until you ship the whole system onto a new level, you are going to have some of the problems pop up in different formats. What's your view about this British woman in Dubai who wrote while she was in the UK on Facebook that someone else was a horse, she's going to Dubai, been detained, what would seem disproportionate to us is clearly proportionate in the UAE. One of the things that doesn't seem disproportionate, it we have this country of extraterritorial IT, you can't prosecute someone in this country. We have to be prosecute -- we have to be careful how we prosecute someone in this country for crimes committed abroad, the scope of the law is the boundary of our country. There are some exceptions around genocide, human rights laws, you have international courts to police some of that. But it's difficult to start writing laws for crimes committed elsewhere. Ian on e-mail says my seven-year-old wanted to learn Indonesian because she wanted to work to save the orangutan. She looked up Indonesian and she got a full pornographic image of an Indonesian woman, nothing was hidden. Someone else says we desperately need controls of Internet content to protect the vulnerable in society and we have a responsibility to do this. I am an adult with a mental illness. Two years ago Internet content groomed me during a depressive episode on how to take my own life. I almost succeeded, I was saved by my wife coming home early. I now have to live with life limiting injuries. There sites provide, as a number had people have said today, step-by-step instructions and have been on the Internet for years without any intervention. Why are people like me are not protected from this? Venus, can you answer for that stuff is still on websites? I think these companies are doing more and more to try and tackle it but we have to remember the scale of this issue. You've got 300 hours of YouTube content being uploaded every hour, 500 million tweets every hour. Is it even realistic that a regulator can make tech firms take this stuff down? There are certain the action that can be taken. For example it's about being fortunate as the Baroness said, its understanding where the risk lies in making sure the interventions are targeted to that risk. One of these things we are talking about, the big tech companies, the government has been very clear this will apply to all user generated content so this will apply to forums like mums net or comments below the line on say the daily mail website and so if we are going to throw it out so widely we need to be clear about what exactly we want these companies to tackle, how we want them to do it and making sure we are taking a risk based and proportionate response.

Two years ago Internet content groomed me during a depressive episode on how to take my own life. I almost succeeded, I was saved by my wife coming home early. I now have to live with life limiting injuries. There sites provide, as a number had people have said today, step-by-step instructions and have been on the Internet for years without any intervention. Why are people like me are not protected from this? Venus, can you answer for that stuff is still on websites? I think these companies are doing more and more to try and tackle it but we have to remember the scale of this issue. You've got 300 hours of YouTube content being uploaded every hour, 500 million tweets every hour. Is it even realistic that a regulator can make tech firms take this stuff down? There are certain the action that can be taken. For example it's about being fortunate as the Baroness said, its understanding where the risk lies in making sure the interventions are targeted to that risk. One of these things we are talking about, the big tech companies, the government has been very clear this will apply to all user generated content so this will apply to forums like mums net or comments below the line on say the daily mail website and so if we are going to throw it out so widely we need to be clear about what exactly we want these companies to tackle, how we want them to do it and making sure we are taking a risk based and proportionate response. OK. Very quick final word. Thinking about the people watching us now.

A rape survivor tells us exclusively she feels \"revictimised\" after she says her jailed abuser was invited by a council to seek custody of her son. Sammy Woodhouse, has waived her right to anonymity to speak to us. </p><p>Rotherham Council gave the man that raped me and was convicted and sentenced to 35 years for what he did to me and other children, they have offered him to apply for custody of my son. She claims there are many other rapists getting custody of children conceived through abuse across the country and she wants a full investigation. We'll bring you her interview in five minutes. Medics are warning that tens of thousands of women are so traumatised by giving birth that they are left with PTSD. Let us know if tyou had a traumatic birth. Is it time to shake up the checks which new mums have in the weeks and months after birth? Protecting our children online. Earlier this year the BBC went undercover, posing as a 14-year-old girl, to expose the online sexual predators using Kik - a messaging service popular with children. A grown man would be on here talking to a 14-year-old for one reason and one reason only. It is nothing innocent at all. Now the same BBC team have developed a bot - an automated programme - to warn users of Kik about the dangers of online grooming and provide help. So, if the BBC can do it, why can't the big tech companies? Hello. Welcome to the programme. We're live until 11 this morning. Anxiety attacks and vivid flashbacks - some of the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder; and they're symptoms reported today not by veterans returning from conflict zones, but by some women after giving birth. If you had a traumatic birth, let me know what happened; use the hashtag Victoria LIVE. If you're e-mailing and are happy for us to contact you - and maybe want to take part in the programme - please include your phone number in your message. Here's Annita McVeigh with a summary of the day's news. The Government will publish its assessment of how the various scenarios for Brexit will occur for the next few years. The Prime Minister was in Wales and Northern Ireland yesterday and will continue her campaign in Scotland later to secure public support for her Brexit deal. The Chancellor Philip Hammond meanwhile says he accepts that remaining in the US the best thing for the British economy. If the only consideration was the economy, then the analysis shows clearly that remaining in the European Union would be at that outcome for the economy but not by much. The Prime Minister's deal delivers an outcome that is very close to the economic benefits of remaining in while having all the political benefits of being out. Clearly people do not only look at the economy, they also look at the political and constitutional benefits of exiting the European Union. That is what drove the decision in the referendum vote. The UK's worst performing mental health trust has been rated inadequate for the third time that the Care Quality Commission said bosses at the Norfolk cancer that NHS Foundation Trust repeatedly failed to protect patients. Inspectors said concerns from 2014 were yet to be addressed. It was described how patients had self harmed and taken overdoses due to a lack of self care. Of Ireland storm has swept through Sydney and surrounding areas causing power cuts and transport delays. -- a violent storm Sydney had its average monthly rainfall in two hours. A 14-year-old boy died in an accident on his way to school. A preliminary report into last month's deadly Indonesian plane crash has found the jet involved was not a worthy. The Boeing 737 operated by Lion Air nosedived into the Java Sea killing everyone on board. The Indonesian transport safety commission noted that pilots experienced similar technical problems to those on its final journey.

A rape survivor tells us exclusively she feels \"revictimised\" after she says her jailed abuser was invited by a council to seek custody of her son. Sammy Woodhouse, has waived her right to anonymity to speak to us. </p><p>Rotherham Council gave the man that raped me and was convicted and sentenced to 35 years for what he did to me and other children, they have offered him to apply for custody of my son. She claims there are many other rapists getting custody of children conceived through abuse across the country and she wants a full investigation. We'll bring you her interview in five minutes. Medics are warning that tens of thousands of women are so traumatised by giving birth that they are left with PTSD. Let us know if tyou had a traumatic birth. Is it time to shake up the checks which new mums have in the weeks and months after birth? Protecting our children online. Earlier this year the BBC went undercover, posing as a 14-year-old girl, to expose the online sexual predators using Kik - a messaging service popular with children. A grown man would be on here talking to a 14-year-old for one reason and one reason only. It is nothing innocent at all. Now the same BBC team have developed a bot - an automated programme - to warn users of Kik about the dangers of online grooming and provide help. So, if the BBC can do it, why can't the big tech companies? Hello. Welcome to the programme. We're live until 11 this morning. Anxiety attacks and vivid flashbacks - some of the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder; and they're symptoms reported today not by veterans returning from conflict zones, but by some women after giving birth. If you had a traumatic birth, let me know what happened; use the hashtag Victoria LIVE. If you're e-mailing and are happy for us to contact you - and maybe want to take part in the programme - please include your phone number in your message. Here's Annita McVeigh with a summary of the day's news. The Government will publish its assessment of how the various scenarios for Brexit will occur for the next few years. The Prime Minister was in Wales and Northern Ireland yesterday and will continue her campaign in Scotland later to secure public support for her Brexit deal. The Chancellor Philip Hammond meanwhile says he accepts that remaining in the US the best thing for the British economy. If the only consideration was the economy, then the analysis shows clearly that remaining in the European Union would be at that outcome for the economy but not by much. The Prime Minister's deal delivers an outcome that is very close to the economic benefits of remaining in while having all the political benefits of being out. Clearly people do not only look at the economy, they also look at the political and constitutional benefits of exiting the European Union. That is what drove the decision in the referendum vote. The UK's worst performing mental health trust has been rated inadequate for the third time that the Care Quality Commission said bosses at the Norfolk cancer that NHS Foundation Trust repeatedly failed to protect patients. Inspectors said concerns from 2014 were yet to be addressed. It was described how patients had self harmed and taken overdoses due to a lack of self care. Of Ireland storm has swept through Sydney and surrounding areas causing power cuts and transport delays. -- a violent storm Sydney had its average monthly rainfall in two hours. A 14-year-old boy died in an accident on his way to school. A preliminary report into last month's deadly Indonesian plane crash has found the jet involved was not a worthy. The Boeing 737 operated by Lion Air nosedived into the Java Sea killing everyone on board. The Indonesian transport safety commission noted that pilots experienced similar technical problems to those on its final journey.

We have heard all about firefighters who have been called to rescue a cat stuck up a tree, but not usually like this... This is a mountain lion spot perched on a branch 50 feet up in the air near a house in California. Fire crews had to tranquilize it and lower it down with a harness before releasing it back into the wild. A cat up a tree story!</p><p> Now, back to Samira. Thank you, Carrie. A group of Labour MPs is expected to announce their departure from the Labour Party. This is the scene in Westminster. We will join them shortly when there is an announcement. At first... -- But first... A group of MPs leading an inquiry into fake news say big tech companies are \"failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to\" act against harmful content. The report by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee is calling for a compulsory code of ethics and an independent regulator to monitor social media platforms. The committee have been particularly critical of Facebook - saying the site needs far stricter regulation to end the spread of fake news. Facebook has told us that it is \"open to meaningful regulation\" and supports the committee's recommendation for electoral law reform. Well, we can talk to the MP Damian Collins who's the Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, who are behind the report. And the chief executive of Web Roots UK - Areeq Choudhury. And European Technology Correspondent for the Financial Times - Madhunita Murgia Damian Collins first. For... Images for children, films that would incite criminals to commit violent acts, that content should not be there and in many cases is already against the community guidelines of the tech companies but they are not always effective in dealing with it. We should say, in a statutory account, this is what you did to remove harmful content, when either referred to you or it should be content you should be able to identify for yourself using technology, and you have to remove it, and if you don't, the regulator could say to the company you have failed in your duty of care to users, therefore you are liable and we will impose a sanction against you. I think that is the system we need and we can't rely on the goodwill of the tech companies to police themselves. I think we have seen the era of self-regulation has not given the robust systems we need to deal with the most harmful forms of content. I would add to that as well, things like this information as well, the malicious systematic targeting of people with false information, again, with the purpose of swaying votes in elections, turning communities against each other, I think we have to view that as harmful as well. They have said they are open to some form of regulation. Is that a significant change because you have been very critical, particularly of the failure of some like Mark Zuckerberg to turn up before the committee. In my expense they want to establish the code for themselves. If the companies were good at rigorously enforcing their own guidelines lots of these problems would not exist, but they are not and that is why we need a statutory code. It is for Parliament and people to decide what that should look like and how it should be enforced but I think the broadcasting regulatory model is a good one that could be adapted to regulate content online as well but it should be for us to determine what the regulation should be like and enforce it. Other countries have started on this journey. In Germany they have legislation around hate speech and tech companies are if I had to take down content referred to them that breaches those hate speech laws. Even though these are global businesses, they still have to abide by the law in individual countries where they operate and I think it is time for us to establish our own legal code of ethics we expect them to adhere to. Right like to be clear, Facebook have always said they are a platform, not a publisher. To be clear, they are up platform, up platform, not a publisher. Others say that too. What do you think?

The Labour Party leader Matt Jeremy Corbyn called him an independent thinker who would be greatly missed. We have heard all about firefighters who have been called to rescue a cat stuck up a tree, but not usually like this... This is a mountain lion spot perched on a branch 50 feet up in the air near a house in California. Fire crews had to tranquilize it and lower it down with a harness before releasing it back into the wild. </p><p>A cat up a tree story! Now, back to Samira. Thank you, Carrie. A group of Labour MPs is expected to announce their departure from the Labour Party. This is the scene in Westminster. We will join them shortly when there is an announcement. At first... -- But first... A group of MPs leading an inquiry into fake news say big tech companies are \"failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to\" act against harmful content. The report by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee is calling for a compulsory code of ethics and an independent regulator to monitor social media platforms. The committee have been particularly saying the site needs far stricter regulation to end the spread of fake news. Facebook has told us that it is \"open to meaningful regulation\" and supports the committee's recommendation for electoral law reform. Well, we can talk to the MP Damian Collins who's the Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, who are behind the report. And the chief executive of Web Roots UK - Areeq Choudhury. And European Technology Correspondent for the Financial Times - Madhunita Murgia Damian Collins first. For... Images for children, films that would incite criminals to commit violent acts, that content should not be there and in many cases is already against the community guidelines of the tech companies but they are not always effective in dealing with it. We should say, in a statutory account, this is what you did to remove harmful content, when either referred to you or it should be content you should be able to identify for yourself using technology, and you have to remove it, and if you don't, the regulator could say to the company you have failed in your duty of care to users, therefore you are liable and we will impose a sanction against you. I think that is the system we need and we can't rely on the goodwill of the tech companies to police themselves. I think we have seen the era of self-regulation has not given the robust systems we need to deal with the most harmful forms of content. I would add to that as well, things like this information as well, the malicious systematic targeting of people with false information, again, with the purpose of swaying votes in elections, turning communities against each other, I think we have to view that as harmful as well. They have said they are open to some form of regulation. Is that a significant change because you have been very critical, particularly of the failure of some like Mark Zuckerberg to turn up before the committee. In my expense they want to establish the code for themselves. If the companies were good at rigorously enforcing their own guidelines lots of these problems would not exist, but they are not and that is why we need a statutory code. It is for Parliament and people to decide what that should look like and how it should be enforced but I think the broadcasting regulatory model is a good one that could be adapted to regulate content online as well but it should be for us to determine what the regulation should be like and enforce it. Other countries have started on this journey. In Germany they have legislation around hate speech and tech companies are if I had to take down content referred to them that breaches those hate speech laws. Even though these are global businesses, they still have to abide by the law in individual countries where they operate and I think it is time for us to establish our own legal code of ethics we expect them to adhere to. Right like to be clear, Facebook have always said they are a platform, not a publisher. To be clear, they are up platform, up platform, not a publisher. Others say that too. What do you think? They are not mutual service of content well they might well they would like to put the blame on the people who published it it is not always easy for us to identify those people, but secondly on Facebook you are not just seeing the most recent item posted by one of your friends, your are seeing content Facebook has selected for you, the content it thinks you are</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC2SC-aae6d9546a004265aad4f1d908d3a85f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC2SCOT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFP-3NF1-DY08-30CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402034</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

A group of Labour MPs is expected to announce their departure from the Labour Party. This is the scene in Westminster. We will join them shortly when there is an announcement. At first... -- But first... A group of MPs leading an inquiry into fake news say big tech companies are \"failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to\" act against harmful content. The report by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee is calling for a compulsory code of ethics and an independent regulator to monitor social media platforms. The committee have been particularly critical of Facebook - saying the site needs far stricter regulation to end the spread of fake news. Facebook has told us that it is \"open to meaningful regulation\" and supports the committee's recommendation for electoral law reform. Well, we can talk to the MP Damian Collins who's the Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, who are behind the report. And the chief executive of Web Roots UK - Areeq Choudhury. And European Technology Correspondent for the Financial Times - Madhunita Murgia Damian Collins first. For... Images for children, films that would incite criminals to commit violent acts, that content should not be there and in many cases is already against the community guidelines of the tech companies but they are not always effective in dealing with it. We should say, in a statutory account, this is what you did to remove harmful content, when either referred to you or it should be content you should be able to identify for yourself using technology, and you have to remove it, and if you don't, the regulator could say to the company you have failed in your duty of care to users, therefore you are liable and we will impose a sanction against you. I think that is the system we need and we can't rely on the goodwill of the tech companies to police themselves. I think we have seen the era of self-regulation has not given the robust systems we need to deal with the most harmful forms of content. I would add to that as well, things like this information as well, the malicious systematic targeting of people with false information, again, with the purpose of swaying votes in elections, turning communities against each other, I think we have to view that as harmful as well. They have said they are open to some form of regulation. Is that a significant change because you have been very critical, particularly of the failure of some like Mark Zuckerberg to turn up before the committee. In my expense they want to establish the code for themselves. If the companies were good at rigorously enforcing their own guidelines lots of these problems would not exist, but they are not and that is why we need a statutory code. It is for Parliament and people to decide what that should look like and how it should be enforced but I think the broadcasting regulatory model is a good one that could be adapted to regulate content online as well but it should be for us to determine what the regulation should be like and enforce it. Other countries have started on this journey. In Germany they have legislation around hate speech and tech companies are if I had to take down content referred to them that breaches those hate speech laws. Even though these are global businesses, they still have to abide by the law in individual countries where they operate and I think it is time for us to establish our own legal code of ethics we expect them to adhere to. Right like to be clear, Facebook have always said they are a platform, not a publisher. To be clear, they are up platform, up platform, not a publisher. Others say that too. What do you think? They are not mutual service of content well they might well they would like to put the blame on the people who published it it is not always easy for us to identify those people, but secondly on Facebook you are not just seeing the most recent item posted by one of your friends, your are seeing content Facebook has selected for you, the content it thinks you are most likely to be interested in</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCTWO-4da7bff480e04f0a81b9275ebf9d2f08</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCTWO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFP-3NF1-DY08-30D9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402047</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Social media can still be really supportive, I am still active on Instagram and I find lots of support that, but it was after I started using it that I discovered how toxic it can be and how difficult it is to navigate away from the toxic contents, it can be hidden, especially on Instagram where you just have pictures and you can post something innocent like a picture of a flower but the comments under that image can be so toxic. Use all people telling others to kill themselves? -- you so people? People are turning their biographies and can ask them different things, lots of these are abused, I have seen comments telling people to kill themselves, comments about different people telling people that they are fat, they are horrible, they are worthless, they don't deserve to be alive. Have you personally had any of these? Not personally, I have seen these comments to other people, I am giving my best to not open myself up for those comments, but for people in a vulnerable place it is quite addictive to feel like that, it feels how you feel about yourself, so I can sympathise with the people who open themselves up to it, to a certain extent, but equally it is very difficult to avoid. It fuels how people feel about themselves, can you explain? One of the things with depression, anxiety, for me at least and I think a lot of people I know with similar issues, you kind of feel like you are the worst person in the world, and you want the people to agree with that, because then that verifies that by being nasty to yourself you are doing the right thing. So you almost want people to tell you these things because it makes you feel like what you are doing is the right thing, and then it spirals, you feeling bad about yourself, other people making you feel bad about yourself, it leads you to doing quite drastic things. It is really upsetting, listening to what Sarah had many others have experienced. You think it is time for the companies to hand over data so the harm it is doing can be properly assessed? How do you envisage that? What Sarah has been talking about is very upsetting that it describes the situation so well, having worked on an inpatient unit for so many years, you see that in small environments between young people on inpatient units, but apply</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-f7e912ceb3e9467c903641ab01782b9a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0P-CWV1-DY08-30Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"775\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

And Dr Rachel O'Connell - an internet safety expert who was formerly chief security officer at Bebo. Deepak, what do you think of the BBC's own bot? BBC Chat Safe? Yeah ? the service the BBC is planning is quite phenomenal, it's probably the first service done at scale which will empower kids to be in command and it's a huge step in the right direction. What do you think? I think it's highly laudable and something the Internet industry should engage with, and we should equip people with the ability to leverage technology to protect children on line and that will push people to come to the table ? everyone knows it's possible, everyone.

That meant there was no impetus to deploy resources and money towards technological innovation and I think in the recent months and since the General Data Protection Regulation came in, there are rules now, companies will process the data of anyone under the age of 16 who must obtain parental consent and are complicit in that it is age Czech children under the age of 16. Businesses know the age band of the children and then they can create safer digital spaces so we are at a inflection point and it's fantastic that BBC is urging the government to do more. You have developed Oyoty which urges apps to recognise risky selfies, risky connections and possible grooming, briefly and concisely explain how it works and how reliable it is? Oyoty is one of the applications we have is a demonstrator of a larger underlying technology which is INAUDIBLE That children might experience in real-time and online, the idea being that with all of this identified within their phones in a very private manner, the children can then be offered interventions both technical and educational. The example is if someone has taken a selfie INAUDIBLE Could see do you want to share this because this is what could happen and show them a scenario in terms of what other kids have faced, similar situations, it becomes a way to rethink. Is it working, do you have evidence that kids are having second thoughts for example? I can give you the INAUDIBLE We did trials of about INAUDIBLE Is also the basis for interaction you have with larger platforms so I can tell you you will probably find the same technology growing into other platforms as well. So it definitely does work. And it's in the same theme as what will go out in the BBC service at scale, so to say, in the same measure and it definitely works. The best thing is during our first INAUDIBLE We were able to identify more than 300 pieces of INAUDIBLE Shared online which were definitely not meant to be shared online.

You know, they are doing this really - they think they are being smart in terms of lumping everything in together and saying, \"Take it or leave it\", regardless of what type of concerns you might have, and doing all the types of things where jobkeeper might not be provided anymore, but they will allow an employer to make all sorts of changes to someone's workplace arrangements, and saying that, \"If you don't like that, well then jobkeeper - everything will grind to a halt.\"</p><p> This is something that certainly my side of politics needs to start taking a firmer line on.

There's no question that Google provides useful services to Australians. There's no question that Facebook provides useful service to Australians. That's why 19 million Australians a month use Google; more than 17 million use Facebook. There's also no question that having a vigorous news media sector is an important part of our liberal democracy. It's important that there is trusted, reliable news from organisations which have journalists, which have editors, which have editorial policies. These are all the policy issues we're working through in a very careful and systemic way. The point I make is, with these kinds of issues, it is not without precedent for large, global tech companies to make heavy-handed threats.</p><p> PK:  So are they bullies? Do they behave like bullies?</p><p> Fletcher:  </p><p> It's not without precedent for them to make heavy-handed threats. </p><p> PK:  You don't want to use the word \"bully\", but that's what you're implying - that they use their power in a way that is unfair and disproportionate.</p><p> Fletcher:  Patricia, we will continue on with our careful, thorough public policy process. One thing that's very important about the way that we carry out public policy in Australia is that we do it making sure that all stakeholders have the chance to comment, have the chance to put their views to government. </p><p>We've charged our competition regulator with taking on this issue because of the significant competition implications.

But if there is follow-through, you still haven't addressed that key part of the question, which is - can the government stop Facebook and Instagram from actually blocking this news content being shared? Because you can't, can you? They can do whatever they want.</p><p> Paul Fletcher:  Well, we expect people doing business in Australia to comply with the law of the land in Australia. Now, Facebook has made a statement this morning - it's free to do that. Frankly, I'll leave it to them to explain what it is that they mean by that. But we're clear on what our public policy process is.</p><p> Patricia Karvelas:  OK, if I could just politely interrupt - they could still comply with the law, and just not let people share it. They're complying, because they're not using it - that's the way they can get around it. What do you say to that? Because you can't do anything.</p><p> Fletcher:  Again, what I say to it is that I'm not going to be commenting or seeking to explain or analyse a statement that Facebook has made about the way it conducts its business. What I'm happy to speak about is the government's public policy intention here. Let's go back to the fact that the ACCC was charged with inquiring into these issues.</p><p>That inquiry began as long ago as the end of 2017. It's a very thorough and comprehensive piece of work. It found that Google and Facebook have substantial market power - over 17 million Australians use Facebook every month; over 19 million Australians use Google every month. </p><p>And as the ACCC has found, these companies are unavoidable business partners for Australian news media businesses. And so what the government has asked the ACCC to do is to develop a mandatory code - \"mandatory\" means backed by the force of law - and it's gone through a careful and thorough process to do that. The most recent step in that has been a four-week consultation process. It will now give its advice to government and government will then consider how we act in relation to that advice. But let's be clear...</p><p> Karvelas:  Do you feel like Facebook is bluffing here?</p><p> Fletcher: Well, the point I make is - it is far from unprecedented for big tech companies to make heavy-handed threats.

Among those in hospital, 26 people are now in intensive care units.</p><p>Over 6.2m tests for Covid-19 have now been carried out. In Australia, there were over 41,000 tests carried out in our country yesterday, but it is essential that testing continues around the country and that people do not become complacent.</p><p>If you have symptoms, no matter how mild, please arrange to get tested, then isolate at home while you wait for your results. </p><p>Even with the consistent fall in new diagnoses, contact tracing remains essential. We must ensure that every new case of Covid-19 is followed up every day.</p><p>I acknowledge the work of our colleagues in Victoria to ensure that this is happening, and the support being provided by contact tracers around the country. We remain very concerned about any cases of Covid-19 in aged care services.</p><p>It's heartening to see the decline in the number of cases among staff and residents in aged care facilities in Victoria. </p><p>Yesterday, the government announced half a billion dollars to include funding for enhanced infection control capability in every aged care facility in the country, including an on-site clinical lead in infection control. </p><p>Funding will support aged care workers to reduce the number of people working across a number of aged care facilities. </p><p>And funding will also improve communications with families and improve visitation arrangements. </p><p>All these measures will enhance both the quality and the safety of our nation's residential aged care facilities and our home care services for elderly. </p><p>Finally, I want to acknowledge the sacrifices which have been made and which continue to be made by people across Australia but especially by the people of Melbourne and across Victoria.

Isn't it the case that at least 17 countries have signed and sealed at least 49 agreements to secure potential Covid-19 vaccines? Together, these deals guarantee over 6bn doses - but Australia hasn't actually signed a single deal for a single dose. Why has the prime minister provided false hope with a big announcement of a \"deal\" which simply doesn't yet exist?</p><p> Greg Hunt gets this one as well:</p><p>I'm very pleased to respond to the member for McMahon's question. Let me quote, specifically, the response of AstraZeneca to this so-called claim. This is what they wrote to the authors of the article in particular at Pharma In Focus:</p><p>\"We stand behind what was stated at this morning's press conference between the prime minister, Prof Kelly and ourselves. AstraZeneca is thrilled. Your interpretation is incorrect. We have not questioned the veracity of the letter of intent. We have never questioned the deal...\" - I want to repeat the phrase - \"we have never questioned the deal, and we are not perplexed about the agreement. We really don't appreciate the approach Pharma In Focus has taken.\" Melissa Milliard,... AstraZeneca Communications.</p><p>I am sorry if those two words offend the shadow minister. I realise that this is not the portfolio he wished for. It's not the position he chose and it shows, because there is not much work or research. </p><p>He got very excited... he got very excited about two words - \"deal\" and \"agreement\". And they're the words from AstraZeneca. But stepping back, where is Australia in all of this?</p><p>We are in the fortunate position that, because of our onshore manufacturing capacity, because of the ability to work with CSL, because of the ability to deliver whole-of-population support, we have been able to identify carefully, as one would want, the best-in-class of the vaccines - the most capable, the most prospective, the most likely to deliver an early outcome, a safe outcome, and an effective outcome for the Australian population.</p><p>And that's precisely what we've done. Already with AstraZeneca, but more is to come, as well as the onshore manufacturing and, therefore, the delivery of whole-of-population vaccination outcomes. </p><p>And you know why? You know why we can do this? Because we've just delivered record vaccination rates in Australia as well for five-year-olds. We've also delivered on the PBS. </p><p>We were not the ones that stopped the listing of medicines. We were not the ones that held up the funding for the PBS, in particular for medicines for schizophrenia and medicines for endometriosis. These are the things that they stopped. So we'll deliver whole-of-population vaccine exactly as AstraZeneca has said through whether you call it the deal or the agreement - both are their words. But that's what we'll deliver [to] the Australian people.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 6.16am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 6.04am BST </p><p> Chris Bowen, the shadow health minister,  to  Scott Morrison: </p><p>On 19 August, the prime minister announced Australia had a \"deal\" with the drug company AstraZeneca to secure a Covid-19 vaccine. But AstraZeneca said there was no deal, and a local manufacturer had not been found. Why do the prime minister's announcements never match their reality?</p><p> Scott Morrison: </p><p>Thank you, Mr Speaker. The shadow minister for health has a habit of coming up with all sorts of sledges that always end up proving not to be true, Mr Speaker.</p><p>I'll ask the minister for health to update further.</p><p> Greg Hunt: </p><p>Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Unfortunately for the shadow minister for health, he neglected the second part of the discussion that day where AstraZeneca actually wrote to the paper in question and rejected their statement, reaffirmed that which they said next to the prime minister, noted that they had struck an agreement with the government that this was the first stage and the most important stage - this is the first and the most important stage - and is a written agreement between the government and AstraZeneca.</p><p>I think the shadow minister will have a very difficult time in the future when he looks back on the fact that we will have delivered whole-of-population vaccines for Australia. We will have delivered it. We have a written agreement with AstraZeneca. </p><p>We have signed that agreement. It's my name on that agreement. And as the person who had worked through it with them as one of this team which had the authority of the expenditure review committee to do that, we have put Australia in a position where we are now at the forefront of those countries which will have access to vaccines. </p><p>AstraZeneca isn't the only vaccine, I would also mention. We are working with a variety of other companies around the world. We are working in terms of Australian manufacturing production with CSL. </p><p>So what we will see is that the Australian population will be given access to whole-of-population vaccines on a free basis, which is one of the fundamental pathways for the road out for Australians, so we have containment and we have capacity. </p><p>The ultimate capacity is that of vaccination. It happens that we are in a fortunate position because we have Australian manufacturing capacity on top of our access. Indeed, we also have - within Australia - an over-$350m Covid vaccine preparedness and treatment program.</p><p>That includes the investments in the University of Queensland molecular clamp, a $5m investment. But also $25m of additional funding for clinical trials, which was announced only in the last 10 days. So all of these things have come together as part of our capacity structure.</p><p>Primary care, aged care, hospitals and vaccines. And, in particular, we have a written agreement with AstraZeneca as the first and the most important part. We have advanced negotiations with other companies. And we have production capability, as well as the capacity to be part of the [vaccine].</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 6.11am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 6.02am BST </p><p>The Labor leader in the Senate,  Penny Wong, has launched an extraordinary broadside against the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, in support of a motion to censure him over Covid-19 deaths in aged care.</p><p>Wong said Colbeck had been \"found wanting\" and the grief and loss caused by his mishandling of the portfolio can be \"measured in the number of lives lost\".</p><p>\"When the most vulnerable older Australians are victims of neglect - when does this chamber say someone must be held accountable?

What do they have against... The harsh reality of Covid-19 is it has had a significant impact on small businesses right around the country.</p><p>We all know that small business owners are often the ones who are first into their office or to their shop, and they're the last to leave. </p><p>They work at the front of the office or the shop, and they work at the back, in the back office, Mr Speaker. </p><p>And they have received unprecedented support from the Morrison government through this crisis. </p><p>And that support has been very varied. It's either been through the jobkeeper payment, which has helped support their workers keep a job through this crisis. </p><p>It's been through the cashflow boost, which has helped meet their working capital requirements through this crisis.

Prime minister, will you use the upcoming budget to make childcare universal and free?</p><p> Dan Tehan gets this one:</p><p>I thank the member for his question. What we have done in government since we introduced changes to the child care subsidy two years ago is to make sure that those who earn the least get accessible care, get affordable care. </p><p>And what that has meant is that, for parents, there has been a 3.2% out-of-pocket reduction in cost since the child care subsidy came into placement</p><p>And not only that... it has led to participation increasing and, in particular, female participation increasing. </p><p>We've seen a 6% increase in female participation. So the subsidies, the changes that we've put in place, have worked. And what it's enabled us to do is to ensure that the support is there for the sector. </p><p>And it's also enabled us to provide support for the sector through Covid-19. And I once again take this opportunity - and I'm pretty sure it's World Educators' Day tomorrow - to thank all those early educators who have supported the childcare sector throughout this Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The work that they have done is outstanding. On behalf of the parliament, I thank them for all the work that they have done helping us carry the sector through Covid-19.

And there is more to be done. Because we still need to close that gap on the needs that are there. And we will continue to do that each and every year, Mr Speaker. </p><p>Because, like everyone in this chamber, we want to ensure that elderly Australians are treated with dignity and with respect and can get the care and support that they seek, whether it's in a private facility, a public facility, or a not-for-profit facility, Mr Speaker.

The royal commission - which I initiated soon after becoming prime minister, Mr Speaker - was it designed to ensure that all in this place and some - like the leader of the opposition - have been in this place for quite some considerable time. </p><p> And the royal commission has observed, as have many outside the royal commission, Mr Speaker, that the challenges that we have in aged care are not the product of just one or two years, Mr Speaker. They are the product of 30 years of how policy has impacted on the aged care sector.* </p><p>Mr Speaker, it is important that, as we seek to address the issues that the royal commission will be, I'm sure, identifying - and as we, as I outlined to the House yesterday - have even since the royal commission, Mr Speaker, announced numerous measures which are being implemented and have been implemented and will continue to be implemented to address the very significant issues and challenges that are in aged care, the government, Mr Speaker, does not walk away from those challenges, and we have done everything we can to ensure that a light is shone upon, Mr Speaker, the challenges that are in the aged care sector. </p><p>And we back that up with the commitment that, during the Covid period alone, Mr Speaker, we have contributed an extra $1.5bn to address the critical needs that exist in that sector. Mr Speaker, every single death that has occurred as a result of Covid - or has otherwise occurred in the aged care sector, or where there has been, Mr Speaker, issues of neglect or where there has been issues of a failure to come up to standards by operators, be they public, private or not-for-profit - these are the challenges that we are addressing.

We've got the Boxing Day Test, the Australian Open, the Formula 1 Grand Prix, and the NBL season, all really important events to Victoria, all conversations we're having in an ongoing sense and I'm confident about all of those events occurring here. </p><p>The grand final, look, it may well be that by the time the grand final is played, our case numbers here in Victoria are extremely low... Unfortunately, we can't wait until late October for the AFL to make a decision about where that will be. So that's a limiting factor for us. </p><p>If we were able to make a decision on 23 October about where the game might be on 24 October, you might be in a different space other than for the fact that arrangements have to be put in place very, very soon. I never give up hope until things are done but it is a difficult proposition.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.23am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 3.19am BST </p><p> Martin Pakula is also the sports minister, so he is asked about the AFL grand final.</p><p>A decision on where it will be made is due very soon.</p><p> Pakula: </p><p>I'm not certain it will be today. I think it will be in the next 48 hours. The AFL and myself and my department are in ongoing discussions. I'd expect to have a conversation with [the AFL chief executive] Gillon [McLachlan] this afternoon. </p><p>But I'm not going to conduct those discussions or those negotiations in the public domain. I think you'd understand that. So, we're looking for the best possible deal for Victoria, in the event that the grand final goes elsewhere. </p><p>But we're still having those discussions with the AFL and we would expect that they'd be resolved in the next couple of days.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.21am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 3.17am BST </p><p> Daniel Andrews on how Victoria will reopen once restrictions begin to lift:</p><p>This has been a very, very terrible year. We still have a way to go. But unless we find it in ourselves to stay the course on this, then 2021 won't be much better. </p><p>I am determined to make sure that we can have a long-term, safe and stable Covid normal throughout 21 until we get a stable fix to this, which is a vaccine, but that will be a considerable task, to manufacture it.</p><p>All of that is still some way off. The only option the only option - unless you're willing to simply fritter away all the pain and effort, all the amazing work Victorians have done, [and] I'm not prepared to do that - it must be done properly. </p><p>It will be frustrating. We won't be able to open everything on the same day. We just can't do that. I don't think Victorians want all that they have given, all that they have achieved to count for nothing. They want it to mean something. </p><p>What it can ultimately mean is a long-term Covid normal that we can properly defend against this virus. It is not going to go away completely. There will still be cases, there will still be outbreaks. That's why these weeks and months ahead are so, so important.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.19am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 3.14am BST </p><p>So Queensland said a Covid-positive person from Victorian flew into Queensland on a Jetstar flight (they are in quarantine).</p><p>Queensland said it was alerted by Victorian authorities that the person was positive.</p><p> Brett Sutton, though, says no:</p><p>I know there has been media reporting on this case this morning, but we have no information on a suspected infectious person getting on a flight.

We'll have to add to that and fill in some of the detail around that, not based on what we hope but on what the data tells us as we get case numbers each day, each week, right throughout the year. </p><p>I made the point yesterday and I make it again - we had a very different Mother's Day. We'll have a very different Father's Day. We have to stay the course on this so we'll have as close to normal a Christmas Day as possible. </p><p>All the sacrifice, the hard work that we have done, that has to count for something. That's why getting this right, not opening up too much too fast but, instead, doing it in a gradual, slow, steady, cautious, however you want to term it, but in a safe way, that is how we will find a Covid normal that we can lock in for a long period of time. </p><p>That essentially says that all the hard work and the pain, that the massive effort that Victorians have put in counts for something. It counts for a steady set of arrangements, a steady set of rules, a Covid normal that we can actually maintain, a Covid normal that we can defend against this virus. </p><p>But you'll never get to that position and, in fact, you'll just fritter away all the good work that Victorians have done, if you don't properly defeat the second wave. And not just pretend you've done it but actually do it. That's why very low numbers, and those low numbers being locked in for a period of time - not one day at a low number but a clear pattern - that's what's essential.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.15am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 3.07am BST </p><p>Not unexpected, but still sigh-worthy for this little locked out duck - there will be no spring fling in Queensland this September for jurisdictions Queensland has declared to be a hotspot - which includes Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT. </p><p>In short, there will be no border changes this month - the Queensland border looks like staying locked until at least October.

We are heading down to low cases. I doubt that they'll be under 10 but it really does depend on people stepping up, getting tested, us identifying those cases. If we know where every case in Victoria is today, we could end it in a week. </p><p>Part of the challenge is that we don't know. There are always a proportion of people who haven't tested and continue to transmit, or who have tested and haven't isolated immediately. That's our challenge and that's stuff that I can't control in its entirety.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.05am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 2.50am BST </p><p>Prof  Brett Sutton  continues: </p><p>They're positive signs, no question. But holding the course with low numbers is just the thing that we need to do to stop it all bouncing back or to stop chains of transmission continuing undetected within the community. </p><p>Which means that if we go to easing, if we're not aware of hidden cases because people have not come forward for testing, they will persist and then accelerate, as we ease restrictions, as we increase allowances for people to interact with others. If there are mystery chains of transmission, just like mystery cases, they will accelerate and potentially explode. </p><p>And if we only detect them when they're large outbreaks, it means there's more community transmission out there and even though we can identify and get on top of outbreaks, it does become really challenging if there's widespread community transmission. </p><p>That's a challenge across the world. That's what New South Wales has been successfully battling but for two months of intensive contact tracing so the very best thing that we can do is to drive these numbers down to the lowest possible level so we don't have to deal with chains of transmission that are unidentified, so they are literally not there in the community. </p><p>That protects our aged care workforce.

That's an overall increase of 58 with the reclassifications numbering 12. We're certainly on the right pathway here. Cases continue to be driven down because of everything that everyone is doing, because of the restrictions in place.</p><p>I said yesterday we had to hold the course. These are low numbers. It can cause complacency for people who think they don't need to test but testing is the pathway to drive numbers down. </p><p>If we don't know that there are cases in the community, if we can't identify people and they're not aware themselves, then they're going to put their close family and other close contact at risk. </p><p>Obviously, we're reducing the number of close contact that people have in the workplace, out in the community, but everyone still has close contact and if you're a positive case and you're not being tested and you're not isolating because of that positive test coming back to you, this virus will continue to spread.

I think it's fair to say that the overwhelming view of those groups so far is the need for certainty and the need to ensure that as we ease restrictions we head in one direction, rather than out and back again.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.57am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 2.42am BST </p><p>Consultations with business and industry groups began last night. </p><p> Daniel Andrews  says the roadmap out of stage four is slowly being formed:</p><p>But with a full week's additional data and the practical and really important input in a very contemporary sense from workers, from business, from community groups, we on Sunday will be able to give people a clearer sense of what the phases to come look like, what the weeks and months to come look like. </p><p>And ultimately, this is all about making sure that the sacrifice, the pain, the amazing work that Victorians have done counts for something. </p><p>It's no good doing this too fast, opening up too much, too quickly, only to be open for just a few weeks and back in lockdown by Christmas time. </p><p>We don't want that.

It will be based on the science, the evidence and the best of medical advice. </p><p>But we believe that given the low case numbers, it will be possible for us to have different settings in regional Victoria, and a different timeline and roadmap compared to what will be essential in metropolitan Melbourne, given the different places in terms of the number of positive cases, the chains of transmission. The challenge is different in metropolitan Melbourne than it is in regional Victoria. </p><p>We will always make sure the rules are as simple and logical as they can.

I was very hesitant in closing the border but we won't be hesitant... We won't leave it a day longer than we need to, but we have to make sure it's the right thing to do at the right time and it's in order to make sure we're keeping the community safe. I'd rather be having this conversation with you today rather than having a conversation about why there are hundreds of cases in regional New South Wales because of what's happening in Victoria.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.32am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 2.21am BST </p><p> Gladys Berejiklian  makes a point of taking the blame for the NSW side of the border angst - at least when it comes to the timing of it all.</p><p>Pandemics are far from perfection when it comes to having to make decisions quickly and can I tell you, hand on heart, that one of the most difficult decisions I've made personally and the government's made during this pandemic has been closing the New South Wales-Victorian border?</p><p>It was a decision of last resort and, in fact, I remember getting heavily criticised for not moving earlier and one of the main reasons we didn't move earlier was because we knew the disruption and angst it would cause people in the border communities. </p><p>For all of you - you don't see yourselves as a state border, as two communities, but one. And I deeply appreciate what that government decision has resulted in in terms of disruption and angst felt by many and I want to say how deeply I regret everybody's challenges during this time, but please know you're not alone. </p><p>We've had many people on both sides of the border, within the border communities, and outside the border communities, who have been deeply impacted by the pandemic and as the Victorian numbers continue to decline, that gives us greater confidence to ease restrictions and to listen to the concerns raised by border communities. Can I, on this occasion, thank a number of community leaders for their support. </p><p>Firstly, to my parliamentary colleague Justin Clancy, who has been outstanding. Please know that he has very much been on the side of his community and raised with me - almost initially on a daily basis but certainly at least every couple of days through direct phone calls, meetings and other forms of communication the concerns expressed by his community, especially when the initial 50km zone was reduced and the impacts it had. </p><p>I regret deeply the fact that the community wasn't prepared for what we had to do at that time and I want to assure everybody that Justin Clancy, until this point in time, has been outstanding and any frustration people feel should be against me and nobody else. I'm the leader and the buck stops with me and I want people to appreciate that every decision we take is in the interests of our citizens. </p><p>The alternative to what we did could have resulted in high rates of infection in rural and regional New South Wales, not just on the border communities, but throughout the state. We have had a few close calls in respect to the virus seeping into or seeding into regional communities and border communities, but our health officials have done an outstanding job in contact tracing. </p><p>I also wanted to acknowledge Justin's colleague on the other side of the border, Mr Tilly, for his advocacy and I know his community is equally anxious about the changes that have occurred.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.26am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 2.15am BST </p><p> NSW records 13 new Covid cases  </p><p>NSW has recorded 13 new diagnoses of Covid in the last 24 hours - two are in hotel quarantine. </p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.16am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 1.59am BST </p><p>Incoming Greens senator,  Lidia Thorpe, the replacement for Victorian senator and former leader Richard Di Natale, joined the party room (remotely) today.

Has the government been told why she's been detained?</p><p> Birmingham:  Fran, I don't have any details that I can provide on that matter. We did have consular access with Ms Cheng on 27 August through virtual and video means. We've been obviously in contact with her family who, as you would have seen, have issued a statement acknowledging that they are doing everything they can to support Cheng Lei and her welfare, that they acknowledge the process that is underway, and they've asked for both privacy and restraint in relation to commentary on these matters. And we will continue to do what we can to support Ms Cheng and her family through what must be difficult and trying times.</p><p> Kelly : Absolutely. Australian officials have had consular access to her as you mentioned by video link. How is she? And do we know where she's been detained?</p><p> Birmingham: Fran, I understand that we have some of those details. As I said, we though, will be restrained in what we say publicly out of acknowledgement for the process, the family, and we simply hope that these matters can be dealt with according to proper process and as expeditiously as possible.</p><p> Kelly:  What is proper process? Because the ABC reports that Cheng Lei has not been charged, she's being held under what's known as residential surveillance which means you can be detained and questioned for up to six months with no access to lawyers. Is that acceptable to the Australian government? That such an arbitrary attention can occur to - detention can occurred on Australian citizens?</p><p> Birmingham:  China's systems are obviously very, very different to our systems, and we have to acknowledge that. And those risks that Australians face when they travel overseas - a risk that we often point out in relation to many, many different countries that are different compared with if they were operating in Australia. We don't see the same legal system, but ultimately there is a process there, we will provide whatever assistance we can. The family, I know, are working to try to provide legal advice and assistance as well, and we will give them whatever support we can as well.</p><p> Kelly:  Do you think Cheng Lei is a pawn in a worsening relationship between China and Australia?</p><p> Birmingham:  Nothing would be particularly helpful for me to try to draw that link, Fran. Cheng Lei is an Australian, a journalist who has been working in China for some period of time. I've actually met her and been interviewed by her while overseas myself. I feel for her family very much at this point in time, and it's why we will do what we can to assist her, as we would and have any Australian in these sorts of circumstances. There is a long history of different consular cases and points of difficulty that we've seen over the years, and so we shouldn't see this as a first or a one off. But obviously it's concerning for her family, and we will provide the assistance that we can.</p><p>    The Australian government was notified in mid-August that Australian citizen and CGTN news anchor Cheng Lei was being detained in China.

As Amy flagged earlier, Labor is planning to vote against government legislation allowing the minister to prohibit items, like mobile phones, in immigration detention. </p><p>That vote is likely in the House this afternoon. The proposal will then go to the Senate. As things stand right now, the government doesn't have the numbers to get this through, so the legislation has dropped down today's batting order in the Senate. </p><p> Stirling Griff from Centre Alliance is opposed. \"100%\" he tells me. </p><p> Rex Patrick is also opposed. He tells me: \"Immigration detention serves an administrative purpose, not a punitive purpose. In these circumstances the restrictions on detainee rights must be reasonable and proportionate. </p><p>\"The government already has powers to deal with items of a criminal nature, or of concern, and with detainees breaking the law\". </p><p>So the Senate numbers make Jacqui  Lambie the critical vote. Lambie's office tells me she's sceptical about the legislation, but is keeping an open mind. </p><p>Presumably the government has slowed down consideration this afternoon in an effort to get Lambie over the line. </p><p>Her office is being lobbied heavily by refugee advocates.

News represents a fraction of what people see in their News Feed and is not a significant source of revenue for us. Still, we recognize that news provides a vitally important role in society and democracy, which is why we offer free tools and training to help media companies reach an audience many times larger than they have previously. </p><p>News organisations in Australia and elsewhere choose to post news on Facebook for this precise reason, and they encourage readers to share news across social platforms to increase readership of their stories. This in turn allows them to sell more subscriptions and advertising. Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge - additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers. </p><p>We already invest millions of dollars in Australian news businesses and, during discussions over this legislation, we offered to invest millions more. We had also hoped to bring <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/sep/01/coronavirus-live-news-who-says-states-cant-pretend-pandemic-is-over-french-cases-rise-50-in-august\">Facebook News</url> to Australia, a feature on our platform exclusively for news, where we pay publishers for their content. Since it launched last year in the US, publishers we partner with have seen the benefit of additional traffic and new audiences. </p><p>But these proposals were overlooked. Instead, we are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.</p><p>Facebook products and services in Australia that allow family and friends to connect will not be impacted by this decision. Our global commitment to quality news around the world will not change either. And we will continue to work with governments and regulators who rightly hold our feet to the fire. But successful regulation, like the best journalism, will be grounded in and built on facts. In this instance, it is not.</p><p> Related:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/sep/01/coronavirus-live-news-who-says-states-cant-pretend-pandemic-is-over-french-cases-rise-50-in-august\">Facebook threatens to block Australians from sharing news in battle over landmark media law</url></p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.17am BST</p><p>block-time published-time 1.11am BST </p><p> Ged Kearney spoke out against the mobile phone ban legislation in the parliament yesterday:</p><p>My community of Cooper regularly tell me how sickened and saddened they are to be governed by a party who continues with the cruel policy of indefinite detention. I don't doubt the desire to silence these brave refugees also lies at the heart of this bill. I don't doubt that there is a desire to silence these brave refugees. </p><p>No one is capable of enduring the torture of indefinite detention. </p><p>Again, the ASRC: Continued detention of these refugees, many with histories of trauma, is used as collective punishment for them having attempted to exercise their right to seek Australia's protection more than seven years ago. </p><p>After up to seven years on Manus or Nauru, the men at the Mantra have been confined to cramped hotel rooms for more than 12 months. They're unable to go outside except for sparse rostered visits to closed detention facilities to exercise. </p><p>The Covid outbreak has been extremely stressful, and many are rapidly deteriorating in terms of mental and physical health. I wrote to the minister back in April requesting that he consider community detention as a way to minimise the risk of a Covid outbreak.</p><p>The UNHCR, lawyers and public health officials made similar requests. The government's response to the risk of a Covid outbreak is to threaten the men with a move to over 3,000km away, to Yongah Hill, where they will lose access to their caseworkers, legal representation and community supports.</p><p>All the while, they are facing the prospect of losing access to their phones - their one connection to the outside world. </p><p>I genuinely fear what the passing of this legislation will do to the refugees. So I end with a plea to those who sit opposite. The people affected by this bill have been through enough. Many have escaped war, famine and other horrors and have spent much of the last seven years detained by this government. </p><p>This government has the power to drop this bill. It has the power to release refugees, where appropriate, into community detention. </p><p>It can make sure that refugees and people seeking asylum have access to medical treatment, and, most importantly, it has the power to resettle these people in safe, permanent homes.

However, he said the government was now \"committed\" to using it after seeing it being used with some success to contact trace active cases in NSW.</p><p>\"Because they were so pressured, they kept going without using the app. The public health unit felt that for a period of time, because they hadn't found value in it in those early cases, they did stop using it, we believe,\" Professor Murphy said.</p><p>We reported on Monday that the contact traced by the app was among 17 new cases reported in NSW on Saturday. NSW Health reported the find this way: \"For one of the cases where NSW Health accessed the COVIDSafe App data, a previously unrecognised exposure date from a known venue, Mounties, was identified. This resulted in the identification of an additional 544 contacts. Two people in this group presented for testing and were subsequently confirmed to have COVID-19,\" he said.</p><p>Professor Murphy's statement raises questions. Why aren't governments open and truthful in their statements about the app and their belief it is worthwhile, given that 6.81 million Australians have been prepared to download it? It is highly likely that fewer have the app installed and even fewer have it running. </p><p>Government Services Minister Stuart Robert keeps saying how well the app is operating in backing-up manual contact tracers, but the suggestion by a state that they stopped using it for a period suggests otherwise.</p><p>Governments need to level with the public about the use of this app given it is a pillar in Australia's response to coronavirus.</p><p>The hearing was told that 1186 cases of coronavirus were linked to the aged care sector on Tuesday, of which 136 could be linked to the St Basil's outbreak. All 11 deaths reported overnight were connected to nursing homes.</p><p>It was heard that while a St Basil's employee reported their infection to management on July 9, the state government didn't inform their federal counterparts until July 14.</p><p>\"The board chair became aware on the ninth (of July) but didn't raise it with Commonwealth,\" Professor Murphy said.</p><p>Current coronavirus protocol stipulates that aged care homes must notify the federal authorities that regulate the private system and the state public health unit within 30 minutes of learning of an infection.</p><p>St Basil's management has previously suggested state authorities were notified on July 9. It wasn't until July 15 that the federal government rolled-out widespread testing at the facility.</p><p>Professor Murphy said state health officials were likely overwhelmed by huge levels of community transmission in Victoria.</p><p>\"The Victorian public health unit had some delays in both getting tests back and identifying and analysing this was an aged care outbreak,\" he said.</p><p>Health Department deputy secretary Michael Lye gave evidence that St Basil's was the only provider that failed to notify federal regulators of an outbreak. \"The Victorians might have been under pressure but the service didn't notify us,\" he said.</p><p>Labor Senator Katy Gallagher probed the panel of government officials about whether Victorian health authorities lost precious time due to the delay in relaying the St Basil's outbreak. \"There was a five-day window where the Commonwealth had no line of sight or understanding that there was an outbreak at St Basil's,\" she said.</p><p>Aged Care Minister Richard Colbeck conceded there had been high-profile failures in care and communication standards. \"There's no point in me trying to pretend that it all did go as well as it should have done, because it didn't,\" he said.</p><p>Minister Colbeck drew the ire of Greens' Senator Rachel Siewart after he suggested it was appropriate for some aged care providers to keep active coronavirus cases secret from the public on the proviso that families were notified. \"I'm reluctant to have a public hit list of facilities that have been unfortunate enough to have an outbreak of COVID,\" he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">With Olivia Caisley</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">11.30am: </emphasis>               Mike Cannon-Brookes takes on new role            </p><p>Atlassian co-founder and co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes is becoming the chairman of venture capital outfit Blackbird, after the company announced it had raised $500m to invest into start-ups.</p><p>Blackbird partner Nick Crocker tells The Australian that Cannon-Brookes' experience building a billion-dollar business will be invaluable.</p><p>Cannon-Brookes will still serve as Atlassian co-CEO, and has his own investment vehicle, Grok Ventures. He is also on the board of several start-ups, including self-driving company Zoox, and is an outspoken climate change advocate.</p><p>\"He has had a set of experiences in scaling Atlassian that only he and Scott have had,\" Crocker says.</p><p>\"They started a software company with just the two of them as an idea, scaling it to be worth tens of billions of dollars and a public company that underpins every app that you and I probably use on our phones.</p><p/><p>\"He just has a set of experiences and insights that you just cannot get from anywhere else. And they're not experiences that he's read in books, they're experiences he has lived through. And what he's built is what we are trying to emulate at Blackbird.\"</p><p>Cannon Brookes says in a statement, \"Blackbird is three things at once - a start-up, an investment firm and an incredibly talented group of people backing ambitious founders. I share with the team a deep belief that the world change comes from entrepreneurs who are wildly wrong, then wildly right. </p><p>\"I'm honoured to be able to help the team on their next stage of growth.\"</p><p>Nick Crocker says his company's long-term relationships with partners including superannuation funds made it possible to close a $500m raise during a global health pandemic.</p><p/><p>\"We've been fortunate to be able to rely on those relationships, and our track record,\" he tells The Australian. \"Through a time of really intense uncertainty, there was definitely a moment of pause, but ultimately we've built those relationships over time and that pretty strong history of success has been confirmed.\"</p><p>Crocker says that the size of the fund is not a signal that Blackbird is necessarily looking for bigger start-up deals, and that if anything, is looking to invest in companies earlier.</p><p>\"For the right investment, we would write a $100,000 cheque, no hesitation,\" he says. \"We should constantly be going earlier and earlier, and with the relationships we build with founders, the only way for us to succeed in this job is to have those relationships start early.</p><p>\"This fund gives us the ability to build longer relationships with founders and invest more, and ultimately own more, of the best companies. And if we do that, that helps us achieve that goal of being the best in the world. \"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">9.00am: </emphasis>               TikTok is now about money            </p><p>TikTok has morphed from being just about security to being more about money. Sure, in the US TikTok will not exist as a Chinese company; it will either be banned or sold to probably Microsoft. The view that TikTok is a security risk is widely embraced.</p><p>President Donald Trump initially was against a plan for TikTok to be sold to a US vendor and wanted an outright ban. Now he has come around to a sale to Microsoft.</p><p>The deal would apply in the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.</p><p>Mr Trump now says he is partial to a Microsoft deal provided Microsoft pays a substantial amount to the US government. </p><p>\"I did say that 'If you buy it ... a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States, because we're making it possible for this deal to happen.' Right now, they don't have any rights unless we give it to them,\" The Wall Street Journal reports.</p><p>So it seems Microsoft will substantially shell out to the US government for the privilege of taking control of TikTok.</p><p>That sets a fascinating precedent. Could we see governments moving in on big tech, requiring a brokerage-type fee to sanction future acquisitions the companies desperately want?</p><p>There's another issue. By confining its purchase of TikTok to four countries including Australia, and presumably leaving current Chinese parent ByteDance still running TikTok in other jurisdictions, can we be sure that data belonging to Australians doesn't filter over into TikTok in other parts of the world, and hence to ByteDance.</p><p>For example, will TikTokers in, say, Brazil, still view Australian user content? If so, how can you guarantee that only videos made by Australians on TikTok get to ByteDance controlled parts of the service and not their data? Or will the TikTok service be ring-fenced, with users in one part of the network only visible to other users in the same section?</p><p>It sadly seems that a Microsoft acquisition of TikTok in the US which includes a \"brokerage\" fee to the Trump administration won't include a similar fee to the Morrison Government for TikTok transferring to Microsoft control in Australia. That's the workings of the world.</p><p>Finally, don't shed too many tears for Facebook which will miss out on the chance to easily entice TikTok users to its new Reels platform. This will be a harder to achieve if TikTok is in Microsoft hands rather than defunct. </p><p>We wait with bated breath.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">8.30am: </emphasis>               Canva investor Blackbird raises $500m            </p><p>Canva investor Blackbird Ventures has defied the COVID-19 pandemic to raise a $500m fund, led by local superannuation firms including Australian Super, Hesta, the Future Fund, Telstra Super and more.</p><p>The venture capital outfit, which owns a 14 per cent stake in Canva - more than any other investor - is the largest in Australia, having committed more than $1.24bn in funds.</p><p>Atlassian co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes has also taken on a role at Blackbird's board of directors as its chairman.</p><p>\"Just like the local start-ups Blackbird invests in, we too have the ambition to be the best in the world,\" said Blackbird co-founder Rick Baker.</p><p>The company is planning to deploy the funding to support Australian start-ups. Blackbird's first investment in Canva was $US250,000 before there was a product, and has now invested a total of $US110m into the global company.</p><p/><p>Other investors to pour money in to Blackbird's $500m fund include institutional clients of Cambridge Associates, First State Super, Cendana Capital, Greenspring Associates and Pavilion Capital.</p><p>Silicon Valley investor Bill Tai described Blackbird as \"Australia's leading unicorn catalyst.\"</p><p>\"This latest raise is evidence of how much Australia's start-up ecosystem has evolved since 2012 when Blackbird was founded,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>\"In 2012, there was almost no venture capital left in Australia. Paradoxically, this was just as the start-up ecosystem was starting to succeed, with start-ups like Atlassian, Aconex, Campaign Monitor and Retailmenot.</p><p>\"These companies were founded by highly ambitious, product-obsessed Australians who dared to attack global markets right from the beginning.</p><p>\"Blackbird was founded because we saw the opportunity to build a new venture capital firm specifically designed to be useful to these kinds of founders.\"</p><p>The company was five people at the beginning of its third fund, is currently 22 people and says it has plans to grow to 40 by the end of 2021.</p><p>\"We want to be the first investor to back a founder, earning their trust and building a relationship that allows us to continue investing as the company becomes successful and there is global competition to invest,\" Mr Baker said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTOL-f9752f80fe6b85763f15dc239f2b6a06</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HC-VF01-JBR4-F0SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2417\"/><timeReceived>6:09 AM AEDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"464E\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 4, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002PFM</classCode><className>WOOLWORTHS LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000504G</classCode><className>UNIVERSAL MUSIC PUBLISHING GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0006EHC</classCode><className>UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002PCM</classCode><className>WARNER MUSIC GROUP CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS452210 DEPARTMENT STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS445310 BEER, WINE &amp; LIQUOR STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS445110 SUPERMARKETS &amp; OTHER GROCERY (EXCEPT CONVENIENCE) STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC5921 LIQUOR STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC5411 GROCERY STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC5311 DEPARTMENT STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS512230 MUSIC PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC3652 PHONOGRAPH RECORDS &amp; PRERECORDED AUDIO TAPES &amp; DISKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Two-day meeting coming to a close today.</p><p>And a fiery hearing on Capitol Hill between William Barr and the Democrats. The hearing appeared to have more questions than answers at least that were allowed, but as he was grilled the A.G. had a question of his own. How long will we let our cities burn? Meanwhile, federal agents pulling out of Seattle now. Other cities could follow despite ongoing violence. Former New York City Mayor, Rudy Giuliani, with us this morning, 7:30 a.m. Eastern with more on the unrest in America and battling rising crime.</p><p>It's another big day for earnings this morning.

Take a look at where we stand this morning, up another $8.70 on the price of gold. Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, the battle between the next coronavirus stimulus relief plan is heating up. Democrats say that the Republican plan does not go far enough. The two sides are negotiating. The GOP proposing a second round of $1,200 checks for Americans making less than $75,000. Also in the $1 trillion plan from the GOP, cutting the federal unemployment bonus from $600 to $200 a week. Democrats are looking for those payments to go up to $6,000 per household and keeping the $600 a week employment extension in tact. The plan needs bipartisan support in order to pass in the Senate.</p><p>Sparks flying on Capitol Hill yesterday as the Democrats spar with Attorney General Bill Barr during a heated House hearing. Democrats grilled Barr on a long list of topics yesterday including his handling of civil unrest in Portland. Barr fired back accusing Democrats of turning a blind eye to ongoing violence across the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: Federal courts are under attack. Since when is it OK to try to burn down a federal court? If someone went down the street to the Prettyman court here, that beautiful courthouse we have right at the bottom of the hill, and started breaking windows and firing industrial-grade fireworks in to start a fire, throw kerosene balloons in and start fires in the court, is that OK? Is that OK now?</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Barr also denying accusation that he is carrying out President Trump's political wishes. We have more coming up on that. The Trump administration, meanwhile, will no longer accept new DACA applications while it conducts a legal review of the policy. The Obama-era program shielding illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children from deportation. The White House will also renew existing protections for only one year instead of two. The Supreme Court recently shut down efforts to end that program.</p><p>Grim new milestones to report in the COVID-19 pandemic. Six states have reported one-day records for deaths yesterday as Texas becomes the fourth state to pass the 400,000 COVID case mark. Dr. Anthony Fauci is now warning parts of the Midwest that there are early signs the coronavirus outbreak could be brewing in Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky.</p><p>Big tech on the hot seat today on Capitol Hill. The CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google will testify by video before the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee. They're expected to be grilled over their growing influence and the impact on competition. The testimony could help build public pressure for government action. In separate statements, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sundar Pichai all emphasized competition their companies face as well as their contributions to the U.S. economy. Take a look at big tech stocks this morning in the premarket ahead of the big show this morning. As you can see they're higher across the board.</p><p>Another big day for earnings, meanwhile. Futures are searching for direction this morning as we await a number of big names. Investors are waiting on Boeing, General Electric, General Motors, General Dynamics, and others all expected to report second quarter results before the opening bell this morning. We'll have all of those numbers when they hit the tape.</p><p>Joining me right now is Sit Fixed Income Senior Vice President, portfolio manager, Bryce Doty. Also joining the conversation this morning Fox Business's Dagen McDowell, Real Clear Politics White House Reporter, Philip Wegman, and Kingsview Asset Management Chief Investment Officer, Fox News Contributor, Scott Martin. Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to be here (ph).</p><p>PHILIP WEGMAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Thanks.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: Hi, guys.</p><p>BRYCE DOTY, SIT FIXED INCOME SENIOR VP &amp; PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Bryce, let me kick it off with you. We are expecting to hear from the Federal Reserve today after a two-day meeting. What are your expectations from the Fed? We know that rates are expected to stay at these levels until 2024 I believe.</p><p>DOTY: Yes, when Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks to his press conference today, he's probably going to be pretty depressing when he talks about the economy and the justification of that poor state of the economy for why they're extending all these lending programs, and we don't think investors are going to like it. We think investors will essentially howl and Powell today, and it could be a dip. I mean, I get it. He's facing, you know, the harsh, cold facts that, you know, things are really bad. He knows that schools are going to be reconvening soon. He's looking out one or two quarters. There's probably going to be another spike in coronavirus cases before a vaccine comes out, but we're firmly in the - by the dip the vaccine trades, so we have a little powder dry. We're looking to take advantage of this, what I refer to as the howl and Powell trade today, and we'll see how that plays out, but that's kind of how we think the market's going to react to his comments this afternoon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, of course, the Fed already announcing it is extending the emergency lending program through December, that emergency funds were set to expire in September. So the stimulus keeps on coming. Does that affect what you're doing, Bryce?</p><p>DOTY: It does. So on one hand you have this bolstering of the economy, and it certainly is definitely helping corporations feel to (ph) borrow money at extremely low rates. That's been fantastic. I mean, they're doing everything they can, and his message will be that they will continue to do everything they can, every - whatever it takes to get us over the hump, to get companies the liquidity they need to survive to next year. In doing so, you know, he tends to just -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DOTY: -- talk about all the really bad things going on with the economy and employment and things as well, but we - you know, when you look out past six months, though, there could be an incredibly strong rebound in the economy, and there's a lot of pent up demand out there. People can't - are itching to get out and spend money again. As soon as they feel safe at all, you know, you're going to see a big pop.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DOTY: The treatments have been better. The fatality rate's coming down, so there's a lot of positive momentum there. We just need to get past the next three, four months, and I think we're on - we'll be at a better track. So we like all of that, and any time -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DOTY: -- there's a dip or hit, we're going to take advantage of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well you make a good point. Scott Martin, jump in here because Larry Kudlow yesterday told Fox Business that he sees the V-shaped economic recovery still in tact despite the coronavirus resurgence. So he was looking, Scott, for 20 percent growth story in the second half is what he told us last time Kudlow joined us.</p><p>MARTIN: Yes, that'd be awesome, and it's probably just a delayed V more than anything, right? We probably thought we were going to get into that V just about now, and it looks like it's a couple months off, but something to your point, Bryce, let's just, hey, that things do start to reaccelerate as you just noted in the fall and into the winter. Do you think then the Fed eases off the stimulus kick and we actually see maybe, gosh, a steepening of the yield curve over time here, therefore helping the banks?</p><p>DOTY: I do. I agree that, you know, let's say there's is a vaccine that comes out. There's a lot of hope. There's going to be a huge market reaction when that happens, right? You might want to take some money off the table because the next step isn't so good for investors even though it's really good for the economy. So everything's going backwards. You know, whatever's bad for the economy ends up being good for the markets because the Fed is going to just throw a ton of money in there and a lot of stimulus, and then you're right. If the economy gets traction, they're going to pull back, the curve will steepen. That will be good for banks. It might - it wouldn't be good for the longer bonds, and I think that they'll pull back on their purchases of corporate bonds for sure. The lending programs haven't - they haven't done a ton, but that'll probably lessen. So it'll be this balancing act that whenever you see some sort of strength in the economy as an investor you have to think, OK, now the Fed's not going to be quite as aggressive. So it's almost like, you know, a little bit of a contrarian on economic news and definitely the volatility that we're going to see in the markets is just higher - just higher than it was the last few years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DOTY: So I - we think that's an opportunity frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, interesting. Bryce, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much. We, of course, will be watching the developments. Bryce Doty joining us there. We are just getting started this morning. We've got a long coming up. Coming up in the next hour, Oklahoma Senator, James Lankford, is here talking about the latest on the stimulus bill, and mysterious seeds reportedly from China ending up in Americans' mailboxes. And then former New York City Mayor, Rudy Giuliani, is here in the growing unrest in largely Democratic cities. We're going to take a look across the country. In the 8 a.m. hour, Delaware Senator, Chris Coons, joining us to talk stimulus and his new manufacturing legislation. Then Trump 2020 Campaign Press Secretary, Hogan Gidley, talking the latest on the race for the White House coming up. Plus who is watching you? One prominent pharmacy secretly using facial recognition technology for nearly a decade. You don't want to miss it. It's all coming up, but first all that and more. A programming note. Fox Business will be covering today's technology hearing on Capitol Hill. You can watch it starting at noon Eastern this morning, live right here. Plus you've got questions. We've got answers. Our new segment, At the Panel, begins next month. Send in your video questions to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:maria@foxbusienss.com\">maria@foxbusienss.com</email> I want to hear what you're thinking about. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.</p><p>Welcome back. Now to the stimulus battle, lawmakers are negotiating a new round of coronavirus aid. One point of contention on both sides of the aisle is funding for non-COVID-19 related items including a new FBI building. President Trump weighed in yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We'll be negotiating. It's sort of semi-year relevant because the Democrats come with their needs and asks and the Republicans go with theirs. So we'll be discussing it with Mitch and all the other people involved. We want to do what's best for the people. I want to do what's best for the people. I want to do what's best for the economy because that means jobs and lots of good things.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is House Financial Services Committee member, Texas Congressman Lance Gooden. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>REP. LANCE GOODEN (R), TEXAS CONGRESSMAN: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GOODEN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What is most important in terms of the getting the economy back up and running and jobs as the president just referred to?</p><p>GOODEN: Well, you know, this stimulus package negotiation has so far been a disaster. It started a little too late, and we're now pushing up against deadlines. A lot of things expire at the end of this month, which the end of this month is two days away, and we've got to get the economy going. We can't continue to encourage people to stay home with excessively-high unemployment. That's one of the top sticking points among Republicans in this next package. That $600 number needs to be brought down a bit. I think Democrats privately agree with that because they've not even indicated that that's a red line. I believe they're willing to go down from that $600. There's talk about stimulus payments, another round of the $1,200 checks that we had a few months ago, and we've also got to have liability protections for businesses and schools that are facing lawsuits. Senator McConnell has said that it is a non-starter if we can't get a bill passed that has liability protections. I think we'll get something done in the next week. I'm hearing this could go deep into August, but I don't believe that. I believe by sometime next week we'll have a package that we'll be voting on. It'll probably be bigger than any Republican would like it to be and smaller than any Democrat would like it to be, but I believe it'll get done in the first week of August.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So why has it been such a disaster? Is it because things got started late or the Democrats are just pushing back on what our and your colleagues are coming up with?</p><p>GOODEN: Well the Democrats were in a good position because about two months ago they just passed a massive bill. They let every far-left member of their caucus get whatever they wanted into that bill. They knew it had no chance of passing. They knew it would go nowhere, but they passed it so then when we came up to this deadline now they could say, see, we've passed something months ago and now we're waiting on you all. And things just unfortunately happened last minute here on Capitol Hill. The negotiations on the Republican side in the Senate started last weekend, but unlike prior packages there is division among Republicans in the Senate. There's not this sense of let's just swallow this bitter pill of this gigantic bill and move forward. We're now in the -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GOODEN: -- third and fourth round of this, and there is less excitement about growing the deficit by several trillions of dollars, and Republicans, myself included -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure.</p><p>GOODEN: -- are prepared for nothing to pass if it's going to be a bad bill.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Understood. Philip Wegman, jump in here.</p><p>WEGMAN: Congressman, you mentioned the topline items obviously changing. Unemployment insurance, liability reforms, things of that nature. A lot of your Republican colleagues in the Senate seem concerned about the size of the bill and you mentioned that, but do you think that your constituents back home are really concerned about an increase in spending right now? For instance, are they concerned whether or not the funding for a new FBI building is included or do they just want to see something get to the finish line?</p><p>GOODEN: I think they want to see something good get to the finish line, but they're absolutely concerned about their grandchildren and their grandchildrens' children paying for large bills that perhaps are larger than they need to be today. Another common concern I get from small business owners across my district is this unemployment number. They say we realize we need to have something, but the $600 figure is so high that we can't get some of our employees to come back to work because they make more money sitting at home, so we need to pass something -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, that makes total - I mean, yes -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOODEN: -- that encourages people to work. And even privately Democrats -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that makes total sense.</p><p>GOODEN: -- agree with that. It makes no sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm sure, and when you're talking about $21 trillion in debt, yes, you are going to have to attack this at some point. Now with rates where they are, I can understand some people not seeing the urgency, but at some point you and your colleagues are going to have to come up with a plan to reign in the spending. Let me ask you about the president touting you as energy (ph). He is travelling to Texas today, touring an oil rig in Midland, delivering remarks on America's energy dominance. Congressman, your reaction with oil prices at $41 this morning. What is the situation in terms of our energy potential?</p><p>GOODEN: Well, our energy potential is unlimited. The reason it's so low is because demand is low. We're in a crisis obviously, but Texas has been leading the way. The Untied States is in such a great position. The cause of President Trump's willingness to roll back ridiculous - excuse me - regulations from the Obama years and ensure that we don't need to rely on Middle East oil. And we're in a great place in Texas. The president's in Midland today. I know he has a fundraiser later tonight. You know all these oil folks allegedly are hurting, but I understand the president's already raised $5 million for his reelection campaign tonight. People are enthusiastic about his race. I realize that polling today has the president down. The president realizes that, but we're also 100 days out. If there's one thing that everyone, Democrats and Republicans, can agree on it's that anything can happen and no one should be surprised about anything in the final two months of the campaign season.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So do you think Texas is purple or is Texas still a red state, Congressman, going into this election real quick?</p><p>GOODEN: I think Texas is still - is still a red state. Obviously the economy's down. People are worried about the future. Our hope is that Democrats pour all of their resources into Texas and make that fatal mistake, ignore the swing states because they think they have them locked down, pour all their money into Texas and let's see what happens. I'm confident President Trump will win big and that we'll be moving forward in a good way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we'll be watching. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>GOODEN: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Lance Gooden. Coming up more than 100 police agencies are backing out of the DNC security contract ahead of this convention because of orders that would prevent them from doing their jobs they say. The fallout right after this.</p><p>Welcome back. Backing out, more than 100 police agencies are saying no to a security agreement for next months Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. At issue a new policy which prevents officers from using crowd control methods like tear gas and pepper spray amid violent protests across the country. One local Wisconsin police chief says this in a statement \"We believe in removing those tools the use of chemical irritants or pepper spray from the available resources that the law enforcement officers would have at their disposal if protests become non-peaceful would severely compromise the safety of the public and also the safety of the law enforcement officers who would be assigned to protect the DNC.\" Dagen McDowell, your reaction.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You take away these tools from police officers and you prevent them from doing their jobs, and that is protecting innocent people and preventing violence, and that seems to be something that Democrats, quite frankly, don't understand. So again because every protest, remember, is peaceful. The Portland protests, those are peaceful demonstrators. Seattle, that's peaceful unless peaceful is really a synonym for violence and unrest and looting and arson, but I want to point out (technical difficulty) have stood (technical difficulty). They have - they have defended - there's an editorial in The Wall Street Journal that they've defended disorder, that it - that abominations are fighting crime and enforcing the laws of the land. So what do they expect? I just raise the issue maybe more federal authorities will be required to protect the DNC, and wouldn't that be an irony of all ironies if more federal authorities have to come in to protect any of the Democrats assembling in Wisconsin because this is what they've been pushing back because remember it was the Feds going into Portland that caused the violence. That's like saying that police officers cause people to rob, shoot, and murder folks. It's the world of -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- left-wing insanity, left-wing lunacy. That's where we're living.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And once again, the media is not calling out the, you know, quote, unquote, \"peaceful protests\". They're also calling it peaceful, and it is anything but. In fact, we're still waiting on any news out of the Department of Homeland Security to let us know what's going on with those two agents Chad Wolf, the secretary, told me on Sunday two agents may very well lose their eyesight. They're going to lose their eyesight because they were - these lasers were shown in their eyes. So we're waiting to see how they're doing, Philip. Your reaction, Phillip.</p><p>WEGMAN: I think what this shows is a complete, stark contrasts between both Republicans and Democrats right now. The situation on the ground in Portland, that was a demarcation between Republicans and Democrats in House Judiciary Committee during a conversation with the attorney general, and now what we're seeing in Milwaukee where you have individual police precincts saying, no, we're not going to put out officers in harms way if you don't give us the tools that we need to keep order.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>WEGMAN: And you know, it's going to be incredibly interesting because this is - this is (inaudible) Republican messaging.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, let's get to those -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Conversation with (ph) Bill Barr.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- fireworks on Capitol Hill. Attorney General Bill Barr sparring with Congress -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I just want to say that was in a conversation with -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- during testimony yesterday. I'm sorry? We're going to take a break. When we come back we're going to give you the highlights and the lowlights of the A.G. Barr testimony yesterday. Wait till you see this. Back in a moment.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, good Wednesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, July 29th. Take a look at markets right here at 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast. We are looking at a fractional move with the Dow Industrials up 20 points, Nasdaq up 50 points right now. Tech on fire once again, S&amp;P 500 up 6.5. It is a big day in Washington this morning.</p><p>The big-tech CEOs will testify. Stimulus negotiations go on and there's a Federal Reserve decision as well. All that coming up this morning and futures are trading up ahead of a big day. This after a decline yesterday on Wall Street. Take a look at 4 O'clock on Wall Street yesterday, you had the Dow Industrials down 205 points, the Nasdaq was down 134 and the S&amp;P 500 yesterday gave up 21 points.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mixed, European indices right now are looking like this, FTSE 100 up 22, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 35, but the Dax Index in Germany is lower by 8 points right now. In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher as you'll see here, best performer overnight with the Shanghai Composite in China, that was up better than 2 percent. The coronavirus pandemic forcing another company to cut jobs, Cheryl Casone with those details right now. Good morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Maria. Yes, L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret says that it is preparing to cut 15 percent of its workforce by about 850 jobs. Most Victoria's Secret stores in the United States are back open after being closed due to the coronavirus. L Brands says it hopes to save $400 million annually through this cost-cutting efforts. There's a stock in the pre-market though, sometimes investors really like to see this, said the stock is up about 18.5 percent in the pre-market.</p><p>Well, McDonald's announced on its earnings call yesterday they're going to permanently close 200 of its 14,000 stores in the United States. The company says over half of the low-volume restaurants are inside of Wal-Mart stores. McDonald's says these closures were planned for the coming years, but they decided to speed up the process. Taking a look at Dow component McDonald's in the pre-market stock is barely higher, just a fraction there.</p><p>Well, the mystery behind packages of Chinese seeds being sent across the United States may be solved. Police believe that it could be tied to an internet scam called Brushing. That's when companies send packages to you even if you didn't order them. They may post a fake review to boost their ratings and this leads to higher sales. So far 47 states have sent warnings about these seed packages, people are being told do not open or plant those seeds and packages.</p><p>And finally, here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com, Pfizer CEO warrants President Trump's executive orders designed to slash drug prices could cause quote, \"enormous destruction of the pharmaceutical industry and will cost the United States jobs.\" TikTok facing possible closure by the U.S. government as Facebook reportedly tries to lure users by offering them money to join its new platform, it's called Reels.</p><p>And Patrick Mahomes joins the Kansas City Royals ownership group, becoming one of the youngest team owners in sports, Maria. And those are your headlines from the newsroom, sending it back over to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. There was fiery testimony yesterday, Attorney General Bill Barr clashed with Democrats during his House Judiciary Committee hearing yesterday. AG Barr going toe-to-toe with Democrats on a series of issues from Russia meddling to ongoing protests across the country. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Attorney General, the time is mine.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL, UNITED STATES: You waited to talk to me like this, you didn't need to wait so long.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When I asked --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Attorney General, you did answer the question.</p><p>BARR: No, you said under penalty of perjury, I'm going to answer the damn question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You said --</p><p>BARR: I'd ask another U.S. attorney to look into the issue of unmasking because of, you know, the high number of unmaskings and some that do not readily appear to have been in the line of normal business.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Clear there. So, I want to be clear, so there's a -- there's another investigation on that issue specifically going on in the Justice Department right now?</p><p>BARR: Yes.</p><p>JORDAN: Can you give us that U.S. attorney's name, is that something you're comfortable doing?</p><p>BARR: John Bash of Texas. Federal courts are under attacks. Since when is it OK to try to burn down a federal court? The U.S. marshals have a duty to stop that and defend the courthouse, and that's what we are doing in Portland. We are at the courthouse defending the courthouse. We're not out looking for trouble.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former U.S. acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. And Matt, it is good to see you this morning, what a day yesterday --</p><p>MATTHEW WHITAKER, FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL: Hi, Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They asked him to come testify, but I don't think they really cared about what he was saying. We didn't hear from him, they just kept talking over him. Your reaction?</p><p>WHITAKER: Yes, well, this is very similar to my experience over a year ago where I went up in front of the same committee and, you know, it really was a missed opportunity then and a missed opportunity yesterday to solve some of these problems. Violent crime is up in our major cities, and this was a chance for the Judiciary Committee in the house which has oversight of the Justice Department to work with the attorney general to solve some of these problems, to give additional resources, additional tools through legislation and they've completely missed that because they would rather grand-stand and really make up a set of alternative facts that are just not consistent with what we are seeing in some of these cities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why? Just to go against the president and his attorney general? Why? Why not actually solve problems?</p><p>WHITAKER: Yes, I think it is. It's election year, it's hyper partisan and I think to some extent, you know, the narrative -- if you think about the things that the Democrats think they're going to win on, many of them are inconsistent with what the American people want. One of this is the rising violent crime rate, and you saw all of these issues, when Barr was asked, he gave a very simple, straightforward answers as to what the problem was and how to solve it.</p><p>And they had no interest in hearing that. And whether it was questions about the Russian collusion fable that they continue to want to perpetuate and suggest that somehow, even though Barr and the Department of Justice recommendation was adopted by a completely independent judge who is no fan of the Department of Justice and the Roger Stone case is somehow that Bill Barr had interfered in that case.</p><p>It was just -- it was a complete outrageous example of why Washington is broken, Congress gets nothing done for the American people, and why ultimately, I think the American people need to demand that some of these problems get solved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen, jump in here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: I just want to push back on something that Philip said, he used the word conversation, well, about yesterday, that's not what that was. It was a shriek fest. I'll just sit here and say, I'm reclaiming my time, my time. My time! It was the intellectual equivalent what we saw from Democrats yesterday of a petulant child eating toilet paper for attention. That's what the American people got out of that. There was one adult in Washington and it was Bill Barr.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, if that point is right --</p><p>WHITAKER: Well, Dagen, and you saw I think out of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you know what? They refused to do -- yes, go ahead.</p><p>WHITAKER: No, I was just going to say, I think she's absolutely right. And I think you saw why Bill Barr is the attorney general and why I was happy and proud to shake his hand and hand him the keys to the Department of Justice because he is a serious sober individual that is very smart, that knows the law, that knows the role of the attorney general, and is restoring the rule of law. And he mentioned that several times, and it's true.</p><p>And, you know, there's -- this is such an important position, and this is the right person for the right time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they're also trying to muddy the story. In other words, there's a specific situation happening in Portland where they -- the anarchists are trying to destroy federal property, the courthouse. And there is a responsibility to protect that courthouse. That's why federal agents are there. Looking at the unrest across the cities is totally different. In fact, you've got federal agents leaving Seattle, for example, amid growing violence.</p><p>The Trump administration is speaking with Portland officials about removing agents from that city as well. If the agents leave Portland, what happens, Matt? I mean, do they recognize what's going to take place? This is not a - -</p><p>WHITAKER: Right --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Peaceful protest what we're looking at right now, but they refuse to acknowledge it.</p><p>WHITAKER: It's not, and we have had dozens of federal law enforcement officers injured, some of them permanently in this attack on the federal courthouse, and somehow, the Democrats yesterday did not seem to care about law enforcement officers being injured nor about the risk of, you know, millions of dollars in property damage happening at a federal courthouse in one of our nation's cities. And so, you know, I just -- again, I think if this is their strategy to win an election this Fall, I just think this is a sad day for America because we should all rally around law enforcement and make sure that we protect our federal assets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Scott Martin. There are shootings that are up across year- to-date in Chicago. You live in Chicago, what is it like there? I mean, no wonder, the cops are saying, look, we don't -- we're going to pull out of the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, you're taking away the tools that we need. What are we doing?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: Yes, if you can hear me. Matt, you know, I'm worried about these cities, though, because if you look at Chicago and where we are dealing with things with respect to how Mayor Lightfoot is handling this. I mean, how far does this go when it comes to federal agents and the fact that they come to the cities and the mayors don't want them in there?</p><p>WHITAKER: Well, it's a problem because when I was at the Department of Justice both as chief of staff and as acting attorney general, we spent a lot of time trying to help the city of Chicago and the police force address these violent crime that is plaguing the city. And, you know, we worked together collaboratively on task forces, especially the ATF to, you know, get some of these trigger polar and these illegal guns off the streets.</p><p>And if we wanted to send more resources and the mayor and the city council don't want them there, that does a disservice to the citizens who do want to end violence because everyone should be entitled to have their children play in their front yard safely without a risk of a drive-by shooting or a stray bullet killing them.</p><p>So, I mean, you know, these mayors and city council members in these big cities need to accept the federal help and let us -- and let the federal government partner with local law enforcement to try to reduce violent crime.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you said it. It's a sad day, Matt, thank you so much. Matt Whitaker joining us --</p><p>WHITAKER: Thank you --</p><p>BARTIROMO: After that incredible testimony yesterday from Bill Barr. Coming up, who has been watching you? One prominent pharmacy secretly using facial recognition technology for nearly a decade. I'm going to check it out. And then a programming note, Fox Business will be covering today's technology hearing on Capitol Hill. You can watch it all live right here noon time, do join us. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, watching you. Rite Aid secretly using facial recognition systems at hundreds of locations across the country. According to an alarming new investigation by \"Reuters\", the drugstore chain capturing customers' faces for more than 8 years largely in lower income and non-white neighborhoods, only recently stopping the practice. Joining us right now is the cyber guy Kurt Knutsson. Kurt, good to see you. First of all, where were these cameras and what can the chains do with this information?</p><p>KURT KNUTSSON, THE CYBERGUY: Good morning, Maria. You would walk into a Rite Aid store, and mostly Manhattan and Los Angeles locations and predominantly as you said in lower-income areas. And one of these cameras, it's about 6-inches, it's kind of rectangular with the -- what happened is, it would activate their system, look to see if you're one of the suspected shoplifters from previously in a database, and then start notifying store agents that you're now walking into that store.</p><p>And then you might walk into the cosmetic area where often the cameras were also positioned and be captured in that location, and similarly, this agent from the store could approach you and say, Maria, we suspect that you were shoplifting at another location, we'd like you to leave the store. Well, that's all fine and well, and you would think that's a great practice for business until it wasn't Maria who was shoplifting a long time ago with somebody else.</p><p>It just looks similar to you. And that is somewhat the concern here because technology is right there staring at us. And the other complaint, Maria, is that nobody really -- and very few at the wall -- at the Rite Aid stores had any writings out that indicated the warning to customers that this was going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I'll tell you, there's a portfolio of billions and billions of pictures of people, where does this facial recognition data go?</p><p>KNUTSSON: That is the big million-dollar question because who owns this data? Who controls the data? Right now, it is a wild west. So hypothetically, the security company that installs it might have had an arrangement or they're now the owner of that data, and do they sell it to someone else? Do they keep it, four or 5 years? That's the real question. What is this information used for down the road? Who is responsible for it and how can we guaranty that we as consumers might have any sort of rights to access that and say, hey, that's not even me and you have my name labeled to that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's interesting all of this as we continue to scrutinize what China is doing in terms of tracking its citizens, and then at the end of the year, given a social score depending on what they get from that video, and here we are, looking at this kind of practice in America as well. Facial recognition getting --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>There's a big warning, important story.</p><p>KNUTSSON: Is that -- yes, but that the concern is also the Chinese might be tapped in to the camera systems that many have manufactured there, some might be in control of that area. So, keep our eye on that one as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's a good point because Chinese manufacturers are incredibly prevalent in these manufacturing -- in these companies. So they could have a stake in this and actually have access to that -- to those pictures. Kurt, great point, good to see you, we will continue to watch this important story, Kurt Knutsson joining us there, the CyberGuy.</p><p>Coming up, out of this world, Virgin Galactic giving a sneak peak of its tourist space, the plane, it is making a buzz this morning, we're going to check it out when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, Emmy likes Netflix. The streaming service topping \"HBO\" in Emmy nominations for the second time in 3 years with a whopping 160 Emmy nominations. \"HBO\" is still celebrating its limited series \"Watchman\", it gained 26 nominations, the most of any program. Dagen, did any of your favorites get a nod?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love \"Ozark\" and \"Succession\", they were kind of near the top of the list -- I used this list to figure out what I need to be watching. If you're on Netflix, I encourage people to watch \"Monty Pythons\", this multi-pod documentary. But the internet seemed most upset about Reese Witherspoon being denied -- oh, Emmy nomination for acting in three shows that also saw other actresses nominated, \"The Morning Show\", \"Big Little Lies\" and \"Little Fires Everywhere\".</p><p>But she's also a producer on those shows, so I guess being the boss is more important than just being -- well, a nominated actress.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I loved the \"Big Little Lies\". By the way, we're getting into \"Yellowstone\" which is -- which is great.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's a vacation in outer --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That is the best, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You love it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes!</p><p>BARTIROMO: You love \"Yellowstone\"?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Me too. It's really good. Vacationing in outer space, Virgin Galactic revealing the cabin of its space plane, the VSS Unity, every white and tail seat will be tailor made, the back wall features a giant silver mirror, so travelers can look at themselves in micro gravity. Scott, are you ready to head to the stars?</p><p>MARTIN: I mean, Maria, have you seen this thing? It's basically like a flying dentist office. So, if I need a root canal on the way up, oh, yes! I'll take the flight. Plus, if you think about -- consider what a weird stuff kind of going on in the skies around the U.S. lately. So, it's almost like the aliens are coming for us and they'll probably take us up there anyway. So I think I'll pass on this Virgin spacecraft.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, finally, the best of friends, the 90s sitcom ranking number one on \"HBO Max\". The streaming platform was supposed to air cast \"Reunion Special\" postponed amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Philip, are you surprised that friends still rule?</p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, not surprised at all. What is interesting though is we don't have hard members for viewership. So the old special is bringing us into a new frontier where the only thing that maybe gauges from is subscribers not actually viewers during the moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, all right, we will take a break, we've got a market this morning fractionally higher, a lot going on in Washington, all right after this break, stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Fortunately, a federal appeals court has ruled[3] that a lawsuit against Facebook for its face surveillance may move forward. The decision, by the federal Ninth Circuit about an Illinois privacy law, is the first by an American appellate court to directly identify the unique hazards of face surveillance. </p><p>This is an important victory for biometric privacy, access to the courts for ordinary people, and the role of state governments as guardians of our digital liberty.Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy ActThe Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act of 2008 (BIPA[4]) is one of our nation's most important privacy safeguards for ordinary people against corporations that want to harvest and monetize their personal information. BIPA bars a company from collecting, using, or sharing a person's biometric information, absent that person's informed opt-in consent. BIPA also requires a company to destroy a person's biometric information when its purpose for collection is satisfied, or within three years of the company's last contact with the person, whichever is sooner. BIPA provides the strongest enforcement tool: a 'private right of action[5],' meaning a person may file their own lawsuit against a company that violates their privacy rights. The Illinois General Assembly explained, when passing BIPA, that 'biometrics are unlike other unique identifiers' because they are 'biologically unique to the individual.' As a result, 'once compromised, the individual has no recourse, [and] is at heightened risk for identity theft.' Lawmakers also pointed out that the ramifications of biometric technology 'are not fully known.' In Rosenbach v. Six Flags[6] (2019), the Illinois Supreme Court held that BIPA does not require a plaintiff to prove an injury beyond a violation of the statute itself. The court reasoned[7]: When a private entity fails to adhere to the statutory procedures, as defendants are alleged to have done here, the right of the individual to maintain their biometric privacy vanishes into thin air. The precise harm the Illinois legislature sought to prevent is then realized. This is no mere 'technicality.' The injury is real and significant. EFF filed an amicus brief[8] in Rosenbach in support of this outcome, along with the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Illinois, the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation, Illinois Public Interest Research Group, and Lucy Parsons Lab[9].Patel v. FacebookIn 2010, Facebook launched its 'Tag Suggestions[10]' feature. It uses face recognition technology to match known faces in user profile pictures and other photos to unknown faces in newly uploaded photos. If this face surveillance system generates a match, then Facebook will notify the person who uploaded the photo and suggest a 'tag.' If that person accepts the tag, then the person in the photo will be identified by name. Facebook imposed this face surveillance system on users by default. To avoid it, a user must affirmatively opt-out, which most users won't[11] do[12]. Facebook has migrated some of its users from its 'Tag Suggestions' feature to its 'Face Recognition' feature, according to the Federal Trade Commission's recently filed consumer deception complaint[13] against Facebook. The default remains application of face surveillance. In 2015, Illinois residents filed a class action lawsuit in federal court called Patel v. Facebook. The plaintiffs allege that Facebook's 'Tag Suggestions' feature violates BIPA. They reason that this feature collects and uses their biometric information without their informed opt-in consent, and does not satisfy the statutory destruction deadline. Facebook removed the case from Illinois to California, where Facebook has its headquarters. The Patel trial court denied Facebook's motion to dismiss, and certified a class of Facebook users. The appellate court allowed Facebook to take an immediate appeal of the class certification decision.'Standing' and SpokeoThe key issue on appeal in Patel was whether the plaintiffs had sufficiently shown that Facebook's biometric surveillance caused them a concrete injury. The U.S. Constitution limits the federal courts to deciding 'cases and controversies.' That means a plaintiff cannot sue a defendant unless they can show 'standing,' meaning that the defendant has injured them in a concrete manner. You'd think that when a company violates a person's rights under a statute, and that statute provides that person a private right of action to sue that company, then that person automatically has constitutional standing. Unfortunately, you'd be wrong. In Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins[14] (2016), the U.S. Supreme Court held that a person in such circumstances might or might not have standing. This depends, among other things, on the legal history of the particular statutory interest at issue. EFF filed an amicus brief[15] in Spokeo (along with CDT, the Open Technology Institute, and the World Privacy Forum) arguing that standing in such cases should be automatic, but that view did not carry the day. Spokeo can sometimes be a barrier to the enforcement of consumer data privacy laws. For example, when a company's negligent data security practices cause massive breaches of consumers' personal information, the company may argue[16] that the injured consumers cannot sue based solely on violations of data security statutes. Rather, the company may argue, the Constitution also requires them to show a financial or physical injury, such as identity theft. This is one of the problems in our legal system that limited[17] the recently proposed settlement of the Equifax data breach litigation. (Don't forget to file[18] your settlement claim against Equifax.)The New Appellate Court Ruling in PatelOn August 8, a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held[19] that the Patel plaintiffs have constitutional standing to sue Facebook for violating their statutory privacy rights under BIPA. In doing so, the appellate court forcefully explained the hazards of face surveillance and the importance of BIPA's privacy protections.The court presented centuries of history of U.S. legal protections for privacy, sounding in the common law and the Constitution. For example, in the context of the Fourth Amendment, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that 'advances in technology can increase the potential for unreasonable intrusions into personal privacy.' The appellate court cited the Supreme Court's protection of the public from home-intruding heat detectors in Kyllo v. United States[20] (2001), GPS location tracking in United States v. Jones[21] (2012), cellphone searches in Riley v. California[22] (2014), and cell-tower location tracking in Carpenter v. United States[23] (2018). The court held that 'an invasion of an individual's biometric privacy rights has a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts.' Quoting Carpenter[24], the court explained that biometric information is 'detailed, encyclopedic, and effortlessly compiled.' Most importantly, the appellate court explained the grave privacy threats posed by Facebook's face surveillance: Once a face template of an individual is created, Facebook can use it to identify that individual in any of the other hundreds of millions of photos uploaded to Facebook each day, as well as determine when the individual was present at a specific location. Facebook can also identify the individual's Facebook friends or acquaintances who are present in the photo. Taking into account the future development of such technology as suggested in Carpenter, it seems likely that a face-mapped individual could be identified from a surveillance photo taken on the streets or in an office building. Or a biometric face template could be used to unlock the face recognition lock on that individual's cell phone. We conclude that the development of a face template using facial-recognition technology without consent (as alleged here) invades an individual's private affairs and concrete interests. The appellate court also upheld the trial court's certification of a class of Facebook users. Facebook reportedly[25] plans to seek review by the full appellate court. EFF filed an amicus brief[26] in Patel regarding the privacy menace of face surveillance, along with the ACLU, its Illinois and California affiliates, CDT, and Illinois PIRG.Lessons For LegislatorsEspecially after the new Patel decision, Illinois' BIPA is one of the most important data privacy laws in the country. What lessons does BIPA hold for legislators who want to better protect their constituents from corporations that place their profits before our privacy? First, a privacy law is only as strong as its enforcement tools, and the best enforcement tool is a private right of action[27]. In many cases, government agencies can't or won't enforce a statute. So people must be free to protect their own rights by filing their own lawsuits. Second, Congress must not pass a weak federal data privacy law that preempts[28] stronger state privacy laws. Many big tech companies told Congress for years that they could self-regulate. Now some of them are asking Congress for regulation. What changed? They want to dodge Illinois' BIPA and other state consumer data privacy laws, like California's Consumer Privacy Act[29] and Vermont's data broker registration statute[30]. Thus, opposition to preemption and support for private enforcement are EFFs two most important demands, among our many proposals[31] for new consumer data privacy legislation.Next stepsThe Ninth Circuit's new ruling in Patel is a watershed in privacy law. It allows litigation to go forward challenging Facebook's biometric surveillance of users absent their informed opt-in consent. It explains, more forcefully than any American appellate court opinion to date, the extraordinary privacy hazards of face surveillance. It holds that a loss of statutory privacy rights under Illinois BIPA is, by itself, a sufficient injury to show constitutional standing under Spokeo. And it clearly demonstrates the necessity of private rights of action, and why Congress must not preempt stronger state laws. Most importantly, it shows what all of us must do now: contact our federal and state legislators, and demand that they enact strong consumer data privacy laws. Illinois BIPA, as strengthened by Patel, is a model for others to follow.Adam Schwartz is a Senior Staff Attorney with the EFF's civil liberties team.

Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said traffic for video calling and messaging had exploded. Microsoft said the numbers using its software for online collaboration had climbed nearly 40% in a week.</p><p>With people told to work from home and stay away from others, the pandemic has deepened reliance on services from the technology industry's biggest companies while accelerating trends that were already benefiting them.</p><p>Amazon has muscled in on brick-and-mortar retailers for years, but shoppers now reluctant to go to the store are turning to the e-commerce giant for a wider variety of goods, like groceries and over-the-counter drugs.</p><p>Streaming services like Netflix have dampened box office sales for movies in recent years. Now, as movie theaters close under government orders, Netflix and YouTube are gaining a new audience.</p><p>Companies were already dumping their own data centers to rent computing from Amazon, Microsoft and Google. That shift is likely to speed up as millions of employees are forced to work from home, putting a strain on corporate technology infrastructures.</p><p>Even Apple, which once appeared to be among the U.S. companies most at risk from the coronavirus because of its dependence on Chinese factories and consumers, appears to be on good footing. Many of Apple's factories are nearly back to normal, people are spending more time and money on its digital services, and Wednesday it even released new gadgets.</p><p>\"The largest tech companies could emerge on the other side of this much stronger,\" said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities.</p><p>That's not to say to say major technology companies shouldn't be worried. Advertising, the lifeblood of Google and Facebook, tends to suffer during economic downturns. The stocks of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google's parent company, Alphabet, have collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market value from a month ago, when U.S. stocks traded at record highs. And Microsoft and Apple have cut their short-term financial forecasts because of slowing consumer spending.</p><p>Beyond the biggest companies, it is more of a struggle. Communication tools like videoconferencing service Zoom are now essential, but ride-hailing firms like Uber and Lyft and property-rental sites like Airbnb are seeing customers vanish.</p><p>The $3.9 trillion global technology industry will suffer this year, though just how much remains unclear. In December, research firm IDC forecast 5% worldwide growth for sales of hardware, software and services in 2020. After it became apparent a month ago that the coronavirus would disrupt supplies and cut sales in China, IDC said annual revenue might inch ahead at only 1%. That 1% growth now looks decidedly optimistic, said Frank Gens, chief analyst at IDC.</p><p>But when the economy does eventually improve, Big Tech could benefit from changes in consumer habits. And despite more than 18 months of criticism from lawmakers, regulators and competitors before the pandemic hit the United States, the biggest companies are likely to finish the year stronger than ever.</p><p>While Amazon has changed shopping habits for items like books, getting customers to trust it with groceries has been challenging. Now, as more people are forced to stay home, one of the last strongholds of physical retailing may be coming under pressure.</p><p>Michael Crowe of Charlotte, N.C., ordered groceries from Amazon for the first time a few days ago because he didn't want to risk going to a supermarket, he said.</p><p>\"I could see myself doing it longer term when this is over,\" said Crowe, 36, who works for home improvement retailer Lowe's.</p><p>As more customers try different Amazon services, they may create permanent shifts in buying habits, said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon employee and the founder of CommerceIQ, a company whose automation software is used by major brands like Kellogg's and Kimberly-Clark.</p><p>In a blog post last week, Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations, said it was adding the new jobs at its U.S. warehouses and delivery network because \"our labor needs are unprecedented for this time of year.\"</p><p>One reason for Amazon's increase in demand is that shoppers are buying a broader variety of goods. From Feb. 20 to March 15, over-the-counter cold medicine sales rose ninefold on Amazon in the United States from a year earlier. Dog food orders increased 13-fold, and paper towels and toilet paper sales tripled, according to CommerceIQ.</p><p>Stay-at-home orders are unsurprisingly increasing traffic to video streaming sites, apps and social media platforms. Downloads of Netflix's app - a proxy for traffic from the streaming site - jumped 66% in Italy, according to data from Sensor Tower, an app data company. In Spain, they rose 35%. In the United States, where Netflix was already popular, there was a 9% bump.</p><p>Netflix declined to comment on whether it was seeing a surge in subscribers.</p><p>Government officials in Europe even called Reed Hastings, the chief executive, to ask if Netflix could reduce the video quality of its streams to lighten the strain on the region's internet network. The company agreed to do it for 30 days. YouTube also agreed to suspend streaming of high-definition video in Europe for a month.</p><p>Voice calling over Facebook's WhatsApp messaging service has doubled in volume, Zuckerberg said on a conference call with reporters Wednesday. Facebook's Messenger app has had similar growth, he said.</p><p>\"So the normal spike for us is New Year's Eve, right, where basically everyone at the same time just wants to message everyone and takes a selfie and sends to their family wherever they are, and to wish them a happy New Year,\" Zuckerberg said. \"And we are well beyond\" that spike.</p><p>Analysts are bullish about Facebook's prospects because many people turn to it for news in times of crisis while working from home.</p><p>\"We believe that many Facebook users have been accessing its properties at meaningfully elevated levels over the last several weeks,\" Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a research note last week.</p><p>The shift to work at home has also demonstrated the merits of cloud computing when use unexpectedly spikes. For companies managing their internet infrastructures, making adjustments to computing needs on the fly is expensive and complicated. Cloud computing makes it easier.</p><p>Amazon, Microsoft and Google, the three major cloud-computing platforms, are swimming in cash and offering discounts for renting the underlying infrastructure for a corporate network as well as software used by employees.</p><p>Microsoft has aggressively pushed its new business messaging and collaboration tool, Microsoft Teams, which competes with independent company Slack. On Thursday, Microsoft said the number of users on Teams had grown 37% in a week to more than 44 million daily users. There have been at least 900 million meeting and call minutes on Teams every day.</p><p>\"We believe that this sudden, globe-spanning move to remote work will be a turning point in how we work and learn,\" wrote Jared Spataro, a corporate vice president at Microsoft.</p><p>Even Apple, a company with hundreds of closed stores around the world (except now in China), is increasingly looking as if it will emerge from the pandemic in good shape.</p><p>Terry Guo, head of Foxconn, which assembles most of the world's iPhones for Apple, told reporters March 12 that Foxconn's Chinese factories were resuming production ahead of schedule and were back to normal - well ahead of expectations that would happen by the end of March.</p><p>Apple has tried to move away from its heavy reliance on device sales and toward services revenue, which includes app sales and subscriptions to its music and TV services.\"After the financial crisis in 2008, Apple emerged even stronger,\" said Ives from Wedbush. \"There is no reason it and the other giants can't do the same again.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-688840</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJ2-G3G1-DY37-D1X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1355\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 29, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

But more than 100,000 people have watched the same performance on Twitch, an Amazon-owned video giant[3] that has become the Web's biggest arena for live-streaming. Viewers used the site's chat and video tools to cheer on his speech and pull sound bites into clips with names like 'GO BACK HOME.' First popularized by video-game fans, Twitch has transformed into a global playground for advertisers and influencers seeking to win over a young audience that barely cares about traditional TV. </p><p>Tens of millions of viewers have watched billions of hours of video streamed on Twitch so far this year, including from the campaigns of Trump and from Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Andrew Yang. But the site's exploding fan base also has attracted those seeking to sow discord and spotlight mass violence. A day before Trump's rally, a gunman who killed two people outside a synagogue in Halle, Germany, used a head-mounted camera to live-stream the bloodshed to Twitch's global clientele. More than 2,000 people watched the attack on Twitch before it was removed, though copies can still be found across the Web.   Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project[4] at Harvard Kennedy School, said Twitch's roots in video-gaming and its audience of young, white, American men have made it a fruitful target for hate groups and extremists seeking to recruit new followers to their cause. The German shooter's use of English in his video narration, Donovan said, suggested he was looking to get the attention of American viewers. And because Twitch is newer and less well known than other social media, she added, the shooter may have assumed his video would have a greater chance at not being quickly detected and removed. Advertising'The shooter obviously chose Twitch because of the audience on Twitch,' Donovan said. 'The internet is providing this export of American white supremacy, and these platforms are providing the rails to disseminate them.' Twitch's emergence as a live-streaming repository for political speech and terrorist propaganda has underscored how quickly the internet's bloodstream can change, as audiences and attackers move from platform to platform, outpacing moderators and regulators in a rapid, unstoppable march. Concerns about political manipulation and extremist violence remain focused largely on legacy social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, which have built up billions of users over years of online operation. But Twitch is part of a new crop of fast-growing internet platforms that offer the same basic features as the older sites - from anonymous chatter to live-stream video - but with less public awareness and the same widespread risks. After the shootings around two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, were broadcast live on Facebook, the social media giant tightened its live-streaming controls and joined large tech companies, including Amazon, in pushing a plan aimed[5] at addressing the technology's abuse. The anonymous message board 8chan, where the alleged gunmen in Christchurch and El Paso, Texas, announced their attacks, collapsed after the internet-infrastructure companies that worked with it pulled their support[6]. But the gunman in the Halle shooting faced no resistance in streaming his attack on Twitch. Anonymous trolls and self-professed white nationalists in recent days have shared copies of the video and celebrated the anti-Semitic attack on the message board 4chan and another refuge for 8chan exiles, the encrypted messaging app Telegram, where the attack has been viewed more than 70,000 times. AdvertisingThat shift shows how the problems facing the modern internet are often bigger than any one website, reflecting the inherent risk of a technology that allows anyone with a video device to instantly broadcast to the world. The difficulty of moderating so much live video also means that Twitch could become a new avenue for disinformation and radicalization, because the company has few tools to detect and block live-streamed abuse. 'That's why it's so interesting to extremists,' said Bill Maurer, dean of the School of Social Sciences at the University of California at Irvine. 'There is no way they can stop someone from airing something in real time.' Twitch has moved aggressively to combat trolls seeking to stream violent videos on its site, filing a lawsuit in June against anonymous users who had repeatedly tried to upload the Christchurch shooting footage and other rule-breaking videos.Twitch chief Emmett Shear told the Hollywood Reporte[7]r last month that setting online guidelines was 'the issue of our times,' adding, 'If you work in social media and you're not thinking about moderation and safety and trust on your platform, I don't know what you're doing.' But Twitch would not say how many people work to review or moderate the videos on its site. Twitch spokeswoman Brielle Villablanca would say only that the company's 'safety operations team' has doubled in size over the last year. Twitch has injected new adrenaline into live video online, outpacing the live-streaming offerings of Big Tech rivals Facebook and YouTube and developing its own insular subculture of memes, emoji and ways of speech.When Amazon bought the site in 2014 for nearly $1 billion, the company's chief, Jeff Bezos, said it was the vanguard of a 'global phenomenon.' Bezos also owns The Washington Post. Anyone can live-stream video there, and more than 3 million people do so every month. That fan base and widespread accessibility have led Sanders[8] and Yang[9] to use the site to stream town halls and ice cream socials. The most popular Twitch videos are vibrant, manic and overrun with eye candy: A single video stream often features not just the real-time action of what's happening but a video of the person's reactions, flashing chyrons and text boxes of links and information, and quick bursts of animation to highlight new user donations, subscriptions and inside jokes.Most Read Business Stories That excitement has made the streams both alluring to digital natives and largely inscrutable to everyone else. Streamers can make money from advertising and donations from their followers, whom they often talk with while recording, addressing users by name. That one-to-many relationship has turned some streamers into virtual celebrities, and the seeming intimacy and camaraderie over many hours of streaming can turn curious viewers into hardcore fans. Launched in 2011, the site first exploded in popularity as a home for people to watch other people play video games: its name refers to the fast-twitch muscles needed to excel in first-person shooter games and multiplayer brawls. But as Twitch has grown up, so, too, have its videos: Streamers now broadcast live videos of arts and crafts, cooking tutorials, karaoke, makeup, social commentary and practically anything else. Videos of 'Just Chatting' were Twitch's fourth-most popular category last quarter, with more than 180 million hours viewed, data from the industry researcher StreamElements[10] show. The site has pushed to expand beyond its gamer base, launching its first official advertising campaign last month with the slogan, 'You're already one of us.' AdvertisingTwitch has helped bring the messages of the two of the oldest candidates in the 2020 race, Sanders and Trump, to the attention of a younger audience, and the Trump campaign's Twitch page includes links for viewers to donate, volunteer or buy Trump-branded merchandise. But a younger corner of Washington sees the value, too: In January, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., called into a charity fundraiser[11] on Twitch, during which players spent 50 hours on a marathon session of 'Donkey Kong 64.' The flood of live video has overwhelmed Twitch's ability to police the content it hosts and distributes. The attack in Germany on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, was live-streamed for 35 minutes, during which the gunman said the Holocaust never happened and that feminism had brought the downfall of Western civilization. 'The root of all these problems is the Jew. Would you like to be friends?' he said on live video while preparing his attack. Only a handful of people watched the video live, Twitch representatives said. But an automatically generated recording of the video was viewed more than 2,000 times on Twitch before it was flagged and taken offline.The episode drew dark similarities to the Christchurch massacre in March, when a gunman used Facebook to live-stream a grisly attack on two mosques that left 51 people dead. After both shootings, some viewers downloaded the videos and reposted them to other sites in an attempt to circulate them more broadly across the Web. The power of online video, and the rush of new platforms seeking to capture it, has challenged the ability of companies and lawmakers to rein in violence, misinformation or abuse. The video app Snapchat was used by students to record live footage of the shootings last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The short-video app TikTok has faced criticism for its potentially predatory viewers[12] and political censorship[13]. AdvertisingAnd a Senate Intelligence Committee report said this month[14] that Instagram, the Facebook-owned photo- and video-sharing app, was 'the most effective tool' used by Russian operatives to spread false information and exploit political divisions during the 2016 campaign. When Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg debuted the site's live-streaming service in 2016, he predicted video would dominate the social network within five years, helping spread[15] 'the most personal and emotional and raw and visceral ways people want to communicate.' In the years since, Amazon, Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have made live video a central element of their business ambitions. But Facebook, the world's largest social network, has proved powerless to prevent violence from being live-streamed onto its site. Since the police killing[16] of Philando Castile was broadcast live to Facebook in 2016, the site has been used to live-stream child abuse[17], rape[18], murder[19], the torture[20] of a special-needs man and the suicide[21] of a 12-year-old girl. After the Christchurch massacre, a Facebook executive wrote in a blog post that the company was investing in human reviewers and artificial-intelligence systems to more quickly detect 'suicidal or harmful acts,' adding, 'We recognize that the immediacy of Facebook Live brings unique challenges.' The company, which says 'the overwhelming majority of people use Facebook Live for positive purposes,' has also instituted more rigid controls for who can stream, including immediate bans for anyone sharing material from a terrorist group. Twitch, like Facebook, uses automated systems to patrol for copyrighted or objectionable material. The systems scan for patterns and can match videos to blacklist databases, but they aren't perceptive enough to understand a video's context - or discern the difference between real-world violence and a video game. The company said it had added the Halle shooting footage to an industry database used to fingerprint and track violent videos. That database can make it easier for other social media sites to pinpoint problematic videos and stem their viral spread, but it does nothing to capture and prevent the live streams from being recorded or viewed in the first place. AdvertisingThe Halle shooting was only the latest episode of violence on the site. Last year, viewers watching a live Twitch stream of a Madden 19 video-game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, saw an eruption of gunfire that injured 11 and left two dead. Joshua Fisher-Birch, a researcher at the nonprofit Counter Extremism Project[22], said the rise of terrorist violence performed online can't be blamed on any one technology. But the power that a video-sharing platform gives users, to broadcast live to the world, can still have consequences that are too devastating to ignore. 'When someone commits an act of violence like this, they're speaking to this community that idealizes these extremist mass shooters. There's a group of people they want to impress,' Fisher-Birch said. 'Live-streaming turns that act of violence into a spectacle, . . . this simultaneously public and intimate act.' For violent extremists, he added, the technology 'has turned mass shootings like these into propaganda gold mines.' This story was originally published at washingtonpost.com.

Viewers used the site's chat and video tools to cheer on his speech and pull sound bites into clips with names like \"GO BACK HOME.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First popularized by video-game fans, Twitch has transformed into a global playground for advertisers and influencers seeking to win over a young audience that barely cares about traditional TV. Tens of millions of viewers have watched billions of hours of video streamed on Twitch so far this year, including from the campaigns of Trump and from Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Andrew Yang.</p><p>But the site's exploding fan base also has attracted those seeking to sow discord and spotlight mass violence. On Oct. 9, a day before Trump's rally, a gunman who killed two people outside a synagogue in Halle, Germany, used a head-mounted camera to live-stream the bloodshed to Twitch's global clientele. More than 2,000 people watched the attack on Twitch before it was removed, though copies can still be found across the Web.</p><p>Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard Kennedy School, said Twitch's roots in video-gaming and its audience of young, white, American men have made it a fruitful target for hate groups and extremists seeking to recruit new followers to their cause.</p><p>The German shooter's use of English in his video narration, Donovan said, suggested he was looking to get the attention of American viewers. Because Twitch is newer and less well known than other social media, she added, the shooter may have assumed his video would have a greater chance at not being quickly detected and removed.</p><p>\"The shooter obviously chose Twitch because of the audience on Twitch,\" Donovan said. \"The Internet is providing this export of American white supremacy, and these platforms are providing the rails to disseminate them.\"</p><p>Twitch's emergence as a live-streaming repository for political speech and terrorist propaganda has underscored how quickly the Internet's bloodstream can change, as audiences and attackers move from platform to platform, outpacing moderators and regulators in a rapid, unstoppable march.</p><p>Concerns about political manipulation and extremist violence remain focused largely on legacy social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, which have built up billions of users over years of online operation.</p><p>But Twitch is part of a new crop of fast-growing Internet platforms that offer the same basic features as the older sites - from anonymous chatter to live-stream video - but with less public awareness and the same widespread risks.</p><p>After the shootings around two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, were broadcast live on Facebook, the social media giant tightened its live-streaming controls and joined large tech companies, including Amazon, in pushing a plan aimed at addressing the technology's abuse. The anonymous message board 8chan, where the alleged gunmen in Christchurch and El Paso announced their attacks, collapsed after the Internet-infrastructure companies that worked with it pulled their support.</p><p>But the gunman in the Halle shooting faced no resistance in streaming his attack on Twitch. Anonymous trolls and self-professed white nationalists in recent days have shared copies of the video and celebrated the anti-Semitic attack on the message board 4chan and another refuge for 8chan exiles, the encrypted messaging app Telegram, where the attack has been viewed more than 70,000 times.</p><p>That shift shows how the problems facing the modern Internet are often bigger than any one website, reflecting the inherent risk of a technology that allows anyone with a video device to instantly broadcast to the world. The difficulty of moderating so much live video also means Twitch could become a new avenue for disinformation and radicalization, because the company has few tools to detect and block live-streamed abuse.</p><p>\"That's why it's so interesting to extremists,\" said Bill Maurer, dean of the School of Social Sciences at the University of California at Irvine. \"There is no way they can stop someone from airing something in real time.\"</p><p>Twitch has moved aggressively to combat trolls seeking to stream violent videos on its site, filing a lawsuit in June against anonymous users who had repeatedly tried to upload the Christchurch shooting footage and other rule-breaking videos.</p><p>Twitch chief executive Emmett Shear told the Hollywood Reporter last month that setting online guidelines was \"the issue of our times,\" adding, \"If you work in social media and you're not thinking about moderation and safety and trust on your platform, I don't know what you're doing.\"</p><p>But Twitch would not say how many people work to review or moderate the videos on its site. Twitch spokeswoman Brielle Villablanca would only say the company's \"safety operations team\" has doubled in size during the past year.</p><p>Twitch has injected new adrenaline into live video online, outpacing the live-streaming offerings of Big Tech rivals Facebook and YouTube and developing its own insular subculture of memes, emoji and ways of speech.</p><p>When Amazon bought the site in 2014 for nearly $1 billion, the company's chief, Jeff Bezos, said it was the vanguard of a \"global phenomenon.\" Bezos also owns The Washington Post.</p><p>Anyone can live-stream video there, and more than 3 million people do so every month. That fan base and widespread accessibility have led Sanders and Yang to use the site to stream town halls and ice cream socials.</p><p>The most popular Twitch videos are vibrant, manic and overrun with eye candy: A single video stream often features not just the real-time action of what's happening but a video of the person's reactions, flashing chyrons and text boxes of links and information, and quick bursts of animation to highlight new user donations, subscriptions and inside jokes.</p><p>That excitement has made the streams both alluring to digital natives and largely inscrutable to everyone else. Streamers can make money from advertising and donations from their followers, whom they often talk with while recording, addressing users by name. That one-to-many relationship has turned some streamers into virtual celebrities, and the seeming intimacy and camaraderie over many hours of streaming can turn curious viewers into hardcore fans.</p><p>Launched in 2011, the site first exploded in popularity as a home for people to watch other people play video games: its name refers to the fast-twitch muscles needed to excel in first-person shooter games and multiplayer brawls.</p><p>But as Twitch has grown up, so, too, have its videos: Streamers now broadcast live videos of arts and crafts, cooking tutorials, karaoke, makeup, social commentary and practically anything else. Videos of \"Just Chatting\" were Twitch's fourth-most popular category last quarter, with more than 180 million hours viewed, data from the industry researcher StreamElements show. The site has pushed to expand beyond its gamer base, launching its first official advertising campaign last month with the slogan, \"You're already one of us.\"</p><p>Twitch has helped bring the messages of the two of the oldest candidates in the 2020 race, Sanders and Trump, to the attention of a younger audience, and the Trump campaign's Twitch page includes links for viewers to donate, volunteer or buy Trump-branded merchandise. But a younger corner of Washington sees the value, too: In January, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) called into a charity fundraiser on Twitch, during which players spent 50 hours on a marathon session of \"Donkey Kong 64.\"</p><p>The flood of live video has overwhelmed Twitch's ability to police the content it hosts and distributes. The attack in Germany on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, was live-streamed for 35 minutes, during which the gunman said the Holocaust never happened and that feminism had brought the downfall of Western civilization. \"The root of all these problems is the Jew. Would you like to be friends?\" he said on live video while preparing his attack.</p><p>Only a handful of people watched the video live, Twitch representatives said. But an automatically generated recording of the video was viewed more than 2,000 times on Twitch before it was flagged and taken offline.</p><p>The episode drew dark similarities to the Christchurch massacre in March, when a gunman used Facebook to live-stream a grisly attack on two mosques that left 51 people dead. After both shootings, some viewers downloaded the videos and reposted them to other sites in an attempt to circulate them more broadly across the Web.</p><p>The power of online video, and the rush of new platforms seeking to capture it, has challenged the ability of companies and lawmakers to rein in violence, misinformation or abuse.</p><p>The video app Snapchat was used by students to record live footage of the shootings last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The short-video app TikTok has faced criticism for its potentially predatory viewers and political censorship.</p><p>A Senate Intelligence Committee report said this month that Instagram, the Facebook-owned photo- and video-sharing app, was \"the most effective tool\" used by Russian operatives to spread false information and exploit political divisions during the 2016 campaign.</p><p>When Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg debuted the site's live-streaming service in 2016, he predicted video would dominate the social network within five years, helping spread \"the most personal and emotional and raw and visceral ways people want to communicate.\" In the years since, Amazon, Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have made live video a central element of their business ambitions.</p><p>But Facebook, the world's largest social network, has proved powerless to prevent violence from being live-streamed onto its site. Since the police killing of Philando Castile was broadcast live to Facebook in 2016, the site has been used to live-stream child abuse, rape, murder, the torture of a special-needs man and the suicide of a 12-year-old girl.</p><p>After the Christchurch massacre, a Facebook executive wrote in a blog post that the company was investing in human reviewers and artificial-intelligence systems to more quickly detect \"suicidal or harmful acts,\" adding, \"We recognize that the immediacy of Facebook Live brings unique challenges.\" The company, which says \"the overwhelming majority of people use Facebook Live for positive purposes,\" has also instituted more rigid controls for who can stream, including immediate bans for anyone sharing material from a terrorist group.</p><p>Twitch, like Facebook, uses automated systems to patrol for copyrighted or objectionable material. The systems scan for patterns and can match videos to blacklist databases, but they aren't perceptive enough to understand a video's context - or discern the difference between real-world violence and a video game.</p><p>The company said it had added the Halle shooting footage to an industry database used to fingerprint and track violent videos. That database can make it easier for other social media sites to pinpoint problematic videos and stem their viral spread, but it does nothing to capture and prevent the live streams from being recorded or viewed in the first place.</p><p>The Halle shooting was only the latest episode of violence on the site. Last year, viewers watching a live Twitch stream of a Madden 19 video-game tournament in Jacksonville, Fla., saw an eruption of gunfire that injured 11 and left two dead.</p><p>Joshua Fisher-Birch, a researcher at the nonprofit Counter Extremism Project, said the rise of terrorist violence performed online can't be blamed on any one technology. But the power that a video-sharing platform gives users, to broadcast live to the world, can still have consequences that are too devastating to ignore.</p><p>\"When someone commits an act of violence like this, they're speaking to this community that idealizes these extremist mass shooters. There's a group of people they want to impress,\" Fisher-Birch said.</p><p>\"Live-streaming turns that act of violence into a spectacle, ... this simultaneously public and intimate act.\" For violent extremists, he added, the technology \"has turned mass shootings like these into propaganda gold mines.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-5085b44001fe462abfca99933f83d929</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X94-JXH1-DXKP-J37T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2090\"/><timeReceived>3:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Katherine Ross and I'm here on the floor of the NYSE with Jim Cramer. Jim, this morning, Abbott reported earnings. What are your thoughts on that quarter?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jim Cramer: Best in show. There are very few hundred billion dollar companies that have amazing ARG, which is accelerated revenue growth. That's what these guys have. There's 40 million people have type 1 diabetes, 40 million people have type 2 diabetes. They have a device that monitors that. Talking about 80 million people, that's a nice size market. Yes, DexCom is a competitor, but that's on the high end. This is the one that the different commissions that judge what you can pay, the pharma commissions all over the world will go towards this. Nutrition good. Diagnostics, that's Alere, turns out to be pretty good now. The St. Jude acquisition, really terrific. Miles White has delivered the best quarter so far of this earnings season.</p><p>Katherine Ross: Over on Real Money this morning you wrote about big tech and how Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook could have their EPSs is hurt. Can you explain why you wrote about that this morning?</p><p>Jim Cramer: Well, I just feel like that Alphabet, because it regulates free speech, that's going to be the one they're really going to go after, I think. They're going to try to find a way. Maybe they try to break it up, which would not be good, by the way. Maybe they put limits on what they can do, take away the idea of a que, or following you.</p><p>Jim Cramer: Facebook, They have to buy Square, they should have done that. They could pay 60 billion, buy Square, remember Square's already endorsed cryptos. Then you can slip in your own kind of crypto. I don't know why they're not thinking about things like this. It's just really unbelievable. And at Amazon, I know there's a big EU investigation. What's being left out entirely is they just settled with Germany for what I think is going to be the actual template and as we say at CNBC, \"Check, please.\" They'll write some checks and that's that.</p><p>Katherine Ross: All right Jim, you've now got about an hour and 20 minutes to write the top of your show for-</p><p>Jim Cramer: Oh, I know. And so many things swimming through my head about what to start with. I went to see a play last night by my agent's wife, Valerie [Thomason]. It's called Fiddler: A Miracle of Miracles. And it was about how Fiddler came together. Somewhere in the world, Fiddler plays every day. And I'm sitting there saying, \"Holy cow. How inspirational. And I got to get a Jerome Robbins choreographer to get this one going.\"</p><p>Katherine Ross: All right, we got to let Jim go because he's got to go prepare for that show. And reminder guys, it's at 11:30 eastern. Tune in.</p><p>Jim Cramer: Yeah. I expect to see you.</p><p>Katherine Ross: All right, thank-</p><p>Jim Cramer: Happy birthday to our ... our cameraman?</p><p>Katherine Ross: Yeah. Happy birthday to our cameraman, Shawn Elias and Erica Santoro, our producer. Her birthday is tomorrow. All right guys, thanks for joining us, Jim, thank you for joining us.</p><p>Jim Cramer: Thank you Kathy.</p><p>Katherine Ross: We'll see you tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSCJIM-15023219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSCJIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKP-PRD1-F00X-J1RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420086</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><timeReceived>12:55 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc.

The GOP Establishment's proposal to import millions of indentured servants on F-1 visas is expected to drive down wages for recent college graduates and tech workers, and cause many more Americans to be forced to train their foreign replacements. RELATED: Pres. Trump \u2014 If You Want American Visa, Prove You Can Obtain Health Insurance[1] It is easy for conservatives and America First populists to get swept up in the day to day news cycle, and forget that it is our job to keep our great president honest by making known our needs and concerns. </p><p>Unfortunately, the President resorted to cheap pabulum and Chamber of Commerce talking points in arguing to allow massive hordes of high-skilled tech workers from India, and other countries, to flood into America, driving down wages and taking jobs from American men who wish to start and support families. I don't blame the president for this. I blame his advisers from the GOP Establishment who are trying to trick this president into putting oligarchic special interests above the interests of our great middle class.Laura Ingraham held President Trump's feet to the fire here:God Bless You @IngrahamAngle[2] for Holding Pres. Trump's Feet to the Fire on His Immigration Promises! Laura expresses the concerns of many America First Conservatives at the WH's plan to import more foreign \"high-tech\" workers to compete w/ Americans. \"You ran on America First.\" pic.twitter.com/zExw2uXKqE[3];\u2014 The Columbia Bugle (@ColumbiaBugle) January 11, 2020[4]AdvertisementMore from Wayne Dupree [Twitter Link][5]Advertisement Michelle Malkin explained in more detail just why this visa program is so devastating for the American worker:Remember the other night when I pointed out Ivanka's stupid Open Borders Inc. propaganda at CES about wanting to keep every last foreign student in the country here to take jobs \u2014 when she said her father agreed with her that it was 'insane' not to open the floodgates? The exchange with Laura Ingraham last night proves that President Trump has, in fact, swallowed whole the Chamber of Commerce/NSF/Javanka/Tim Cook myth of the American tech worker shortage hook, line, and America Last sinker. The reason this all matters is that the F-1 program will dwarf H-1B as a bottomless pipeline for cheap foreign workers. Unlike H-1B, which at least has a nominal cap, F-1 is unlimited. UNLIMITED. [Telegram[6]]Advertisement That's right, folks. This foreign visa worker program will create an endless pipeline of cheap foreign workers to take away good American middle-class jobs. Those who do finally find a job will find themselves slaving away for wages that are far too low to start a family. This is a disgrace and a betrayal of our great young people.David North, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) and noted scholar on immigration and its influence on domestic policies, said at the National Press Club this week that a government program cooked up during the George W. Bush administration and put into place through a federal regulation encourages U.S. businesses to hire foreign instead of citizen college graduates. North also said at the panel discussion, hosted by CIS, that millions of dollars a year is diverted from helping Americans to benefiting F-1 student visa holders and the American companies that hire them. The students, North said, get to work for one year or more at an American business, and the business that hires them gets a discount under the Optional Practical Training (OPT) protocol that allows them not to pay certain payroll taxes for their non-immigrant, non-citizen employees. 'You shouldn't take money from America's elderly, give it to fat cat corporations so that they can discriminate against Americans,' North said. 'I don't think that's a very good idea.' [Breitbart[7]]AdvertisementWhat's more, according to recent statistics, there is NO LABOR SHORTAGE, as President Trump has claimed:There remain more than 11 million Americans who are out of work but want full-time jobs, despite claims by corporate interests and the big business lobby of a so-called 'labor shortage.' The latest unemployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals there is still slack in the labor market for disenfranchised Americans to enter the workforce rather than business bringing foreign workers to the U.S. to take jobs. [Breitbart[8]].@LouDobbs[9] calls out Senator Mike Lee on @FoxNews[10]: pic.twitter.com/vJ6wJmni3f[11]; \u2014 U.S. Tech Workers (@USTechWorkers) January 9, 2020[12]Advertisement [Twitter Link][13] To add insult to injury, this program is totally rife with fraud. F-1 visa holders from countries like India and China are overstaying their visa by pretending to work for fake companies. President Trump has to put an end to this madness immediately.WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal visa program allowing international students to work at firms in the United States after graduation appears to have been exploited by fake companies providing false employment verifications,according to an NBC News/NBC Bay Area investigation. The F-1visa program includes a component that allows students to stay in the U.S. to get practical work experience after obtaining their professional degrees. Many students, schools and employers use the program legitimately, as intended. But a recent federal prosecution revealed the potential for fraud, with a defendant admitting in court papers she had provided false employment records for nearly 2,700 students. [NBC][14]I am the biggest supporter of President Trump on God's green earth, and I happen to believe that the Chamber of Commerce and GOP Establishment have tried to trick Trump on this issue. I truly believe that if we cry out to our great president, he will hear our voices and put an end to this oligarchic nonsense, and do the right thing for the American people. Will you join me?

That was the final step, but as lan Bowker, president and founder of Hudson-based Icon Broadcast, explains, there's more behind what meets the eye.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It took 18 months of preparation,'' says Bowker, who was consulted to design, build and train the people to run the system out of WWE's studio in Stanford, Conn. Since then, Bowker has worked with the network on an HD shared editing project, allowing WWE to edit its live broadcasts to fit the cultures and regulations of its 46 markets.</p><p>\"For example,\" explains Bowker, \"in Germany, you're not allowed to show, blood at a live sporting event. In Saudi Arabia you're not allowed to show bare skin on a woman. So what they do is take their live program and. before it goes to a live venue, they'll shoot dark matches, and these matches are not shown on the TV as a live event, but they're recorded onto a hard disk. [Then] they're put into this shared editing pool and they'll recut or reedit the live event to be redistributed in other markets.\"</p><p>Bowker says for every match the WWE may do four dark matches and record them onto the video server to allow specific versions for each country.</p><p>\"Within 48 hours of a live event in the U.S., WWE puts that back into its big video server in Stanford, Conn., and it's edited for all these different markets and then delivered either electronically or cut back to tape and issued to the country - and that's done for 46 countries,\" says Bowker.</p><p>Bowker's projects can be as small as connecting a half-dozen cables across a TV studio to building a production tractor-trailer used to broadcast major league sports events.</p><p>Olympics broadcast</p><p>His most recent project has Bowker managing the buildout of New England Cable News' studio in Newton, Mass., which will take about nine months, he says. NBC recently announced that NECN will replace Channel 7 News out of Boston at the end of the year.</p><p>\"At the moment, NECN is a 24-hour news channel, so what you'll probably see is the news that goes out becomes the main Boston news for NBC,\" says Bowker.</p><p>He is also working on a project to help broadcast the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil back to the U.S.</p><p>\"I'm building what they call flypacks, so when broadcasters go down to the Olympics, they typically take cases of the equipment that's pre-wired, and they just put big connectors between the cases to hook them up that will provide the signal to bring it back to the home country,\" explains Bowker.</p><p>Fifty pieces of equipment will be in the four flypacks, but it will take only a half-hour to connect them to each other and the cameras. It would take all week if they were wired on the spot, says Bowker. It's also not practical logistically to wire on the spot, since there are different venues so the broadcasters will move around nearly every week.</p><p>Game Creek relationship</p><p>Bowker has always worked in technical broadcast engineering positions, though in a variety of roles. Born in England, he started his career working for the U.K. government on aircraft flight trials.</p><p>\"My role was more of doing these flight trials and filming them, and the more I got into that, from film it became video and then editing them, and I ended up leaving that role and running a film and TV unit for the police in the U.K., and then I left them and went to train at the BBC,\" he says.</p><p>Bowker left the BBC for private sector- technical roles, which led to working on a three-year project for Avid Technology in Tewksbury, Mass., in the mid-90s. He returned to the U.S. shortly after with another company and ran a technical broadcast engineering team for a big broadcast company. But in 2006, the company was bought out by Thomson Broadcast, a French conglomerate.</p><p>\"I was laying people off every month,\" says Bowker, who called such a task demoralizing. That same year, Bowker resigned after being asked to head up another layoff. \"I said, 'You can have my salary and distribute it among these guys.\"</p><p>That's when Bowker started Icon Broadcast in Hudson. WWE reached out to him, having known him from consulting them for several years. Shortly thereafter it built a mobile production unit for HD provider Game Creek Video - another Hudson-based company. Since then, Bowker has built all but two of the company's mobile units.</p><p>That's 46 trailers since 2006, plus 90 small news trucks in the past year alone.</p><p>Ebbs and flows</p><p>There are about 17,000 or 18,000 cables in each vehicle, and every cable is labeled, meaning there are 34,000 labels that have to be printed and attached to wires, says Bowker.</p><p>\"It's a big jigsaw puzzle in making sure everything gets done and gets done quickly,\" he says.</p><p>A large trailer will take four months to be built in Ohio, during which Icon Broadcast's team will fly out to Ohio to inspect it. Then the vehicle comes to New Hampshire for a 10-week build cycle with seven to eight people work- ing full time to install the wiring, followed by a threeweek test cycle.</p><p>There are only a dozen or so companies like Icon Broadcast, says Bowker, who adds that networks like NBC stopped running their own trailers about 20 years ago and instead leased vehicles and engineers through middlemen like Game Creek Video.</p><p>Bowker says the ebbs and flows of the business make it more practical to lease out the equipment and expertise, including smaller stations, like New York's public television channel, WNET.</p><p>\"Although the TV industry as a whole is a roller coaster ride, what I found, certainly for me as a business owner, is year on year I've been doubling my numbers,\" says Bowker. \"It's been a wild ride for the last 10 years. The volume of business that I'm doing is just incredible.\"</p><p>The industry has evolved as well during Bowker's career.</p><p>\"When I started, it was all analog pictures and fuzzy pictures on home screens and now it's 4K and 8K ultrahigh-definition and things like that crystal-clear pictures,\" says Bowker. \"But the big tech breakthrough that's starting to occur in our industry is video over IP, so using a network connection like you would do in your house but a wired network connection to send videos over with audio.\"</p><p>At the beginning of the year, Icon built the first IP truck in the country for Game Creek Video, which went to Fox Sports.</p><p>\"This is a huge step forward in reducing the weight of the trailers, increasing the amount of pictures you can display - moving pictures around from the truck to a studio location, you can send it over a dedicated IP line. It just opens up a whole world in our industry,\" says Bowker. \"We're able to be on the technological forefront, which is fun too.\"</p><p>There's more behind what meets then eye.</p><p>\"Its a big jigsaw puzzle in making sure everything gets done ana gets done quickly.' - IAN BOWKER</p><p>Liisa Rajala can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:lrajala@nhbr.com\">lrajala@nhbr.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NHBUSR-1772451732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NHBUSR2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J98-P8Y1-JBHT-D2TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316339</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1226\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2016 Business Publications Inc.

It's  a novel concept: introducing a new generation of moviegoers and TV audiences to  tried and true characters and stories by giving them a makeover or a new plot  twist without having to completely reinvent the wheel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the video surveillance market, it could be said that  analytics are getting their shot at an industry reboot. Having overpromised and under-delivered a  decade ago, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine  learning software have made intelligent video analysis a realistic capability  for end-users to deploy at scale. Of course, the technology is still in its  infancy and there are a number of challenges that must be overcome before it can be widely adopted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Aside from video analytics, issues surrounding the  cybersecurity of camera networks remain a major priority for manufacturers,  systems integrators and end-users alike. Hackers have been keen to leverage  vulnerable surveillance devices for a various malicious schemes over the years  and given their pervasiveness among IoT devices, the threat is not expected to  subside anytime soon. \u00a0</p><p>SecurityInfoWatch recently reached out to a number of industry experts  to get their take on these and other trends that are expected to impact the  industry in 2019 and beyond. </p><p>         The Panel:       </p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Jon Cropley, Principal Analyst, Video Surveillance, IHS Markit</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Fredrik Nilsson, VP, Americas, Axis Communications</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Tim Palmquist, VP, Americas, Milestone Systems</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Andrew Elvish, VP, Genetec</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Jeff Swan, VP of Security Marketing, North America, Bosch Security and Safety Systems</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Paul Kong, CTO, Hanwha Techwin America</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Jeff Whitney, VP, Marketing, Arecont Vision Costar</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Jumbi Edulbehram, Regional President, Americas, Oncam</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>                    There's has obviously been a lot of hype around artificial intelligence  and deep learning solutions within the industry over the past couple of years  but not necessarily a lot of technology deployments. Will that change in 2019  and, if so, what will be the catalyst?                 </p><p>Cropley: Video  analytics have been a hot topic for the last couple of years. However, in 2019,  the development of camera ASIC SoCs will enable deep neural networks processing  at the edge.  </p><p>Nilsson: While there are a number of providers  starting to incorporate AI into their solutions, this emerging technology is  still relatively unproven. There are some examples where Deep Learning -  improving algorithms based on experiences - has proven successful in training  environments, ,but I still think the day AI and Deep Learning become force  multipliers for the security industry is still far in the future.</p><p>Palmquist: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence represent the next big  tech changes that will forever disrupt the status quo in our industry. It may  take several years for these technologies to play out -- and they will come in  many different forms -- but the impact on security and surveillance will be  fascinating. We're already seeing leaps forward in hardware acceleration and  other processes that are enabling complex processing tools now, and we'll  undoubtedly see more over the next year. </p><p>Elvish: The hype over AI has set unreasonable expectations in the market.  However, meaningful progress will be made in 2019 in specific areas around Machine and Deep Learning which will help deliver advanced analytics  capabilities such as object recognition. For us, the catalyst will be the next  generation of technology that brings even more power to the edge.</p><p>Swan: Video  analytics plays an important role in generating smart data that helps to  improve security, increase efficiency and reduce costs. In order to be  able to deliver high-quality data, video analytic algorithms have to be  continuously trained - through deep learning - on recognizing regularities and  recurring patterns. At the end, the video analytics software on board a security  camera should have learned enough to be able to judge independently whether the  object it sees is a person. The camera should not only be able to distinguish  individuals from each other, but also, for example, from rolling suitcases and  vehicles. The next steps will involve learning to interpret the behavior of  people.</p><p>Kong: AI will play a large role in the  future, but it's also important to set correct expectations for the market. These  algorithms are only as good as the data that they are given, so daytime and  nighttime image quality will be essential to deliver accurate results.\u00a0</p><p>Whitney: Implementing AI technologies in security systems has much promise,  but like when most big technology shifts are just getting underway, there is  more hype than fact in early products. This will shake itself out just as  IP networking, megapixel technology, and multi-sensor cameras all did following  their introduction and are now mainstream. However, many of the products  we will see in 2019 will still be early, first generation solutions, with  improved versions and products to follow in later years.</p><p/><p/><p>                    Edulbehram                  : While  AI/deep-learning techniques have already started to be used in traditional  applications such as facial recognition, the creation of newer applications  based on this technology is still in its nascent stage. Over the next few  years, we will undoubtedly see the development of a profusion of AI-based  technologies and the broad-based adoption of these products will fundamentally  change the way security is conducted across markets.       </p><p>                    What do you think will be the biggest trend that impacts the video  surveillance industry from a business perspective in 2019?                </p><p>Cropley: One very  important issue will be government policies on tariffs and trade. This will  affect the price of equipment and therefore the level of demand. However, it  may also affect which vendors are allowed to supply equipment in different  countries.</p><p>Nilsson: IoT will  be a dominating trend for the world in general and the security industry will  certainly feel the impact. We've already seen the shift to IoT reflected in the  widespread adoption of network cameras in the video surveillance space. The  same is about to happen in audio, intercom, environmental sensors, perimeter  protection, etc. </p><p>Palmquist: Today,  we see most industry topics from a security point of view, but tomorrow we'll  talk in terms of data and the value of that data and what we can achieve. Tools  are being developed now to automate user processes and to augment human  operator effectiveness with information. The harvesting of data that's  currently left untouched will be a massive catalyst of change within our  industry in the very near future.</p><p>Elvish: Our  industry is thankfully becoming increasingly aware of the rising cyber threats  and the damage they can cause to businesses, institutions and individuals. With  a continuous rise in state-sponsored hacking and cyber warfare, it is becoming  increasingly important to properly vet every product we install on our  networks. Cybersecurity regulations are now becoming  the norm as governments enact laws to hold businesses more accountable. GDPR  was a first, but was soon followed by the California GDPR regulation and  the HR5515 law in the U.S. With bigger consequences  looming, businesses are forced to consider the vulnerabilities of their  security systems. </p><p>Swan: Data  security and privacy protection will continue to impact the industry. More and  more video security cameras are connected to the internet and transitioning  into intelligent sensors that collect significantly more data than images alone. As the level of connectivity and collection of  business-sensitive data becomes more widespread, the threat from cybercrime  also rises. This is clearly an issue that affects everyone. </p><p>Another impactful development is the IoT. Now, video  security cameras need to be so much more than devices with which to simply  capture images. Cameras are  becoming an integral part of the vast digital connectivity infrastructure; they  need to be shaped into intelligent sensors that have the ability to extract  invaluable data to help businesses make improvements in the area of video  security and beyond.</p><p>Kong: Sophisticated analytics, with help  from Deep and Machine Learning algorithms, will drive increased business in  2019 for both security and business intelligence use cases by providing  additional value. Organizations will increasingly rely on edge devices for  notification and alarm validation. Customers will become more aware of the  useful metadata that can be gathered from edge devices which can turn a  security system into a revenue generating business tool or smart city sensor  array for some deployments.\u00a0</p><p/><p>Whitney:  The security industry - always  conservative to adopt new tech by its traditional risk-adverse nature<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00a0</emphasis>- now sees the benefits that  the cloud offers.\u00a0Hybrid cloud solutions are the most likely to be  successful, since the best of them\u00a0offer the benefits of local recording  with remote administration and easy uploading and distribution of video of  interest. This eliminates the challenges around the availability of bandwidth  and its cost for total cloud solutions that upload all video, and\u00a0removes  the need for downgrading video quality. Local administration isn't required,  reducing the risk of human error or misuse of the surveillance system, while  improving the reliability of and access to video from anywhere, anytime.</p><p>Edulbehram: The  convergence of multiple streams of data, in conjunction with video  surveillance, has the ability to truly disrupt the industry and take the use of  video far beyond simply security. The collection and analysis of IoT devices  will give rise to a plethora of opportunities, such as intelligent building  management, smart cities, intelligent traffic management and much more. The  physical security side of the coin will benefit immensely by gaining enhanced  levels of intelligence for situational awareness and emergency management, as  well as opportunities to provide additional value-added services.\u00a0</p><p>                    Besides AI, what technology trend do you think will have the greatest  impact on the market in 2019?                </p><p>Cropley: Cybersecurity  will have a big impact. Some vendors are using cybersecurity protection as a  way to differentiate their equipment from that of their competitors. Regarding  cybersecurity, we predict the following in 2019:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>There will be an increasing focus on where components and software is sourced and which OEM partnerships are in place. Software auditing is required by end-users in many critical vertical markets which will make this more transparent.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>In the lower end of the market, ease of use will compete with cybersecurity. Ultimately, SMBs are not as concerned with cyber threats and will prioritize ease of use and installation over security unless legislated to do something different.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Which leads to regulations and the lack thereof. The industry will continue to lack real regulation and legislation, instead following the lead of the IT industry and, in particular, large suppliers such as Microsoft.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Nilsson: Just like IP video a decade ago, IP audio and intercom systems are  poised to disrupt the IoT and security system landscape. In contrast to their  analog predecessors, network audio solutions deliver higher scalability and  greater dependability, are customizable and have a lower total cost of  ownership. Because IP audio and intercom systems are built on an open platform  standard, they can easily integrate with different subsystems like video and  run third-party applications. This makes these systems future-proof and a much  better value proposition than analog speakers.</p><p>Palmquist: There are a couple of impactful shifts happening. First, universal  standardization will play a significant role as we look to build tools and  systems that ingest data from multiple sources, independent of format. We need  to develop tools that are adaptable to all the many different formats in the  marketplace, not just data related to security. And along the same data sharing  idea, as consumer-grade IoT innovations continue to advance and are expected by  users, our industry is challenged to develop similar types of IoT technology,  provoking us to think of new ways to solve both traditional and new challenges.  </p><p>Elvish: We  anticipate more unification of systems in 2019. Organizations  are already experiencing the benefits of unifying access control systems with  video surveillance, and this will only increase. What will also increase is the  ability to employ analytics tools to leverage the vast amounts of data that  physical security systems and other devices are already collecting. When  organizations are able to understand and leverage their data, they can use it  to improve any number of business functions, including efficiency, operations,  customer service, and revenue generation.  Security departments are sitting on a goldmine of data.</p><p>And talking of data, one of the pressing challenges that  will continue in 2019 is how, and where, to store all of the data that is being  collected. Given that this is continuing to increase exponentially,  manufacturers must focus on providing real solutions to the growing data  storage challenge.</p><p>Swan: The  development of a common platform for security cameras. This will enable  manufacturers to focus on innovation instead of investing almost all of their  resources in tackling common challenges. Today's security industry is  fragmented. Device manufacturers are offering proprietary technology and  developing individual solutions for common challenges like data security and  privacy protection, performance improvements, hardened operating systems and so  on. As a result, we have a very fragmented market that does not attract  software developers to develop new business models in terms of software  solutions. Seamless integration of these proprietary solutions remains a burden  and true innovation is hindered. If we really would like to tackle the  challenges of the future, we need to ensure that engineering resources are  freed-up to invest in innovation.</p><p>Kong: The continuing  impact of cybersecurity issues across all technology sectors has created an  awareness that did not exist before. This has set new expectations for vendors,  distributors, integrators, as well as end users to take increased  responsibility and proactively address cybersecurity concerns across their  entire network infrastructure.    \u00a0</p><p/><p>Whitney: The cloud\u00a0will become an ever-more-important force in 2019, just  as IP networking, megapixel cameras, and multi-sensor camera  technology\u00a0did in past years. However, the cybersecurity risks of the  cloud and networking in general\u00a0will not diminish in the New Year. The  many\u00a0reported\u00a0hacker attacks and security\u00a0exploits that occurred  using NVRs and surveillance cameras\u00a0in past years will continue,  particularly on IoT devices and poorly secured network devices. Regardless, the  many benefits that the\u00a0cloud\u00a0brings to\u00a0video  surveillance\u00a0will drive the use of the technology and industry-wide cyber  protection in the years to come.</p><p>Edulbehram: The  greater use of cloud services and mobile devices in security applications. The  mobility aspect of security and the ability to access security devices through  a smart phone or web-based browser is becoming paramount to customers across  industries -- especially in our increasingly mobile society. That's why  there's been such an influx of mobile apps created to manage video cameras,  receive alerts to intrusion alarms, grant or restrict access to a facility and  quickly access stored video. All of this together demonstrates the world's  demand for connectivity and ease-of-use, which will lead to a significant  impact on the market.</p><p>                    Given the advancements we've seen in analytics and cloud-based video  solutions, how do you see video management software evolving moving forward?  Are the capabilities of current generation VMS offerings going to be enough to  support the video deployments of tomorrow?                 </p><p>Nilsson: VMS  offerings are certainly becoming more of a central command tool, integrating  sensors and subsystems such as access control. Especially in verticals like  Smart Cities, some VMS systems integrate data from multiple sources such as  intelligent traffic cameras, environmental sensors, etc. But if you look at the  industry as a whole, VMS offerings are actually moving in three directions:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>SMB markets - Because these customers are looking for ease of design, installation and use, we'll be seeing more business opportunity for bundling VMS and video cameras into a complete solution from a single vendor.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Enterprise system markets - These customers are looking for tight integration between best of breed products and systems with relatively high complexity. VMS vendors will be challenged to maintain interoperability with evolving technology not only on the video and analytics front but throughout the customer's ecosystem which might include everything from HVAC and building automation to other non-security devices and systems. To maintain seamless and secure connectivity, VMS vendors will need to cultivate close partnerships with a wide variety of technology vendors.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Cloud-based services markets - As more solutions move to the cloud, VMS vendors will need to figure out how to make the best use of the benefits of the cloud for different customers and applications. Where the VMS ultimately resides will depend on the customer's needs and their sensitivity to such issues with bandwidth, manageability, and cybersecurity.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Palmquist: Applications  and video management platforms are getting smarter and more useful, and users  will benefit tremendously from increased automation and new capabilities that  will augment human decision making. More solutions will be coming out that  deliver greater precision and efficiency in understanding environments and  profiling a multitude of anomalies. The VMS platform, the intelligent  applications, hardware acceleration, cloud processing -- all evolve and progress  together, and the speed of advancement right now in our industry is remarkable.</p><p>Elvish: One of the  most important functions of a video surveillance system is its ability to  deliver secure and timely information that leads to greater safety and improved  situational awareness of security and operational environments. A VMS should  also be able to deliver additional awareness and understanding by correlating  video with other security data (e.g. access control or intrusion), operational  data (e.g. analytics and building sensors), and business data (e.g.  point-of-sale). Video should complement existing data to offer a richer understanding  of an event; the addition of timely visual (video) data to door events or  intrusion events allows staff to verify the authenticity of events, and then  respond with a better visual understanding of what is actually  happening.\u00a0</p><p>Swan: As the world is changing,  management software needs to change. VMS solutions will evolve towards  management solutions covering multiple security and safety domains - in other  words unified management of security and safety solutions. On top of that,  plug-ins should be available to facilitate the need for customer specific  business insights, and continuous advancements are needed regarding data  security and privacy protection.</p><p>Kong: VMS systems will be required to deliver more comprehensive  information to operators in the form of advanced messaging, audio analytics,  and useful data beyond simply displaying video streams. We can expect more web  integration and real-time notification for security personnel. Cloud and  virtualized deployments will help create a single point of information flow for  all stakeholders, regardless of location, at an affordable price point that can  scale as companies grow.    \u00a0</p><p>Whitney: AI will result  in entirely new solutions, beyond what we are capable of today. While a multi-year  prospect, traditional surveillance systems, from the camera through to the  recorder or server and storage, will change for the better. AI in use in other  technologies, particularly in networking, behavior monitoring and prediction,  and in integrating disparate systems, will result in a more cohesive whole  security solution.\u00a0AI also has the potential to be abused and misused,  potentially leading to a technology battle on a new level between manufacturers  and the security professionals who use their products and those who would  attack their systems, either as individuals, criminal organizations, or  governments.</p><p/><p/><p>                    Edulbehram                  : In  general, the current generation of video management systems are simply  extensions of the basic capabilities of the traditional DVRs. That is, they're  essentially used for video storage and viewing/reviewing; though with the  advent of IP cameras, some also provide the capability to configure and manage  the cameras. These basic capabilities will be totally insufficient for the  video deployments of tomorrow. With the increasing use of enhanced analytics  and cloud services, the paradigm will shift from collecting and storing large  amounts of video, to implementing intelligent edge devices and application  software that address particular problems, needs and requirements. Another way  to put it: the current VMS/video storage paradigm will shift from putting in a large  video infrastructure and then figuring out what analytic applications can be  run on the video, to first understanding what problems need to be solved,  finding the right applications to solve them, and then figuring out what video  infrastructure is needed.       </p><p>                    Speaking of the cloud and the increasing comfort level of end-users  with it, how do you expect the market for Video Surveillance-as-a-Service  (VSaaS) offerings to mature moving into 2019 and beyond?                 </p><p>Cropley: Revenues  from hybrid VSaaS solutions (where both onsite and offsite storage are  employed) are forecast to grow fastest. The residential sector will remain an  important market for VSaaS. This will be especially true in the Americas  region.</p><p>The involvement of large communication and security  companies such as Comcast and ADT, with many existing residential subscribers,  is helping to raise the profile of VSaaS solutions. Consumer video surveillance  vendors like Arlo have also been quickly growing their VSaaS revenues in the  residential sector. Demand in the quick service restaurant (QSR) and SMB sectors  is also forecast to grow quickly. Users in these sectors are receptive to the  convenience, payment method, and functionality offered by VSaaS solutions.</p><p>Nilsson: VSaaS  will continue gaining momentum, especially for small businesses and enterprise  customers with multiple small locations (e.g. franchise operations and branch  offices). This will be due to the greater security of off-site video storage  and the ability to access the video remotely on-demand, coupled with the lack  of technology and maintenance expertise at the customer level. The other reason  customers are flocking to cloud-based solutions is because those service  providers are better equipped to address evolving cyber threats in a more  scalable and efficient manner.</p><p>Palmquist: VSaaS  is indeed maturing. A high level of cybersecurity and system hardening best  practices are becoming standard within our industry. As those hurdles are met,  VSaaS becomes a very cost-effective option for moving complexity into the  cloud. I believe one of the drivers for  this is to lift the responsibility from the edge. Technology integrators and  end users must measure the total cost of safe and compliant ownership for their  systems; VSaaS offers a very attractive path to powerful video system  capabilities with minimal infrastructure costs or in-house expertise needed. </p><p>Elvish: Cloud-based  security solutions can be game-changing offerings for organizations of all  sizes: they are more affordable, provide strong security, robust reliability,  and include a deployment model that doesn't require capital expenditure for  traditional on-site servers. If vendors do not take advantage of the  scalability and elasticity of cloud computing in at least some part of their  applications or offerings, they will miss a huge opportunity. Hybrid cloud  solutions, in particular, allow organizations to decide where to store their  data to best suit their specific requirements. In many sectors, this allows  organizations to comply with retention rates without blowing their budgets. Regardless  of the industry, hybrid cloud solutions allow us to better control costs while  ensuring the privacy and security of our information. </p><p>Swan: The market  for VSaaS will not be mature in 2019. We are still scratching the surface.  Business models are changing and customers are getting used to paying for  services instead of hardware. Another development is increased customization.  Video surveillance solutions are more and more being considered as a means to  generate new business opportunities. There are signs of a shift from a cost  center approach with video surveillance being a necessary evil to video  security solutions used as profit centers. Customers are requesting tailor-made  insights to steer and drive their businesses. As a result, we see a market demand  for application and customer-specific apps that can be installed on cameras to  provide additional value.</p><p>Kong: In the B2B and enterprise market, the  adoption rate for VSaaS has been slower due in part to cybersecurity, privacy  concerns and corporate IT policy. We expect VSaaS offerings to grow steadily in  2019 as the market becomes more comfortable and educated with the cloud as a reliable  and secure alternative to traditional, server-based storage architecture.    \u00a0</p><p/><p>Whitney: VSaaS is  still in its early stages, and is most promising for use in small business and  home security initially. Simply handing cameras and connecting them to a local  network, eliminating complexity, the cost of system administration, and of  local recorders is already making a difference.\u00a0In IT, we witnessed  this phenomenon with services like\u00a0Amazon Drive, Apple iCloud, Box,  Carbonite, DropBox, Filesanywhere, Google Drive, IBM Cloud, and Microsoft  OneDrive providing various\u00a0cloud-based data storage solutions\u00a0for  both\u00a0organizations and individuals. We will see the same for VSaaS,  as cloud becomes more prevalent in other surveillance applications as an  alternative approach, and the camera becomes a full-fledged IoT device.</p><p/><p/><p>                    Edulbehram                  : Cloud-based  video applications and products will take off in a big way, but perhaps not in  the manner that many folks may have envisioned, which is the transmission of  video over the public internet and storage in the cloud. This paradigm works  really well for the residential and SMB markets and in these markets, the use  of cloud services - both DIY and commercial - will continue to rapidly  increase. In the medium- to high-end of the market, the growth in the use of cloud-based  services will be driven by the increasing levels of intelligence at the edge.  Transmitting and storing large amounts of video in the cloud will remain  uneconomical for most applications, which means that intelligent edge devices -  for example, cameras capable of running analytics - will process the video and  transmit only the interesting data and video. The cloud will be increasingly  used to analyze, compare and correlate the data, which is the cloud-based \"service\"  that service providers will monetize.        </p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://securityinfowatch.com/21038277\">http://securityinfowatch.com/21038277</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SIWCOM-21038277</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SIWCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJW-9WK1-DXMT-R3VB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401141</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4682\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cygnus Business Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SecurityInfoWatch.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"05950\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 1, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Until this past October, the select board was the only town committee whose meetings were regularly videotaped and accessible on the town's website.</p><p> Now videos of the meetings of the finance committee and the parking task force are posted online as well. And Baumgarten has big plans.</p><p> \"My goal is to get all of the important committees in Wellfleet taped and available for viewing,\" she said last week. \"I've contacted every board and committee in town, and I've heard back from some.\" The recycling committee has agreed to be videotaped, she said, and she was hoping to get the board of health to agree soon.</p><p> At this point, said Hoort, it's up to individual committees to decide whether they want to be filmed. \"I don't want to play hardball with people,\" he told the Banner. \"I hope your readers will put pressure on all of our boards to encourage them to have their meetings taped.\"</p><p> The finance committee had not so long ago rejected the idea of having its meetings available for viewing. Some members felt that it would inhibit candid discussion of the town budget and spending priorities.</p><p> \"I was pleasantly surprised when they changed their mind,\" said Hoort. \"We've gotten a lot of positive comments. The finance committee is making recommendations about the budget. If people can't see them and know in advance what the discussion is about, then the first time they hear about it is on the floor of town meeting. That's not enough time. If the committee really wants to have an impact they need to get their message out.\"</p><p> Hoort added that, at the first meeting with the video cameras rolling, the FinCom members were \"a little uncomfortable, but they got used to it pretty quickly.\"</p><p> \"Personally, I think the meetings are better for it,\" said FinCom member and former Selectman Ira Wood. \"It keeps us all on point.\"</p><p> Wood agreed with Hoort's view of the importance of getting the town budget discussion out into the public eye before town meeting. \"At town meeting it's all out of context and you only get little snippets of information,\" he said.</p><p> Baumgarten grew up and went to high school in Weston, and moved to Wellfleet with her family at age 17. She graduated from Emerson College in Boston, where she studied screenwriting and film and video production. She did video work for the International Fund for Animal Welfare and then was a studio technician for ESPN in Connecticut before returning to the Cape. She has been working for the town of Orleans taping town committee meetings for its media department. Her work there attracted Hoort's attention.</p><p> \"I just love this stuff  I'm a big tech geek,\" Baumgarten said. \"I believe strongly in the importance of government transparency and citizen engagement in fostering a healthy community. That's especially true in Wellfleet where issues like climate change, public resource use, and seafaring industry regulations are so hotly contested and have such a direct impact on the community. It's very important to keep young people here. I want to get them engaged in what's going on in the town. I'm committed to making information readily and clearly available to the public.\"</p><p> Baumgarten started out by looking at the existing video operation and thinking about what could be most quickly improved.</p><p> \"One thing that was very apparent in looking back over the taped meetings was that it's difficult to tell where you are in any given meeting,\" she said. \"You could have a three-hour meeting and it says the same thing at the bottom of the screen for the whole time. So I started adding information.\"</p><p> Now the tapes are indexed and labeled so that, by checking the agenda for that meeting, viewers can easily find the part of the discussion they're looking for.</p><p> Also on Baumgarten's agenda is getting better video equipment. \"We've been scraping by with some borrowed equipment,\" she said. She serves on the town's cable advisory committee along with Tom Cole, Deborah Magee and Town Librarian Jennifer Wertkin, and last week she presented the group with an equipment purchase plan. Her goal, she said, is to be able to film any meeting in any room with professional equipment that can be managed by a one-person crew.</p><p> The town government video programming is funded by franchise fees that Comcast pays to the town in exchange for the use of public rights of way for cables on poles or underground. The account into which these payments go has about $380,000 in it, Hoort said last week.</p><p> Hoort wants to make the media operations manager a regular town position, and he posted the position on the town website on Monday. The hours, according to the posting, are up to 15 per week, the schedule is flexible, and the salary is negotiable. The deadline for applications is Feb. 28.</p><p> Hoort said the town is currently negotiating a new contract with Comcast, and that depending on the outcome, \"we might look at increasing the hours\" for the operations manager. \"If it became 20 hours a week or more, it would become a position with benefits.\" There would be no effect on taxpayers, he added, because all the funds would come out of the Comcast account.</p><p> Do people actually watch videos of town board meetings? Wood says they do.</p><p> \"When I was a selectman I discovered they were very popular,\" he said. \"People sit and watch that stuff. It gives you a kind of cachet  makes you more real or something. It's unbelievable.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-61e8fb19b01cf2dc7374adc04dc117db75c52f86</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289B9EB211AE67 NWBKMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VF8-GY51-DXVP-V04W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"955\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Provincetown Banner<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It is significantly altering the ways people live and businesses operate. Recent examples of the use of disruptive technologies include financial technology (fintech), e-commerce and ride-sharing.</p><p>Because it is new and complicated, the policy responses of most countries, including developed ones, are often late compared to the actual development of the trend, which could be seen in perplexed regulations involving fintech and ride-sharing in many countries.</p><p>Cryptocurrency has emerged as an innovative product of digitalisation. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as an internet-based medium of exchange which uses cryptographical functions to conduct financial transactions.</p><p>Based on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies have high security, transparency and decentralisation. As they are not controlled by any central authority, they are immune to the old ways of government interference.</p><p>The technology uses peer-to-peer consensus to record and verify transactions without the need for custodians and clearing houses, which will reduce financial intermediary costs and transaction times.</p><p>Besides their advantages, fintech and cryptocurrencies, as part of the digital economy, have posed a challenge to monetary policy as well as policy sovereignty of many countries.</p><p>Among the concerns are questions of privacy, money laundering and the financing of terrorism as the result of the anonymity characteristic of blockchain technology.</p><p>The legal status (money or financial asset) of bitcoin or other digital currencies varies around the world. Some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade while others have banned or restricted them.</p><p>Japan is seen the world's most progressive regulative climate for cryptocurrencies; it recognises digital currencies as legal property under the Payment Services Act and gains on cryptocurrencies are taxable at rates of 15-55 per cent.</p><p>In fact, many experts have raised suspicions as to whether bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be considered currency when taking into account their high volatility, low degree of transactions, quite small community and not yet a real store of value.</p><p>For Libra, Facebook has advertised it as a way to improve financial inclusion for a vast pool of people without access to bank accounts.</p><p>Starting in 2020, Facebook's 2.4 billion users will be able to shop and send money overseas with almost zero transaction fees via its social platforms, including Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, it said.</p><p>Moreover, Facebook's digital coin is anticipated to gain higher customer trust as the Libra is pegged to a basket of major sovereign currencies, including the US dollar and Euro (Libra Reserve), meaning it would fluctuate less than existing cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Facebook even established a subsidiary called Calibra to run its crypto dealings and promised to separate transaction data from social data. It and 27 other founding members in Libra Association (which could increase to 100 members) will share governance power.</p><p>However, US regulators are bristling and they have sent a clear message: they don't trust Facebook, especially since the tech giant has a poor track record of privacy and security.</p><p>Its oversight capacity is also in question following a slew of scandals including the Cambridge Analytica scandals for which the Federal Trade Commission ordered the company to pay US$5 billion for privacy violations.</p><p>The possibility that big tech groups such as Facebook could rapidly establish a dominant position in global finance could also pose a potential threat to competition, financial stability and monetary policy sovereignty, and it may undermine the power of the US dollar.</p><p>US lawmakers are considering a ban to prevent big technology companies from functioning as financial institutions or issuing digital currencies.</p><p>In Vietnam, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is seen an important opportunity to shore up its economy, accelerate the process of modernisation and enhance its competitiveness.</p><p>In fact, disruptive technologies such as fintech, the sharing economy and e-commerce are developing rapidly in Vietnam. The Government began to study and issue more regulations to meet actual development requirements of businesses and encourage innovation.</p><p>However, taking into account the potential adverse impacts of disruptive policies on the economy and social welfare, this process is taking a slow and cautious view.</p><p>For cryptocurrencies, the official view of the State Bank of Vietnam is that it has not recognised them as legal ledger tender (a legal payment instrument) and exchanges and transactions of digital currency are illegal in Vietnam.</p><p>Nevertheless, mining and trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still happening in Vietnam and unclear regulations have hindered tax collection on such transactions for the State budget.</p><p>Libra and cryptocurrencies are part of disruptive technologies that are inevitable which are associated with the development of fintech and digitalisation in the banking sector.</p><p>A working group of the Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV) has also studied the development of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and the newest Libra, providing policy implications.</p><p>From the experience of many countries, it is necessary to determine the scope of the issue to have appropriate policies. Caution is needed in terms of financial and macroeconomic stability, but it should also be treated in the context of actual development in both the world and domestic markets so as we're not passive in policymaking.</p><p>Research on policies of the other countries is also essential as Vietnam is integrating more deeply into the global economy.</p><p>Libra should not only be seen as a single cryptocurrency but as a disruptive technology issue. It is associated with the status and development of social networks, global financial stability and policy sovereignty of major countries.</p><p>As Facebook said, blockchain technology is inevitable and the US should absolutely lead the world in rule-making for cryptocurrencies.</p><p>This is also an unavoidable problem for Vietnam. We should not just wait to see when it is born but take advantage of this chance to push research and oversight of disruptive technology to have in-time and appropriate policies.</p><p>* V\\xF5 Tr\\xED Thanh is a senior economist at the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) and a member of the National Financial and Monetary Policy Advisory Council.

It is significantly altering the ways people live and businesses operate. Recent examples of the use of disruptive technologies include financial technology (fintech), e-commerce and ride-sharing.</p><p>Because it is new and complicated, the policy responses of most countries, including developed ones, are often late compared to the actual development of the trend, which could be seen in perplexed regulations involving fintech and ride-sharing in many countries.</p><p>Cryptocurrency has emerged as an innovative product of digitalisation. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as an internet-based medium of exchange which uses cryptographical functions to conduct financial transactions.</p><p>Based on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies have high security, transparency and decentralisation. As they are not controlled by any central authority, they are immune to the old ways of government interference.</p><p>The technology uses peer-to-peer consensus to record and verify transactions without the need for custodians and clearing houses, which will reduce financial intermediary costs and transaction times.</p><p>Besides their advantages, fintech and cryptocurrencies, as part of the digital economy, have posed a challenge to monetary policy as well as policy sovereignty of many countries.</p><p>Among the concerns are questions of privacy, money laundering and the financing of terrorism as the result of the anonymity characteristic of blockchain technology.</p><p>The legal status (money or financial asset) of bitcoin or other digital currencies varies around the world. Some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade while others have banned or restricted them.</p><p>Japan is seen the world's most progressive regulative climate for cryptocurrencies; it recognises digital currencies as legal property under the Payment Services Act and gains on cryptocurrencies are taxable at rates of 15-55 per cent.</p><p>In fact, many experts have raised suspicions as to whether bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be considered currency when taking into account their high volatility, low degree of transactions, quite small community and not yet a real store of value.</p><p>For Libra, Facebook has advertised it as a way to improve financial inclusion for a vast pool of people without access to bank accounts.</p><p>Starting in 2020, Facebook's 2.4 billion users will be able to shop and send money overseas with almost zero transaction fees via its social platforms, including Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, it said.</p><p>Moreover, Facebook's digital coin is anticipated to gain higher customer trust as the Libra is pegged to a basket of major sovereign currencies, including the US dollar and Euro (Libra Reserve), meaning it would fluctuate less than existing cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Facebook even established a subsidiary called Calibra to run its crypto dealings and promised to separate transaction data from social data. It and 27 other founding members in Libra Association (which could increase to 100 members) will share governance power.</p><p>However, US regulators are bristling and they have sent a clear message: they don't trust Facebook, especially since the tech giant has a poor track record of privacy and security. </p><p>Its oversight capacity is also in question following a slew of scandals including the Cambridge Analytica scandals for which the Federal Trade Commission ordered the company to pay US$5 billion for privacy violations.</p><p>The possibility that big tech groups such as Facebook could rapidly establish a dominant position in global finance could also pose a potential threat to competition, financial stability and monetary policy sovereignty, and it may undermine the power of the US dollar.</p><p>US lawmakers are considering a ban to prevent big technology companies from functioning as financial institutions or issuing digital currencies.</p><p>In Vietnam, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is seen an important opportunity to shore up its economy, accelerate the process of modernisation and enhance its competitiveness.</p><p>In fact, disruptive technologies such as fintech, the sharing economy and e-commerce are developing rapidly in Vietnam. The Government began to study and issue more regulations to meet actual development requirements of businesses and encourage innovation.</p><p>However, taking into account the potential adverse impacts of disruptive policies on the economy and social welfare, this process is taking a slow and cautious view.</p><p>For cryptocurrencies, the official view of the State Bank of Vietnam is that it has not recognised them as legal ledger tender (a legal payment instrument) and exchanges and transactions of digital currency are illegal in Vietnam.</p><p>Nevertheless, mining and trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still happening in Vietnam and unclear regulations have hindered tax collection on such transactions for the State budget.</p><p>Libra and cryptocurrencies are part of disruptive technologies that are inevitable which are associated with the development of fintech and digitalisation in the banking sector.</p><p>A working group of the Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV) has also studied the development of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and the newest Libra, providing policy implications.</p><p>From the experience of many countries, it is necessary to determine the scope of the issue to have appropriate policies. Caution is needed in terms of financial and macroeconomic stability, but it should also be treated in the context of actual development in both the world and domestic markets so as we're not passive in policymaking.</p><p>Research on policies of the other countries is also essential as Vietnam is integrating more deeply into the global economy.</p><p>Libra should not only be seen as a single cryptocurrency but as a disruptive technology issue. It is associated with the status and development of social networks, global financial stability and policy sovereignty of major countries.</p><p>As Facebook said, blockchain technology is inevitable and the US should absolutely lead the world in rule-making for cryptocurrencies.</p><p>This is also an unavoidable problem for Vietnam. We should not just wait to see when it is born but take advantage of this chance to push research and oversight of disruptive technology to have in-time and appropriate policies.</p><p>* V\u00f5 Tr\u00ed Thanh is a senior economist at the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) and a member of the National Financial and Monetary Policy Advisory Council.

The new regulation passed this week strengthens the government\u2019s position on censoring the internet, drawing Amnesty International to decry that it leaves \u201cno safe place for people to speak freely\u201d in Vietnam. Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) \u2014 a group that represents Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Line and others \u2014 furthered cautioned that it would harm the development of the country\u2019s digital economy. </p><p>Among the broad points, the new cyber security law forbids internet users from organizing with, or training, others for anti-state purposes, spreading false information, and undermining the nation state\u2019s achievements or solidarity, according to reports. \u201cThis decision has potentially devastating consequences for freedom of expression in Vietnam. In the country\u2019s deeply repressive climate, the online space was a relative refuge where people could go to share ideas and opinions with less fear of censure by the authorities,\u201d Amnesty International added in a statement. Internet censorship isn\u2019t new to Vietnam, but the law increases the state\u2019s potential to act. Concern is already high following a string of arrests over the past year which has seen bloggers jailed for discussing environmental issues, politics and more online. Beyond limiting free speech, the cyber law also applies pressure to foreign internet companies who will now be required to operate a local office and store user information on Vietnamese soil. Currently, in the case of Google and Facebook, data on Vietnam-based users is stored overseas in locations such as Singapore and Hong Kong. Google and Facebook both declined to comment, but they are part of the AIC which did make a statement condemning the new law. \u201cThe provisions for data localization, controls on content that affect free speech, and local office requirements will undoubtedly hinder the nation\u2019s fourth Industrial Revolution ambitions to achieve GDP and job growth,\u201d AIC wrote in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, these provisions will result in severe limitations on Vietnam\u2019s digital economy, dampening the foreign investment climate and hurting opportunities for local businesses and SMEs to flourish inside and beyond Vietnam,\u201d the organization added. The people of Vietnam have also voiced their discontent at the new law. Bloomberg reports that demonstrations took place on Sunday ahead of the voting. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN882505620180612</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJ6-9SY1-DXCW-D3PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 12, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The markets get it. When themarket value of the top four companies - all tech - in the S&amp;P 500 exceeds that of the bottom 400, you knowprofound changes are underway in the global economy.The divergence between digital and analogue, old world and new world, has never been as stark as it has been  through the Covid-19 lockdown and beyond. We are all creatures of habit. </p><p>Yet, there is plenty of precedent for how behavioural changes following 'shock treatment' tend to stick - the acid test for such stickiness being whether thesechanges made sense anyway.Take GoI's 2016 demonetisation move. It led to an explosion in the use of digital wallets and debit/credit cards, and electronic payments generally. This digital transformation has substantially endured. Consider, also, the impact of the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2002-03, which led Alibaba to transform its B2B business model and launch the Taobao ecommerce platform. There was no looking back, with e-commerce in China today accounting for 37% of all retail, compared to 11% in the US.Digital commerce is, indeed, the most obvious beneficiary of the Covid-19 lockdown(s). US e-commerce sales jumped 49% from March to April - and it wasn't all Amazon, whose share actually declined from 51% to 40%. A robust e-commerce strategy has rapidly become the sine qua non for a successful retailer.Thus, Target is thriving while JC Penney has filed for bankruptcy. The digitisation of finance was also already well underway, but has been reinforced by Covid-19. It will be interesting to watch the Japanese fascination with cash - always a puzzle in the context of an otherwise highly digitised society - and how it clashes with an equally compulsive fixation on hygiene. Regardless, physical bank branches seem increasingly anachronistic, and - as with retail - a digital strategy will become a key differentiator among the incumbents.Joining the Cyber QueueApril 2020 saw a 200% surge in new mobile banking registrations in the US, while traffic increased by 85%.  Surveys suggest only 40% of peopl expect to return to physical bank branches once Covid-19 passes. The 'challenger banks' should logically be beneficiaries of this trend. But their ability to capitalise on these tailwinds will be a function of how they evolve their business models, as well as their funding and regulatory status.Virtual healthcare will also become an integral part of our 'new normal'. China has led the way, with PingAn Good Doctor boasting 300 million users. While the Chinese government has actively encouraged tele-health, approving coverage via public insurance last summer, it took Covid-19 to get the US government to expand Medicare to cover telemedicine.Then there has been the simultaneous digitisation of the workplace and of leisure - the creation of the 'Stay at home' economy. Jack Dorsey led the way, declaring that all Twitter employees could work from home 'forever'. Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook will embrace remote work, with the expectation that over time, 50% of its workforce would work remotely.While one could debate the merits of personal interaction, particularly when it comes to leadership, new hire integration, creativity and teamwork, the explosion in demand for bandwidth generally, and enabling technologies like video conferencing applications is undeniable. As cool as Zoom (up 290% [year to date] YTD) and Slack (up 61% YTD) may seem, there is very little Microsoft or Google could not replicate. And with security concerns paramount, enterprise chief technology officers (CTOs) will gravitate toward the perceived safety of big tech.Robotic process automation (RPA) -software that automates repetitive tasks - and robotics, generally, should experience a massive lift in a postCovid world, although the pressure to minimise disruptive job losses willmitigate this in the near term.As for leisure, live sports was the raison d'\ufffdtre for linear TV. Not surprisingly, therefore, 1.8 million payTV subscribers in the US cancelled service in Q1 2020, up 70% from the same period last year. Meanwhile,Netflix added 15.8 million new customers worldwide in the same period, while Disney+ added five million inApril alone.And then, there is education. According to New York University professor of marketing Scott Galloway,schools in the US charging $50,000 a year have value propositions that have been exposed and 'rendered untenable overnight' by Covid-19. 'The elimination of the university experience is similar to SeaWorld without killer whales,' he writes, adding, 'we're not paying $54,000 for Zoom classes'.Class of 2020Galloway sees a world with 50% online classes, as universities - devoid of the cash cow that is an international student body - embark on a radical restructuring with deployment of technology at its core, eventually resulting in a dramatic increase in enrolment, potentially even reverting college to the utopian vision of being a 'public good'. Partnerships with big tech are likely a fundamental part of this digital restructuring, as higher education becomes one of the few alternatives available to Amazon and Google to generate scalable growth.There's much that is uncertain today. But one thing is certain: your digital future has finally arrived.The writer is former CFO, SoftBank For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-76472245</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605K-MM11-DXJR-H16Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"928\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Frankly, I have never been a Facebook aficionado, albeit I reluctantly opened an account because there was this phase when many thought that if I did not increase Mark Zuckerberg's market capitalisation, I was an anachronism in the age of Big Tech. It was the cool thing to do; I remember going to parties frequented mostly by those with a visible hangover of a mid-life crisis who brightened up when saying: \"Let's connect on Facebook\".That same seemingly innocuous Facebook has now become an uncontrollable Frankenstein, a gargantuan monster that is capable of slaying democracies, upending social behaviour, destroying fragile minds and creating a toxic addiction to screen time. The Social Dilemma documentary tries to capture the raging madness that has imperceptibly overwhelmed humanity. </p><p>Incidentally, the Facebook CEO is now among the top three richest in the world.With the US elections due next month between a blustering President Donald Trump and a sombre former VP Joe Biden, Facebook is back in prime-time headlines. In 2016, it was public knowledge that the social media leviathan had a suspicious role in propagating Russian-sponsored advertisements that maliciously targeted Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton with vicious mendacities. Many Americans genuinely believed that the New York senator was surreptitiously running a child-prostitution racket. Such outlandish vulgarity was finding popularity in various pro-Trump chat groups.Clinton was demolished by the organised chaos that was amplified in Facebook pages; and data-mining was done using the services of Cambridge Analytica. Since Facebook algorithms permit localised targeting of vulnerable audiences, it is interesting to know that despite getting 2.8 million votes more than Trump, Clinton lost a sure-shot presidency by a mere 78,000 votes in the key swing-states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. We under-estimate Facebook's monumental impact on human psychology at our own risk. That's why the dramatic expose by the Wall Street Journal of the dubious role of Facebook's South Asia/India leadership becomes a serious transgression. So does Facebook actually have a conservative bias as is alleged? That is a tricky terrain.Bizarrely both Democrats and Republicans in the US think Facebook favours the other and want regulatory strictures imposed on it. Trump, in fact, believes that social media as a whole is in collusion with left-wing conspiracy marketers. In India, too, both the Congress and BJP echo chambers blame each other for manipulating information using the social media's massive database, sliced and diced to suit the targeted demographic segment. They are all wrong. The right-wing uses Facebook more effectively because large numbers of apolitical young voters inhabit those pages and they are more easily malleable to aggressive propaganda. The Facebookers snack on news, often swallowing it without digging their teeth in. The more aware news junkie is on Twitter, which right-wingers have frequently lamented is a left-leaning social network.The right-wing strategy also works on Facebook because it has no compunctions in twisting facts to suit its political narrative that is mostly impregnated with negative emotions: fear, insecurity, anger, threat, danger, enemy, hate, etc. It appeals to our basic instincts, our core susceptibilities. Secular, liberal fundamentalists are comparatively boring; their playbook is anodyne. Facebook has created a Zuckerbergfication of political communication; anything works, the more outrageous the better. Free speech is the excuse to create social polarisation.Zuckerberg has an obsessive objective to dominate the planet. The 36-year-old already has 2.6 billion active users on Facebook; it has become a vanity project for him. If you were Zuckerberg, just imagine the absolute power he commands. He can be the kingmaker in the political chessboard of democracies. Ankhi Das, the controversial public policy director of Facebook, let the cat out of the bag by making a telling comment that most missed: she let hate speeches go uncensored \"because it could damage government relationship (with the ruling BJP)\". Facebook courts governments; if Joe Biden wins, Facebook will chaperone what Trump calls \"radical left loonies\".If BJP loses in 2024, trust me, Facebook and Congress will do a slow-dance cheek by jowl. That is Zuckerberg's business model: government schmoozing. The fact that it took some brave Facebook employees to speak to WSJ is a manifestation of the company's compromised ethical commitments in maintaining neutral platforms. Facebook clearly had no intentions to deodorise the provocative messages. Ultimately, Facebook would like to consume mainstream media, without any production costs, regulatory obligations and journalistic qualifications. All it needs is sensationalist user content. And that is pouring in. The world needs to worry.(The author is a suspended Congress leader) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-78472965</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610D-H8J1-DXJR-H3TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.
