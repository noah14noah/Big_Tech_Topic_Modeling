A CQ Roll Call review of other major fintechs finds similar margins at firms like Intuit Inc., Square Inc. and Stripe Inc. For comparison, affiliates of Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, have given the former vice president more than $1 million and Trump just under $30,000, while JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. affiliates have supported Biden over Trump to the tune of $255,700 to $77,500.</p><p> Political prognosticators give Biden the edge with less than two months left to go until the election. FiveThirtyEight's average of national polls puts Biden up on Trump, 50.5% to 43.5%, and Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales currently projects Biden winning 319 electoral votes to Trump's 188, leaving Georgia and North Carolina's combined 31 votes a \"Toss-up.\"</p><p> The Biden campaign has released relatively little in the way of plans for the technology and finance sectors, let alone for the fintech niche \u2014 although it's far more than what's been released by President Donald Trump, whose platform is a continuation of his Make America Great Again agenda. But Biden has said enough on certain issues to expect some big policy shifts, said Diego Zuluaga, a Cato Institute researcher focusing on fintech.</p><p> \"I think the change could potentially be very substantial,\" said Zuluaga, pointing to Biden's support for a public credit-reporting agency that would compete with Experian, TransUnion and Equifax, as well as calls to reinstate fair-lending regulations, like the ability-to-repay rule, that Trump appointees rolled back.</p><p> Those changes could fall heavily on fintech lenders that have marketed themselves as cheaper alternatives to high-cost, small-dollar lenders, even as some consumer advocates say the fintechs are no different from the payday lenders they seek to disrupt.</p><p> \"I do worry about attempts to equalize access to credit, even though well-intentioned, that could lead to fintechs leaving certain segments of the market,\" Zuluaga said.</p><p> Despite the support from Big Tech and Big Banks, Biden is expected to take a more adversarial approach to both, wrote Isaac Boltanksy of Compass Point Research in a recent client memo, particularly if Democrats also reclaim the Senate and retain the House.</p><p> \"Under a Blue Wave, banks would face higher corporate taxes and a less hospitable regulatory environment,\" Boltansky wrote. \"We believe the leadership of the (Federal Trade Commission) and (Department of Justice) under a Biden administration would be structurally skeptical of large-scale M&amp;A, which could impact advisory businesses and the consolidation landscape.\"</p><p> Buying up fintech firms is one way such big institutions build their own fintech capacity.</p><p> What Biden's fintech-specific policies will end up looking like will depend heavily on his choices to run the financial regulators, emphasized Paul Thornell, a former Democratic staffer on the Hill and in the White House and Citigroup lobbyist now at Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen &amp; Thomas.</p><p> \"Fintech is not really partisan like other areas of banking regulation,\" he said.</p><p> Some Democrats applaud Silicon Valley's challenge of Wall Street's hegemony on all things money, while others are more skeptical.</p><p> The only mention of fintech among the policies on Biden's campaign website comes under the pledge \"strengthen and expand the Community Reinvestment Act to \u2026 ensure that 'fintechs' and non-bank lenders are providing responsible access to all members of the community.\"</p><p> Enacted in 1977, the CRA sought to reverse decades of redlining, a practice by which banks in poor minority neighborhoods took the community's deposits but invested and lent that money only in whiter, better-off areas. The law requires banks to sufficiently lend and invest in the neighborhoods surrounding their branches and ATMs in order to qualify for regulatory approvals to expand.</p><p>Fintech firms, because they don't have branches, are raising questions about how to apply the law.</p><p> Thornell expects Biden-appointed financial regulators to take a more coordinated approach to overhauling the CRA than the disjointed effort under Trump. The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation declined to adopt the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's changes, which were broadly panned by both fair housing advocates and banks.</p><p> That discontent with the new OCC rule, which covers 20 percent of banks holding 67% of total bank assets, presents an opportunity for Democratic appointees at the three regulators to rejigger it.</p><p> \"There's no way a Biden White House is going to run afoul of (House Financial Services Chairwoman) Maxine Waters and how she feels the Community Reinvestment Act should be modernized,\" Thornell said.</p><p> Waters has called for giving the law more teeth \u2014 only around 2% of banks failed to get satisfactory marks on CRA evaluation \u2014 and expanding it to meaningfully cover branchless online banks, perhaps by requiring them to invest in areas where they find concentrations of depositors.</p><p> Another big, recent change from the OCC \u2014 allowing payments firms to get national, rather than state-by-state, charters from the federal banking regulator \u2014 may also see a rethink under a Biden presidency, depending on whom he nominates to be comptroller. While banks and state regulators oppose the move, some see it as helping fintechs to inject welcome competition into the consumer banking sector.</p><p> \"Schools of thought on the OCC's right to issue payments charters are less divided by party than in other areas,\" said Zuluaga. \"You have Democrats who would advocate for this.\"</p><p> Boltanksy predicts the payments charter fight, which is now in court, will continue into a Biden administration without a quick resolution.</p><p> Biden's biggest fintech proposal, found in the unity document that Biden's campaign released with his main challenger for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, is probably the one analysts like least: creating free banking accounts for every American at the Federal Reserve and leveraging the U.S. Postal Service's 30,825 locations to build a branch network.</p><p> \"We remain bearish on the FedAccount effort even in a Blue Wave scenario given operational limitations and ideological opposition, but the issue will continue to garner attention as it is part of the broader economic equality/access conversation,\" wrote Boltanksy.</p><p> Banks and credit unions oppose that proposal, and it's unclear whether a Biden administration would expend any political capital to pursue it, especially when fiscal stimulus and a major tax overhaul top the policy priority list.</p><p> Zuluaga, however, thinks the policy idea could build momentum among Biden's bureaucratic appointees, potentially setting the stage for a future implementation attempt.</p><p> \"The technocrat-Democrat alliance is strong and would strengthen considerably under a Biden administration,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNE-7c768819542631fb87644724c26acc4b389bc292</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289B12C2B3CAD4 NWBKNE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WJ-5X81-DXVP-V3TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1306\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Lee Enterprises, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

La Monica, CNN Business</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline><nitf:dateline><location>NEW YORK (CNN Business)</location></nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEW YORK (CNN Business) --  The possibility that Elizabeth Warren could win the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination --- and perhaps even defeat Donald Trump --- is starting to unnerve some in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But would a President Warren actually be a bad thing for big business and the stock market? </p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees this summer that a Warren White House would not be good for the social media networking company, becaue of her calls to break up Facebook and other big tech companies. </p><p>Tech news site The Verge reported earlier this month that, according to leaked audio clips, Zuckerberg said \"if [Warren] gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah.\"</p><p>And a recent survey by RBC Capital Markets showed that investors are nervous about Joe Biden's poll numbers and Warren's ascent. </p><p>\"Investors clearly think Biden is better for the stock market than Warren,\" said Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in the report. In fact, Warren was viewed as \"the least market friendly\" candidate, Calvasina noted.</p><p>Warren has a populist platform and has talked about doing more to regulate the financial, tech, health care and energy industries. She has also proposed a wealth tax of 2% annually on households with a net worth above $50 million and 3% on households with a net worth higher than $1 billion. </p><p>So it's understandable why Wall Street has concerns about Warren. </p><p>The reasons why Warren wouldn't tank the stock market</p><p>Still, some experts think that worries about Warren are way overdone.</p><p>For one, few believe that the Senate will flip to Democratic control in 2020 --- even if President Trump loses his reelection bid. </p><p>So there are limits to how much a President Warren could do with executive orders if Congress is split, said Matt Daly, a managing director and head of corporate credit research at Conning.</p><p>And a Warren win could boost some parts of the market and economy, Daly told CNN Business. He pointed to clean energy and infrastructure as sectors that likely would benefit if Warren were to win the race for the White House. </p><p>Even though Mark Zuckerberg may not be a fan of the Massachusetts senator, other leaders in the tech industry support Warren's candidacy. </p><p>Big Tech starting to warm to Warren</p><p>According to a Vox/Recode story earlier this month, numerous tech insiders said they liked Warren because of her rigorous approach to coming up with policy ideas. Many also viewed her as a more palatable alternative to Bernie Sanders, who is also on the far-left, progressive side of the Democratic party.</p><p>To that end, employees and PACs tied to Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft are listed by the Center for Responsive Politics' OpenSecrets.org site as among the biggest donors to Warren's campaign. CNN owner AT&amp;T, Disney and IBM were also among the top 20 contributors.</p><p>Analysts at tech, media and telecom research firm MoffettNathanson don't seem worried about Warren either, noting that there's a difference between campaign rhetoric and actual policy.</p><p>\"We're relatively sanguine. Sure, a Warren presidency would heighten regulatory risks. But a Warren presidency would heighten regulatory risks for lots of industries,\" the MoffettNathanson analysts said in a report. The analysts added that \"her platform has more planks than a pirate ship; she's got plans for everything.\" </p><p>Warren has also talked tough about China. That actually could be good for the markets, despite current concerns about the trade war. </p><p>Even though Trump's tactic of imposing more tariffs on China has hurt American companies and consumers --- including from China's retaliatory measures --- there is support in the business community for Washington to enforce intellectual property rights more forcefully with Beijing. </p><p>Warren would probably continue that approach. So it may not be in China's best interests to drag out trade talks and hope that it will no longer have to deal with Trump in 2021 if Warren continue to gain ground in the polls. </p><p>\"There is growing consensus that China may hold out, trying to 'run out the clock' on the Trump administration through next November. These dynamics are changing, however, as Elizabeth Warren emerges and Joe Biden fades,\" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, in a report this week.</p><p>\"Warren is running on populist policies and could be as challenging an adversary to the Chinese than Trump,\" Hackett added.</p><p>Continued pressure on China in a Warren White House?</p><p>A likely strong approach to dealing with China is a key reason why Kyle Bass, founder of the Hayman Capital Management hedge fund, said he is backing Warren too. </p><p>Bass told CNN Business in August that he would \"immediately\" vote for Warren because of her stance on China. She has criticized the country's environmental and labor/human rights policies and has also accused China of currency manipulation.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Wall Street was initially wary of Barack Obama in 2008 because of similar fears about the prospects for tougher regulations on the health care and financial sectors. (Of course, Wall Street was scared about lots of things unrelated to politics in 2008, such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Great Recession.)</p><p>But the Obama presidency wound up being far more friendly to businesses than many had expected. So the same thing could happen if Warren wins the White House. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said recently that economic statistics are not adequately capturing the value of services delivered over smartphones and other devices. Meanwhile, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed creating a \"data dividend\" that would require large tech companies to pay users for their data, which requires an understanding of how much the data is worth to companies such as Google and Facebook. </p><p>Other lawmakers are trying to outsource the math problem to tech companies, asking them to put a price on user data and regularly report that number to regulators. It's a new challenge in the digital age to measure and value consumer data, fed to tech giants by tracking us via our many devices, including work computers, phones and even smart TVs. Signing up for Facebook or using Google's search engine is free. But consumers are trading their data \u2014 and the ability for those companies to help target them with ads \u2014 in exchange for those services. That's one of the reasons that pair of sneakers you eyed online on one website might appear to chase you in ads around the Internet. Google's ad arm brought in $32.6 billion in advertising dollars for the second quarter, while Facebook took in $16.6 billion in the same period. Facebook said that its 2.41 billion monthly active users generated an average of $7.05 each in revenue during the quarter between ad activity and other payments and fees. In Powell's speech, he referenced research by MIT and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. They found that people would have to be paid $17,530 per year to stop using search engines. Another group of researchers studied how much the average user would need to be paid to deactivate their Facebook account for one year. The result: more than $1,000, according to the researchers from Kenyon College, Susquehanna University, Michigan State University and Tufts University. Consumers have their own ideas. To help fuel the multimillion-dollar advertising businesses of Google and Facebook, Joshua Rivera, an avid Twitter user, said he guesses his personal data is worth about $10,000 a year. \"Those companies take the same data and can use it for really good purposes or really bad purposes,\" said the Albuquerque-based software engineer. \"There's nothing you can really do about which one they choose.\" For years, consumers have been willing to turn over their data in exchange for ads. But new concerns have surfaced about the type and volume of data collected, plus the way outside parties may abuse it. Facebook, which has borne the brunt of public scrutiny over data privacy, said in September that it had suspended tens of thousands of apps for possibly mishandling user data. The announcement came a year after reports that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had accessed the data of 87 million Facebook users and targeted them with political ads. State attorneys general have launched antitrust investigations into Facebook and Google, questioning in part the industry's access to vast amounts of data, while lawmakers and regulators are probing all of the major tech companies for potential antitrust violations. Tech companies are responding to those concerns. Facebook launched a tool that allows users to limit the data they share with apps, businesses and other groups. Google has rolled out ways for users to automatically delete certain data and ensure other data won't be saved to the user's account. Facebook declined to comment. In a statement, Google spokesman Aaron Stein said the company is \"constantly investing in tools that help users control their data and automatic protections that secure it.\" How officials choose to value user data and Internet-powered economic gains will affect how regulators police some of the world's most-profitable companies, including the fines and taxes imposed upon those organizations. Plus, data that more adequately captures the digital age could allow economists to explain why U.S. productivity has slowed in recent years. In recent remarks, Powell said that some at the Fed have proposed valuing the services customers derive from their digital devices based on data volume. The research is in the early stages, he said. \"Good decisions require good data, but the data in hand are seldom as good as we would like,\" Powell said. Others say they think the value shouldn't be measured at all. In a statement, analyst Karen Gullo of the nonprofit organization Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said privacy is a human right, and valuing data could trigger more problems. Gullo said the foundation opposes anything that could threaten to create a situation in which privacy is seen as \"property that can be bought and sold,\" even if users get paid in the process. Newsom, California's governor, is behind one such proposal that would require big tech companies to pay users for their data. \"Giving out handfuls of dollars in exchange for data just lets companies' invasive data collection remain unchecked,\" said Gullo.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Getty Images Signing up for Facebook or using Google's search engine is free.

That's one of the reasons that pair of sneakers you eyed online on one website might appear to chase you in ads around the Internet.</p><p>Google's ad arm brought in $32.6 billion in advertising dollars for the second quarter, while Facebook took in $16.6 billion in the same period. Facebook said that its 2.41 billion monthly active users generated an average of $7.05 each in revenue during the quarter between ad activity and other payments and fees.</p><p>In Powell's speech, he referenced research by MIT and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. They found that people would have to be paid $17,530 per year to stop using search engines. Another group of researchers studied how much the average user would need to be paid to deactivate their Facebook account for one year. The result: more than $1,000, according to the researchers from Kenyon College, Susquehanna University, Michigan State University and Tufts University.</p><p>Consumers have their own ideas. To help fuel the multimillion-dollar advertising businesses of Google and Facebook, Joshua Rivera, an avid Twitter user, said he guesses his personal data is worth about $10,000 a year.</p><p>\"Those companies take the same data and can use it for really good purposes or really bad purposes,\" said the Albuquerque-based software engineer. \"There's nothing you can really do about which one they choose.\" </p><p>For years, consumers have been willing to turn over their data in exchange for ads. But new concerns have surfaced about the type and volume of data collected, plus the way outside parties may abuse it.</p><p>Facebook, which has borne the brunt of public scrutiny over data privacy, said in September that it had suspended tens of thousands of apps for possibly mishandling user data. The announcement came a year after reports that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had accessed the data of 87 million Facebook users and targeted them with political ads.</p><p>State attorneys general have launched antitrust investigations into Facebook and Google, questioning in part the industry's access to vast amounts of data, while lawmakers and regulators are probing all of the major tech companies for potential antitrust violations.</p><p>Tech companies are responding to those concerns. Facebook launched a tool that allows users to limit the data they share with apps, businesses and other groups. Google has rolled out ways for users to automatically delete certain data and ensure other data won't be saved to the user's account.</p><p>Facebook declined to comment. In a statement, Google spokesman Aaron Stein said the company is \"constantly investing in tools that help users control their data and automatic protections that secure it.\" </p><p>How officials choose to value user data and Internet-powered economic gains will affect how regulators police some of the world's most-profitable companies, including the fines and taxes imposed upon those organizations. Plus, data that more adequately captures the digital age could allow economists to explain why U.S. productivity has slowed in recent years.</p><p>In remarks this week, Powell said that some at the Fed have proposed valuing the services customers derive from their digital devices based on data volume. The research is in the early stages, he said.</p><p>\"Good decisions require good data, but the data in hand are seldom as good as we would like,\" Powell said.</p><p>Others say they think the value shouldn't be measured at all.</p><p>In a statement, analyst Karen Gullo of the nonprofit organization Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said privacy is a human right, and valuing data could trigger more problems. Gullo said the foundation opposes anything that could threaten to create a situation in which privacy is seen as \"property that can be bought and sold,\" even if users get paid in the process.</p><p>Newsom, California's governor, is behind one such proposal that would require big tech companies to pay users for their data.</p><p>\"Giving out handfuls of dollars in exchange for data just lets companies' invasive data collection remain unchecked,\" said Gullo.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-0e773e675a294273be306c2819a1f990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8F-BKK1-DXKP-J00P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"869\"/><timeReceived>11:01 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The 12 candidates for the October Democratic debate are trotted out onstage in Westerville, Ohio, each true to type. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard wears her all-white suit. Businessman Tom Steyer has his Christmas plaid tie. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is open-collar with a \"MATH\" pin - Make America Think Hard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             2 minutes. \"Let's begin,\" CNN's Anderson Cooper says, before introducing a first question about impeachment. Everyone gets a chance, but the septuagenarians go first. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) rehashes stuff she has said before about the Mueller report and the rule of law. Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), recently recovered from a heart attack, looks well as he explains President Trump's alleged crimes. Former vice president Joe Biden, coifed and tailored as if he just stepped out of a men's store catalogue, can't settle on whether Trump is \"the most corrupt president in modern history\" or \"all of our history.\" </p><p>             5 minutes. Because everyone has basically the same answer on impeachment, the candidates search for ways to define their brands. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) quotes the author Maya Angelou. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) speaks about feelings and duty. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) says Trump is making \"Russia great again.\" Former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro talks about Ohio job losses. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg gestures with his hands as he asks America to envision the day after Trump is pushed from office. \"It starts out feeling like a happy thought,\" he says. \"But really think about where we'll be: vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now.\"</p><p>             12 minutes. Gabbard says impeachment should not be partisan. Steyer tries to get applause by calling Trump a \"criminal in the White House.\" Yang uses the moment to blame Amazon, a company run by the owner of The Washington Post, for \"closing 30 percent of America's stores and malls\" and paying no taxes. Former congressman Beto O'Rourke (Tex.), in his trademark poetry-slam cadence, riffs on how Trump has betrayed those who have served the country in uniform. </p><p>             16 minutes. Biden gets a question about his son Hunter, who got a job for a Ukrainian gas company while he held elected office - and whose dealings have become a focus for Trump's attacks on the former vice president. \"I want to point out there's no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you,\" Cooper says, before asking if it was wrong for family members of vice presidents to take jobs like that. Biden doesn't seem to want to answer. Instead, he says no one did anything wrong and he never talked business with his son. \"This is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focusing on,\" Biden says. </p><p>             18 minutes. Cooper tries to get Sanders to bite on Hunter Biden. Sanders responds by talking about \"the pain of the working class of this country.\" </p><p>             20 minutes. Now it is Warren's time in the frying pan. Marc Lacey, an editor at the New York Times, which is co-hosting the debate with CNN, asks the question Warren won't answer. Will she raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare-for-all? Warren still won't answer. Instead, she talks about the \"70,000 selfies\" she has taken with voters, which really aren't selfies because someone else is holding the camera. </p><p>             21 minutes. Lacey tries again, asking if she should acknowledge what is obvious. Warren, a former high school debate champion, responds this time with a double negative. \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,\" she says. She won't say taxes.  </p><p>             22 minutes. Nearly half the people onstage are ready to pounce. Some want to debate the policy. Others want to turn Warren's strategy of not admitting what everyone knows into a proxy for her character. \"Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,\" says Buttigieg. Warren bites back by saying the mayor's plan - Medicare-for-all who want it - is really \"Medicare-for-all who can afford it.\" Snap. </p><p>             25 minutes. After a quick rebuttal that notes his plan's subsidies, Buttigieg deftly pivots back to his opening theme. Warren, he says, wants to disrupt and divide the day after Trump leaves office. \"Why unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all?\" he asks. Sanders chimes in to say taxes will go up under Medicare-for-all. \"Well, at least that's a straightforward answer,\" says Buttigieg, getting in yet another dig at Warren.</p><p>             26 minutes. CNN cuts to a shot of the four in the center of the stage, Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren, which is a nice compliment for Buttigieg and a dismissal of Harris, who has recently faltered in the polls. Both Klobuchar and Biden chime in to hit the same points on Warren's refusal to say what her policy would do. They score blow after blow, and in response, Warren keeps lapsing into her stump speech, talking about how the middle class has been hollowed out. Maybe this strategy worked better in high school. </p><p>             31 minutes. Sanders gives Warren a break. He attacks Biden for not backing his bill. He says 500,000 people go bankrupt every year from medical costs, a contested statistic. Then, he accuses Biden of a lack of courage. Biden smiles, but before he can respond Harris breaks the spell by changing the topic. She says its time to talk about \"women's reproductive health care.\" </p><p>             33 minutes. The resulting applause serves as a palate cleanser. But the moderators move on. Now everyone is talking about robots taking jobs. Yang disagrees with Sanders about whether the best response is more government employment or cash subsidies. But then, just as the robot conversation gets going, Booker chimes in to sayHarris is right about reproductive health care. \"Women are people. And people deserve to control their own bodies,\" he says. </p><p>             37 minutes. CNN's Erin Burnett tries to get the topic back on robots and jobs. Warren talks about bad trade deals. Castro talks about infrastructure investment and a Green New Deal. Yang challenges Warren for not adopting his universal basic income plan, which would pay adults $1,000 a month. He mentions the self-driving trucks and self-serve kiosks at McDonald's. Warren responds by saying she supports increases in Social Security payments. The conversation continues for a while, with several candidates endorsing stronger unions and better trade deals. </p><p>             46 minutes. Burnett appears to try to set a trap. She asks Sanders if he thinks billionaires should be taxed into millionaire status. Steyer, a billionaire who has joined the debate stage for the first time, is just a few feet away. \"We cannot afford a billionaire class,\" Sanders responds. But Steyer is ready. \"First of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right,\" he says. He flips class politics on its head and makes the case that he is as radical on economic inequality as the Democratic socialist.</p><p>             49 minutes. But Warren is not ready to give up the class struggle. She asks why everyone on the stage besides Sanders and herself thinks \"it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\" Biden takes offense. \"No one is supporting billionaires,\" he says. So does Buttigieg, who generally sounds the best in these debate settings. Here, he tries some next-level mental jujitsu. He says people in the Midwest have come to distrust politicians who focus on \"who sounded better on a debate stage or in a committee hearing.\" </p><p>             53 minutes. Klobuchar does not want to lose the pile-on-Warren thread. \"I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires,\" she says. \"Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\" Warren is dismissive, without actually engaging with Klobuchar. \"Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\" Warren says. Klobuchar is ready. \"Simply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're [not] fighting for regular people,\" she says.  </p><p>             57 minutes. A discussion continues about the wealth tax embraced by Warren. Yang likes the idea, but he says it has failed in lots of places. O'Rourke says it is part of a solution, but worries that Warren is being \"punitive.\" This gives Warren a chance to say she is \"really shocked\" that anyone would consider her punitive and to lapse into another part of her stump speech, where she says the wealthy got help from public infrastructure and need to \"pitch in\" to pay some of it back. </p><p>             63 minutes. \"We've got to take a quick break,\" says Cooper. Only two hours left. Democracy is hard. </p><p>             68 minutes. We're back with foreign policy. The focus in on Trump's recent decision to pull troops out of Syria. Everyone on the stage is against either the withdrawal or the way Trump handled the withdrawal, leaving behind former Kurdish allies to face Turkish forces alone. Biden seems particularly worked up. \"This is shameful, shameful what this man has done,\" he says. </p><p>             70 minutes. Gabbard, the only candidate who raises doubts about reports of Syrian chemical weapons use on her campaign website, scrambles the conversation by blaming the Turkish slaughter of Kurds on \"the regime change war that we've been waging.\" The Syrian civil war started before U.S. troops arrived, and the U.S. troops in the country were not focused on changing the Syrian regime. Gabbard goes on to say accusations that she is Russian asset are \"completely despicable.\" She repeats the phrase \"regime change war\" four more times. </p><p>             73 minutes. The other candidates work to distance themselves from Gabbard. Warren says she wants to get out of Syria but in a smarter way, and she appears to be reading talking points from a piece of paper on her podium. Buttigieg, who is delivering his most forceful debate performance of the year, calls Gabbard \"dead wrong.\" This prompts an odd exchange where Gabbard and Buttigieg debate the difference between \"regime change war\" and \"endless war.\" \"What is an endless war if it's not a regime change war?\" Gabbard asks. </p><p>             78 minutes. The discussion turns to the U.S. standing in the world and the trust of its allies. Candidates agree that Trump has not been good for either. Several also point to growing Russian geopolitical strength. </p><p>             91 minutes. Cooper changes the topic to gun violence, pitting O'Rourke and Buttigieg against each other. O'Rourke wants a mandatory buyback of assault weapons, although he offers only vague notions of how it will be enforced. Buttigieg thinks the proposal could prevent other new gun regulations from becoming law by polarizing the debate. The back and forth gets a bit nasty. \"I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\" Buttigieg says to O'Rourke, who responds by saying Buttigieg's position is a \"slap in the face\" to gun violence survivor groups. The other candidates also weigh in on guns. </p><p>             105 minutes. The topic changes to opioid policy. Several candidates say they support strong enforcement against pharmaceutical companies that flooded the market with drugs. Yang and O'Rourke says they support decriminalizing small amounts of opiates. When O'Rourke says marijuana should be legalized, Yang chimes in. \"Yes. Preach, Beto,\" he says. </p><p>             112 minutes. Sanders, 78, gets a question about his age and his health, given the heart attack. He answers by bragging about his youthful allies. \"Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we're having in Queens, New York,\" he says. \"We're going to have a special guest at that event.\" The guest is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), 30, who, The Washington Post later reports, will be endorsing him at the rally. Sanders also thanks all the well-wishers during his illness. \"I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening,\" he says. </p><p>             115 minutes. Biden, 76, responds to the age question by saying his experience is one of his best qualities. Warren, 70, basically dares anyone to keep up with her. \"I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone,\" she says. </p><p>             119 minutes. Gabbard, 38, gets the age question and answers by saying that as a military veteran she is ready to be commander in chief. Then she tries to ask Warren to justify her qualifications to lead the military, but the moderators cut her off and go to another commercial break. </p><p>             124 minutes. And we're back. The topic is big tech and whether companies like Facebook and Amazon need to be broken up. Most are leaning that way, although the details differ somewhat. Warren is particularly bothered by Amazon's ability to gather information from vendors on its network and then use that information to compete with those vendors. \"Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team, but you don't get to do both at the same time,\" she says. </p><p>             132 minutes. Harris takes a question about Facebook and turns it into a question for Warren about Twitter. She asks Warren to join her in demanding that Twitter suspend Trump's account for violating the rules. Like other platforms, Twitter tends to give public officials more leeway to be abusive. \"No,\" says Warren. \"No? Wow,\" says Harris, looking shocked. \"You can't say you're for corporate responsibility if it doesn't apply to everyone.\"</p><p>             139 minutes. The previously scheduled reproductive health section of the evening arrives. The candidates support reproductive health and are unhappy with the Trump administration. </p><p>             145 minutes. Buttigieg has spent much of the night telling other candidates that they are too polarizing, but now he revels in the fact that he was the first candidate to prominently embrace the idea of overhauling the Supreme Court to prevent a conservative majority. \"Some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate,\" he brags. He hasn't settled on how he would \"depoliticize\" the court, but options include term limits, rotating justices off and increasing the number from 9 to 15. Castro and Warren say they are interested in the ideas. </p><p>             149 minutes. Biden gets a question about whether his platform is bold enough. He boasts of all he has accomplished and pivots to attack Warren and Sanders. \"Both are being vague on the issue of Medicare-for-all,\" he says, trying to bring back the argument from earlier. Sanders is happy to oblige, listing off some of Biden's less popular accomplishments. \"You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA,\" he says. </p><p>             152 minutes. Rather than respond on Medicare-for-all, Warren begins listing off all the things she got done while working in the Obama administration fighting for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This leads Biden to praise her. \"I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes,\" Biden says. </p><p>             153 minutes. Warren can't manage to return the compliment, at least not directly. \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it,\" she says. </p><p>             154 minutes. Buttigieg does the meta-thing that politicians do when they want to make it look like they are not politicians, calling the debate between Biden and Warren a \"false choice.\" \"If I had a buck for every argument that I've witnessed like this, I could pay for college for everybody,\" he says, delivering what is clearly a rehearsed line. \"We need to move past what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I've been alive.\" </p><p>             156 minutes. Klobuchar weighs in to say bold doesn't matter if you don't win, and she knows how to win in the Midwest. </p><p>             157 minutes. Cooper asks Sanders why his approach is more likely to beat Trump. \"Here's the radical reason,\" says Sanders. \"It's what the American people want.\" This is not yet clear. </p><p>             160 minutes. A final break. Almost there. </p><p>             165 minutes. And we're back. The final question is for everyone. Each candidate is asked to talk about a surprising friendship. Castro talks vaguely about people he has known who are different from him. Gabbard talks about her friendship with former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.). Klobuchar talks about former senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), who died last year. \"I miss him every day,\" she says. Steyer talks about a woman he met in South Carolina who is fighting for cleaner water. O'Rourke talks about his former colleague Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.). Booker talks about bible study in the office of Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.). Yang talks about a Trump-voting trucker he met and turned into a supporter. Harris talks about Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Buttigieg talks about the friends he met serving in Afghanistan. Sanders talks about Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). Warren talks about Charles Fried, a Republican solicitor general who helped her get a job. Biden talks about McCain as well.</p><p>             186 minutes. \"Candidates, thank you,\" says Cooper. \"That concludes the fourth Democratic debate.\" Think hard, America. </p><p><email

The 12 candidates for the October Democratic debate are trotted out onstage in Westerville, Ohio, each true to type. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard wears her all-white suit. </p><p>Businessman Tom Steyer has his Christmas plaid tie. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is open-collar with a \"MATH\" pin \u2014 Make America Think Hard. \u2014 2 minutes. \"Let's begin,\" CNN's Anderson Cooper says, before introducing a first question about impeachment. Everyone gets a chance, but the septuagenarians go first. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts rehashes stuff she has said before about the Mueller report and the rule of law. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, recently recovered from a heart attack, looks well as he explains President Trump's alleged crimes. Former vice president Joe Biden, coifed and tailored as if he just stepped out of a men's store catalog, can't settle on whether Trump is \"the most corrupt president in modern history\" or \"all of our history.\" \u2014 5 minutes. Because everyone has basically the same answer on impeachment, the candidates search for ways to define their brands. Sen. Kamala Harris of California quotes the author Maya Angelou. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey speaks about feelings and duty. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota says Trump is making \"Russia great again.\" Former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro talks about Ohio job losses. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, gestures with his hands as he asks America to envision the day after Trump is pushed from office. \"It starts out feeling like a happy thought,\" he says. \"But really think about where we'll be: vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now.\" 12 minutes. Gabbard says impeachment should not be partisan. Steyer tries to get applause by calling Trump a \"criminal in the White House.\" Yang uses the moment to blame Amazon, a company run by the owner of The Washington Post, for \"closing 30 percent of America's stores and malls\" and paying no taxes. Former congressman Beto O'Rourke (Tex.), in his trademark poetry-slam cadence, riffs on how Trump has betrayed those who have served the country in uniform. 16 minutes. Biden gets a question about his son Hunter, who got a job for a Ukrainian gas company while he held elected office \u2014 and whose dealings have become a focus for Trump's attacks on the former vice president. \"I want to point out there's no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you,\" Cooper says, before asking if it was wrong for family members of vice presidents to take jobs like that. Biden doesn't seem to want to answer. Instead, he says no one did anything wrong and he never talked business with his son. \"This is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focusing on,\" Biden says. 18 minutes. Cooper tries to get Sanders to bite on Hunter Biden. Sanders responds by talking about \"the pain of the working class of this country.\" 20 minutes. Now it is Warren's time in the frying pan. Marc Lacey, an editor at The New York Times, which is co-hosting the debate with CNN, asks the question Warren won't answer. Will she raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare-for-all? Warren still won't answer. Instead, she talks about the \"70,000 selfies\" she has taken with voters, which really aren't selfies because someone else is holding the camera. 21 minutes. Lacey tries again, asking if she should acknowledge what is obvious. Warren, a former high school debate champion, responds this time with a double negative. \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,\" she says. She won't say taxes. 22 minutes. Nearly half the people onstage are ready to pounce. Some want to debate the policy. Others want to turn Warren's strategy of not admitting what everyone knows into a proxy for her character. \"Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,\" says Buttigieg. Warren bites back by saying the mayor's plan \u2014 Medicare-for-all who want it \u2014 is really \"Medicare-for-all who can afford it.\" Snap. 25 minutes. After a quick rebuttal that notes his plan's subsidies, Buttigieg deftly pivots back to his opening theme. Warren, he says, wants to disrupt and divide the day after Trump leaves office. \"Why unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all?\" he asks. Sanders chimes in to say taxes will go up under Medicare-for-all. \"Well, at least that's a straightforward answer,\" says Buttigieg, getting in yet another dig at Warren. 26 minutes. CNN cuts to a shot of the four in the center of the stage, Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren, which is a nice compliment for Buttigieg and a dismissal of Harris, who has recently faltered in the polls. Both Klobuchar and Biden chime in to hit the same points on Warren's refusal to say what her policy would do. They score blow after blow, and in response, Warren keeps lapsing into her stump speech, talking about how the middle class has been hollowed out. Maybe this strategy worked better in high school. 31 minutes. Sanders gives Warren a break. He attacks Biden for not backing his bill. He says 500,000 people go bankrupt every year from medical costs, a contested statistic. Then, he accuses Biden of a lack of courage. Biden smiles, but before he can respond Harris breaks the spell by changing the topic. She says its time to talk about \"women's reproductive health care.\" 33 minutes. The resulting applause serves as a palate cleanser. But the moderators move on. Now everyone is talking about robots taking jobs. Yang disagrees with Sanders about whether the best response is more government employment or cash subsidies. But then, just as the robot conversation gets going, Booker chimes in to say Harris is right about reproductive health care. \"Women are people. And people deserve to control their own bodies,\" he says. 37 minutes. CNN's Erin Burnett tries to get the topic back on robots and jobs. Warren talks about bad trade deals. Castro talks about infrastructure investment and a Green New Deal. Yang challenges Warren for not adopting his universal basic income plan, which would pay adults $1,000 a month. He mentions the self-driving trucks and self-serve kiosks at McDonald's. Warren responds by saying she supports increases in Social Security payments. The conversation continues for a while, with several candidates endorsing stronger unions and better trade deals. 46 minutes. Burnett appears to try to set a trap. She asks Sanders if he thinks billionaires should be taxed into millionaire status. Steyer, a billionaire who has joined the debate stage for the first time, is just a few feet away. \"We cannot afford a billionaire class,\" Sanders responds. But Steyer is ready. \"First of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right,\" he says. He flips class politics on its head and makes the case that he is as radical on economic inequality as the Democratic socialist. 49 minutes. But Warren is not ready to give up the class struggle. She asks why everyone on the stage besides Sanders and herself thinks \"it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\" Biden takes offense. \"No one is supporting billionaires,\" he says. So does Buttigieg, who generally sounds the best in these debate settings. Here, he tries some next-level mental jujitsu. He says people in the Midwest have come to distrust politicians who focus on \"who sounded better on a debate stage or in a committee hearing.\" 53 minutes. Klobuchar does not want to lose the pile-on-Warren thread. \"I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires,\" she says. \"Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\" Warren is dismissive, without actually engaging with Klobuchar. \"Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\" Warren says. Klobuchar is ready. \"Simply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're not fighting for regular people,\" she says. 57 minutes. A discussion continues about the wealth tax embraced by Warren. Yang likes the idea, but he says it has failed in lots of places. O'Rourke says it is part of a solution, but worries that Warren is being \"punitive.\" This gives Warren a chance to say she is\"really shocked\" that anyone would consider her punitive and to lapse into another part of her stump speech, where she says the wealthy got help from public infrastructure and need to \"pitch in\" to pay some of it back. 63 minutes. \"We've got to take a quick break,\" says Cooper. Only two hours left. Democracy is hard. 68 minutes. We're back with foreign policy. The focus in on Trump's recent decision to pull troops out of Syria. Everyone on the stage is against either the withdrawal or the way Trump handled the withdrawal, leaving behind former Kurdish allies to face Turkish forces alone. Biden seems particularly worked up. \"This is shameful, shameful what this man has done,\" he says. 70 minutes. Gabbard, the only candidate who raises doubts about reports of Syrian chemical weapons use on her campaign website, scrambles the conversation by blaming the Turkish slaughter of Kurds on \"the regime change war that we've been waging.\" The Syrian civil war started before U.S. troops arrived, and the U.S. troops in the country were not focused on changing the Syrian regime. Gabbard goes on to say accusations that she is Russian asset are \"completely despicable.\" She repeats the phrase \"regime change war\" four more times. 73 minutes. The other candidates work to distance themselves from Gabbard. Warren says she wants to get out of Syria but in a smarter way, and she appears to be reading talking points from a piece of paper on her podium. Buttigieg, who is delivering his most forceful debate performance of the year, calls Gabbard \"dead wrong.\" This prompts an odd exchange where Gabbard and Buttigieg debate the difference between \"regime change war\" and \"endless war.\" \"What is an endless war if it's not a regime change war?\" Gabbard asks. 78 minutes. The discussion turns to the U.S. standing in the world and the trust of its allies. Candidates agree that Trump has not been good for either. Several also point to growing Russian geopolitical strength. 91 minutes. Cooper changes the topic to gun violence, pitting O'Rourke and Buttigieg against each other. O'Rourke wants a mandatory buyback of assault weapons, although he offers only vague notions of how it will be enforced. Buttigieg thinks the proposal could prevent other new gun regulations from becoming law by polarizing the debate. The back and forth gets a bit nasty. \"I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\" Buttigieg says to O'Rourke, who responds by saying Buttigieg's position is a \"slap in the face\" to gun violence survivor groups. The other candidates also weigh in on guns. 105 minutes. The topic changes to opioid policy. Several candidates say they support strong enforcement against pharmaceutical companies that flooded the market with drugs. Yang and O'Rourke says they support decriminalizing small amounts of opiates. When O'Rourke says marijuana should be legalized, Yang chimes in. \"Yes. Preach, Beto,\" he says. 112 minutes. Sanders, 78, gets a question about his age and his health, given the heart attack. He answers by bragging about his youthful allies. \"Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we're having in Queens, New York,\" he says. \"We're going to have a special guest at that event.\" The guest is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., 30, who, The Washington Post later reports, will be endorsing him at the rally. Sanders also thanks all the well-wishers during his illness. \"I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening,\" he says. 115 minutes. Biden, 76, responds to the age question by saying his experience is one of his best qualities. Warren, 70, basically dares anyone to keep up with her. \"I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone,\" she says. 119 minutes. Gabbard, 38, gets the age question and answers by saying that as a military veteran she is ready to be commander in chief. Then she tries to ask Warren to justify her qualifications to lead the military, but the moderators cut her off and go to another commercial break. 124 minutes. And we're back. The topic is big tech and whether companies like Facebook and Amazon need to be broken up. Most are leaning that way, although the details differ somewhat. Warren is particularly bothered by Amazon's ability to gather information from vendors on its network and then use that information to compete with those vendors. \"Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team, but you don't get to do both at the same time,\" she says. 132 minutes. Harris takes a question about Facebook and turns it into a question for Warren about Twitter. She asks Warren to join her in demanding that Twitter suspend Trump's account for violating the rules. Like other platforms, Twitter tends to give public officials more leeway to be abusive. \"No,\" says Warren. \"No? Wow,\" says Harris, looking shocked. \"You can't say you're for corporate responsibility if it doesn't apply to everyone.\" 139 minutes. The previously scheduled reproductive health section of the evening arrives. The candidates support reproductive health and are unhappy with the Trump administration. 145 minutes. Buttigieg has spent much of the night telling other candidates that they are too polarizing, but now he revels in the fact that he was the first candidate to prominently embrace the idea of overhauling the Supreme Court to prevent a conservative majority. \"Some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate,\" he brags. He hasn't settled on how he would \"depoliticize\" the court, but options include term limits, rotating justices off and increasing the number from 9 to 15. Castro and Warren say they are interested in the ideas. 149 minutes. Biden gets a question about whether his platform is bold enough. He boasts of all he has accomplished and pivots to attack Warren and Sanders. \"Both are being vague on the issue of Medicare-for-all,\" he says, trying to bring back the argument from earlier. Sanders is happy to oblige, listing off some of Biden's less popular accomplishments. \"You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA,\" he says. 152 minutes. Rather than respond on Medicare-for-all, Warren begins listing off all the things she got done while working in the Obama administration fighting for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This leads Biden to praise her. \"I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes,\" Biden says. 153 minutes. Warren can't manage to return the compliment, at least not directly. \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it,\" she says. 154 minutes. Buttigieg does the meta-thing that politicians do when they want to make it look like they are not politicians, calling the debate between Biden and Warren a \"false choice.\" \"If I had a buck for every argument that I've witnessed like this, I could pay for college for everybody,\" he says, delivering what is clearly a rehearsed line. \"We need to move past what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I've been alive.\" 156 minutes. Klobuchar weighs in to say bold doesn't matter if you don't win, and she knows how to win in the Midwest. 157 minutes. Cooper asks Sanders why his approach is more likely to beat Trump. \"Here's the radical reason,\" says Sanders. \"It's what the American people want.\" This is not yet clear. 160 minutes. A final break. Almost there. 165 minutes. And we're back. The final question is for everyone. Each candidate is asked to talk about a surprising friendship. Castro talks vaguely about people he has known who are different from him. Gabbard talks about her friendship with former congressman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. Klobuchar talks about former senator John McCain, R-Ariz., who died last year. \"I miss him every day,\" she says. Steyer talks about a woman he met in South Carolina who is fighting for cleaner water. O'Rourke talks about his former colleague Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas. Booker talks about Bible study in the office of Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. Yang talks about a Trump-voting trucker he met and turned into a supporter. Harris talks about Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. Buttigieg talks about the friends he met serving in Afghanistan. Sanders talks about Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Warren talks about Charles Fried, a Republican solicitor general who helped her get a job. Biden talks about McCain as well. 186 minutes. \"Candidates, thank you,\" says Cooper. \"That concludes the fourth Democratic debate.\" Think hard, America.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

One of the best collections is put together by the online business publication Business Insider, which performs months of research and deep investigations before putting together a sober and realistic prediction for the year. Its latest list has just been released, and you can download it right here[2]. But if you're stressed for time and patience, we've gone to the trouble of digging out the gems for you. </p><p>In a nutshell, these are the things you can expect from the year ahead. Facebook will take on YouTube in the arena of mobile video and has a good chance of becoming the dominant player. Indonesia is set to become one of the largest smartphone markets in the world The blockchain will move from its area of niche, misunderstood finance into the mainstream Oil companies will embrace the Internet of Things to counter the sliding oil price Let's dig into a few of these sectors in more detail. The Internet of Things Cars which are connected to the internet are moving rapidly from the arena of 'nice-to-have' and into the realm of 'must-have'. Business Insider estimates that in 2016, two-thirds of all cars shipped in the US will be internet-enabled. Automakers like it because they can track data about their products and push for better performance and efficiency, while consumers are more and more enamoured with the data, media and applications that a connected car can provide them with. Hand-in-hand with connected cars is the steady flow of news around self-driving cars. One of the largest barriers to growth has been a lack of regulation around this technology. 'in 2016, we expect the federal government to provide more guidance to states that are creating their own self-driving car regulations,' claims the report. With better regulation, the prediction is that consumers will be able to purchase self-driving cars by the year 2019. Digital Media As we mentioned above, YouTube is facing a significant video challenge from Facebook. Business Insider predicts that brands and consumers will push more video to Facebook than to YouTube for the first time in 2016. Add to that Snapchat's growing audience and sophisticated brand partnerships and the stage is set for a transformative year. The metrics used to measure video views is set to become a major point of contention. Different platforms all use different techniques and, with the competition heating up, it is expected that a resolution will be reached in 2016. 'We expect platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and, to a lesser extent, Snapchat and Twitter, to have to address that they each use different metrics to count video views.' Ad blocking technology is gaining traction and changing the game for advertisers. As a result, you can expect to see much more native advertising embedded into popular online publications. Even massive publishers like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times have embraced native advertising, and the report stakes its colours to the mast, claiming that 'we believe that a migration to native could help redefine users' perception of digital advertising, and, in turn, diminish the need for ad blockers.' Ecommerce In the arena of ecommerce, big changes are predicted and many of them are from the big players. For some time now, Amazon has been seeking to provide a complete end-to-end service. From buying its own fleet of tractor trailers, to experimenting with drone delivery, this year will see Amazon move further away from its traditional reliance on delivery companies and become ever more independent. Social media is still a relatively small players in ecommerce and barely drives sales in a direct way. But that won't last for long. 'In 2015, Facebook made a big push toward achieving that goal by allowing more brands and retailers to use its platform for selling merchandise. For example, online shoppers can now request to have shipping updates sent to them via Messenger. Consumers can also use the app to speak to a brand representative.' You can expect more and more links to e-commerce through your social pages in the coming year. Affiliate marketing had a fairly bad name a few years ago, but it's turning into something of a darling for the media industry. 'Two factors are driving this growth: mainstream media publishers looking for supplementary revenue sources and influencer marketing. The latter is a form of earned media, which continues to expand on social media.'

Sweeping financial regulatory reforms in Europe \u2014 which have been in the works for seven years \u2014 finally went live on Wednesday. The lengthy and complex set changes, known as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), will impact a broad swath of financial firms across the globe, but especially investment banks that do business in Europe. Here's how banks will be affected[2]. In other news,\u00a0Spotify has reportedly filed for its IPO in secret[3]. And in markets news: Tesla's highly anticipated Model 3 delivery report has traders bracing for the worst[4] JEFFERIES: There's an unorthodox way for traders to protect against big stock market losses[5] BANK OF AMERICA: Stocks could surge 19% this year because investors are the right kind of cautious[6] Blackstone's Byron Wien unveils his big surprises for 2018[7] Here's what you missed over the holidays: The world's hottest investment product is showing signs of slowing down[8]\u00a0-\u00a0It used to be that if you wanted to attract interest in an\u00a0exchange-traded fund[9], all you had to do was launch one. </p><p>After all, as the ETF market exploded over the past decade, investor demand seemed to outpace supply. The best stock market trade of 2017 was one that experts hate[10]\u00a0-\u00a0The best\u00a0stock market[11]\u00a0trade of 2017 doesn't involve a specific stock or sector. It instead relates to price fluctuations in equities \u2014 or in this case, the lack thereof.

Facebook also plans to launch Lasso, its standalone video app, in markets where TikTok isn't aready big. So Lasso isn't coming to India anytime soon!<br/><br/>\"I think that it's not only one of the more interesting new phenomena and products that are growing. But in terms of the geopolitical implications of what they're doing, I think it is quite interesting. I think we have time to learn and understand and get ahead of the trend. It is growing, but they're spending a huge amount of money promoting it. What we've found is that their retention is actually not that strong after they stop advertising. So the space is still fairly nascent, and there's time for us to kind of figure out what we want to do here.\" - Mark Zuckerberg<br/><br/>Zuckerberg acknowledged that TikTok is the only non-American company to dominate the global internet landscape, which has been a bunch of American tech companies.<br/><br/>\"It's starting to do well in the US, especially with young folks. It's growing really quickly in India. I think it's past Instagram now in India in terms of scale. So yeah, it's a very interesting phenomenon.\" - Mark Zuckerberg<br/><br/>\"Big push\" for encryption on messaging apps: Zuckerberg revealed two things regarding encryption: a greater push towards encryption across Facebook's messaging apps, and a more consultative approach to the process. He acknowledged that \"law enforcement, obviously, is not going to be psyched about that\", but added, \"we think it's the right thing to protect people's privacy more, so we'll go defend that when the time is right.\"<br/><br/>Zuckerberg had indicated this at F8 2019, where he had declared that \"the future is private\", and this future is based on six principles, one of which is encryption. This could simply mean that Facebook wants to make Messenger end-to-end encrypted. At F8, he had said that he wants to achieve the private future the way it has built WhatsApp - starting with a secure private messaging service with end-to-end encryption, and build more ways to interact privately within that.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that these meetings were held in July 2019, when debate around law enforcement agencies' access to originator information was intensifying in the Madras High Court, and WhatsApp's general counsel, Brian Hennessey attended one of the hearings.<br/><br/>On Libra launch and other payments services: Zuckerberg said Facebook wants to make is as easy for people to send money as a photo or other content, stating that \"but we want to work with traditional currencies\".<br/><br/>\"So we have a test going in India. We're working in Mexico and a bunch of other countries to have this rolled out broadly. The hope is to get that rolled out in a lot of places with existing currencies before the end of this year.\" - Mark Zuckerberg<br/><br/>The intention behind Libra is to try to stand up a new kind of digital money, that can work globally, and is stable, Zuckerberg said. \"We've led that the thinking and development on it so far, but the idea is to do this as an independent association, which is what we announced with about 27 other companies. By the time it launches, we expect we'll have 100 or more companies as part of it.\"<br/><br/>Zuckerberg said that Facebook is going to take a more consultative approach, when it comes to socially important such as Libra, acknowledging that finance is heavily regulated, and important issues such as terrorist financing and money laundering have to be dealt with.<br/><br/>On attending hearings around the world:<br/><br/>\"So I mean, the reality on the hearings thing is, I'm not going to go to every single hearing around the world. A lot of different people want to do that. When the issues came up last year around Cambridge Analytica, I did hearings in the US. I did hearings in the EU. It just doesn't really make sense for me to go to hearings in every single country that wants to have me show up and, frankly, doesn't have jurisdiction to demand that.\" - Mark Zuckerberg<br/><br/>Hon'ble IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Cambridge Analytica in 2018 (L) --&gt; Leaked audio of Hon'ble Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2019 (R). #GandhiAt150 m/RZdQ44ifrG</p><p>- Anuj Srivas (@AnujSrivas) October 2, 2019<br/><br/>On the calls for breaking up Facebook: Zuckerberg said that if Elizabeth Warren gets elected president, he bets that \"we will have a legal challenge\" and \"I would bet that we will win the legal challenge\". That \"still sucks\" for Facebook because it wouldn't want to have a major lawsuit against its own government, he said. Even though he would prefer that Facebook work with their government, \"But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\"<br/><br/>Breaking up big tech won't reduce election interference, but makes it \"more likely because companies can't coordinate and work together\" and also makes hate speech more likely.<br/><br/>\"It's why Twitter can't do as good of a job as we can. I mean, they face, qualitatively, the same types of issues. But they can't put in the investment. But they can't put in the investment. Our investment on safety is bigger than the whole revenue of their company.\" - Mark Zuckerberg<br/><br/>Although Zuckerberg said there are real issues, he thinks anti-trust remedies are not going to solve them. At the same time, if Facebook doesn't help address those issues and help put together a regulatory framework, \"people are just going to keep on getting angrier and angrier\".<br/><br/>On reports about mental and emotional abuse experienced by content moderation contract workers: Zuckerberg said that Facebook works with outside firms to scale up. \"Facebook wants to make sure that the moderators are very much part of the family and are treated dwell, and have the same kind of support the employees would have,\" he added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0049773099</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X69-C211-DXMP-K4RC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1041\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 3, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Sort of.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Wednesday, The Washington Post reported that the social network was in negotiations with the Federal Trade Commission over fines relating to the company's misuse of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Around the same time, Facebookmade it public that it was setting aside between $3 billion and $5 billion for the fine. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  In Silicon Valley and Washington circles, the news kicked off an informal parlor game of ''Guess That Fine,'' with some speculating that even the high end of Facebook's public estimate would be little more than a slap on the wrist.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  What does a good, meaningful fine actually look like? Would it need to wipe out one quarter's revenue (roughly $15 billion)? Is a fine meaningless unless it's recurring (penalties for every quarter or year since Facebooklast settled with the F.T.C. for violating user privacy in 2011)?</p><p>  At the core of these hypothetical arguments is the large question of not only how to regulate Facebookbut of how to conceptualize an entity that operates largely without meaningful competitors and collects troves of information on more than two billion human beings. Facebook-- alongside Big Tech counterparts of Google and Amazon-- is operating at a vast scale. As such, any meaningful attempts to hold the company accountable should be equally disruptive, to borrow a Silicon Valley term of art. That the F.T.C. is negotiating what appears to be a trivial fine, suggests that the organization isn't just deferential to Facebook, but that it doesn't truly understand the company's power.</p><p>  ''We don't have a good regulatory framework [for Facebook] because this kind of scale and impact is unprecedented. And our ideas for remedies, things like fines, are based on an outdated view of how markets work,'' the Glitch C.E.O. and longtime developer, Anil Dash, told me.</p><p>  ''The F.T.C. is based on the premise of markets where consumers have choice,'' Mr. Dash continued. ''As long as their remedies are conceived of within that outdated framework, it will remain structurally impossible for them to hold any major platform accountable in any meaningful way.''</p><p>  Don't believe the critics? Then just ask the market. As BuzzFeed News pointed out on Wednesday, in just one hour of after-hours trading after signaling its impending $3 billion to $5 billion fine, Facebook's market capitalization increased by $40 billion.</p><p>  [As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel's limited-run newsletter to explore what's at stake and what you can do about it.]</p><p>  Which means that most fines likely to be considered by the F.T.C. might amount to what Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, described to me as ''a parking ticket and a news release.''</p><p>  Some with insider experience disagree. A former F.T.C. consumer protection official told me Thursday that if the numbers they'd heard around the fine are real, ''they might not be transformative to the bottom line'' but would be ''symbolic of the gravity.'' Similarly, they believed the organization could add requirements that ''change the way Facebookhandles and shares data. I'd be very surprised if Facebookdidn't continue in the same general lines of business, but operating with more restrictions,'' they said.</p><p>  David Carroll, a professor at the New School, who took legal action against Cambridge Analytica in the United Kingdom, agreed that, ''no fine would be adequate for a monopoly. Advertisers, users, and investors do not register the fines in their economic activity. [They're] still buying, using investing. It causes no material harm to Facebook. It's just bad PR.''</p><p>  What does he have in mind? ''Seizure of servers, criminal penalties against corporate directors and Stop Data Processing orders would actually be painful penalties,'' he argued. Or, even more intense, ''force Facebookto delete its user data and models and start from scratch under rigorous collection restrictions.\"</p><p>  Of course, Facebookis not likely to see anything resembling Mr. Carroll's proposals anytime soon; most ideas would likely be dismissed as wildly radical. And certainly without precedent.</p><p>  And yet the scope of Facebook's recent privacy scandals in the last two years has little precedent either. A quick, partial rundown:</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 A security flaw that potentially exposed the public and private photos of as many as 6.8 million users on its platform to developers (the company told the told European regulators almost two months after discovering the bug and waited almost three months before disclosing publicly).</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 A separate ''bug'' that exposed up to 30 million users' personal information in late September. Among the information exposed: emails and phone numbers, and profile information including recent search history, gender and location.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 An admission that the company \"unintentionally uploaded\" the email contacts of 1.5 million new Facebookusers since May 2016.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 And, of course, the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data from tens of millions of users was misappropriated and shared to be used for profiling for political campaigning</p><p>  ''Everyone is thinking backward about a fine for what they did wrong,'' Jason Kint, the chief executive of the trade group Digital Content Next, told me. He argued that the F.T.C.'s framework is out of date and should instead reflect the more progressive industry standard for tech giants of ''aligning data usage with consumer expectations.'' Under that model, Mr. Kint suggests the F.T.C. consider something similar to the German government's February decision to restrict Facebook's data gathering (specifically the ability for Facebookto collect and combine third-party data account advertising profiles).</p><p>  Should the F.T.C. go with the expected wrist-slap of a fine, it'll be flatly ignoring a broader sense of mounting frustration over user privacy and the monolithic nature of Big Tech.</p><p>  ''It's very clear that people are waking up and they want something to be done,'' Mr. Stoller said. ''What's happening with Facebookis that, after years of not paying attention, people are turning to the F.T.C. and saying, 'You're the cops, we need you to finally police.' In that way, it's less a Facebook crisis than it is an F.T.C. crisis.''</p><p>  Of course, the most likely scenario suggests that a $3 billion to $5 billion fine would be far from a crisis for either party, allowing both to save face while solemnly pronouncing that justice has been served. The former F.T.C. official countered that notion, suggesting the F.T.C. ''will be thoughtful and reasonable and take steps that are likely to change Facebook's behavior. ''</p><p>  But they also acknowledged that a ruling most likely won't satisfy the harshest critics. ''They're not going to be vengeful. People who are angry and hurt may be disappointed. People who want to see change while still using these services -- they may be better served.''</p><p>  The only potential crisis then seems reserved for us, the users. If the regulators fail to meet the moment they'll have wasted a rare opportunity for real accountability. Worse yet, quietly prompting Facebookto write a check for an amount it's already safely ferreted away will be an admission that regulators are out of ideas when it comes to the company's unprecedented power and reach.</p><p>  Follow @privacyproject on Twitter and The New York Times Opinion Section on Facebookand Instagram.</p><p>  Charlie Warzel, a New York Times Opinion writer at large, covers technology, media, politics and online extremism.

That's one of the major conclusions in anew reportissued by AI Now, a research group home to employees from tech companies like Microsoft and Google and affiliated with New York University. The report examines the social challenges of AI and algorithmic systems, homing in on what researchers call 'the accountability gap as this technology is integrated 'across core social domains. They put forwardten recommendations, including calling for government regulation of facial recognition (something Microsoft president Brad Smith also advocated forthis week) and 'truth-in-advertising laws for AI products, so that companies can't simply trade on the reputation of the technology to sell their services. </p><p>Big tech companies have found themselves in an AI gold rush, charging into a broad range of markets from recruitment to healthcare to sell their services. But, as AI Now co-founder Meredith Whittaker, leader of Google's Open Research Group, tellsThe Verge,'a lot of their claims about benefit and utility are not backed by publicly accessible scientific evidence. Whittaker gives the example of IBM's Watson system, which, during trial diagnoses at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, gave 'unsafe and incorrect treatment recommendations, according toleaked internal documents. 'The claims that their marketing department had made about their technology's near-magical properties were never substantiated by peer-reviewed research, says Whittaker. 2018 has been a year of 'cascading scandals for AI The authors of AI Now's report say this incident is just one of a number of 'cascading scandals involving AI and algorithmic systems deployed by governments and big tech companies in 2018. Others range from accusations that Facebookhelped facilitate genocidein Myanmar, to the revelation that Google's is helping to build AI tools for drones for the military as part ofProject Maven, and theCambridge Analytica scandal. In all these cases there has been public outcry as well as internal dissent in Silicon Valley's most valuable companies. The year saw Google employeesquittingover the company's Pentagon contracts, Microsoft employeespressuring the companyto stop working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), andemployee walkoutsfrom Google, Uber, eBay, and Airbnb protesting issues involving sexual harassment. Whittaker says these protests, supported by labor alliances and research initiatives like AI Now's own, have become 'an unexpected and gratifying force for public accountability. Photo by John Moore/Getty ImagesThis year saw widespread protests against the use of AI, including Google's involvement in building drone surveillance technology. But the report is clear: the public needs more. The danger to civic justice is especially clear when it comes to the adoption of automated decision systems (ADS) by the government. These include algorithms used for calculating prison sentences and allotting medical aid. Usually, say the report's authors, software is introduced into these domains with the purpose of cutting costs and increasing efficiency. But that result is often systems making decisions that cannot be explained or appealed. AI Now's report cites a number of examples, including that ofTammy Dobbs, an Arkansas resident with cerebral palsy who had her Medicaid-provided home care cut from 56 hours to 32 hours a week without explanation. Legal Aid successfully sued the State of Arkansas and the algorithmic allocation system was judged to be unconstitutional. Whittaker and fellow AI Now co-founder Kate Crawford, a researcher at Microsoft, say the integration of ADS into government services has outpaced our ability to audit these systems. But, they say, there are concrete steps that can be taken to remedy this. These include requiring technology vendors which sell services to the government to waive trade secrecy protections, thereby allowing researchers to better examine their algorithms. 'If we want public accountability we have to be able to audit this technology. 'You have to be able to say, \u2018you've been cut off from Medicaid, here's why,' and you can't do that with black box systems says Crawford. 'If we want public accountability we have to be able to audit this technology. Another area where action is needed immediately, say the pair, is the use of facial recognition and affect recognition. The former is increasingly being used by police forces, in China, the US, and Europe. Amazon's Rekognition software, for example, has been deployed by police inOrlando and Washington County, even though tests have shown that the software can perform differently across different races. In a test where Rekognition was used toidentify members of Congressit had an error rate of 39 percent for non-white members compared to only five percent for white members. And for affect recognition, where companies claim technology can scan someone's face and read their character and even intent, AI Now's authors say companies are often peddling pseudoscience. Despite these challenges, though, Whittaker and Crawford say that 2018 has shown that when the problems of AI accountability and bias are brought to light, tech employees, lawmakers, and the public are willing to act rather than acquiesce. With regards to the algorithmic scandals incubated by Silicon Valley's biggest companies, Crawford says: 'Their \u2018move fast and break things' ideology has broken a lot of things that are pretty dear to us and right now we have to start thinking about the public interest. Says Whittaker: 'What you're seeing is people waking up to the contradictions between the cyber-utopian tech rhetoric and the reality of the implications of these technologies as they're used in everyday life.

As a result we are instinctively reluctant to trust something so personal into the hands of the government for fear that if, due to a failure of state capacity, this information is compromised, it will cause us irremediable harm. If biometrics are going to be the key to our digital identities, there is an apprehension that criminal elements who figure out how to get their hands on them will be able to steal our identity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At present, fingerprints and iris scans are the government's biometrics of choice. They are, both individually and in combination, capable of uniquely identifying us from the rest of humanity. While there have been claims that all it takes to capture your fingerprints is the application of Fevicol on your fingers, it is hard to conceive of situations in which someone can actually apply that glue on your hands without your knowledge. These biometrics therefore have an inherent, non-trivial barrier to collection that is an effective defence against ambient capture.</p><p>Even though the government may have chosen to limit itself to fingerprints and iris, these are, by no means, the only biometric markers that are being used to identify you. At least one of the other biometric currently in use is more pervasive and infinitely more worrying.</p><p>Last week Google announced the launch of Google Lens, a product that integrates the smartphone camera with Google's core search functionality-allowing the company's proven expertise in text and web search to extend to photos and videos. It works with Google Assistant so that when you look at something through your camera, the artificial intelligence infers what it is you might want to know about it.</p><p>For instance, if you are at a historical landmark, all you need to do is point your phone in its general direction and Lens will cross reference your location with its analysis of the image and provide you with detailed historical information about what you are looking from its data banks. Thanks to this ability to dynamically parse images in a way that has, so far been reserved for text, Lens allows us to interact with the physical world far more intuitively than before.</p><p>It should not come as a surprise to anyone that Google has this sort of technology at its command.</p><p>We've known for a while that all the big tech giants have been focussed on improving their image recognition technology. We have witnessed the results of these endeavours ourselves as the hundreds of images we've stored in the cloud have more recently begun to arrange themselves by category and miraculously compose themselves into short videos around algorithmically curated topics. Just as image search algorithms have begun to get increasingly accurate-capable of tagging images sometimes even better than humans can.</p><p>In all of this, the primary focus has been to identify the people in these images. Social media companies have long understood the advantage of accurate facial recognition-the more skilful they get at identifying friends and acquaintances within images, the better is their ability to understand the web of our social connections. By uploading a decade's worth of personal images onto sharing websites, we have provided them ample data with which to train algorithms in facial identification. We've seen how these algorithms have improved over the years with the many connections that our social networks have miraculously generated for us.</p><p>In the context of personal privacy, all of this is actually a cause for considerable concern. Unlike iris and fingerprint data, your face is always visible, and easily captured-often without your knowing it. Given the ever expanding network of cameras and mobile devices that surround us, facial recognition exposes us to the significant risk of active surveillance. If Google Lens is all it is cracked up to be, that risk may just have doubled as we now have in play, accurate mobile technology capable of providing workable, real-time facial recognition in still and moving images.</p><p>Facial recognition is, at best, superficially regulated. We have next to no information as to how these technologies are being developed within technology companies-but we do get a glimpse of how rapidly they are advancing when we notice that the algorithms are now capable of identifying us from our baby pictures, with facial hair or under costume makeup.</p><p>If we worry that the use of biometrics exposes us to persistent surveillance I would argue that facial recognition poses the greatest threat, far more than iris or fingerprints ever could. It is imperative that we understand the full extent of this risk and take steps to protect ourselves adequately.</p><p>Rahul Matthan is a partner at Trilegal.

What is more intangible is the effect this long drawn-out crisis will have on corporate behaviour and corporate reputation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For many years I have witnessed and represented excellent companies delivering on what they see as their mandate for their various stakeholders - quality products and services for their customers, jobs for their employees, revenue for their suppliers - all under the old Friedman Doctrine that the overarching purpose of their business is to make a profit and pay dividends to their shareholders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In doing so, many also acted responsibly in their communities, giving back where they saw local needs and where it benefited their reputations. They sponsored large scale sporting, cultural and other public events to achieve visibility and goodwill, while devising corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes to fulfil their role as good corporate citizens. Reputation management became a central part of their ethos and self-interest, and surveys tracked in league tables how well they were doing.</p><p>Following the financial crisis, good corporate ethics, culture and governance became an industry in its own right. A plethora of educational initiatives emerged to teach business executives and even directors how to make right choices and protect themselves from weak stewardship. Companies and brands began clawing back their reputations, aiming to rebuild badly damaged trust with their customers, staff and the entire body politic.</p><p>Whole divisions in large companies were devoted to risk management, including reputation risk, to embed prudence into corporate culture, prevent hubris and guide decision making.</p><p>Regulation increased and central banks the world over stretched their tentacles deep into the financial services sector. The banking industry itself set about addressing its own behaviours in establishing the Irish Banking Culture Board. The EU levied huge fines on companies for breaches of their contracts with consumers. As climate change moved up the public agenda, fund managers developed new environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment products and companies began publishing Sustainability Reports. Philanthropy went big time.</p><p>So, over the past number of years, the corporate sector has increasingly had to become more socially conscious, valuing and measuring its societal impact while still being true to its now revised fundamental purpose - to drive stakeholder value, not just shareholder value.</p><p>Then this emergency comes along, putting a whole new speed and power behind what was a gentle trend. A gale-force wind is blowing on corporate reputations and I do not see how companies can believe it will not impact their whole raison d'\u00eatre and behaviour in the months and years ahead.</p><p>Look at the seeds of it right now - small companies are responding to a national need on a pro bono basis, pivoting production to supply PPE at cost while employee morale in so doing has never been higher.</p><p>Companies and wages are being kept afloat by the State while shareholders sit quietly. Airplanes fly half-way across the world to bring supplies in and natives home whose flights have been crowd funded. Some companies have declared a pause in dividends, some have not. The letter of the law has had to be put aside - some landlords are giving rent breaks on leases, knowing that it is counterproductive to drive the commercial tenant out of business. The insurance industry was elbowed by the minister for finance. Some companies have pledged to pay their small suppliers early to keep their cash flow flowing.</p><p>Corporate relationships have never been more important - Bono goes lobbying the South Korean president, Apple's Tim Cook and Chinese companies to source supplies for our health service. Companies which try to take advantage of state support are outed quickly as greedy opportunists.</p><p>Commentators are predicting a shift away from capitalism and globalisation that will continue. Growing your food locally, manufacturing locally, suddenly looks like a way to manage your own future <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.risk.No\">www.risk.No</url> one knows how this will pan out, for companies or for consumers who keep them in business. Will there be a kind of \"post-war\" mood, this time of self-imposed austerity and purchasing prudence and a reversion to old-time values? There is also, of course, the possibility of seeing a 'Roaring 20s' euphoric mentality whereby the survivors decide life is too short and unpredictable, so will spend, spend, spend. In effect we could see two divergent trends for consumer behaviour depending on values and savings.</p><p>Whatever happens, the shock has been so great and so prolonged the only certainty is that life will be different, and different also for the private sector, including all commercial entities.</p><p>Will companies, as true citizens, focus on building up their social instead of their share capital? Employee health and protection became the top priority in recent weeks and will mean a total reconfiguration of workspaces and working hours mandated as we return to the office or the factory. Will employee welfare continue as a priority beyond the vaccine? I think there will be more social polarisation between security in employment and insecure, gig economy, zerohours type jobs. This could be the biggest societal expectation of business. I believe there will be a continuing priority on workers' economic health - possibly even a universal wage - in the new world.</p><p>While capital will naturally only go where it has a reasonable expectation of a return, will investors be forced to rethink what is proper for successful companies in an era of depression? Will we tolerate Big Pharma profiteering on a vaccine? Who will pay the State's bill for the new 'socialism'? How will directors and boards justify extreme levels of executive remuneration and still manage to retain the permission to operate under a social contract, retaining trust and enjoying a corporate reputation which underpins value? Will companies have to become almost philanthropic in some of their behaviours and expectations of return? I believe corporate activism will grow as companies need to be seen to solve, not just sell. Expectations of respon-sible behaviour by companies will multiply.</p><p>Is there the possibility of a new corporate altruism as companies adapt? Will companies build and wield their \"soft power\" in attracting and motivating staff and customers? How will the brands which held our hands in the crisis, hold and build on that emotional connection with their customers as we recover? Are there new businesses that will address new shifts, funded not by the traditional markets but by \"the crowd\" if their service is seen to \"do good\" and have \"purpose\"? We have witnessed and admired genuine public service and public servants in recent weeks. Will the era of State-owned commercial entities come back into vogue by necessity? Will the State be forced to step in and own hotels (remember Great Southern?), to own airlines, food companies (remember Irish Sugar and Erin Foods?), or shops and insurance companies? We might well be facing an era of \"de-privatisation\". Certainly, as costs increase and recession bites, the need to communicate, to explain, to justify and most of all, like doctors, firstly to \"do no harm\", will be right up there among the top commandments.</p><p>Notwithstanding how we all relied on Big Tech in the last few weeks (I have even mastered Zoom), I believe there has been a huge acceleration in humanising and socialising corporate life.</p><p>Companies will build great reputations not just because they have great products and services but also because they are known to truly care and show it through action.</p><p>It will, literally, pay to be kind.</p><p>Ita Gibney is executive chairman of Gibney Communications, one of Ireland's leading public relations companies.</p><p/><p>This crisis has put a whole new speed and power behind what was a gentle trend</p><p/><p>Will firms now start to focus on building social capital instead of share capital?</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Pitching in: Gary Foley MD of Future Plastics which joined the national effort by making PPE face masks at its plant in Navan</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-159864780</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YW6-7XT1-DYTY-C12C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 11, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Contracts Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzY0RTZFMzE0RjkwNDdFQUI5M0U5N0ZFMjYyREMyQzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Lease Agreements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZEOEU3MEJBRUQ2NDNFNzhFRjAxRTk1OEU1QjY2QTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjg1NzgyRDNGQzg1NEM5Nzg3RjA3MEUwRTA1QUI0NkU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000406</classCode><className>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XKJ</classCode><className>BUSINESS ETHICS &amp;

You probably know about AmazonBasics for batteries or cleaning rags, but there are<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">several</url> hundred<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">thousand</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Amazon</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">products</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">under</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">dozens</url> of brand<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">names</url>. The company is finding ways to subtly nudge people to buy the in-house merchandise.</p><p>This isn\u2019t so different from what stores like Walmart and Target do to get you to buy their own brands of cereal or T-shirts. The question is whether internet powerhouses are so different from retail stores that when they play by the old rules, it\u2019s not OK anymore.</p><p>The difference between Amazon and Walmart, which sells far more merchandise, is how much more Amazon knows about what happens on its digital shelves than its competitors do.</p><p>Walmart doesn\u2019t usually know that you\u2019ve been in the store three times this month to browse for mattresses, but Amazon knows when you\u2019re hunting around \u2014 on its own site and often elsewhere online, too.</p><p>Amazon might also watch what you\u2019re buying from other companies and then <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">use that information</url> to more effectively make a competing version. The Wall Street Journal reported that it did this with car-trunk organizers, for example, in apparent violation of the company\u2019s rules.</p><p>Amazon\u2019s site has become so popular that it\u2019s now the starting point for the biggest chunk of Americans shopping online. This enables it to have the best information on what products sell or don\u2019t online and at what prices. Amazon\u2019s search box is a window into our desires, and many product manufacturers believe they can\u2019t exist without selling on Amazon.</p><p>That data and heft arm Amazon with the information it needs to more effectively steer people to its products.</p><p>Amazon is not a normal store. It\u2019s the infinite Everything Store with infinite information. That\u2019s why the company\u2019s marketing pitches for its own products are unlike any other form of advertising.</p><p>Those concerns are one reason regulators in the European Union are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">preparing to charge Amazon with violating antitrust rules</url>, and why the authorities in the United States are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">investigating</url> whether Amazon is abusing its power by giving itself a leg up over other companies that sell their products on its site.</p><p>To Amazon and its defenders, this feels unfair. Amazon is just doing what stores have always done \u2014 just better.</p><p>This question about whether technology superpowers can play fair by the tried and true rules is a central legal, economic and ethical confrontation of our age.</p><p>It\u2019s not just about whether Google is too big to be dethroned or Facebook is bad at policing speech on its online hangout. The conundrum is whether these giants are so mighty that they can\u2019t operate fairly and effectively.</p><p>Curtailing facial recognition doesn\u2019t require Congress</p><p>When Amazon flexes its power, part two.</p><p>Amazon said Wednesday that it was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">putting a one-year pause</url> on letting the police use its facial recognition technology, called Rekognition, and said it hoped that would give Congress time to pass regulations on its use.</p><p>Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">didn\u2019t give a reason</url>, but the move comes amid nationwide protests against biased policing. Civil liberties advocates have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">concerned</url> that facial recognition misidentifies people with darker skin, is prone to overuse, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">reinforces bias</url> against black people.</p><p>Amazon had previously refused requests from privacy advocates to monitor whether law enforcement agencies were using Rekognition ethically.</p><p>IBM, which is a smaller supplier of facial recognition technology, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">said</url> this week that it would stop its work on the technology.</p><p>This is another side of the power of these tech companies. A handful of big companies are so influential that their decisions alone can put the brakes on a divisive technology.</p><p>At times, this may lead to decisions you support. If you worry that facial recognition software is dangerous, then you\u2019re probably relieved that Amazon, IBM and other companies have decided that their software is too flawed or prone to misuse to be used by the police without legal guidelines. (There will, of course, always be other companies that sell facial recognition.)</p><p>Even when I write about the dangers of powerful technology gatekeepers, I know we sometimes want them to flex their power.</p><p>I want Google and Facebook to push accurate information about the coronavirus to the people hanging out inside their digital walls. When Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">cracks down on selling Nazi-themed books</url>, it becomes much harder for people to buy them.</p><p>We might agree with these companies\u2019 decisions or not. Either way, choices by a few big companies can affect millions of people, and the companies can move faster than governments can write laws. Their rules effectively serve as public policy.</p><p>We need to figure out how to thread the needle between demanding that companies use their power, and being worried when they do.</p><p>Before we go \u2026</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Not a lot of love for Facebook: Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign plans to urge its supporters to demand that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Facebook strengthen its rules</url> against misinformation and hold politicians accountable for harmful comments, my colleague <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Cecilia Kang</url> writes.

Names such as Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook have made news but Jeff Bezos has created a cult today - both loved and feared for its pervasiveness.<br/>The Amazon Journey<br/>The aura of Amazon comes from the remarkable influence it has over our lives, given its ever-expanding list of products and services. The company has steadily surpassed Alphabet when measured by market cap, making it the world's second-most-valuable publicly traded business behind Apple. Revenues from e-commerce grew seven-fold from an already massive base of $34.2 billion. Yet, this accounts for only 40% of the overall e-commerce market in the US, according to\u00a0eMarketer, and globally even less, leaving plenty of head room for growth.<br/>However, more than its size or revenue, Amazon needs to be measured in terms of importance to modern life and its ability to shape the US economy and subsequently, the global economy.<br/>The Seattle-based company that started as a modest online bookseller in 1994 has grown into an internet giant that plays in nearly every sector. Take hardware for example. Amazon pioneered e-readers, before stumbling through a failed phone launch in 2014. And then came up with a novel home assistant, Alexa that is turning Apple's Siri into a legacy technology and giving Google a tough competition in artificial intelligence (AI), despite criticisms on the ongoing privacy and security threats.<br/>Read more: Voice Assistants Can Be Hacked with Laser Rays<br/>Daniel Raff, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania mentions in an article on CNN Business, while Amazon began with books, they understood that the Internet was a source of information for them about who their customers were, and their customers' search behavior and price sensitivity.\"<br/>Since 2005, that information has been concentrated around Amazon's most powerful innovation: The Prime membership, which incentivizes consumers to consolidate as many of their purchases as possible within Amazon's ecosystem.<br/>Kantar Consulting estimates that in late 2017, about 57 million households in the US paid $99 a year - and $119, as of this April - for access to exclusive television content, discounts at Whole Foods and of course, fast free shipping. Rather than aggregating through a central hub, Amazon has built its own distributed empire of warehouses. Staffed by armies of workers and, more recently, robots, this network allows the company to deliver packages nearly as quickly as a shopper clicks the \"Buy\" button. Amazon now uses more than 100,000 robots in warehouses around the world to help move and organize products,\u00a0according toThe New York Times.<br/>Between 2006 and 2018, Amazon spent billions for running more than 100 fulfillment centers. But that investment has paid off well. This new infrastructure not only helped Amazon raise its profit margin between 5% and 14% over that same period (by shortening travel distances and reducing the number of transfer points) but also helped the company enjoy the full confidence of Wall Street while never paying a dividend to shareholders, the news site mentions.<br/>What's more, after deflating brick-and-mortar retail, Amazon has become a brick-and-mortar retailer itself with its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods, its physical bookstores, and its foray into cashier-less convenience store.<br/>Since 2014, Amazon's operating profit has steadily improved, from $2.2 billion to around $4 billion for the next two years, to more than $12 billion in 2018, with analysts projecting $13.4 billion in 2019, as per The Wall Street estimates. Since 2015, the company's robust quarterly profits have been boosted by its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), a data hosting business that generated $6 billion in revenue last quarter.<br/>Read more: For AWS, Artificial Intelligence Is The Way Forward<br/>Recently, Amazon has set its sights on online advertising, stealing market share\u00a0and ad dollars\u00a0from Google and Facebook and is conquering every market it sets eyes on. As a result, investors who have held the stock since 2010 have seen their investment increase in value dramatically, making it one of the largest companies in the world by market cap.<br/>\"The number one thing that has made us successful, by far, is obsessive-compulsive focus on the customer as opposed to obsession over the competitor,\" Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos is now the world's richest man, with a net worth of $160.2 billion, according to Forbes, said at a recent global event in September.<br/>The company has added pretty much everything to the basket, shaping the US economy and spreading its wings across every territory it plans to capture, as New York Times columnist Paul Krugman sees these traits as code for \"monopoly power.\"<br/>Customer Obsession<br/>One obvious secret to Amazon's success is its relentless adherence to a set of principles that has proven to work across many different industries. The principles were articulated mostly by Bezos himself and are enforced in internal meetings.<br/>Perhaps the most important core principle is putting the customer first. Everything else is secondary. Amazon employees have spoken about how they've been in meetings where revenue-generating ideas were rejected because they would be bad for customers.<br/>Another key ingredient at Amazon is relentless experimentation and learning from failure. When the company's Fire Phone flopped, it doubled down on hardware and found success in the Echo line of devices, personal assistant and Fire TV streaming products. Now, it unveils a huge mix of 15-20 odd new products every fall. Many continue to fail, but the one or two hits to justify the exercise.<br/>The company's $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods looked like a puzzling misstep at the time, but two years later Amazon is reportedly pushing full speed ahead into launching its own grocery stores, taking the lessons learned and data gathered from Whole Foods shoppers to direct its expansion.<br/>An obsession with customers and a willingness to experiment then make it a key differentiator from its competition. At a time when other companies talk about innovation but iterate on one or two hit products, Amazon actually walks the talk. As Techtree reports, \"Jeff Bezos appears undeterred in his quest to make Amazon the\u00a0voice of everything\u00a0and move on to making it the 'everything of everything'. Even in a country such as India, the company has delivered\u00a0something of a Super App\u00a0that straddles everything from online retail to booking tickets. The company is now reportedly moving over to create connected lighting.<br/>(Read the full story: Now, Amazon is Seeking to Spread the Light)<br/>To tame the ever-fickle consumers, Amazon's methodology including low prices, endless choice of products, a continuous stream of novel products and exceptional handling of logistics - will continue to make it a fearsome competitor in the next decade.<br/>Abusive Dominance<br/>However, Amazon's customer obsession has a dark side, believe experts. Time and again, employees find themselves in overworking condition and high stress level to help reach their customer goals. Take for example, the free delivery and same day delivery concepts which Amazon has designed for its restless customer.<br/>The tech major also views suppliers, independent sellers and other partners useful in so far as they help the company get customers what they want, when they want it, at the right price.<br/>Amazon has a seller strategy that competes directly with the vendors whose products it sells. In other words, the way it treats sellers on the Amazon Marketplace, pits third-party merchants against one another in a brutal pricing war. This is exacerbated by often ineffective enforcement against counterfeit products and against shady seller tactics.<br/>There are also complains on how Amazon has used its cloud computing arm - AWS - to copy and integrate software that other tech\u00a0companies\u00a0pioneered. It has given an edge to its own services by making them more convenient to use, burying rival offerings and bundling discounts to make its products less expensive, says a report in Business Standard.<br/>Even so, smaller rivals say they have little choice but to work with Amazon. Given the company's broad reach with customers, start-ups often agree to its restrictions on promoting their own products and voluntarily share client and product information with it. For the privilege of selling through AWS, the start-ups pay a cut of their sales back to Amazon.<br/>By lifting other people's innovations, trying to poach their engineers and profiting off what they made, Amazon is choking off the growth of would-be competitors and forcing them to reorient how they do business, the report mentions.<br/>All of this has fueled scrutiny of Amazon and whether it is abusing its market dominance and engaging in anticompetitive behavior. The company's tactics have led several rivals to discuss bringing antitrust complaints against it. And regulators and lawmakers are examining its clout in the industry.<br/>The more powerful Amazon gets, the more complaints about these practices will grow, putting the company at odds with antitrust regulators and lawmakers who are aggressively starting to take on Big Tech.<br/>Yet despite various use and abuse of its power, consumers largely trust Amazon with everything from their personal information and buying habits to the literal conversations they have in their own homes. According to a study conducted by The Verge with consulting firm Reticle Research, Amazon is the most-liked and trusted technology brand by a wide margin. One likely explanation there is that the company has a strong relationship with its customers, thanks in part to its zealous commitment to low prices and a seemingly never-ending quest to make modern life more convenient.<br/>Read more: What Makes Amazon the Most Trusted Brand<br/>All Pervasive Amazon<br/>With the exception of China, where Alibaba is the sole marketplace, the penetration rate of Amazon continues to grow worldwide. Amazon's ecommerce dominance in North America and most of Europe is phenomenal. In the US, 50% of all e-commerce sales happen through Amazon, with its closest competitor, eBay, pulling in just 6%. And after hitting growth plateaus in western markets, it has turned its eyes toward countries like India, where it sees a huge potential for growth and profit in the country's e-commerce market that is worth $100 billion by 2022, as estimated by a Nasscom-PwC study.<br/>The growth trajectory is not smooth though in a market where e-commerce represents just 3% of total consumption. Amazon keeps facing steep competition from Walmart-owned Flipkart - the domestic ecommerce powerhouse. Amazon's efforts are complicated by new e-commerce regulations in India, which prohibit foreign companies from selling their own products like the Amazon Echo or the Kindle, and from negotiating exclusive deals with sellers.<br/>To keep up with the ecommerce major has tapped the local market by expanding its brick-and-mortar presence while also customizing its e-commerce experience for consumers. Both Amazon and Flipkart have faced charges of abusing their large market position. The All India Online Vendors Association, which represents over 3,500 online sellers, accused Amazon in the Competition Commission of India court of using their dominant market position to favor certain sellers and engage in predatory pricing.<br/>Meanwhile, Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance is preparing to roll up small merchants into a large online platform and take on Amazon and Flipkart. And because Reliance is a wholly Indian company, the same restrictions against selling products where a company holds more than a 25% stake don't apply.<br/>But Amazon is not shaken. It has already set up its biggest office building in Hyderabad, signaling the centerpiece of the e-commerce giant's growing investment in the country.<br/>Indeed, Amazon is giving its competitors a tough time. Amazon is starting to claim its share of the cake to both Google and Facebook, and is promoting advertising within its own platform. Today this segment only represents 4.3% of Amazon's revenues, but the statistics predict a great growth to the point of being able to be done in 2020. In fact, Facebook has officially recognized Amazon's advertising business as a threat. Google, on its part has begun to compete directly with Amazon in France, turning Google Shopping into a marketplace. It seems likely that Google will expand this model to other markets in an attempt to stop Bezos' global domination.<br/>Considering that Jeff Bezos is already building his own airports, looks like Amazon is nowhere close to taking a pause in its journey towards becoming everything for everybody!<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CXOTDY-M-412167</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CXOTDY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XS3-0GP1-DYDW-7560-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410850</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2201\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CXOToday.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 17, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

When big tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon and Apple sneeze, the entire market catches a cold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Five titans of tech -- Apple, Amazon, Google owner Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook -- made up nearly a quarter of the market value of the entire S&amp;P 500 as of the end of February. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook, Google and Amazon have fallen sharply because of the possibility of more government regulations on the tech sector. That's dragged down the whole market. </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has fallen 5% in the past two weeks and the Nasdaq has tumbled 6%. Even the Dow, which has Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Cisco and Intel as members, is down more than 3%.</p><p>But the market rebounded Thursday, led by solid gains in Facebook, Google and Apple.</p><p>Should investors be worried that there's too much tech in the major indexes? Perhaps. </p><p>Concentration in one sector is fine when things are humming along nicely. Tech stocks surged last year and continued to do so at the start of 2018 thanks to strong earnings. </p><p>But now that tech is under pressure, there are some concerns that it could bring about another major market crash like 2000 -- the last time that the sector made up such a large percentage of the overall market. </p><p>Still, many analysts and investment strategists think the negative headlines about Facebook's data privacy issues and President Trump's tough talk regarding Amazon will soon fade and that investors will instead focus on upcoming earnings reports.</p><p>Big Tech companies will report first quarter results in April and early May and the numbers are expected to be very good. </p><p>Wall Street is forecasting a more than 30% jump in earnings for Facebook from last year for example. Google's earnings are expected to rise more than 20%.</p><p>The market also has a way of adjusting so that different companies wind up taking the lead while others falter. To that end, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has recently moved ahead of Facebook in market value, bumping Facebook to sixth place. </p><p>The rest of the top companies in the S&amp;P 500 are a much more diverse group. JPMorgan Chase, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Exxon Mobil and Bank of America round out the top ten. No tech to be found here.</p><p>And the Dow, which weights its components by price instead of market value, isn't particularly tech heavy either. </p><p>The top five Dow stocks are Boeing, Goldman Sachs, UnitedHealth, 3M and Home Depot. That should help insulate it from any future problems in the sector.</p><p>It's also worth noting that the top tech stocks don't make up nearly as big of a percentage of the global stock market as they have in the past, meaning that a tech slump shouldn't drag down markets in Europe or Asia either.</p><p>Roman Kouzmenko, executive director for MSCI Core Equity Research, wrote in a blog post Thursday, that the five biggest techs accounted for just 8% of the MSCI World Index at the end of February. </p><p>That's actually the lowest concentration for the market's top five stocks in five decades. There was one point in the mid-1970s when just TWO stocks dominated the market. </p><p>\"The combined weight of IBM and AT&amp;T alone in 1976 was greater than the weight of all the top five stocks today,\" Kouzmenko wrote. </p><p>In other words, the might of 2018's top techs pale in comparison to Big Blue and Ma Bell in their heydays.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

When big tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon and Apple sneeze, the entire market catches a cold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Five titans of tech -- Apple, Amazon, Google owner Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook -- made up nearly a quarter of the market value of the entire S&amp;P 500 as of the end of February.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook, Google and Amazon have fallen sharply because of the possibility of more government regulations on the tech sector. That's dragged down the whole market.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has fallen 5% in the past two weeks and the Nasdaq has tumbled 6%. Even the Dow, which has Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Cisco and Intel as members, is down more than 3%.</p><p>But the market rebounded Thursday, led by solid gains in Facebook, Google and Apple.</p><p>Should investors be worried that there's too much tech in the major indexes? Perhaps.</p><p>Concentration in one sector is fine when things are humming along nicely. Tech stocks surged last year and continued to do so at the start of 2018 thanks to strong earnings.</p><p>But now that tech is under pressure, there are some concerns that it could bring about another major market crash like 2000 -- the last time that the sector made up such a large percentage of the overall market.</p><p>Still, many analysts and investment strategists think the negative headlines about Facebook's data privacy issues and President Trump's tough talk regarding Amazon will soon fade and that investors will instead focus on upcoming earnings reports.</p><p/><p>Big Tech companies will report first quarter results in April and early May and the numbers are expected to be very good.</p><p>Wall Street is forecasting a more than 30% jump in earnings for Facebook from last year for example. Google's earnings are expected to rise more than 20%.</p><p>The market also has a way of adjusting so that different companies wind up taking the lead while others falter. To that end, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has recently moved ahead of Facebook in market value, bumping Facebook to sixth place.</p><p>The rest of the top companies in the S&amp;P 500 are a much more diverse group. JPMorgan Chase, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Exxon Mobil and Bank of America round out the top ten. No tech to be found here.</p><p>And the Dow, which weights its components by price instead of market value, isn't particularly tech heavy either.</p><p>The top five Dow stocks are Boeing, Goldman Sachs, UnitedHealth, 3M and Home Depot. That should help insulate it from any future problems in the sector.</p><p>It's also worth noting that the top tech stocks don't make up nearly as big of a percentage of the global stock market as they have in the past, meaning that a tech slump shouldn't drag down markets in Europe or Asia either.</p><p>Roman Kouzmenko, executive director for MSCI Core Equity Research, wrote in a blog post Thursday that the five biggest techs accounted for just 8% of the MSCI World Index at the end of February.</p><p>That's actually the lowest concentration for the market's top five stocks in five decades. There was one point in the mid-1970s when just TWO stocks dominated the market.</p><p>\"The combined weight of IBM and AT&amp;T alone in 1976 was greater than the weight of all the top five stocks today,\" Kouzmenko wrote.</p><p>In other words, the might of 2018's top techs pales in comparison to Big Blue and Ma Bell in their heydays.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180329tech-stocks-apple-amazon-facebook-google-microsoft1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S0B-DS31-DY60-K08X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"540\"/><timeReceived>1:14 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 29, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

But prominent medical organizations are warning that patient data-sharing with apps could facilitate invasions of privacy \u2014 and they are fighting the change. The battle stems from landmark medical information-sharing rules that the federal government is now working to complete. The rules will for the first time require health providers to send medical information to third-party apps, like Apple's Health Records, after a patient has authorized the data exchange. </p><p>The regulations, proposed this year by the Department of Health and Human Services, are intended to make it easier for people to see their medical records, manage their illnesses and understand their treatment choices. Yet groups including the American Medical Association[1] and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists[2] warned regulators in May that people who authorized consumer apps to retrieve their medical records could open themselves up to serious data abuses. Federal privacy protections, which limit how health providers and insurers may use and share medical records, no longer apply once patients transfer their data to consumer apps. The American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association[3] and other groups said they had recently met with health regulators to push for changes to the rules. Without federal restrictions in place, the groups argued, consumer apps would be free to share or sell sensitive details like a patient's prescription drug history. And some warned that the spread of such personal medical information could lead to higher insurance rates or job discrimination. 'Patients simply may not realize that their genetic, reproductive health, substance abuse disorder, mental health information can be used in ways that could ultimately limit their access to health insurance, life insurance or even be disclosed to their employers,' said Dr. Jesse M. Ehrenfeld[4], an anesthesiologist who is the chair of the American Medical Association's board. 'Patient privacy can't be retrieved once it's lost.' AdvertisingEnabling people to use third-party consumer apps to easily retrieve their medical data would be a milestone in patient rights. Dr. Don Rucke[5]r, the federal health department's national coordinator for health information technology, said that allowing people convenient access to their medical data would help them better manage their health, seek second opinions and understand medical costs. He said the idea was to treat medicine as a consumer service, so people can shop for doctors and insurers on their smartphones as easily as they pay bills, check bus schedules or buy plane tickets. 'This is major, major, major,' he said. 'The provision of health care will be brought into the app economy and, through that, to a much, much higher degree of patient control.' The new rules are emerging just as Amazon[6], Apple[7], Google[8] and Microsoft[9] are racing to capitalize on health data and capture a bigger slice of the health care market[10]. Opening the floodgates on patient records now, Rucker said, could help tech giants and small app makers alike develop novel consumer health products. The regulations are part of a government effort to push health providers[11] to use and share electronic health records[12]. Regulators have long hoped that centralizing medical data online would let doctors get a fuller, more accurate picture of patient health and help people make more informed medical choices, with the promise of better health outcomes.In reality, digital health records have been cumbersome for many physicians[13]to use and difficult[14] for many patients to retrieve. AdvertisingAmericans have had the right to obtain copies of their medical records[15] since 2000 under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA. But many health providers still send medical records by fax or require patients to pick up paper or DVD copies of their files. The new regulations are intended to banish such bureaucratic hurdles. Rucker said it was self-serving for physicians and hospitals, which may benefit financially from keeping patients and their data captive, to play up privacy concerns. 'All we're saying is that patients have a right to choose as opposed to the right being denied them by the forces of paternalism,' he said.The Department of Health and Human Services proposed two new data-sharing rules this year to carry out provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act, a 2016 law designed to speed medical innovation.Rucker's office developed the one[16] that would allow patients to send their electronic medical information, including treatment pricing, directly to apps from their health providers. It will require vendors of electronic health records to adopt software known as application programming interfaces, or APIs. Once the software is in place, Rucker said, patients will be able to use smartphone apps 'in an Uber-like fashion' to get their medical data.To foster such data-sharing, a coalition of tech giants[17] \u2014 including Amazon, Google and Microsoft \u2014 has committed to using common standards[18] to categorize and format health information. Microsoft, for instance, has developed cloud services to help health providers, insurers and health record vendors make data available to patients.'What that lets an individual consumer do is to connect an app or service of their own choice into their health care records and pull down data about their historical lab tests, about their medical problems or condition, about medication prescription,' said Josh Mandel, chief architect for Microsoft Healthcare.The other proposed rule[19], developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, would require Medicare and Medicaid plans, and plans participating in the federal health insurance marketplace, to adopt APIs so people could use third-party apps to get their insurance claims and benefit information. The regulations are expected to become final this year. Health providers and health record vendors will have two years to comply with the API requirements. Electronic health record vendors that impede data-sharing \u2014 a practice called 'information blocking' \u2014 could be fined up to $1 million per violation. Doctors accused of information blocking could be subject to federal investigation.Most Read Business Stories Brett Meeks, vice president of policy and legal for the Center for Medical Interoperability[20], a nonprofit that works to advance data sharing among health care technologies, said it would be better for regulators to help foster a trustworthy data-sharing platform before requiring doctors to entrust patients' medical records to consumer tech platforms. 'Facebook, Google and others are currently under scrutiny for being poor stewards of consumer data,' he said. 'Why would you carte blanche hand them your health data on top of it so they could do whatever they want with it?' Physicians' organizations and others said the rules failed to give people granular control over their data. They added that the regulations could require them to share patients' sensitive medical or financial information with apps and insurers against their better judgment.The current protocols for exchanging patients' data, for instance, would let people use consumer apps to get different types of information, like their prescription drug history. But it is an all-or-nothing choice. People who authorized an app to collect their medication lists would not be able to stop it from retrieving specific data \u2014 like the names of HIV or cancer drugs \u2014 they might prefer to keep private. AdvertisingRucker said that current information-sharing standards could not accommodate granular data controls and that privacy concerns needed to be balanced against the benefits of improved patient access to their medical information. In any case, he said, many people are comfortable liberally sharing personal health details \u2014 enabling, say, fitness apps to collect their heart rate data \u2014 that are not covered by federal protections. Patients, he said, have the right to make similar choices about which apps to entrust with their medical data.'A lot of this actually will be enforced by people picking apps they trust from brand names they trust in exactly the same way that people don't let their banking data and their financial data just go out randomly,' he said. Apple's Health Records app, for instance, lets people send a subset of their medical data directly to their iPhones from more than 300 health care centers. Apple said it did not have access to that information because it was encrypted and stored locally on people's personal devices.But even proponents of the new regulations are calling for basic privacy and security rules for tech platforms that collect and use people's medical information. 'The moment our data goes into a consumer health tech solution, we have no rights,' said Andrea Downing, a data rights advocate[21] for people with hereditary cancers. 'Without meaningful protections or transparency on how data is shared, it could be used by a recruiter to deny us jobs,' or by an insurer to deny coverage.

Why?In the 1990s, Microsoft\u200a\u2014\u200athe tech giant of its time\u200a\u2014\u200awas trying to parlay its dominance in computer operating systems into dominance in the new area of web browsing. The federal government sued Microsoft for violating anti-monopoly laws and eventually reached a settlement. </p><p>The government's antitrust case against Microsofthelped[2]clear[3]a path for Internet companies like Google and Facebook to emerge. The story demonstrates why promoting competition is so important: it allows new, groundbreaking companies to grow and thrive\u200a\u2014\u200awhich pushes everyone in the marketplace to offer better products and services.Aren't we all glad that now we have the option of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing?There is alot to unpack here. First, while the government wanted to break-up Microsoft, it didn't end up being able to do it. Yes, there was traditional antitrust enforcement (in the US and also notably in Europe) but that isn't a breakup. Second, did it help clear a path for Google and Facebook? That is, had the antitrust enforcement not proceeded, would they have been in trouble? Well, of course, we know that we didn't need to break Microsoft up. But it is very unclear what the other antitrust actions did with regard to Google and Facebook. What was Microsoft doing that might have stopped them? I don't really know. Maybe something to do with Java? Maybe they would have thwarted Google at the level of Internet Explorer or blocked Chrome? But it is far from clear. We know that in competing with Google, the well-resourced Microsoft was unable to really get inroads on them despite actually having a search engine that was likely equivalent or just a shade worse. Compare that to other inferior Microsoft products that actually succeeded and the case is really hard to parse. Third, how crippled is Microsoft exactly? Today, when I looked at company valuations, Facebook is at $481b, Amazon is at $793b, Google is at $799b and Microsoft is . checks notes .. at $840b (even higher than Apple at $810b). So Microsoft is the world's most valuable company. It wasn't just the tech giant of the 1990s but it is the tech giant of today! Fourth, it is pretty odd that Warren is targeting Facebook, Google and Amazon when Microsoft is out there as the tech giant. Moreover, why is Microsoft the tech giant? It is pretty obvious why: it has a virtual monopoly over PC operating systems and PC Enterprise software? You know, the things it actually had a monopoly over in the 1990s when it was pursued by the DOJ. Now we don't perceive it as so bad as there are alternatives to both of these but, in general, Microsoft does not appear to be operating like a company facing brutal competition. I am not saying it should be broken up. I'm just saying that I don't understand where Warren is drawing some line. I mean if those other companies are bad for democracy because of their power, why doesn't that apply to larger ones? Now all this is not to say that there aren't significant reasons to look at all of these companies for antitrust reasons. For instance, I think we should get innovative in dealing with Facebook[4] and I am worried about Google's vertical integration that favours some of its own services over potential competitors. In some cases, divestiture may be the only remedy. And I think the weaker antitrust pushes in the US should be strengthened considerably. When you delve into a few more of the details, Warren wants a vertical breakup of at least Google and Amazon \u2014 by isolating their 'platform utilities' (something that I couldn't see a definition of). For Amazon, this is odd since it opened up its marketplace to third parties when it didn't have to for regulatory reasons. For Google, it is unclear how breaking up its ad exchange in places will lead to greater competition in search. But when someone comes out and says these three companies should be broken up and suggests some, in some cases, just punative ways of doing that, we have to take it seriously. Crazy policies have been proposed recently in the US and UK that no one thought could ever be done and then they just happen. I worried that a breakup rather than an innovative approach to opening up to enhance technology competition will end up being another of those things that ends up hurting many without any benefit to anyone.

The guy was headhunted by the bank to be a gamechanger (GC), and had been gifted the ability to do almost whatever he wanted when it came to innovation, change, ideas and so on and so forth. He had taken that message home big time - go big or go home - and had started to cut a swathe through the stodgy old banking culture. </p><p>But the CEO had called him into the office to query his method. CEO: I hear you've got some great ideas, but my team is complaining. Care to share? GC (Game Changer): Sure. You hired me to turn this big bank into a Big Tech Bank. That's what I'm doing. CEO: But this idea of integrating developers with risk managers, treasury and compliance people. You cannot be serious? GC: I'm totally serious. Your boring old bankers should learn Python. Everything is code. All of your people should be able to code. CEO: You cannot be serious? GC: I just said I was. You told me that technology is the future of the bank, the bank has to be digital, you're backing me all the way, blah, blah, blah. If you believe that, then this is the way to go. CEO: But why should bankers learn to code? GC: I'll ask you a different way. Why do you think Stripe is worth $20 billion (as of October 2018)? CEO: I don't know. You tell me. GC: It's just seven lines of code but it's beautiful code. CEO: I don't get it. GC: Well the reason why FinTech is such a hot space is that you've got all these young engineers who can see how to do what you do with code. So, they're writing beautiful code. Adyen is also great code. It's an art. CEO: Code is art? GC: Of course, it is. CEO: So, what does that mean? GC: It means that if your code is clunky-bumpy-chunky-wunky, then no one will use it. Engineers are designing the new world of trade and they look at code, and ask if they could write something as good as that. If not, they will use it and they will look for the best version of it. Then they stumble upon one or two companies that are offering code, like Stripe and Adyen, and because they are engineers they will strip it down and realise that it is beautiful code. It's art. Then they will use it and anything else doesn't stand a cat's whiskers  CEO: So, what should we do? GC: Well, you told me to come in here and stir up the shack, so that's what I'm doing. All of your guys see product, process, service and such like from a bankers' view. It's all about the regulation, risk and compliance of those structures. Whereas what they should be seeing now is how to code those products, processes and services so that the regulation, risk and compliance is in the code, but the customer doesn't see it. It should just be simple, easy, beautiful and artistic. CEO: And that's what you think these upstarts like Stripe and Adyen do? GC: You got it, you got it. YOU GOT IT!!! CEO: No, I don't get it. What I get is that you're saying we should be coders first and bankers second? GC: Well, kind of. CEO: But we're a bank. We're bankers first and code comes way down the list. GC: But how will you ever create great art? CEO: We're not artists. We're risk managers. GC: You don't get it, do you? CEO: I don't think I do. Now, have a good day. Miss Simmonds will deal with your severance package. The conclusion of my conversation with the GC is that the FinTech community are dealing with an internet commerce world of Amazons, Facebooks, Ubers and more who all see code as art. The more intuitive, simple and beautiful the way the code is presented in an Open API form, the more likely it is to be used. That's why he mentioned Adyen and Stripe, and not PayPal and Braintree. However, bankers begin with banking products and services and mentality. They see the banking process first and then ask the coders to code the banking processes. No wonder banks struggle with innovation. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-FSCB1079981561707340784251762500141</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCB-6705</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFD-JGP1-F03R-N3H6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><timeReceived>7:35 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Finanser by Chris Skinner</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 28, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Grid</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fintech</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Digital Bank</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLPN</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT HISTORY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

In the aftermath of such incidents, some       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5d1aa98-3cc9-11e7-821a-6027b8a20f23\">decry</url> the sorry state of cybersecurity and insist that if only tech firms, with their wealth of resources and technical expertise, were allowed to go after the perpetrators of these attacks, they would do a much better job of stopping the damage and deterring other perpetrators than the slow, plodding, over-worked, under-resourced, jurisdiction-bound law-enforcement agencies.</p><p><br/>Which raises a question: Beyond the standard set of protective tools-encryption, firewalls, anti-virus software, intrusion-detection systems, two-factor authentication-should companies be allowed to go outside the boundaries of their own networks and crash the servers that are attacking them, or delete data that has been stolen from them off their adversaries' machines? The answer of most companies and cybersecurity experts is no. But that doesn't stop a vocal minority-usually researchers at libertarian think tanks and lawyers concerned by how restrictive anti-hacking regulations have become-from suggesting otherwise.<br/><br/>The notion that companies should be given more leeway to engage in \"active defense\"-the cybersecurity euphemism for offense-has been quelled for years by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the United States and its counterparts in other countries, which effectively make it illegal for people to access computer systems that don't belong to them without permission from the owners. But some lawmakers feel the need to carve out an exception to that blanket ban for companies that infiltrate external networks in the name of self-defense. In March, Georgia Representative Tom Graves <url normalizedValue=\"https://tomgraves.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398726\">proposed</url> the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (ACDC), which       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://tomgraves.house.gov/uploadedfiles/discussion_draft_active_cyber_defense_certainty_act_2.0_rep._tom_graves_ga-14.pdf\">would change</url> the CFAA so that it would not apply to victims of cyberattacks who accessed attackers' networks to \"gather information in order to establish attribution of criminal activity to share with law enforcement\" or to \"disrupt continued unauthorized activity against the victim's own network.\"<br/>Stewart Baker, a former homeland security assistant secretary under George W. Bush and a current partner at the D.C. law firm Steptoe &amp; Johnson, would also like to see companies be allowed to hack back. A sharp critic of the current state of law enforcement's cybersecurity efforts, Baker has for years been trying to make it easier for private firms to be able to pursue their adversaries in cyberspace. \"For a company to go to the FBI and say 'I've been hacked, can you find the hacker,' it's like going to a university town's police force and saying, 'Somebody stole my bike'-you're lucky if they don't laugh at you,\" Baker says. \"The government is completely consumed just trying to take care of its own data and tracking its own attackers. It doesn't have the resources to help firms and probably never will.\"<br/>While it may seem irrelevant to liken denial-of-service attacks and data breaches to bicycle theft, most discussions of cybersecurity laws and policies, for better or for worse, happen by analogy to the physical world. And to Baker, there are two other important ways of thinking about the importance of legislation like the ACDC. One is the widely accepted principle of an organization's right to defend its own interests. The other is the idea that there are many tiers of people with different responsibilities in between ordinary civilians and actual law enforcement. \"In the physical world,\" Baker explains, \"there are all kinds of people in the middle, between innocent civilians and full-on military and law-enforcement protective personnel, who have intermediary authorities-bounty hunters, private investigators, mall cops-all people who have some additional authority and who ought to be able to use that additional authority because it was deemed necessary not to rely exclusively on the police. If that's where we end up in the physical world, why would we not welcome the idea of having intermediate authorities between ordinary civilians hunkering down behind their firewalls and the police?\"<br/>Baker's advocacy is driven not by industry interests so much as his own deeply held belief that government officials and law enforcement agencies are incapable of addressing online threats themselves. \"It's like the NRA saying, 'When seconds count, the police are only minutes away,' except the police are days away when you're talking about cybercrime,\" Baker says.<br/>Baker and Representative Graves, though, are in the minority. At least among most people willing to speak on the record, legalizing proactive responses to cybercrime is a wildly unpopular idea. Its critics range from law enforcement officials who       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/fbi-director-tells-companies-not-to-hack-back-against-hackers\">worry</url> it will lead to confusion in investigating cyberattacks, to lawyers who caution that such activity might well violate foreign laws even if permitted by the U.S., to security advocates who fear it will merely serve as a vehicle for more attacks and greater chaos, particularly if victims incorrectly identify who is attacking them, or even invent or stage fake attacks from adversaries as an excuse for hacking back.<br/>And if big tech firms are clamoring for the opportunity to go after their attackers more aggressively, they are certainly not doing so publicly. \"I haven't heard from particular companies that they want to have that activity authorized,\" says Greg Nojeim, the director of the Freedom, Security and Technology Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a think tank. At least a couple companies have actively gone after adversaries in the past-Google       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/world/asia/15diplo.html?ref=technology\">reportedly breached a computer in Taiwan</url> in 2010 while investigating attacks on its customers, and in 2014 the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-30/fbi-probes-if-banks-hacked-back-as-firms-mull-offensives\">FBI examined whether some banks had hired hackers to crash servers being used by Iran</url>-but known examples are few and, on the whole, relatively tame.<br/>\"I think a lot of companies would be hesitant to take the position,\" Nojeim continued, \"that it's okay to engage in active-defense measures on somebody else's network out of fear that their own networks would then become targets.\" He, like many critics of broad hacking-back legalization, makes certain distinctions for defensive activities he views as less problematic. For instance, he is comfortable with \"beaconing,\" the practice of attaching code to sensitive files that will report back to their owners the IP address of machines they are copied onto when stolen.<br/>Others argue that the crucial limits relate to who is permitted to hack back rather than what they are permitted to do. For instance, Jeremy Rabkin, a law professor at George Mason University, has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/hacking-back-without-cracking-0\">advocated</url> for putting together a list of cybersecurity firms vetted by the U.S. government, so that companies could hire an approved hack-back vendor to go after its online adversaries. \"A lot of things can go wrong when people start mucking around in your files and your systems,\" Rabkin told me. \"You have to trust these people; you have to be sure that they're not going to steal stuff or tip off other people.\" In his estimation, there are only a handful of firms-highly regarded security companies and contractors that have longstanding relationships with the U.S. government and ex-military personnel, mostly-that can be trusted to pull this off.<br/>Michael Chertoff, the former secretary of homeland security under George W. Bush who now runs his own consulting firm, argues that any private firm's activities should be not only government-approved but also closely coordinated with U.S. officials. \"If it's not done at the direction of the government, then you get into something which is not terribly different from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/12/world/europe/russia-hacker-evgeniy-bogachev.html\">what the Russians do</url>,\" he says, referring to the Russian government's reliance on intelligence gathered by criminals, allowing it to benefit from crimes without accepting responsibility for them. Ultimately, Chertoff doesn't think that countering cyberattacks is something the government needs help with or for which it is interested in outsourcing its responsibilities.<br/>Patrick Lin, a professor of philosophy at California Polytechnic State University, has finer-grained logistical concerns about any legislation that opens up the possibility of hacking back, regardless of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ethics.calpoly.edu/hackingback.pdf\">what one makes of whether it is justified or not</url>. \"It is much too premature to allow for hacking back, even if the practice isn't immoral,\" Lin says. \"At minimum, there needs to be a clear process to authorize or post-hoc review cyber counterattacks to ensure they're justified, including penalties for irresponsible attacks. That oversight infrastructure hasn't even been sketched out.\" (There's little discussion of such oversight in the current discussion draft of the ACDC, though under the most recent draft, released in May, companies would be required to report their activities to the FBI.)<br/>At a moment when most people are concerned with trying to reduce online attacks, proposals to legalize hacking back and encourage more cyber conflict are a bit of an oddity. They rely on the implicit assumption that offense is the best defense, even though offense and defense have, in general, looked entirely different from each other online: The tools for defending computers like encryption and network monitoring bear almost no resemblance to the tools used to attack computers, such as botnets and phishing. Legalizing hacking back would conflate those two domains and, in doing so, likely make it that much harder to distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys online.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLANT-hackingbackactivedefense533679</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLANT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PGC-8T91-DYY9-J44T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">368376</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

In recent years, seasteading - an amalgam of sea and homesteading - has captured the attention of some keen to create their own precincts of corporate sovereignty. An associated movement advocates charter cities, free to set their own rules. </p><p>As academics Andrew Phillips and JC Sharman write in their new book, Outsourcing Empire, \"the seasteading movement constitutes one of the most radical attempts to revive a form of corporate sovereignty within the international system\". </p><p>Thiel and co see these floating cities as a way to escape the \"predation and corruption of national government\". They are designed to nourish entrepreneurs and guarantee personal freedom better than existing governments. </p><p>A very different version of corporate sovereignty is described in Phillips and Sharman's book, a comparative history of the 19th-century company-states such as the English and Dutch East India companies and the Hudson's Bay Company. From the 17th to the 20th century, the company-states, rather than sovereign states, drove European expansion. But unlike the seasteads, they worked hand in glove with governments rather than challenging them. </p><p>Even so, Phillips, associate professor of international relations and strategy at the University of Queensland, sees some intriguing connections.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley has been an absolute catalyst for people coming up with ideas that look like the company-states,\" he says. </p><p>\"Peter Thiel is obsessed with this movement to set up basically independent corporate cities. Milton Friedman's grandson is involved.</p><p>\"You've got these incredibly powerful people in big tech who are saying: 'We're not public utilities so we shouldn't be submitted to public regulation.' And they're fantasising about what this would actually look like in practice.\"</p><p>               Beyond the pale            </p><p>In one sense it's the company-state model taken to its logical extreme but, as Phillips and Sharman point out, the problem for seasteads is that today anything \"even vaguely evocative of company-states is now beyond the pale\". </p><p>\"Corporate sovereignty was once commonplace,\" they write. \"But now its afterlife can be found not in the real world of international politics but in the libertarian venture capitalists' fantasies ... this in itself is a tribute to the current universal dominance of the sovereign state, and to the unimaginability of a return to the not so distant world where companies were once kings.\"</p><p>Phillips's research background is in the way international systems change over history. His first book grew out of September 11 when he was in New York State. </p><p>\"It sort of dramatised that for me and so my first book looked at military innovation and religious fanaticism as catalysts of change throughout history,\" he says. </p><p>Colleague JC (Jason) Sharman is the Sir Patrick Sheehy professor of international relations at the University of Cambridge, where he is a fellow of King's College. His research focus is   regulation of global finance and international relations of the early modern world.</p><p>Phillips says the history of the company-states resonates with today's debates around the public-private divide: \"What does it mean to be a corporation? What is the legitimate distinction between what governments do and what corporations do? I think there are a lot of contemporary echoes.</p><p>\"Take the big debate over the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, now Alphabet) and the question of whether something like Facebook warrants some kind of governmental regulation. We're not suggesting Twitter and Facebook will ever enjoy anything near the power of the historical company-states. But the current controversies show that the boundaries of the public-private divide that we take for granted are historically contingent, often blurred and always contested.\"</p><p>He says company-states were crucial actors in forming the modern international system, driving the first wave of globalisation. They were the forerunners of the modern multinational corporation, with extensive sovereign powers, armies and navies and practical independence. Some were more powerful than monarchs and they transformed the world through trade in commodities, people and ideas. They were the key mediators linking Europe with the rest of the world, with the right to declare and wage war and the ability to use violence to uphold their monopolies.</p><p>\"It is impossible to see the company-states as merely mercantile concerns,\" the authors argue. They were interested in profit but they were inherently political \u00adactors engaged in diplomacy, fighting wars and governing substan\u00adtial domains. Or as Phillips says: \"Europeans wouldn't have been able to conquer the world without the company states. (Author) Niall Ferguson talks about Western civilisation's killer apps. For me the company-state is clearly one of them.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Outsourcing Empire: How Company-States Made the Modern World (Princeton University Press). </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTOL-d4636f55d35478f9fe5b11b7d9ee0fe9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:602X-KS11-JBPV-K4HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"889\"/><timeReceived>8:03 AM AEDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"464E\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC000539V</classCode><className>CENTURY CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC00023UW</classCode><className>HUDSON'S BAY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>PRINCETON UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>NAICS333994 INDUSTRIAL PROCESS FURNACE &amp;

We need to consider amendments to San Jose's general plan to accelerate housing production.\"</p><p>Liccardo is just the latest San Jose mayor to say the valley's largest city is struggling with the expense of providing routine municipal services to its burgeoning population because housing doesn't pay its own way on city government's books.</p><p>\"We've got to somehow change the balance sheet and the incentives for cities,\" he said.</p><p>\"We cannot continue to see the pattern that we've seen, for example, in a small city (Cupertino) to our west, where a three million-square-foot spaceship campus is built and in that period of time - the five years of construction for that headquarters campus - not a single housing unit was added to that city. That is what is creating our fundamental challenge here today. We have added jobs at a rate six times the rate at which we were adding housing this past half-decade in the Silicon Valley region.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

The project is driven by a wealthy core including the US, EU, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and South Korea, and their leading corporations. The strategic goal is to transpose them into the WTO in order to anchor them within the global trade and investment regime.  A new report (TiSA: Not our Future!)</p><p>  prepared for the IUF by Professor Jane Kelsey of Auckland University reveals the scope of the corporate power grab through a close examination of TiSA's potential impact on workers across the IUF sectors and TiSA's broader implications for the labour movement, society and democratic governance.  The report explains in plain language the meaning and context of TiSA's complex rules and how they are designed to lock in the corporate agenda. TiSA -and 'trade in services' components of other mega-trade deals like the reborn Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP, ex-TPPA) - are, on the one hand, a continuation of long-standing efforts to complete the corporations' unfinished agenda at the WTO by establishing enforceable global rules on public and private services, finance and investment, domestic regulation and government procurement. But the new model 'trade in services' fuses these familiar objectives with the potent force of digitally-based technologies expressed in the rise of Big Tech.  'E-commerce' rules in TiSA are not about online shopping. They are about the control of the algorithms and data flows which are essential to the corporate-driven digitalization of everything, including work. When the WTO rules were established over two decades ago, digital 'high precision' agriculture fed a data stream from cloud computers did not exist. Nor did lab-grown meat and dairy, 3D printed meals, 'smart fishing', Airbnb, Amazon Prime food deliveries, UberEats, and digitally-based worker surveillance technologies.  Under current WTO rules, the products of IUF sectors like food processing and beverage manufacturing, agriculture and fisheries are treated as goods the moment they cross borders. TiSA introduces another layer of rules, under which every current and future task performed by workers in these sectors can be treated as a discrete, stand-alone 'service' to be outsourced to a transnational 'service provider' who is liberated and protected by TiSA's rules. These service providers would not be required to have a physical presence in the countries they operate in, shielding them from regulation and liability.  The same rules would apply to all other manufacturing sectors and to the extractive industries. In the IUF sectors already treated as services - hotels, restaurants, catering - TiSA gives new impetus and encouragement to the ongoing process of outsourcing and casualization.  The report identifies the many ways in which TiSA will deepen the concentration of corporate power over all the IUF sectors and accelerate the fragmentation and precariousness of work in each of those sectors, eroding the capacity of workers to organise and to bargain on a workplace, national and international scale.  TiSA would accelerate a process of digitalized automation potentially resulting in massive job destruction, while its rules would radically reduce the possibility for workers to negotiate the application and impact of these new technologies. At the same time, TiSA's rules on financial services effectively preclude meaningful efforts to regulate the crisis-prone financial sector through new laws or regulations. The volatile, speculative flow of money which increasingly drives food production and the global economy acquires even greater power to disrupt.  Understanding TiSA and similar provisions in the new generation of trade and investment deals is crucial to defeating them. As the report notes, the TiSA negotiations are currently suspended because opposition has made them - for the moment - politically toxic. In the immediate term, the task is to ensure that they are definitively abandoned. Defeating TiSA is both possible and necessary. But in a world where everything is now a 'tradeable service', they will resurface in another guise, just as the investment provisions of the defeated Multilateral Agreement on Investment have regularly resurfaced in the regional and bilateral trade and investment deals. The larger task facing the labour movement and its allies is to unwind the thickening web of trade and investment deals to reclaim the democratic policy space needed to defend worker rights, sustainable livelihoods, public services, the environment and the world's food resources.

Their open, well-lit, 10-car garage was designed by Christine a few years after the couple bought the Spanish-style five-bedroom house during \"the heart of the Great Recession,\" says Ben, 49, of the property purchased at $8.2 million and now estimated to be worth more than $17 million. Of the cars at the house, one of the Rolls-Royces, a bespoke Dawn Black Badge, valued at around $600,000, was personally delivered to him by the brand's CEO, Torsten Muller-Otvos, at Pebble Beach this summer, while the volcanic orange $2 million McLaren PI is one of 375 in the world. \"The six racing cars are off-site,\" Sloss says of the Ford Mustang GT4 and Mustang Boss 302S, among others. \"They live with their respective racing teams\"--including Lesher Motorsports in Salinas, California, and R3 Motorsports in L.A.--\"so that we can use them on the track.\"</p><p>It's no wonder that the \"site reliability czar\"--as Ben is known internally at Google, overseeing a team of 5,000 to keep the search engine well-oiled and running--would get hooked on such complex, high-performance cars as his gaggle of Ferraris. His inventory includes an F355 Spider, a trio of 458 models and the track-only 488 GT3 and 458 Challenge EVO. The latter drove the Slosses (Christine's Instagram handle: because_race_wife) to an endurance-race win at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in October by a \"margin of 30 seconds after 8.5 hours,\" says Ben. He, Christine and a third driver had taken turns driving. Rounding out the Slosses' set are the Ferrari F12tdf (which sells on the secondary market for up to $1.6 million), a LaFerrari coupe (a model was bought recently for $7 million), Aperta (which fetched $10 million at auction) and limited-edition track-only $3 million FXX-K--a surprise birthday gift to Christine from Ben.</p><p>\"When Ferrari offers you something special, you don't say no,\" explains Christine, 50, of their fetish. \"I feel very fortunate and I don't take any of this for granted. I still cry when I see the FXX-K.\" Ben attributes his bond with the brand to his dad: \"I bought my first Ferrari in 2000, a surprise for my father on his 60th birthday. I wanted him to have one and [at the time] I couldn't afford two. Before that, my father would call me every week and we'd talk about whatever was new at the Ferrari of New England dealership.\"</p><p>Benoit Boningue--a former tech exec from the days of Netscape and Palm who went on to found 100/OCT, which produces exotic car events for Silicon Valley enthusiasts--says his favorite among the Sloss autos that he's seen is the LaFerrari coupe: \"This is a car that would be considered by most to be a collector car, and therefore would be put on mothballs in a temperature-regulated garage and never seen in the light of day. But Christine does drive it quite a bit and enjoys it, even taking it to Yosemite.\" (Christine and Ben were both road hogs before they met, having first encountered each other on motorcycles--she on a Suzuki SBV650, he on a Yamaha R1--at Alice's Restaurant, a Woodside, California, hangout that doubles as a motorcycle destination because of the scenic roads leading to it.)</p><p>Ben, who joined Google pre-IPO in 2003, went from buying his father that one car to a succession of different models, but it was a benefit for victims of a May 2012 natural disaster that precipitated the bulk of his collection. \"There was a big earthquake in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, where Ferrari is based, and they built a 599XX EVO to auction off,\" recalls Sloss of the $1.8 million car. \"James Chou, our dealer, called us and I thought some billionaire would snap it up. But we won the car.\" He requested a rendering in the colors of the regional flag. \"It was perfect,\" he says. \"[Now] almost all our Ferraris are yellow, either Giallo Modena or Giallo Tristrato. Many of them have Blu Scozia accenting.\"</p><p>Of the racing scene in the tech world, Ben says, \"There are a handful of people at Google who race, and all of us recognize that this is a fun hobby--there's not a lot of aggression and dirty driving. We're all achievement-focused, and the racing doesn't get to the point where we're going to ruin the work relationship.\" When asked if he's ever discussed his hobby with Sergey Brin or Larry Page, Sloss laughs, \"No, I never have, it's always about work.\" Joshua Schachter, a longtime technical consultant on HBO's Silicon Valley, confirms the same attitude toward racing among techies: \"I don't generally have any business dealings with people I race against.\" As for what it's like being a woman participating in a male-dominated sport, Christine says, \"You have to be very courteous and serious, try not to be too pushed off by other people and stick to your line. Some are gracious drivers, others have race face. I don't let it bother me.\"</p><p>According to Boningue, \"there is a certain bipolar aspect\" to car collecting in Silicon Valley. \"I would say it is a bit taboo, where some big tech companies--though not Google, where Ben works, to my knowledge --actually have directives for their execs not to talk about their car collections. 'Show-off is generally frowned upon. There are a few exceptions: events where [you're] sharing a super-rare car with the public, where kids can see something they never would have otherwise, have an educational aspect.\"</p><p>Ben insists that he and his wife aren't \"really\" collectors. \"We're enthusiasts, and if you marry another enthusiast, you either go bankrupt or run out of garage space. My job is to run out of garage space before we run out of money.\" As for the best collection he's ever seen outside of his own, Ben, who just added a McLaren Senna to the mix, says, \"We've visited Jay Leno's hangars in Los Angeles. Jay's a very bright, very enthusiastic driver with the most amazing collection I've ever seen.\"</p><p>The Race to Make the World's Most Expensive Car</p><p>An appetite for super hypercars grows stronger as a series of more elaborate, harder-to-get models sell out even before they hit the market</p><p>* $1.3M</p><p>FERRARI MONZA SP1 &amp; SP2 T</p><p>Ferrari debuted the Monza one-seater SP1 and two-seater SP2 as retro-inspired throwbacks to the marque's \"en plein air\" sports cars, selling at a starting price of $1.3 million. The 499-unit edition is sold out, just part of the brand's onslaught of one-off limited production cars.</p><p>* $2.25M</p><p>MCLAREN SPEEDTAIL</p><p>All 106 units of McLaren's Speedtails were sold at $2.25 million before the ink on the marketing materials was dry. Tony Joseph, president of McLaren North America, says the Speedtail, along with the Senna, will expand to include 18 new models with hybrid technology by 2025: \"The Speedtail is a unique creation, incorporating bespoke customization, a stateof-the-art petrol-electric hybrid powertrain and the world's first full carbon-fiber and titanium weave bodyshell.\"</p><p>$2.7M</p><p>MERCEDES-AMG PROJECT ONE</p><p>Ron Robertson, of Beverly Hills Mercedes-Benz, says of the brand's hypercar, \"In 2021, there will be 55 coming to the U.S. I sold two [out of the sold-out lot], and had many more clients who wanted one, but the clients were selected by Mercedes-Benz AMG after a very exhausting process. There are many billionaires that did not make the cut.\"</p><p>* $2.7M</p><p>ASTON MARTIN VALKYRIE</p><p>The brand--which has been active of late, introducing a slew of new models (Vantage, DB11 AMR, the forthcoming DBS Superleggera)--sold out all 150 road cars and 25 racetrack-only versions of the Valkyrie.</p><p>BUGATTI DIVO</p><p>\"The idea was to create a one-off opportunity for customers: a perfectly balanced super sports car focusing even more on enhanced driving dynamics,\" says Stephan Winkelmann, president of Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S., of the marque's Divo, all 40 of which have been pre-sold for $5.7 million each. Adds Winkelmann, \"When you invest in a project with very limited units, [it] will lead to a price increase. The fact that the Divo is now the world's most expensive car was never a target, but a mere consequence.\"--J.A.G.</p><p>Please Note: Illustration(s) are not available due to copyright restrictions</p><p>Caption: Ben and Christine Sloss were photographed Oct. 14 at their home in Los Altos Hills, California.</p><p>Caption: Schacter</p><p>Caption: 1 Ben and Christine Sloss in their Los Altos garage containing (from left) a LaFerrari Aperta, LaFerrari coupe, Ferrari 458 Speciale and Ferrari F12tdf. 2 Christine's shoes are custom made by Wicked Addiction in the same yellow and blue livery colors as her Ferrari FXX-K. 3 Ferrari F12tdf's interior. 4 The LaFerrari coupe, one of 500, with butterfly doors open. 5 The custom engine bay of the 458 Ferrari Speciale. \"We went over the top with the carbon fiber,\" says Christine. 6 The Slosses' bespoke Rolls-Royce Dawn Black Badge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-563358739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 563358739</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWG-MWF1-JCBJ-K0KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Prometheus Global Media LLC</copyright><publicationName>Hollywood Reporter</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0018-3660</issn><volume>Vol. 424</volume><issueNumber>No. 36</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 7, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Sloss, Benjamin</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.product\"><classificationItem><className>Automobiles</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Arts and entertainment industries</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Automobiles</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Beliefs, opinions and attitudes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet service providers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Officials and employees</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Purchasing</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>General services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Executive changes &amp;

Drones drive down the costs of surveillance to a worrisomely low level. For example, it wouldn't be surprising if Amazon delivery drones were equipped with cameras for loss prevention. So what would stop law enforcement from asking Amazon for all of its drones' footage in a given neighborhood where there had been a crime?</p><p>Simultaneously, drone technology has the potential to revolutionize delivery, agriculture, photography and possibly disrupt major industries.</p><p>Imagine that you're shopping at Barnes &amp; Noble. You ask for a book that the store does not carry. Rather than send you online, Barnes &amp; Noble flies the book over from another store while you shop or take a coffee break.</p><p>Or imagine that you're a farmer whose livelihood depends on catching crop disease early. You could use drones to fly over thousands of acres in an afternoon to spot problem areas.</p><p>These are exciting uses for drones. But the real innovation will come when companies such as Amazon mix their robotics strategy with their love for open platforms.</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>Recall that the first personal computers did not come to the market until the mid-1970s. Before that, government and industry purchased or leased computer equipment dedicated to a particular purpose such as database management. That's analogous to what Amazon and other companies are doing today.</p><p>Amazon paid nearly $800 million for the robotics firm Kiva Systems for the specific purpose of helping to organize its warehouses. The company is now experimenting with drones for the second task of delivery.</p><p>The real explosion of innovation in computing occurred when devices got into the hands of regular people. Suddenly consumers did not have to wait for IBM or Apple to write every software program they might want to use. Other companies and individuals could also write a \"killer app.\" Much of the software that makes personal computers, tablets and smartphones such an essential part of daily life now have been written by third-party developers.</p><p>As author Jonathan Zittrain points out, it would be hard to name a category of important software -- from word-processing to e-mail -- that some computer hobbyist did not create first at home. Today, popular apps such as Snapchat or Instagram are used by millions of people. Yet, both were created by just two or three people in their 20s.</p><p>There are, of course, problems with apps for robots.</p><p>You do not necessarily want a live-action version of Angry Birds using drones. And who is responsible should someone get hurt by interacting with robots?</p><p>Once companies such as Google, Amazon or Apple create a personal drone that is app-enabled, we will begin to see the true promise of this technology. This is still a ways off. There are certainly many technical, regulatory and social hurdles to overcome. But I would think that within 10 to 15 years, we will see robust, multipurpose robots in the hands of consumers.</p><p>Worried about your kid getting to and from the bus? A drone app lets you follow her there by trailing her phone and returning when she waves. Selling your house? An app on a drone will command it to fly around your property and stitch together a panorama of photos for a virtual tour. Same drone, thousands of possibilities.</p><p>Put another way, the day when Amazon or Apple opens a drone app store is the day when drone innovation takes off. On an open model, the sky is quite literally the limit.</p><p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p><p>Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20131216calo-drones-apps1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B32-58X1-JBPX-X1X7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"637\"/><timeReceived>11:59 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>December 16, 2013 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He is author of the paper, \"Open Robotics.\" Follow him on Twitter: @rcalo</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (CNN) --  Amazon, Apple and Google: All of these big tech companies have announced major robotics initiatives or investments in recent months. Amazon, in particular, managed to capture the public imagination when founder Jeff Bezos outlined a plan to deliver packages by drones. </p><p>As drones become more mainstream, the prospect of excessive surveillance and other dangers loom. Drones drive down the costs of surveillance to a worrisomely low level. For example, it wouldn't be surprising if Amazon delivery drones were equipped with cameras for loss prevention. So what would stop law enforcement from asking Amazon for all of its drones' footage in a given neighborhood where there had been a crime? </p><p>Simultaneously, drone technology has the potential to revolutionize delivery, agriculture, photography and possibly disrupt major industries. </p><p>Imagine that you're shopping at Barnes &amp; Noble. You ask for a book that the store does not carry. Rather than send you online, Barnes &amp; Noble flies the book over from another store while you shop or take a coffee break. </p><p>Or imagine that you're a farmer whose livelihood depends on catching crop disease early. You could use drones to fly over thousands of acres in an afternoon to spot problem areas. </p><p>These are exciting uses for drones. But the real innovation will come when companies such as Amazon mix their robotics strategy with their love for open platforms. </p><p>What does that mean? </p><p>Recall that the first personal computers did not come to the market until the mid-1970s. Before that, government and industry purchased or leased computer equipment dedicated to a particular purpose such as database management. That's analogous to what Amazon and other companies are doing today.</p><p>Amazon paid nearly $800 million for the robotics firm Kiva Systems for the specific purpose of helping to organize its warehouses. The company is now experimenting with drones for the second task of delivery. </p><p>The real explosion of innovation in computing occurred when devices got into the hands of regular people. Suddenly consumers did not have to wait for IBM or Apple to write every software program they might want to use. Other companies and individuals could also write a \"killer app.\" Much of the software that makes personal computers, tablets and smartphones such an essential part of daily life now have been written by third-party developers. </p><p>As author Jonathan Zittrain points out, it would be hard to name a category of important software -- from word-processing to e-mail -- that some computer hobbyist did not create first at home. Today, popular apps such as Snapchat or Instagram are used by millions of people. Yet, both were created by just two or three people in their 20s. </p><p>There are, of course, problems with apps for robots. </p><p>You do not necessarily want a live-action version of Angry Birds using drones. And who is responsible should someone get hurt by interacting with robots? </p><p>Once companies such as Google, Amazon or Apple create a personal drone that is app-enabled, we will begin to see the true promise of this technology. This is still a ways off. There are certainly many technical, regulatory and social hurdles to overcome. But I would think that within 10 to 15 years, we will see robust, multipurpose robots in the hands of consumers. </p><p>Worried about your kid getting to and from the bus? A drone app lets you follow her there by trailing her phone and returning when she waves. Selling your house? An app on a drone will command it to fly around your property and stitch together a panorama of photos for a virtual tour. Same drone, thousands of possibilities.</p><p>Put another way, the day when Amazon or Apple opens a drone app store is the day when drone innovation takes off. On an open model, the sky is quite literally the limit.</p><p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p><p>Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion. </p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ryan Calo. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2013 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Responding to user searches out loud through Google Assistant is not ideal for generating revenue, Schindler suggested. When results are visible, not merely oral, \"you have room for advertising, of course,\" said Schindler, whose company grosses an estimated US$70 billion annually through ads above search results. The Alphabet Inc company declined to elaborate on Schindler's remarks. </p><p>But Google's conundrum is one facing several big tech companies whose users increasingly seek help from voice-enabled speakers and gadgets: how to deliver greater convenience while still generating the ad revenue that traditionally has funded free searches. The question is most acute for Google, which holds the world's biggest search advertising business. So far, consumers generally get a brief answer from virtual assistants without the disturbance of ads. And tech companies have not shown how they would include the \"Sponsored\" or \"Ad\" disclaimers that regulators in the United States and elsewhere require with paid-for search results. One Google Assistant feature already is close to violating disclosure rules, according to five advertising attorneys contacted by Reuters. Google contends it is in compliance. The feature recommends plumbers and other local home service providers without disclosing that the results draw from a curated database mainly composed of companies that joined a Google marketing program. \"It's not a completely clean recommendation,\" said Michelle Cohen, an attorney with expertise in marketing rules at Ifrah Law in Washington, D.C. \"If there's a financial commitment, you're supposed to disclose it.\" Conversing with assistants is routine for millions of people globally, whether on bedside alarm clocks, car audio systems or even high-end headphones. More than 1 billion such devices have Google Assistant, 100 million Amazon.com Inc's Alexa and at least 1 billion Apple Inc's Siri, according to the companies and estimates. Regulators avoid stifling new technologies, said Richard Lawson, partner at Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips and former consumer protection director in Florida's attorney general's office. But he said, authorities will still ask, \"How do you convey meaningful disclosures?\" At the conference, Schindler said ads on Google Assistant would be more \"interesting\" when responses are shown on a nearby screen, like a TV, smartphone, laptop or smart speaker with a display. \"Then we're exactly in the world that we deeply understand,\" Schindler said, with moneymaking options \"very similar\" to traditional search. NEW SEARCH TECHNOLOGIES The Federal Trade Commission, which regulates deceptive business practices in the United States, has long required search engines to inform users in a \"noticeable and understandable\" fashion when results are connected to financial relationships. That is why consumers see \"Ad\" or \"Sponsored\" labels next to the first few Google results on screens. New search services that \"talk\" to consumers are not exempt from \"the long-standing principle of making advertising distinguishable,\" the FTC said in letters to Google and other companies in 2013. Consumers often complain to the commission about potential violations, and it prods companies into changing practices by threatening fines if the issues persist. The FTC has not received complaints about ads on Google Assistant, according to results from a Freedom of Information Act request. And the agency declined to comment on whether it is scrutinizing any virtual assistants, though last year it charged a small search engine for prospective college students that included paid results without warning. GOOGLE'S CHALLENGE Google users have come to expect results from any relevant source on the web, except when using specialized tools like Google News or Google Flights that have a narrowed set of sources. In 2017, Google Assistant adopted a specialty tool, Local Services, which offers only vetted businesses when U.S. users search for domestic help such as plumbers and locksmiths. Results come from a marketing program, known as Google Guarantee, in which members are licensed, insured and clear of legal issues, according to Google. It refunds consumers up to US$2,000 if members botch a job. Membership is free, but businesses need it to buy Local Services search ads from Google. And guaranteed businesses largely do buy those for queries like \"plumber,\" Reuters found. Google gets paid when users contact providers through the ads, which are labeled \"Sponsored\" on Google.com. But when Google Assistant responds to \"plumber\" queries with the same \"Google Guaranteed\" options, the assistant does not offer any disclaimer or further explanation. Google said in a statement that the results are not labeled as ads \"because Google isn't paid for these results\" when delivered on the Assistant rather than Google.com. The advertising attorneys said users should be informed that Google Assistant results, even if not paid for, stem from a filtered database in which many businesses landed because they wanted to buy ads. \"Disclosing 'many of the recommended providers may participate in our referral network'...would be relevant and appropriate,\" said Cohen, the Washington, D.C., attorney. In some cities, Google Assistant includes businesses vetted by partner search services HomeAdvisor and Porch. It does not mention that those services charge some businesses for customer leads. Disclaimers vary in other types of searches, depending on how they are delivered. Google.com answers \"flight to Los Angeles\" with upcoming flights labeled as \"Sponsored,\" and users who click on the label would learn that Google \"may be compensated\" by some of its data sources. But Google Assistant's \"Sponsored\" label does not link to additional information. On smart speakers, the assistant reads only the lowest price without naming an airline. It says nothing about sponsors.

But regulating the technology sector today will be more difficult than regulating any industry in history because of the exponential rate of change, the complexities arising with artificial intelligence and the strong likelihood of unintended consequences that would lead to the stymieing of innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tech giants have been in the news for some scandalous practices in recent months. Their practices run counter to theories of the firm that say companies' short-term profit-driven motives are aligned with their long-term interests of keeping customers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Why would Apple surreptitiously slow down its devices unbeknownst to its users, when there is every expectation it would be found out eventually?

But they, more than other firms, enjoy the benefits of network effects. Once locked into an Apple or Facebook ecosystem, using products associated with these tech giants becomes a matter of habit for billions of customers, who get used to engaging with friends and their social networks using these means. Once network effects take hold, positive externalities make it extraordinarily difficult for consumers to switch providers, thereby earning them loyalty, albeit grudgingly. This makes it easy for tech giants to take their users for granted, and thus delay admitting wrongdoing.</p><p> Also, barriers to entry for new entrants are reinforced. Analysis by a venture firm, NFX, states that network effects account for 70 per cent of the value creation in tech. As such, companies that grow their platforms, despite impropriety (or by withholding alarming news that might scare consumers for as long as possible) are rewarded by sheer market forces in the long run, as opposed to being penalised by the marketplace.</p><p> The short-term, grow-at-all-costs mindset not being incongruent with long-term success creates perverse incentives that drive the \"it's better to seek forgiveness rather than permission\" mantra that virtually all technology companies subscribe to today.</p><p>  If tech giants do not face the discipline of the market when they err, should customers be the ones who force discipline on them?

PHOTO: AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE<br/></p><p>The short-term, grow-at-all-costs mindset not being incongruent with long-term success creates perverse incentives that drive the \"it's better to seek forgiveness rather than permission\" mantra that virtually all technology companies subscribe to today.</p><p> Shouldn't Facebook's terms of service be aligned with Mr Zuckerberg's previous promises? Apparently, you can publicise promises and commitments, but they aren't as legally binding as terms of service that are virtually never read. Ironically, Apple CEO Tim Cook lamented in a January letter to shareholders that the company's selling of discounted batteries as mea culpa for its throttling scandal has hurt sales of new iPhones. If discounted batteries have been driving down iPhone sales now, what about wilfully throttled iPhones driving up iPhone sales during Apple's previous blockbuster quarters? Technology companies can act with impunity because of the carte blanche rights that are afforded to them by their terms of service.</p><p>  Companies should no longer be given free rein with their terms of service.</p><p> But regulating the terms of service of technology companies with a rules-based approach is doomed to fail. Prescriptive approaches will be cleverly bypassed, will not deliver desired outcomes and the regulations could indeed hinder a country's competitiveness. While there are two sides to the regulation debate, the need for transparency in free markets is hard for anyone to challenge - regardless of which side of the debate you sit on.</p><p> One designer, Mr Dima Yarovinsky, calculated the average length of the terms of service of the most popular Internet services to be 11,972 words. If the average person reads 200 words a minute, the terms of service would take a user approximately 60 minutes to read before agreeing to them. It should come as no surprise that a 2017 Deloitte study found that 97 per cent of people within the 18-34 age group agreed to conditions without reading them. Across all age groups, the number stood at 91 per cent. Users click the \"I agree to the terms of service\" button and everyone - the companies included - knows that it is a lie. It's a convenient lie because the company has protected itself, without incurring the user experience friction that would occur had the user actually attempted to read the agreement.</p><p> There should be no free lunch. It is time that onerous or overly broad terms of service incur some sort of economic cost.</p><p>  That hasn't happened because terms of service are hiding in plain sight. This is where market-based regulation needs to come in. A rating agency that rates and reviews the terms of service of companies could achieve this. Companies could be required to list the ratings and reviews they obtain alongside the \"I agree\" button.</p><p>                 Health officials constantly rate the cleanliness of food establishments and mandate the ratings' prominent display; Apple and Google encourage users to rate the apps from developers. Why can't the same be done with terms of service'</p><p> We have already seen that by crowdsourcing employment agreements, tech industry workers in California are strengthening their position and shining the spotlight on binding arbitration clauses in employment agreements that unfairly - but legally - restrict them from achieving judicial remedies for sexual harassment claims. It is clear that rating terms of service would similarly create a situation where companies are forced to trade between unfettered rights over their users and the reputational cost arising from such a demand and the ensuing negative publicity.</p><p> This tension in of itself could help go a long way towards achieving the optimal outcome of ensuring the technology industry acts justly and respectfully towards its users, but at the same time, not compromising or constraining some of the advancements in society that it has helped drive.</p><p>\u00b7 Carlos Fernandes is a technology investor, entrepreneur and former member of the Pro-Enterprise Panel, a private-public panel chaired by the head of Civil Service.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg testifying before lawmakers in Washington last April, over his company's data breach scandal.

The episodes climax featured the Fonz performing a water ski jump over a shark. The series pretty much went downhill from there. Although, I think the series went downhill when Al Molinaro replaced Pat Morita as the proprietor of Mels Drive In, but that\u02dcs one man\u02dcs opinion. That being said, markets and a lot of conditions that affect them have jumped the shark.</p><p><br/><br/>The whole \u0153OH GOD INFLATIONS COMIN AND ITS GONNA BE LIKE GERMANY IN THE 20S\u00a6..AIEEEEEE!!! argument has made the leap. Inflations happened and it sucks. But its far from Weimar Republic style (which was really Germany just hitting the reset button). A gallon of gas used to be $2.50. Now its $4.00. Thats a 60% bump. OK mysterious cabal that manipulates prices\u00a6youve made your point. Take your 60% profit and go buy an island where you can hunt humans. The potential for deflation is way scarier.<br/><br/>The \u0153HOLY CRAP! INTEREST RATES ARE GOING TO GO UP! THE HORROR! THE HORROR! schtick has lost its luster. This time last year, the 10 year Treasury was yielding around 3.30%. Today its around 3.12%. Im no math whiz but thats lower. The five year is at 1.78% which is absolutely useless. It was at 2.09%. Thats almost 15% lower. OK before you start yelling \u0153Nuh uh\u00a6nuh uh..QE2...QE2!! ..granted thats played a big part. But what else helps rates go up? Velocity of which there is none or, at least not much. People have to want it and banks have to want to give it out. Theres more of that then there has been but not enough to make 90 day LIBOR go from 26 basis points to 25%. Now THATS a buttload of velocity.<br/><br/>The \u0153THE STOCK MARKETS RIGGED SO YOU CANT WIN AND ITS PROBABLY OBAMAS FAULT! \u0153victim mentality is old. Stop it and embrace a new day in America. Have you seen your access to markets? For seven bucks you can get two shares of Apple Computer (AAPL) from your iPhone while you drink a latte at the McDonalds of coffee. Wait a second, McDonlads is now the McDonalds of coffee. Before Chuck Schwab and the internet, you had to call a guy at Merrill who called the order room who called the floor trader who walked over to the specialist at his trading post. Markets have been democratized like a Tunisian supermarket. How is that kind of access rigged against you? Sure. There are other forces out there who stuff on a larger scale and if you try to fight the tape they control, they will mop the floor with you. So dont. Do what you know other than an index fund. Dont try to beat Goldmans algorithmic black box. You can make money in the market. You just have to work at it which is why they call it \u0153work.<br/><br/>Right now, a handful of sectors have jumped the shark: energy, precious metals, softs, Jim Rogers. AKA?the Inflation Trade. Investors are doing a crazy new dance called \u0153the Rotation. It involves grooving into consumer staples, healthcare, utilities, anything that pays you to participate (also known as a dividend).<br/><br/>Some of the big pharma names are OK: Lilly (LLY) for deep value, Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT)  (ABT) for dependability. Some of the herd has already bid Kraft (KFT) up a bit. Maybe take a look at Unilever (NYSE:UL)  (UL) or an outlier like B&amp;G Foods (NYSE:BGS)  (BGS). If youre snooping around the big, regulated, electric utilities, Duke (DUK) and Exelon (NYSE:EXC)  (EXC) are always worth the time. Still a bit early to party with the financials. They need to learn how to make money the old fashioned way. However, a few of the asset managers like AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB)  (AB) and Federated (FII) might deserve at least a look. Oh and expect great things from big tech: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)  (INTC) and, yes, even Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  (MSFT) and Cisco (CSCO). Give Apple (AAPL) a rest. Build some new infrastructure. Stop playing with the toys for a bit.<br/><br/>But the scary trade mantra doesnt work anymore. The more real return and hard asset funds the mutual fund companies crank out the better normal, non-commodity linked stuff looks. Time to buy normal and tell the gold hucksters and the slicky boys in the Chicago pits to \u0153Sit On It.<br/><br/>For the latest investing news, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/moneygame\">Money Game</url>.

The latest is Mountain View, the home of Googleand several other big and rapidly growing tech companies. The city's mayor, Lenny Siegel, is proposing to place what's known as the \"Googletax\" on November's city ballot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I call it the perils of prosperity,\" Siegel told me. \"We're blessed with too many good jobs for the housing and transportation we have.\" As Mountain View's biggest employer, Googlebrings about 20,000 employees into the city every working day. But it's not the only contributor to an influx that swells the city's population, nominally about 80,000, to about 125,000 in the daytime -- Microsoft, LinkedIn and Intuit are also major employers. About 2,000 to 3,000 Googleemployees live in Mountain View, Siegel estimates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That has strained the housing and transportation infrastructure of this city in the heart of Silicon Valley to the breaking point. The rents on new apartments run about $5,000 a month. Three-bedroom single-family homes of 1,500 square feet list for nearly $2 million.</p><p>The city has built a modest number of affordable housing units, but not nearly enough, and it suffers from what Siegel calls \"the missing middle: teachers, plumbers, surgical technicians who make too much money to qualify for affordable housing, but not enough to live here.\" Some 300 inhabited vehicles are parked on Mountain View's streets, says Siegel, a veteran environmental advocate who joined the City Council in 2015 and is serving a one-year rotating term as mayor.</p><p>Siegel's goal is to raise about $10 million a year by charging all but the smallest employers a tax based on full-time employees. Medium-sized companies, say between 50 and 3,000 employees, would pay the head tax on a progressive scale. Google(or Alphabet, which is the holding company for Googleand a number of other enterprises) would end up paying about half the total. The money would be used to support bonds for housing and transit improvements, including an automated tram, or \"guideway,\" between Mountain View's downtown transit hub and the tech employment district hugging the shore of San Francisco Bay.</p><p>Siegel says Googlehas been a good corporate citizen for Mountain View. The company contributes to a free community shuttle that serves the central city, for example. Googlehasn't expressed a public opinion on the measure; the company didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Other Silicon Valley communities have considered initiatives like Mountain View's, but none has enacted anything like it. Siegel says that if Mountain View can pass its head tax, neighboring cities may fall into line.</p><p>The proposal indeed may signal a sea change in how what urbanist Richard Florida calls \"superstar cities\" address the inescapable costs of runaway growth.</p><p>These include \"gentrification, mounting inequality and acute housing unaffordability,\" he says. \"If we had a functioning federal government, it would help out with the social safety net. But mayors and city councils recognize that the federal government has gotten out of the business of helping. So they point the finger at big companies, and particularly big tech companies, because they're the biggest companies in the world and the most highly valued.\"</p><p>Some of those big companies, however, are pushing back.</p><p>The best example comes from Seattle, where the City Council is debating whether to impose an employment head tax to address homelessness and transportation problems.</p><p>The City Council could vote as soon as Monday on a plan to tax employers with at least $20 million in annual sales within the city. The tax would amount to 26 cents per employee hour, up to $500 per worker per year, with the goal of raising up to $75 million.</p><p>Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan on Thursday countered with her own plan about half the size, capping the tax at $250 per worker and raising $40 million a year, but it was rejected Friday by a City Council committee. A majority of the council favors the original proposal, though not enough to overcome a mayoral veto.</p><p>About 585 businesses would be subject to the tax, the city estimates. But its prime target is Amazon, which with about 40,000 local workers is the largest private employer within the city limits.</p><p>Amazon responded this month with an announcement that it was putting a major skyscraper project in the city on hold and reconsidering plans to expand into a second building. The premises were to accommodate up to 8,000 more Amazon employees.</p><p>Around the same time, Andrew Jassy, a top Amazon executive, called the tax proposal \"super dangerous for cities to implement.... What company is going to want to start -- or move to or grow in -- a city that penalizes them for hiring full-time employees?\" Jassy said on CNBC.</p><p>Amazon may have aimed to send a signal to the cities participating in a competition to host the company's second headquarters, which is expected to employ 50,000 workers. That's a boon to employment statistics, but certain to drive up rents and home prices and strain even the best-developed transit systems. But Amazon has made plain that it expects state and local tax breaks to be offered as a come-on.</p><p>\"It's hard to see how $500 a head would influence Amazon's investment decisions,\" says Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, which tracks state and local subsidies awarded to corporations. \"But it makes a lot of sense as a hardball signal\" to bidders for HQ2, Amazon's proposed second corporate headquarters.</p><p>The regional technology industry also has launched an opposition campaign, based partially on questioning whether money for Seattle's existing initiatives to fight homelessness and for other services has been spent wisely enough to warrant dunning tech companies for more.</p><p>\"The city invests $75 million a year to house the homeless,\" says Michael Schutzler, chief executive of the Washington Technology Industry Assn. \"But nobody in city government can point to successful outcomes as a result of the spending. We've got more potholes, not less. We've got more homeless, not less. We don't have schools improved, we don't have roads improved.\"</p><p>Yet there's hardly room for argument that rapid growth has strained Seattle's infrastructure and, for many residents, its standard of living. Rents and home prices are rising by 10 to 15% per year, and the average round-trip commute exceeds 54 minutes, higher than the national average and sixth highest in the nation -- even ahead of Los Angeles.</p><p>Whether a head tax is the best option to raise money has been questioned in Seattle and elsewhere, in part because it comes out of total business revenue rather than as a share of profits. That makes it particularly burdensome during recessions.</p><p>Chicago, for example, phased out its employee head tax in 2011, during a protracted economic slump. The levy had been in existence since 1973.</p><p>Still, interest in tying municipal revenues to employers' impact on infrastructure is rising, if only out of a sense that they haven't been paying their fair share. \"I think we're going to see more and more of this,\" says urbanist Florida, \"not only about corporate headquarters, but around universities and medical centers, where areas are getting more gentrified. Local government can't raise money out of thin air, so who are they going to turn to? The residents are tapped out and who seems flush other than these big giant companies?\"</p><p>He says that today's big corporations, which increasingly are technology firms rather than heavy manufacturers, would be well advised to go along with the trend rather than fighting it like Amazon.</p><p>\"Maybe the message will get through that building the economy is not just about creating jobs for the one-third of us who can do knowledge work, but that if we want to rebuild our cities the right way, it's in all our interests to make our cities more inclusive and more equitable,\" Florida says.</p><p>He sees the resistance of tech giants to contribute more to their communities as a sign of immaturity, also reflected in the tendency of firms such as Uber and Airbnb to run roughshod over local regulations.</p><p>\"Maybe they just believe this libertarian mythology that somehow they're the be-all and end-all and don't owe anyone anything,\" he says. \"But I think it's going to come back to haunt them. Amazon has a great brand, but it could begin to erode in the sense of Amazon being seen as a decent company.

I actually find the messianic Californian new-worldy-touchy-feely culture of Facebooka little grating,' he said two years ago. </p><p>'Nor am I sure that companies such as Facebookreally pay all the tax they could - though that's as much the fault of governments who still haven't got their tax act together.' </p><p>Facebookpaid only \u00a37.4m in tax in the UK last year despite collecting a record \u00a31.3bn in British sales. </p><p>Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said he would write a letter to Sir Nick: 'I will be urging him to make sure Facebookco-operates with attempts to make sure they pay their fair share of taxes.'</p><p>Tory MP Nigel Evans told said he 'looked forward' to Sir Nick persuading the Facebookchief to pay for UK corporation tax.</p><p>He said: 'He can help them to increase it to much higher levels. Perhaps he could dedicate a Facebook page on his actions and successes he achieves for UK plc.'</p><p>The former Liberal Democrat MP, who lost his Sheffield Hallam seat to Labour last year, will also end his personal campaign for a second EU referendum, which saw him join forces with Tony Blair and Sir John Major and flying across Europe meeting its political leaders.</p><p>Posting a video online he said he would help Facebookboss <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to 'navigate the onward journey'. </p><p>In a statement on his Facebookpage he said leaving before Brexit would be 'a wrench' but the move was 'an exciting new adventure'. </p><p>But people were quick to mock him in comments under the post, saying: 'looks like freedom of speech is doomed then'.</p><p>                     Sir <person><nameText>Nick Clegg</nameText></person>: Former Lib Dem MP accused of wrecking his party                   </p><p>Sir <person><nameText>Nick Clegg </nameText></person>was knighted for services to politics this year but more than 50,000 people signed a petition to have the honour reversed, branding Mr Clegg a 'failed politician'.</p><p>The father-of-three, whose son Antonio recently fought blood cancer, is married to Spanish city lawyer Miriam Gonzalez Durantez.</p><p>Last year he revealed that his son Antonio - one of the couple's three children - had been diagnosed with blood cancer. </p><p>The arch Remainer was among a number of Lib Dems showered with honours in recent years, with knighthoods for Vince Cable and Ed Davey, who both lost their seats in 2015 after serving in the Cabinet.</p><p>Mr Clegg held on but lost the Sheffield Hallam seat he held for 12 years in June 2017. </p><p>He has called for a second referendum and written a book called How To Stop Brexit. </p><p>In his book on Brexit, Mr Clegg wrote: 'There is nothing remotely inevitable about Brexit - except that it will be deeply damaging if it happens.'</p><p>He said there should be a second vote because the people who voted Leave were dying off. </p><p>Mr Clegg, the third of four siblings, entered the Commons in 2005 after years working in Brussels. </p><p>He took up a post with the European Commission in 1994 and five years later he was elected as a Liberal Democrat MEP in the European Parliament.</p><p>After swapping Brussels for Westminster, he won the race to become party leader in 2007 by beating Chris Huhne after Menzies Campbell was persuaded to step down.</p><p>Three years later he rode a wave of so-called 'Cleggmania' that briefly saw his party top the polls during the 2010 election campaign.</p><p>Although the results did not match this early success, he became a power broker during coalition talks, eventually siding with the Tories and allowing David Cameron to enter No 10.</p><p>In return, Mr Clegg was handed the position of deputy prime minister and brought the first Liberal MPs into government for decades. However, his party's poll ratings began to plummet after he was forced to renege on a major pledge not to increase tuition fees.</p><p>And he suffered the humiliation of losing a referendum on changing the voting system to a form of proportional representation.</p><p>After the party's 2015 election disaster, Mr Clegg resigned as leader and returned to the backbenches.</p><p>A year later, following the EU referendum, he became the party's Brexit spokesman but then lost his seat.</p><p>Before his career in politics the ex-MP worked in Brussels as an MEP and the Facebookbillionaire believes he can build bridges with the EU.</p><p>He will lobby Eurocrats who are pushing for a new tech tax by next year and who are also promising more punishing fines for high-profile data breaches like the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>Last week, Facebookrevealed new platform tools it says will increase transparency of political advertising as it faces investigations over the role of the adverts in elections around the world</p><p>It is also facing a potential \u00a31.2 billion fine for a data breach that allowed hackers to access the personal information of 30 million users last month.</p><p>The Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), the lead supervising authority for Facebookin the EU, officially opened its investigation last week after the social media giant admitted hackers could have accessed the accounts of millions of users through a 'vulnerability' on September 28.</p><p>In America the company faces upcoming midterms where it must fight Russian interference and it still faces investigation in by the Federal Trade Commission and the Security Exchange Commission.</p><p>Mr Clegg may also help Mr <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>with his public speaking after he spent two awkward days stammering his way through Senate hearings this year.</p><p>Critics have today slammed the former MP's new job as a 'damning indictment' of the revolving door between politics and big business.</p><p>Sir Nick is the most senior politician from Europe to work for Facebookand in a statement on his Facebookpage he said he was looking forward to 'an exciting new adventure'.</p><p>He added that the firm and its apps, including Whatsapp and Instagram was 'at the heart of some of the most complex and difficult questions we face as a society', over individual privacy, democratic integrity, the balance between free speech and prohibition online, artificial intelligence and the well-being of children.</p><p>He went on: 'I believe that Facebookmust continue to play a role in finding answers to those questions - not by acting alone in Silicon Valley, but by working with people, organisations, governments and regulators around the world to ensure that technology is a force for good.</p><p>'I am looking forward to being part of this endeavour.' </p><p>Jon Trickett MP, Labour's Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office said: 'It is a damning indictment of the sorry state of our country's politics that, at a time when digital giants such as Facebookare rightly coming under public scrutiny, our former Deputy Prime Minister has been hired to lobby on their behalf.</p><p>'Labour is committed to slamming shut the revolving door between politics and big business, which for too long has corroded public trust in politics.'</p><p>He will start working for Facebook's global affairs and communications team in London in the coming weeks after Mr <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>looked to him for help with its ailing reputation. </p><p>Sir Nick, his Spanish wife Miriam, a partner at law firm Dechert, and their children will then move to California. </p><p>British PR expert Rachel Whetstone, one of the people said to be vying for Sir Nick's new job, has recently moved to Netflix from Facebook.</p><p>The social network has been rocked by recent data scandals where millions of accounts were compromised.</p><p><person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>had to give a number of humbling apologies this year and it is understood he personally pursued Sir Nick for the job.</p><p>Until now he has dedicated himself to campaigning for a second referendum and had written a book called How To Stop Brexit.</p><p>In his book he said there should be a second vote because the people who voted Leave were dying off. </p><p>Mr Clegg also joined former PMs Tony Blair and Sir John Major in their 'shuttle diplomacy' jetting across the continent arguing British politics had made it 'viable' for the UK's exit to be stopped, </p><p>But in leaving for Facebooksome have suggested he may believe that the referendum result cannot be reversed as he wished. </p><p>Lord Allan of Hallam, who was Clegg's predecessor as Sheffield Hallam MP, is director of policy at Facebook.</p><p>The company is already facing tough questions over its treatment of customers.</p><p>Mr <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>one of the richest and most powerful men in the world, has faced a barrage of criticism over Facebook's privacy policies.</p><p>Under his stewardship Facebookhas been accused of allowing Russians to interfere in the US election and spread 'fake news'. </p><p>                     Leaving Britain before Brexit is a 'wrench' - but I'm excited to jon Facebook, says <person><nameText>Nick Clegg      </nameText></person></p><p>Here is <person><nameText>Nick Clegg's </nameText></person>statement in full: </p><p>I am delighted to be joining Facebook. After almost twenty years in European and British politics, this is an exciting new adventure for me.</p><p>Having spoken at length to Mark and Sheryl over the last few months, I have been struck by their recognition that the company is on a journey which brings new responsibilities not only to the users of Facebook's apps but to society at large. I hope I will be able to play a role in helping to navigate that journey.</p><p>Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, Oculus and Instagram are at the heart of so many people's everyday lives - but also at the heart of some of the most complex and difficult questions we face as a society: the privacy of the individual; the integrity of our democratic process; the tensions between local cultures and the global internet; the balance between free speech and prohibited content; the power and concerns around artificial intelligence; and the wellbeing of our children.</p><p>I believe that Facebookmust continue to play a role in finding answers to those questions - not by acting alone in Silicon Valley, but by working with people, organizations, governments and regulators around the world to ensure that technology is a force for good.</p><p>I am looking forward to being part of this endeavour. Throughout my public life I have relished grappling with difficult and controversial issues and seeking to communicate them to others. I hope to use some of those skills in my new role.</p><p>As someone who has spent a lifetime arguing for Britain's wholehearted commitment to Europe, it is of course a wrench to be leaving the public debate at a crucial time in the Brexit process. But the key decisions will soon pass to Parliament, of which I am no longer a Member, and once I had decided to take up this unique new challenge at Facebook, I felt it was best to get going sooner rather than later.</p><p>Miriam and I have been so grateful for the warm welcome extended to us by everyone we have met at Menlo Park.

In the two years that I've been writing this column, I have resisted the urge to make the last article of the year a retrospective. However, this year has been an exceptional one for privacy and it would be remiss of a writer who focuses on the impact of law and technology on society not to reflect on the year that privacy came into its own. </p><p>It was during this year that the world's most advanced data protection regulation came into force, resetting standards of privacy the world over. Provisions in Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require European companies to only engage with other companies that have adequate level of privacy protection and, additionally, requires companies outside the Union to meet the strict compliance obligations of the European data protection law if their business extends to the Union. As if to endorse this uniquely European approach, within the same year, California also enacted a privacy law that appears to have drawn heavily from GDPR principles. Several other countries seem to be keen to follow suit. At the heart of the European privacy framework is the notion of consent-a concept that has been central to the global privacy jurisprudence for decades. However, just as GDPR was re-affirming this concept and elevating it to new heights, various big tech companies proved just how inadequate an over-reliance on consent could be in the context of modern technologies. Ever since the Cambridge Analytica story first broke, it seems that every month there has been some news story or the other about the callous manner in which companies around the world deal with data. This was the year in which many of them were exposed as having indulged in questionable practices for a long time to the point where it is now quite clear that few, if any of them, ever really had any actual control over the petabytes of customer data under their care. Back in India, this year has been the one in which the privacy debate reached its crescendo. During the first half, the highest court in the land heard arguments on Aadhaar, the world's most ambitious identity project that many believed was nothing more than a sophisticated tool for state surveillance. In a split decision, the court upheld the constitutional validity of the project, but at the same time, struck down various critical features in the way private parties use its authentication functionality. What has survived is a shadow of what the Aadhaar project could have been. At about the same time, the Justice Srikrishna committee released its report making recommendations as to what India's new privacy law should look like and attaching a draft bill that the Parliament could consider directly enacting. The structure of the draft bill follows along the lines of the European framework, focusing on consent as the main safeguard against violation of personal privacy but at the same time introducing many new concepts that are heartening. Significant among these is the novel re-framing of the relationship between the data subject from whom data is collected and the data controller who processes it. Rather than sticking with the current nomenclature that seems to suggest that the person whose data is collected is somehow inferior to the collector, the Personal Data Protection Bill calls her the data principal, elevating her to a position of primacy, while at the same time, referring to the data controller as a data fiduciary suggesting that any data collected must be treated with fiduciary responsibility. That said, as we look towards 2019, I have hope that the world will finally come to terms with the fact that they have to find a new way to think about personal privacy-that the notice and consent model that has served us well for so long finally needs to be overhauled. I hope that this will spur the nations of the world to think up new ways in which to re-design privacy regulations so as to adequately address recent advances in technology such as Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things and neural networks, and find new ways to reduce their influence on our personal privacy. Despite the fact that the Srikrishna committee seems to have cleaved closely to the European framework, I still have hope that it will be India that leads the way in re-imagining privacy for the digital world. As the world's largest democracy, we have more at stake than any other nation in the world to actually get this right.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MintAsia.

(Adam S. Davis/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)   Reed Albergotti and    Reporter covering consumer electronics   EmailBioFollow   Reporter focused on technology coverage in the Pacific Northwest   EmailBioFollow   When it comes to keeping monopolists in check, the government has played the leading role, from President Teddy Roosevelt battling the railroad at the turn of the century to the Department of Justice taking on Microsoft in the 1990s.   Lately, though, it\u2019s been other corporations and, in some cases, individuals standing up to the likes of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon, all of which have been accused of wielding monopoly power unfairly.   Last week, Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, one of the world\u2019s most popular video games, became the latest company to step into the ring and fight for increased competition in the app economy. It sued both Apple and Google on the same day after both companies removed the game from their app stores.   AD   Epic\u2019s suit follows other civil lawsuits against the companies, all alleging anticompetitive behavior. Apple is being sued in part on antitrust grounds by email company Blix, which accuses the iPhone maker of stealing its technology and then suppressing its app on the Apple App Store. Amazon is facing a price-fixing lawsuit brought by consumers who claim the company has jacked up prices in some cases. And Facebook and Google have both faced lawsuits from independent software developers who claim they have abused their monopoly power over their own digital fiefdoms.   For years, antitrust regulators and lawmakers around the world have weighed whether to take action against big technology companies accused of abusing their power. Most recently, the Department of Justice and state attorneys general have announced investigations into large technology companies.   AD   The House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee has subpoenaed documents from technology companies relating to allegedly anticompetitive behavior and has been posting them online following a hearing last month featuring the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.   AD   With little to show for all the investigations and public hand-wringing, the private industry is moving forward with lawsuits instead.   \u201cYeah, I wish the DOJ was next to me, but they\u2019re not,\u201d said Steve Berman, managing partner of the law firm Hagens Berman, which has led separate class-action lawsuits recently against Amazon, Apple and Google for alleged violations of antitrust law. Berman also successfully sued Apple alongside the Department of Justice in the e-books price-fixing case decided seven years ago.   (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)   AD   Some see Epic\u2019s lawsuit as an important bellwether marking a shift in thinking in corporate America, which has steadfastly lobbied for decades against government involvement in the free market. It\u2019s rare for large, multinational companies like Epic Games to find themselves supporting greater enforcement of antitrust laws.   AD   \u201cSomething strange started happening a few years ago, and it\u2019s continuing today with this suit,\u201d wrote Matt Stoller, the director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, a Washington think tank devoted to reducing the power of monopolies, in his newsletter Wednesday. \u201cBusinesses began battling each other, and some started asking for an expansion of public power to structure markets. This suit is the latest on that score, the escalation of an ideological civil war within the business world, an attempt to undo deep changes in our society implemented forty years ago.\u201d   At the center of Epic\u2019s lawsuit is Apple\u2019s 30 percent fee it charges apps on its platform for all digital goods sold. Apple only allows its iPhone owners to download apps one way: through Apple\u2019s App Store. App developers like Epic Games are only permitted to collect money one way: through Apple\u2019s payment system. If a person spends $10 on a video game on an iPhone, Apple keeps $3 and the maker of the game gets $7.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42890378214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N0-TR31-JCSC-J1P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000D7EQ</classCode><className>SHUTTERSTOCK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Of course, this was meant to invoke personal shame, not a societal shame. In a 2010 book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Honor Code</emphasis>, renowned philosopher and cultural theorist Kwame Anthony Appiah identifies societal shame as a major motivator of modern moral revolution.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Appiah, shame is the flipside of honour. When enough people feel dishonour or acquire a culture of shame regarding a societal practice, they seek collectively \u2014 or request their governments \u2014 to make the practices illegal and their elimination enforceable. The recent elimination of birth alerts by the Manitoba government is just such an example.</p><p>Part of the problem with societal shame rests in the fact that if we\u2019re all dishonoured or implicated, we might not feel personal shame, as in it\u2019s not our problem and we personally can do nothing about it. The trick, then, is to translate some deeply understood moral shame as somewhat personal, and to act accordingly.</p><p>What better time to change some of our shameful practices and attitudes than when we\u2019re experiencing a moral awakening of sorts? We have much to be ashamed of, some which have been heightened by our COVID-19 experience. I would like to highlight two that top my list, partly because they represent some of the most vulnerable in our society; I then humbly suggest where we can find honour in having a government that is to represent \u201crule by everyone for the sake of everyone\u201d address them.</p><p>First, the sexual exploitation of children. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has frequently voiced concerns that COVID-19 isolation provides the perfect conditions for producing, distributing and viewing child pornography. In times of social isolation, children are often forced to stay at home with their abusers; they are away from adults such as child care workers and teachers who are often the first to identify abuse, and the internet is a ready tool to entertain and entice, and aid and abet the abusers. A publication by the centre, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Failing Our Children</emphasis>, clearly states the human scope and cost of the cyber-crime of child pornography.</p><p>Our federal government is being urged by child advocates to follow the lead of the British government by regulating big-tech companies whose networks knowingly permit distribution of this material. In a white paper titled \u201cOnline Harms,\u201d the British Home Office has recommended setting up an independent regulator with powers to pursue revoking the international licences of companies that don\u2019t comply with taking down illegal material, charging them with criminal offences, invoking huge fines or incarcerating their top executives. I would consider such action a hopeful and helpful Canadian response.</p><p>Second, let\u2019s revive and reinvoke the societal shame some of us felt during the Idle No More movement, and let\u2019s think of our attitudes toward Indigenous children and their parents. Close to 90 per cent of children in care in Manitoba are Indigenous; school attendance records show that Indigenous children are more likely to miss school and not be missed.</p><p>Relatedly, their educational achievements, success in school, likelihood of graduation and entry into gainful employment all lag unconscionably behind the rest of the population. Rates of fetal-alcohol effects, adolescent and later adult incarceration, and chances of being murdered or going missing far outstrip those in the general population. Their homes are more likely to be overcrowded, lack clean water and sanitary facilities.</p><p>What works, when it works, is providing the means for Indigenous peoples\u2019 control over the decisions that affect their children and their futures. The Manitoba First Nations School System \u2014 conceptualized, created and administered by a partnership of Manitoba First Nations \u2014 is a case in point. The self-sufficiency and industriousness of some of Manitoba\u2019s First Nations communities is another, and their success in keeping COVID-19 out of their communities to this point is remarkable.</p><p>We can only look forward to the anticipated development of the urban reserve where the Kapyong barracks used to be, bolstered by the open consultative process being initiated with its urban neighbours.</p><p>The shame I am praising is not the shame that most exploited children feel or the shame that many Indigenous people experience because of their situations. The shame I am praising is that which causes us enough discomfort and remorse to act, to speak up, and to insist that our governments attend to these issues to relieve us of the shameful burden of collective guilt.</p><p>John R.

Notably, Facebook has now begun turning its focus to activity by Americans.</p><p><br/>Recently, the site took down over 550 pages and 251 accounts operated by U.S citizens. In a blog post explaining the decision, Facebook claimed it took down the pages because they were inauthentically promoting content that linked to ad farms.<br/>Unlike the thousands of pages that have been previously shut down for similar behavior, many of these politically-oriented pages asserted their authenticity. For example, the left-leaning Reasonable People Unite page, which had over 2 million followers and shared mainstream political articles, was caught up in Facebook's purge. Also captured were relatively smaller groups like Punk Rock Libertarians, which had almost 200,000 followers.<br/>Facebook claimed the pages and accounts involved \"have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior.\"<br/>It's possible that some or all of these political-themed pages were indeed in violation of Facebook's terms of service, even if the users didn't believe they were. And, as a private company, Facebook certainly has the right to choose what content is and isn't allowed on its platform. But the takedown of numerous popular pages operated by Americans that espouse viewpoints across the spectrum amounts to censorship, even if Facebook is within its rights to do so.<br/>Facebook's crackdown on \"divisive political messages\" has intensified dramatically following government scrutiny of foreign meddling on the platform in the 2016 election. Predictably, this scrutiny has come with legislative proposals, such as the so-called \"Honest Ads Act,\" and an abundance of congressional hearings.<br/>The threat of heavy-handed government intervention has online platforms walking on eggshells. In Facebook's decision to remove these pages, we can see how government pressure leads to private action.<br/>Make no mistake, this is government censorship by other means.<br/>While politicians may not have the votes or the constitutional authority to censor online political content (though at least one state, Maryland, is having this theory tested) they can exert political pressure on the platforms that host the content. The multitude of congressional hearings, threats of anti-trust enforcement, and the introduction of legislation like the Honest Ads Act have all undoubtedly altered the behavior of these tech firms.<br/>Would Facebook have removed Americans' accounts in the absence of repeated congressional hearings? Would Facebook have created intensive new verification procedures for ad buyers without the threat of the Honest Ads Act? Would the company be so worried about allegations of bias towards content on its platform if it weren't for pressure from members of Congress?<br/>This isn't just an opinion from those outside the tech industry. At least one former Facebook employee believes the threat of government regulation has altered Big Tech's behavior.<br/>Brian Amerige, who recently left Facebook prior to the company's most recent purging, wrote in an internal memo, \"We've accepted the inevitability of government regulation... Our policy strategy is pragmatism - not clear, implementable long-term principles - and our PR strategy is appeasement - not morally earned pride and self-defense.\"<br/>This kind of outsourcing of censorship should worry Americans who believe in a culture of free speech. While it may not be as egregious an offense as the government removing the pages itself, the outcome is often the same. Voices are silenced.<br/>It may be the case that the recently removed Facebook pages were simply bad actors, no different than the spammers who peddle stories of fake celebrity deaths. It seems likely, however, that many of the pages were targeted because they contained political content that Facebook has an incentive to remove.<br/>The First Amendment is clear when it says \"Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech.\" The government doesn't have the right to censor political speech, no matter how divisive. We should be skeptical when the government co-opts tech companies to do the same.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-40216</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"712\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 23, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But the resulting lawsuits and regulation haven\u2019t done much.</p><p>Google is the best example. Investigations into allegations of anti-competitive tactics took years. The European Union then <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">fined</url>Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">several</url> billion <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">dollars</url> for breaking the law.

Europe passed a highly-touted privacy law called General Data Protection Regulation, but it\u2019s been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">a flop at limiting data collection</url> by the biggest tech companies. Much of the policing of the law was left to Ireland, which simply doesn\u2019t have the resources to keep up.</p><p>It sounds as if the lesson is that you can believe there\u2019s a problem with tech companies\u2019 power, but it\u2019s hard to craft an appropriate response.</p><p>Without a doubt. The authorities in Europe are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">changing their tactics now</url>. They\u2019re looking at rewriting laws to directly target the way big tech companies do business: How they use data or box out rivals, and ways they give their products preferential treatment.</p><p>But after a few years covering this in Europe, I have become much more suspect about these efforts at regulation. There\u2019s a lot of potential for unintended consequences.</p><p>What have been the unintended consequences?</p><p>A big one is the ripple effects of several countries, especially Germany, making new rules against hate speech online. The worry is that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">gave cover to countries to enact censorship laws</url>. Turkey cited Germany\u2019s hate speech law in enacting its new social media restrictions. Another law, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">known as the right to be forgotten</url>, has also raised concerns about limiting the availability of information online.</p><p>Does this mean we should be skeptical about any U.S. government action against Big Tech?</p><p>Maybe. But it\u2019s still been interesting to watch this growing realization among the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic about the size of these companies and the influence they hold over their democratic societies and how they operate, including their communication systems, information flow and commerce.</p><p>You can sense this feeling that lawmakers think they must do something, but aren\u2019t quite sure what that is yet. The next 12 to 18 months are going to be extraordinary.</p><p>Hello, dear readers! Several of you had asked about differences in how the United States and Europe handle regulation of technology. This conversation gets the ball rolling on that subject. Please keep the questions coming. You can reach us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ontech@nytimes.com\">ontech@nytimes.com</email></p><p>Twitter\u2019s blunder is a symptom of our broken internet</p><p>Twitter is in hot water with the U.S. government. Let me explain why you should be angry.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">investigating Twitter</url> and may fine the company up to $250 million for using people\u2019s phone numbers in ways that users didn\u2019t expect, my colleague Kate Conger wrote.</p><p>This stems from Twitter\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">disclosure</url> in October that the phone number you might have listed as a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">second form of account verification</url> \u2014 in addition to a password \u2014 might also have been used to target advertisements at you. This is not good.</p><p>Phone numbers used for security purposes shouldn\u2019t be repurposed for Twitter to make money. Twitter said this was a mistake, but it hasn\u2019t said how long this practice had gone on or how it made this error. (Facebook had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">gotten in trouble for the same thing</url>.)</p><p>There are two interrelated problems revealed by what might seem like Twitter\u2019s minor flub.</p><p>First is the problem of companies ignoring common sense. People who enter a phone number to keep impostors out of their Twitter accounts do not expect that number to be used to target ads. Period. Therefore, companies should absolutely not do this.</p><p>Two, Twitter\u2019s mistake is a symptom of the broader scourge of online surveillance. Internet advertising <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">is an arms race waged with our data</url>, and that leads to ever more intrusive harvesting and use of our information.</p><p>This is not only a concern for tin-foil-hat privacy paranoiacs. Companies like Facebook and Google have a big leg up over all other companies that sell digital ads because they have more and better data than anyone else. Every other company is tempted to play catch up by resorting to increasingly creepy ways of collecting user data.</p><p>That might include Twitter, or apps we\u2019ve never heard of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">that gather our location information and sell it without our knowledge to other data-hungry companies</url>.

The testimony will give an indication of how the companies are fighting antitrust arguments behind the scenes from regulators who can break them up, what commitments they're willing and unwilling to make under oath and how likely bipartisan antitrust reform really is.  When the CEOs of Amazon , Apple , Facebook and Google's parent company  Alphabet  testify before Congress on Wednesday, it won't be exactly what the House Antitrust Subcommittee members envisioned when their probe launched last June.    For one thing, it will be held over video conferencing software due to pandemic-related precautions, eliminating the optics of the four executives swearing in before an elevated panel of lawmakers. And with 1.3 million documents already obtained from the companies, the testimony is unlikely to include any bombshells the subcommittee hasn't already learned.   But regardless of how well-practiced the CEOs are when they take the witness stand, their testimonies will offer an important insight: how they are handling antitrust challenges from regulators with the authority to break them up.   The House Judiciary Committee's probe into the tech companies is expected to end with a report and legislative proposals about how to update the antitrust laws to respond to new challenges posed by the digital marketplace. Those laws, if enacted, could have far-reaching and lasting effects on how federal and state regulators crack down on anticompetitive practices in the future.   But the more immediate threat to the four business leaders taking the witness stand Wednesday is a potential lawsuit from domestic and international regulators that have been probing the companies on the same issues the House panel is investigating. Those agencies have the authority to order the companies to alter their businesses or make onerous commitments.   Antitrust questions about the four companies are not uniform, and even an hours-long hearing will only scratch the surface. But the way it plays out will indicate how the companies are fighting antitrust arguments behind the scenes, what commitments they're willing and unwilling to make under oath, and how likely bipartisan antitrust reform really is.  Big Tech on defense  Google has already faced fines from the European Commission's competition authority over its shopping search tool and Android mobile operating system. In the U.S., it faces the most pressing threat of legal action out of the four companies, as the Department of Justice and state attorneys general move toward a lawsuit that could span issues ranging from its search product to digital advertising marketplace, according to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal . Questions about Google tend to center on whether it favors its own products or suppresses competing options through its dominance in search and digital advertising.   Facebook disclosed a new Federal Trade Commission probe into its business last year, just after the agency closed a privacy probe into the company with a $5 billion fine. Several state attorneys general have also launched their own joint antitrust probe into the company. Facebook's past acquisitions of nascent competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp are a particular sticking point. The company has more than 2 billion monthly users, making it the largest social media platform, and enforcement advocates have argued that those earlier acquisitions could have become serious challengers if they'd been allowed to grow on their own.   Amazon's Jeff Bezos will face his first congressional hearing, and he's likely to get questions about Amazon's marketplace, where thousands of independent sellers sell new and used products, sometimes competing against Amazon itself. The FTC has been asking third-party sellers about what it's like selling on Amazon's marketplace, according to Bloomberg . Some members of the Judiciary Committee were outraged at a  Wall Street Journal investigation  earlier this year that found Amazon had used data from some of those sellers to create its own products , and suggested that some of Amazon's past statements to the panel \"appear to be misleading, and possibly criminally false or perjurious.\"   Apple's antitrust woes recently gained broader attention after a public spat with the leaders of a software company called Basecamp. The Basecamp executives aired their challenges in gaining approval for their new email service on Apple's App Store, the only official place for users to download new apps on iPhones and iPads. While Apple  ultimately approved  the app and created a new way to challenge its App Store rules , the incident shed light on the potential antitrust issues the EU is now looking into , such as Apple's opaque process for the app marketplace and its 30% commission fee on digital purchases consumers make through apps.   Some of the tech companies have already tipped their hand about how they will refute claims monopolistic behavior. The arguments typically start by challenging the premise that they're dominant players, slicing their markets and competitors to downplay the power they hold across all their spheres of influence.    Apple released a study that it commissioned last week that found its App Store fees and practices were generally in line with other digital marketplaces, refuting the claim that its 30% commission on digital sales was out of step with industry trends.   NetChoice, a trade group that counts Amazon, Facebook and Google among its members, published a report called \"Debunking the 'Big is Bad' Bogeyman: How Facebook Benefits Consumers.\" The report aims to pick apart a recent paper outlining an antitrust argument against Facebook by arguing that it does not monopolize the social media market and faces robust competition from companies like TikTok.   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's testimony will reportedly touch on the rise of TikTok, according to Bloomberg , as he paints Facebook as a patriotic counterbalance to upstart Chinese tech companies that lawmakers believe could pose a threat to U.S. security. Separate from the antitrust probe, lawmakers have expressed concern about TikTok and other Chinese-created apps, fearing they could collect valuable data on U.S. users that Chinese officials could force companies to hand over.   Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has previously pointed to the rise of Chinese tech companies when defending her company's position , arguing that even if Facebook is broken up, Chinese companies won't be.   But that argument may not sit well with lawmakers. Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., a member of the Antitrust Subcommittee whose amendment to a defense bill banning TikTok from government-issued devices recently passed in the House , said the threat of Chinese tech firms is separate from that of Big Tech's dominance.   \"I'm very concerned about China and their influence, but I think that's a whole different story,\" Buck said in an interview with CNBC Monday. \"If we allow our tech companies to become so big that they stifle innovation in this country we will never be able to compete with China because that's really what separates us from China is our ability to innovate and move forward.\"   Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also dismissed the defense in an interview, saying it was not \"legitimate.\"   \"Of course those things all get taken into account but that has nothing to do with monopolistic power and behavior via the antitrust laws that govern the way we do work and govern business regulation in this country,\" she told CNBC. \"It's not a compelling factor and the reality is that these companies have been engaged in this behavior for quite some time and none of the data that we have seen in our investigation points to this being because China is coming in and trying to take business away. It's not borne out by any of the documents.\"   Spokespeople from Amazon and Google did not provide comment for this article. Representatives from Apple and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.  Commitments under oath  The most tangible thing that could come from the panel are new commitments from the four CEOs.    \"Are they going to get any surprising new information? I highly doubt it,\" a senior staffer for a Democratic member of the subcommittee said. \"Now with that said, I do think there is a possibility that they get new commitments. There's a difference between new information and new commitments.\" The staffer spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to comment publicly.   Some of those commitments may deal directly with the antitrust issues at hand: Will you commit to never ripping off a product or app sold on your marketplace? Will you commit to never purchasing a company you perceive to be a future threat to your business?   Others could run the gamut of a host of other political issues: Will you commit to never taking down a post by a sitting president? Will you commit to fact-checking ads by all customers, including sitting presidents? Will you commit to never selling user data to third-party providers without their clear and explicit permission?   One line of questioning to watch for is a grilling of Amazon's Jeff Bezos over the company's use of data from third-party sellers. Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., said Amazon's witness at an earlier antitrust hearing \"may have lied to Congress'' about how the company uses data from its third-party sellers to come up with its private-label products following the WSJ report earlier this year. During a hearing in July 2019, Amazon general counsel Nate Sutton said that Amazon does not use individual sellers' data to inform its strategy, though it uses aggregated data to get a sense of how a product category is performing.    But the Journal's report found that aggregate reports could contain as few as two sellers or easily expose individual performance metrics by other means. An Amazon spokesperson previously told CNBC it doesn't allow employees to use \"non-public, seller-specific data to determine which private label products to launch\" and said it had opened an internal investigation, though it doesn't believe the allegations are true.   Jayapal is likely to take the opportunity to pin down Bezos on his stance on third-party seller data. She questioned Amazon's general counsel about the data at the previous hearing and her district includes Amazon's headquarters in Seattle.   \"That is important for me to follow up on because obviously I am extremely disturbed by the fact that their general counsel appears to have lied to me based on reports from papers like The Wall Street Journal,\" she said. \"So it won't be a satisfactory answer to say that that was rogue behavior because we have constant data from multiple sources, multiple reports that Amazon does engage in accessing information that hurts third-party sellers and using that to benefit their own products and their own business lines, so I think I will certainly be following up on that.\"   She said no decision has been made about whether an unsatisfactory answer could result in a perjury referral, but said once she hears what Bezos has to say, \"everything's on the table.\"  Bipartisan appetite for change?  The hearing will also show whether there's really a bipartisan appetite in Congress to change the antitrust laws?   When the investigation was launched last year, it had buy-in from top Democrats and Republicans on both the Judiciary Committee and Antitrust Subcommittee. But Judiciary Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., stepped down from the position partway through the probe as he pursues a Senate bid, handing the reins to Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Jordan has signaled discontent with aspects of the investigation and hearing format in public letters to Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.   Before he left the role, Collins and Subcommittee Ranking Member Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., wrote to Chairman Nadler, condemning remarks about breaking up big companies that he delivered at a fundraising event. Nadler was not specifically calling to break up tech companies, but rather talking about broad changes needed to dismantle concentrated market power, Politico reported at the time.   But Jordan has appeared as the sole signatory on several other letters questioning Democratic leadership's decisions about the hearing itself. He has advocated for it to be held at the full committee level and asked for Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to be invited to the hearing, despite not being a subject of the initial investigation. Jordan did not sign the  bipartisan letter asking Bezos to testify following the WSJ report.   Questions from Republican lawmakers on the subcommittee could show how committed they remain to the initial goals of the investigation and whether they still have an appetite to amend the antitrust laws.   Buck said both Republicans and Democrats remain concerned that the large platforms could \"stifle innovation.\"   \"This is the most bipartisan effort that I have been involved with in five and a half years of Congress and I'm really pleased with Chairman Cicilline's leadership and willingness to share resources and be very open in the approach to these issues,\" he said. \"The only way really to get a well thought-through law as well as a law that will pass the House and Senate and be signed by the president is to work in a bipartisan fashion and I think Chairman Cicilline has great vision in how he has approached this issue.\"   Still, several conservative members have signaled a focus on the alleged bias they believe platforms like Facebook and Google's YouTube display in their algorithms and moderation of users' content. Democrats have largely dismissed those concerns, and the companies have denied they build their products and policies in ways that discriminate against conservative voices.   Buck said he expects issues of bias and privacy to come up mainly as they relate to anticompetitive behavior. He plans to focus his questions on behavior he believes should be regulated.   \"I think that it's clear that the [antitrust] law was written at a time when Big Tech didn't exist and I think that there are new challenges now that we have to update the law to make sure that regulators have the tools and resources that they need to assure competitive behavior in the marketplace,\" he said.   No matter how lawmakers reach their conclusions, the question to watch is whether members on both sides of the aisle see these companies as too powerful, and if updates to the antitrust laws could reset the balance.

In recent years, seasteading - an amalgam of sea and homesteading - has captured the attention of some keen to create their own precincts of corporate sovereignty. An associated movement advocates charter cities, free to set their own rules.</p><p>As academics Andrew Phillips and JC Sharman write in their new book, Outsourcing Empire, \"the seasteading movement constitutes one of the most radical attempts to revive a form of corporate sovereignty within the international system\".</p><p>Thiel and co see these floating cities as a way to escape the \"predation and corruption of national government\". They are designed to nourish entrepreneurs and guarantee personal freedom better than existing governments.</p><p>A very different version of corporate sovereignty is described in Phillips and Sharman's book, a comparative history of the 19th-century company-states such as the English and Dutch East India companies and the Hudson's Bay Company. From the 17th to the 20th century, the company-states, rather than sovereign states, drove European expansion. But unlike the seasteads, they worked hand in glove with governments rather than challenging them.</p><p>Even so, Phillips, associate professor of international relations and strategy at the University of Queensland, sees some intriguing connections.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley has been an absolute catalyst for people coming up with ideas that look like the company-states,\" he says. \"Peter Thiel is obsessed with this movement to set up basically independent corporate cities. Milton Friedman's grandson is involved.</p><p>\"You've got these incredibly powerful people in big tech who are saying: 'We're not public utilities so we shouldn't be submitted to public regulation.' And they're fantasising about what this would actually look like in practice.\" In one sense it's the company-state model taken to its logical extreme but, as Phillips and Sharman point out, the problem for seasteads is that today anything \"even vaguely evocative of company-states is now beyond the pale\".</p><p>\"Corporate sovereignty was once commonplace,\" they write. \"But now its afterlife can be found not in the real world of international politics but in the libertarian venture capitalists' fantasies \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 this in itself is a tribute to the current universal dominance of the sovereign state, and to the unimaginability of a return to the not so distant world where companies were once kings.\" Phillips's research background is in the way international systems change over history. His first book grew out of September 11 when he was in New York State.</p><p>\"It sort of dramatised that for me and so my first book looked at military innovation and religious fanaticism as catalysts of change throughout history,\" he says.</p><p>Colleague JC (Jason) Sharman is the Sir Patrick Sheehy professor of international relations at the University of Cambridge, where he is a fellow of King's College. His research focus is regulation of global finance and international relations of the early modern world.</p><p>Phillips says the history of the company-states resonates with today's debates around the public-private divide: \"What does it mean to be a corporation? What is the legitimate distinction between what governments do and what corporations do? I think there are a lot of contemporary echoes.</p><p>\"Take the big debate over the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, now Alphabet) and the question of whether something like Facebook warrants some kind of governmental regulation. We're not suggesting Twitter and Facebook will ever enjoy anything near the power of the historical company-states. But the current controversies show that the boundaries of the public-private divide that we take for granted are historically contingent, often blurred and always contested.\" He says company-states were crucial actors in forming the modern international system, driving the first wave of globalisation. They were the forerunners of the modern multinational corporation, with extensive sovereign powers, armies and navies and practical independence. Some were more powerful than monarchs and they transformed the world through trade in commodities, people and ideas. They were the key mediators linking Europe with the rest of the world, with the right to declare and wage war and the ability to use violence to uphold their monopolies.</p><p>\"It is impossible to see the company-states as merely mercantile concerns,\" the authors argue. They were interested in profit but they were inherently political -actors engaged in diplomacy, fighting wars and governing substan-tial domains. Or as Phillips says: \"Europeans wouldn't have been able to conquer the world without the company states. (Author) Niall Ferguson talks about Western civilisation's killer apps. For me the company-state is clearly one of them.\" Outsourcing Empire: How Company-States Made the Modern World (Princeton University Press).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-9d7b4c829f3711eabf3b7c5331fad8f6854389b49150609752239dbfd38d72c1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6017-19W1-F0JP-W2TB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"896\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 30, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC00023UW</classCode><className>HUDSON'S BAY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC000539V</classCode><className>CENTURY CO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>NAICS452210 DEPARTMENT STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

Australia's political and media elite seemed nonplussed: can they really do that?   It seemed almost unAustralian. At least when old media companies like News Corp use their platforms to promote their interests, they have the decency to dress it up as \"news\".   Or when fossil-fuel companies want to resist climate action they wash their campaign through respectable front groups. (Hello, IPA!)   But when, like Google, you have your own channel used by most Australians most days, what else would you do? In its letter Google said the government proposals would dramatically worsen internet services in Australia and could lead to users' personal data being handed over to media companies: </p><p/><excerpt><bodyText><p>The law would force us to give an unfair advantage to one group of businesses -- news media businesses -- over everyone else who has a website, YouTube channel or small business. The proposed changes are not fair and they mean that Google search results and YouTube will be worse for you.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> They encouraged YouTube creators to protest the draft legislation up for consultation until August 28 through the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and foreshadowed further action in coming days. The ACCC responded that the letter was based on \"misinformation\".  It's a first for Australia, but it's part of a global pattern by the big tech companies to resist regulation -- particularly regulation that costs money or challenges their monopoly.   It's a playbook that includes spending big on lobbying, removing services from countries or states to avoid regulation (and punish regulators), leveraging their user networks to campaign politically and, if necessary, unleashing the lawyers.   Most famously, in 2014, Google shut down Google News in Spain when faced with a law requiring it to pay publishers for using snippets in the News search results.   Both platforms are heavily represented in Canberra. According to Australia's lobbyist register, Facebook is represented by DPG Advisory Solutions, whose principal, David Gazard, was described in the AFR in 2018 as \"number one in terms of who Morrison speaks to\". Google has multiple representatives, including Newgate Communications and TG Endeavour, that claim close connections with the Nationals.  Still they'd be finding it hard to compete with the Murdochs' News Corp or the Peter Costello-chaired Nine.  Just how far big tech will go to protect revenues has shown up this week in the industry's home state of California. The two big app-based transport companies, Uber and Lyft, are threatening to suspend operations in the state rather than comply with a law requiring them to treat their drivers as employees (with consequent minimum wages and benefits) rather than independent contractors.  They spent US$100 million boosting a referendum to be voted on in November to overturn the law. Their yes case is being supported through emails to customers and in-app promotions as well as a multimillion-dollar public advertising campaign.   Now, facing a court order to comply with the law this month, Uber and Lyft have threatened to suspend their services in California until their ballot proposal is approved.  The Australian government believes its draft legislation will prevent the tech platforms from suspending or limiting services. However, Facebook has foreshadowed that it doesn't believe it needs news, saying: \"News content is highly substitutable with other content for our users and ... does not drive significant long-term commercial value for our business.\"   Google says it doesn't sell ads against news searches and has consistently said it believes its search delivers more value to publishers through subscriptions and advertising than it takes through using news snippets in its results.   Both companies have been attempting to make friends in the news world through grants and training both to start-up media and traditional voices.  The tech platforms have not threatened legal action against the code, but it can't be ruled out. Last year an internal leak showed Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg threatening legal action against any threatened break-up of the company by US regulators.   \"I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" he pugnaciously told staff. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P3-MTF1-F0NT-H1BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><timeReceived>09:31:38 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The ACCC responded that the letter was based on \"misinformation\".  It's a first for Australia, but it's part of a global pattern by the big tech companies to resist regulation -- particularly regulation that costs money or challenges their monopoly.   It's a playbook that includes spending big on lobbying, removing services from countries or states to avoid regulation (and punish regulators), leveraging their user networks to campaign politically and, if necessary, unleashing the lawyers.   Most famously, in 2014, Google shut down Google News in Spain when faced with a law requiring it to pay publishers for using snippets in the News search results.

Just how far big tech will go to protect revenues has shown up this week in the industry's home state of California. The two big app-based transport companies, Uber and Lyft, are threatening to suspend operations in the state rather than comply with a law requiring them to treat their drivers as employees (with consequent minimum wages and benefits) rather than independent contractors.  They spent US$100 million boosting a referendum to be voted on in November to overturn the law. Their yes case is being supported through emails to customers and in-app promotions as well as a multimillion-dollar public advertising campaign.   Now, facing a court order to comply with the law this month, Uber and Lyft have threatened to suspend their services in California until their ballot proposal is approved.  The Australian government believes its draft legislation will prevent the tech platforms from suspending or limiting services. However, Facebook has foreshadowed that it doesn't believe it needs news, saying: \"News content is highly substitutable with other content for our users and ... does not drive significant long-term commercial value for our business.\"   Google says it doesn't sell ads against news searches and has consistently said it believes its search delivers more value to publishers through subscriptions and advertising than it takes through using news snippets in its results.   Both companies have been attempting to make friends in the news world through grants and training both to start-up media and traditional voices.  The tech platforms have not threatened legal action against the code, but it can't be ruled out.

Australia's political and media elite seemed nonplussed: can they really do that?   It seemed almost unAustralian. At least when old media companies like News Corp use their platforms to promote their interests, they have the decency to dress it up as \"news\".   Or when fossil-fuel companies want to resist climate action they wash their campaign through respectable front groups. (Hello, IPA!)   But when, like Google, you have your own channel used by most Australians most days, what else would you do? In its letter Google said the government proposals would dramatically worsen internet services in Australia and could lead to users' personal data being handed over to media companies: </p><p/><excerpt><bodyText><p>The law would force us to give an unfair advantage to one group of businesses -- news media businesses -- over everyone else who has a website, YouTube channel or small business. The proposed changes are not fair and they mean that Google search results and YouTube will be worse for you.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> They encouraged YouTube creators to protest the draft legislation up for consultation until August 28 through the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and foreshadowed further action in coming days. The ACCC responded that the letter was based on \"misinformation\".  It's a first for Australia, but it's part of a global pattern by the big tech companies to resist regulation -- particularly regulation that costs money or challenges their monopoly.   It's a playbook that includes spending big on lobbying, removing services from countries or states to avoid regulation (and punish regulators), leveraging their user networks to campaign politically and, if necessary, unleashing the lawyers.   Most famously, in 2014, Google shut down Google News in Spain when faced with a law requiring it to pay publishers for using snippets in the News search results.   Both platforms are heavily represented in Canberra. According to Australia's lobbyist register, Facebook is represented by DPG Advisory Solutions, whose principal, David Gazard, was described in the AFR in 2018 as \"number one in terms of who Morrison speaks to\". Google has multiple representatives, including Newgate Communications and TG Endeavour, that claim close connections with the Nationals.  Still they'd be finding it hard to compete with the Murdochs' News Corp or the Peter Costello-chaired Nine.  Just how far big tech will go to protect revenues has shown up this week in the industry's home state of California. The two big app-based transport companies, Uber and Lyft, are threatening to suspend operations in the state rather than comply with a law requiring them to treat their drivers as employees (with consequent minimum wages and benefits) rather than independent contractors.  They spent US$100 million boosting a referendum to be voted on in November to overturn the law. Their yes case is being supported through emails to customers and in-app promotions as well as a multimillion-dollar public advertising campaign.   Now, facing a court order to comply with the law this month, Uber and Lyft have threatened to suspend their services in California until their ballot proposal is approved.  The Australian government believes its draft legislation will prevent the tech platforms from suspending or limiting services. However, Facebook has foreshadowed that it doesn't believe it needs news, saying: \"News content is highly substitutable with other content for our users and ... does not drive significant long-term commercial value for our business.\"   Google says it doesn't sell ads against news searches and has consistently said it believes its search delivers more value to publishers through subscriptions and advertising than it takes through using news snippets in its results.   Both companies have been attempting to make friends in the news world through grants and training both to start-up media and traditional voices.  The tech platforms have not threatened legal action against the code, but it can't be ruled out. Last year an internal leak showed Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg threatening legal action against any threatened break-up of the company by US regulators.   \"I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" he pugnaciously told staff. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MT-TTR1-F0NT-H0MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><timeReceived>09:31:38 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Australia's political and media elite seemed nonplussed: can they really do that?   It seemed almost unAustralian. At least when old media companies like News Corp use their platforms to promote their interests, they have the decency to dress it up as \"news\".   Or when fossil-fuel companies want to resist climate action they wash their campaign through respectable front groups. (Hello, IPA!)   But when, like Google, you have your own channel used by most Australians most days, what else would you do? In its letter Google said the government proposals would dramatically worsen internet services in Australia and could lead to users' personal data being handed over to media companies: </p><p/><excerpt><bodyText><p>The law would force us to give an unfair advantage to one group of businesses -- news media businesses -- over everyone else who has a website, YouTube channel or small business. The proposed changes are not fair and they mean that Google search results and YouTube will be worse for you.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> They encouraged YouTube creators to protest the draft legislation up for consultation until August 28 through the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and foreshadowed further action in coming days. The ACCC responded that the letter was based on \"misinformation\".  It's a first for Australia, but it's part of a global pattern by the big tech companies to resist regulation -- particularly regulation that costs money or challenges their monopoly.   It's a playbook that includes spending big on lobbying, removing services from countries or states to avoid regulation (and punish regulators), leveraging their user networks to campaign politically and, if necessary, unleashing the lawyers.   Most famously, in 2014, Google shut down Google News in Spain when faced with a law requiring it to pay publishers for using snippets in the News search results.   Both platforms are heavily represented in Canberra. According to Australia's lobbyist register, Facebook is represented by DPG Advisory Solutions, whose principal, David Gazard, was described in the AFR in 2018 as \"number one in terms of who Morrison speaks to\". Google has multiple representatives, including Newgate Communications and TG Endeavour, that claim close connections with the Nationals.  Still they'd be finding it hard to compete with the Murdochs' News Corp or the Peter Costello-chaired Nine.  Just how far big tech will go to protect revenues has shown up this week in the industry's home state of California. The two big app-based transport companies, Uber and Lyft, are threatening to suspend operations in the state rather than comply with a law requiring them to treat their drivers as employees (with consequent minimum wages and benefits) rather than independent contractors.  They spent US$100 million boosting a referendum to be voted on in November to overturn the law. Their yes case is being supported through emails to customers and in-app promotions as well as a multimillion-dollar public advertising campaign.   Now, facing a court order to comply with the law this month, Uber and Lyft have threatened to suspend their services in California until their ballot proposal is approved.  The Australian government believes its draft legislation will prevent the tech platforms from suspending or limiting services. However, Facebook has foreshadowed that it doesn't believe it needs news, saying: \"News content is highly substitutable with other content for our users and ... does not drive significant long-term commercial value for our business.\"   Google says it doesn't sell ads against news searches and has consistently said it believes its search delivers more value to publishers through subscriptions and advertising than it takes through using news snippets in its results.   Both companies have been attempting to make friends in the news world through grants and training both to start-up media and traditional voices.  The tech platforms have not threatened legal action against the code, but it can't be ruled out. Last year an internal leak showed Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg threatening legal action against any threatened break-up of the company by US regulators.   \"I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" he pugnaciously told staff. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MK-VH11-JD6R-T0M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><timeReceived>09:31:38 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.
