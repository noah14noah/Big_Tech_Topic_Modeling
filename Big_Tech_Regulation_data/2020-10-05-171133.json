Elizabeth Warren went further earlier this month when she suggested breaking up companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said. \"That's why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition.\"</p><p>Klobuchar said she agreed with Warren.</p><p>\"Some of this is worth looking at, in terms of she's getting at the fact that there are conflicts, when they own companies that are being actually featured on their own platforms,\" the Minnesota Democrat said.</p><p>But she also attempted to take a more measured approach, telling CNN that she would only support breaking up companies if it is warranted.</p><p>\"How I would approach it is a little different,\" Klobuchar said.</p><p>\"If, in fact, the law shows that they should be broken up and it may well do that,\" she added. \"One, you try to change the laws so they're better suited for what we're dealing with, for things like a company being the only source for all of the companies underneath it.\"</p><p>On opioids, Klobuchar said that when she worked with Democrat Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Republicans Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire to \"put this bill forward for a blueprint\" on tackling the opioid crisis \"other senators (were) kind of patting us on the head saying, 'Oh yeah.'\"</p><p>The opioid crisis is one area that Klobuchar, who proudly touts her work with other Republicans, has found success with President Donald Trump. To date, the Republican president has signed three bills dealing with opioids that Klobuchar has worked on.</p><p>\"I think they understand now,\" Klobuchar said when asked if Congress understands the crisis.</p><p>Klobuchar named Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa as one of the senators with whom she can work on this issue.</p><p>\"Chuck Grassley's a bit of a maverick,\" Klobuchar said with a laugh, giving him a nickname that harkened back to the late Sen. John McCain. \"He's now chair of the Finance Committee, so he should be in a place to bring these bills up.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20190315amy-klobuchar-obama-drug-costs1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN6-68P1-JBPX-X010-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"827\"/><timeReceived>10:46 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 15, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>amy-klobuchar-obama-drug-costs</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009TRZ</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000C4EM</classCode><className>DRUG PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001371</classCode><className>HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002244</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE COSTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000C49J</classCode><className>OBAMA HEALTH CARE REFORM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001342</classCode><className>POLITICAL CANDIDATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CF16</classCode><className>US PATIENT PROTECTION &amp;

Elizabeth Warren went further earlier this month when she suggested breaking up companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said. \"That's why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition.\"</p><p>Klobuchar said she agreed with Warren.</p><p>\"Some of this is worth looking at, in terms of she's getting at the fact that there are conflicts, when they own companies that are being actually featured on their own platforms,\" the Minnesota Democrat said.</p><p>But she also attempted to take a more measured approach, telling CNN that she would only support breaking up companies if it is warranted.</p><p>\"How I would approach it is a little different,\" Klobuchar said.</p><p>\"If, in fact, the law shows that they should be broken up and it may well do that,\" she added. \"One, you try to change the laws so they're better suited for what we're dealing with, for things like a company being the only source for all of the companies underneath it.\"</p><p>On opioids, Klobuchar said that when she worked with Democrat Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Republicans Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire to \"put this bill forward for a blueprint\" on tackling the opioid crisis \"other senators (were) kind of patting us on the head saying, 'Oh yeah.'\"</p><p>The opioid crisis is one area that Klobuchar, who proudly touts her work with other Republicans, has found success with President Donald Trump. To date, the Republican president has signed three bills dealing with opioids that Klobuchar has worked on.</p><p>\"I think they understand now,\" Klobuchar said when asked if Congress understands the crisis.</p><p>Klobuchar named Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa as one of the senators with whom she can work on this issue.</p><p>\"Chuck Grassley's a bit of a maverick,\" Klobuchar said with a laugh, giving him a nickname that harkened back to the late Sen. John McCain. \"He's now chair of the Finance Committee, so he should be in a place to bring these bills up.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

He is originally from Russia.  It's Sergey and Larry who started Google.  It's eBay, so that's Pierre and Jeff Skoll, both of them are foreign born.  So Pierre is from Paris and Jeff is originally from Toronto, that -- that's the original eBay set of people.  Yahoo, that's Jerry Yang. He's from Taiwan.    </p><p>      I mean, these guys were all school at Stanford when I was there either as an undergrad or later in graduate school.  They are products that have produced a great number of jobs for the United States and it came right out of that university.  </p><p>      And so one of the, sort of, policy prescriptions, and Schramm did say this yesterday, was what about an entrepreneurship visa?  This is being talked about on the Hill.  The question mark is do we give foreign-born innovators immediately green card status?  Or do we try to put parameters around it that they have to create a certain number of U.S. jobs or they have to come with a certain amount of capital in order to get that entrepreneurship visa?  </p><p>      But that, to me, is a really strong thing that we should be doing really pretty quickly in order to -- to seize some of these people and help them stay in the United States.  </p><p>      There's also data that says if we would staple a green card to the back of diplomas of STEM graduates, so this was mentioned yesterday as well -- this is science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduate degree students.  If we would give them a green card when we gave them a diploma, we would have 70,000 innovators staying in the United States.  </p><p>      Really, I don't think we want to educate those people and send them away.  Right?  Because they are going to Shenzhen or Shanghai or Bangalore or Dubai or name any other place in the world that they are going to, to start their companies.  We don't want to have educated them in our universities and then kick them out.    </p><p>      So those are immediate sort of policy things to try to support the people who are -- who we're educating.  And I also want to make the point here that it's not just technology people.  So I did move from San Francisco to Washington, D.C.  And Levi Strauss was a German- born immigrant, right, the quintessential American jeans -- that is definitely not a technology story. </p><p>      In the last couple years you see a lot of cupcake makers, you see a number of, you know, green-tech, clean-tech businesses.  There are a number of consumer-based business that are not technology-related and those people as well could be foreign-born and we want to have them doing whatever they're doing, especially if it's scaling high-growth businesses inside our borders.  So that's the first point.    </p><p>      The second is to advance entrepreneurship education.  And this was talked about even this morning.  I believe the questioner came forward and said the good news, there's Kauffman statistics on this as well, the Kauffman data basically says that 40 percent of young adults, this is age 18 to 24, they have an interest in starting a business.  </p><p>      That's really good news for the United States.  Seventy percent of new college graduates -- they want to start their own businesses. Sixty percent of gen-Y business owners consider themselves serial entrepreneurs.  These are people who have already started one business and they basically believe that they will continue to start businesses and that's what their future will look like.  </p><p>      That's really encouraging that our young people are going to take hold in that way.  But one of the things that we need to do is make sure we have the right education system that is actually fostering the right skill sets.  </p><p>      And there is this kind of crazy mythology going on that it's good to drop out of -- of our education system.  Right?  And so this is Steve Jobs dropped out of Reed College.  It's Mark Zuckerberg drops out of Harvard.  Bill Gates drops out of Harvard, and it's oh so glorious to be a drop-out.  </p><p>      That's, in fact, not the case.  And there is some data -- I'd be real interested to see if we could in, you know, this room or if the government could try to -- to marshal more data.  There's some -- some technology accelerators, Y Combinator and Tech Stars, which have produced some of the best technology businesses in the valley.  They have put together a survey trying to look at this question.  It does use some Bureau of Labor Statistics data, but it uses some other sources of data that they have as well.  </p><p>      And, you know, so here are the results:  46 percent of founders have an undergraduate degree; 45 percent have a master's degree in this data set; only 2 percent have Ph.D.s.  So I'm sorry to all of you Ph.D.s in the room.  You're dark horse candidates for starting a high- growth high-tech business.  Seven percent have less than an undergraduate degree.  And so this is very different from what we hear.  Right?  Only 7 percent of this data set has dropped out or has started something without a college degree or -- or higher.  </p><p>      And so what do we do about this?  The Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship is a really fantastic program in the high school-age for teaching entrepreneurship skills.  I think we should be boosting that, fostering it.  Every student in the United States should know about it. </p><p>      FIRST Robotics is a competition that is taking hold, really, across the United States.  And Dean Kamen is one of the people that I have interviewed in my research, said -- I love this quote -- he says, \"Critical thinking is the sport in which every student can go pro.\"  </p><p>      Because this is thinking critical thinking skills of how do high school students take a box of stuff and make a robot out of it, and then how does their robot play basketball, or just kind of ball sport, with other robots?  And it's got unbelievable ability to learn about teamwork, to learn about collaboration, to learn math, to learn engineering, to learn about robotics.  That's a model also that I believe we should be trying to foster at a -- at a greater level.  </p><p>      At the university level, MIT has got the Venture Mentor program. It's one of the most successful models in the United States.  We should be trying to replicate that or seeing other universities pick something up about that.  </p><p>      And in this conversation, we talked about community colleges. There's a massive amount of value there as well.  Whether it's at the community college level or after-school learning centers, you know, we really want to be infusing the curriculum of -- of entrepreneurship.  </p><p>      And some of that is blocking and tackling skills.  Right?  Some of that is just accounting.  How do you read a balance sheet?  How do you read an income statement?  How do you assemble a team?  How do you market a product?  I mean, some of it is real sort of basic skill sets that we can be diffusing across a number of different platforms.  So the education piece I think is under-talked about in terms of how to -- to solve this problem.  </p><p>      Third point is building ecosystems.  And obviously we had panels talking about the infrastructure of ecosystems or ecosystems in different cities.  I think that this conference I'm very, very grateful to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the board of governors and the Kauffman Foundation for putting something like this together.  I think this is an example of building an ecosystem.  </p><p>      I think we should all be trying to carry this conversation forward, not only yesterday and today, but in collaborative networks. That is something I see quite a lot in my research.  It doesn't matter where you live, we are all networked together and this is an ecosystem now of people who have participated in this very conference, for example.  </p><p>      The point was made that we can't stay in silos.  I see this quite a lot in my research as well.  And so this is how do universities collaborate with businesses, collaborate with government?  How do people talk to each other?  There is a language, often, in each one of these silos and you need to understand and speak the language that the other people speak in a different silo.  </p><p>      My background has gone across sectors, so I was a McKinsey consultant and a JPMorgan banker, started a company, and then came into Washington as a White House Fellow.  And I'll tell you, like, in the White House, nobody knew what McKinsey Consulting was.  I thought it was crazy, but it was very, very true.  I mean, and out of business school, that was kind of a -- a big deal.  In the political world, people thought it was Baker McKenzie  law firm.  And it's like, OK, that's fine.  But, I mean, it really is -- even -- even within that, like it's crazy that we don't talk to each other regardless of what the silos are.  </p><p>      So I think that we'll see a lot more of this tri-sector leadership or hybrid leaders is -- is something that I'm calling the people who will cross sectors, whether it's their backgrounds will cross sectors or they will just communicate and talk with people in different sectors.  I think that is increasingly important in building ecosystems.    </p><p>      To the data point, so there's been a huge amount of talk about gaps in data -- data.  One of the things that I see, and I'm not exactly sure how this can work or if it might work, but in the Silicon Valley there's a massive amount of data collection.  And it's going on at places like Google and Facebook.  And data mining and, you know, data analytics, the people who have the most data in the world that I know right now are -- are those people.  </p><p>Palantir Technologies is an example of a startup in -- in Silicon Valley that has come to do quite a lot of data mining for the CIA. Now the Treasury Department has picked them up a little bit.    </p><p>      I mean, there are examples here on the collaborative efforts where I -- I throw that out sort of as a question to people in this room is how -- how can we, especially where there are gaps in the -- in the data here, how can we sort of work together and figure that out because there are certainly other -- other sources of data that are increasingly powerful.  </p><p>      So to this ecosystem's point, one of the things that was talked about in the nanotechnology point, half of all Net nanotechnology firms have been started by professors.  So an immediate policy recommendation here, and the Kauffman Foundation does write about this and talk about this, but it's trying to commercialize or opening technology licensing offices on university campuses for faculty.  And so the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 requires faculty innovators to work through their own university technology licensing offices.  The technology licensing offices often create delays.   </p><p>      And the question is, you know, is that a policy that we can change?  And can we change it pretty easily and pretty quickly so that in the nanotechnology field or other fields, if there are faculty members who can commercialize technologies, can we make that easier?  </p><p>      And that -- that's just, you know, one way to do it would be to mandate federal research grants that go to universities, that go conditioned on the idea that faculty members could choose their licensing agents.  That would be one policy prescription that could be made to try to facilitate this -- this collaborative effort.  </p><p>      So an anecdote which I love to share about the Palo Alto effect is the case study of PayPal.  And I'm not sure how many people are familiar with PayPal, but it is a -- a company that in 2002 went public and then sold to eBay.  And I graduated from Stanford Business School in 2002.  That was a time of doom and gloom.  I mean, if people don't remember it, it was the end of technology in Silicon Valley. Everybody -- the tech bubble burst and there were no more good ideas and there were certainly no opportunities for the future of -- of tech companies.  </p><p>      So PayPal is an example that I love because in 2002 they, in fact, iterated a business model eight times in eighteen months, so this is to the fast cycle iteration process.  They sold to eBay.  And then the more miraculous thing is that original team of people went on to basically found the whole Web 2.0 next wave.   </p><p>      And so this is to the ecosystem's point.  They went on to start LinkedIn.  They started YouTube; Yelp, which is going public; Digg; Tesla Motors; Slide; Clarium Capital; it's -- Kiva dot org is on the nonprofit side.  They put the first $500,000 into Facebook.    </p><p>      A lot of people don't realize that is the \"PayPalMafia,\" as they're called in Silicon Valley.  And it's a group of 12 or 15 guys. Now, I say that specifically because they're mostly guys.  They do come out of Stanford University and the University of Illinois Urbana- Champagne.  </p><p>      So Max Levchin is the technology kind of genius in that.  And Peter Thiel is the manager CEO.  But they've all gone on.  There's a great story in last weekend's New York Times about Reid Hoffman.  He came out of this network.  He's the LinkedIn founder.  </p><p>      The point about the \"PayPalMafia\" is they stayed in Silicon Valley.  They funded each other's businesses.  They -- they were angel funders, a lot of them, to each other's businesses and a number of other businesses there.  It's a real ecosystem effect that happens. And the question mark is can we take that and replicate it?  Can it happen in other places?  </p><p>      And there has been a fair amount of research done on this.  The case study that I find most interesting right now is Roosevelt Island in New York City.  So Mayor Bloomberg is trying to figure this out. Right now, there are seven universities vying to bring technology campuses into New York.  Stanford University is one of them.  Cornell is -- is another one; NYU and Columbia.  </p><p>      And that is something that people in this room I think we should all be watching and trying to figure out what happens at the local level; what happens -- what does the mayor do; you know, what are the regulations around that; how do you get the right universities in there, to invest their money;  how do you get the students trained.  I mean, this is a -- a pilot case study right now of can you take kind of this Stanford-Silicon Valley effect and can you move it into New York City?  And can we have Silicon Alley be stronger is what people are saying, than Silicon Valley?  </p><p>      So to building ecosystems, I think that that's critical and we have to do it across -- this is the tri-sector leader idea.  </p><p>      And then the final point that I'll make is about supporting women.  And this -- I was an investment banker.  I think this is a very undervalued asset class.  And we've talked about it a little bit here with women and minorities.  We talked about how we don't have very good data, certainly.  And I think that it was mentioned that maybe the funding is -- is going away for this.  </p><p>      I really would hope that we would be pushing women forward.  You see individual efforts.  Goldman Sachs, for example, has the Women Hold Up Half The Sky initiative.  That's the report that they did 10 years ago about women in the emerging markets.  That's done quite a lot to support women; the 10,000 Women initiative that that bank did, but a lot of other investment in women in the emerging markets.  I think we need to look at this for women in the United States.    </p><p>      And so there are -- there are some statistics and I'll give you one out of Boston (ph) College.  If women entrepreneurs in the United States started with the same capital as male entrepreneurs, they'd add a whopping 6 million jobs to the economy in five years.  And the data from -- out of Boston (ph) College goes on to say 2 million of those would be in the first year alone.    </p><p>      So there -- there -- there are people who are out there studying this.  There's a venture capital fund that was just stood up in Silicon Valley called Illuminate Ventures.  They have a white paper out.  And some of their data basically say that female-led high-tech startups have lower failure rates and they have greater capital efficiency than comparable companies led by men.  </p><p>      So, you know, there's a question mark.  Can women do more with less?  Or have they in the past because they've had less access to capital?  </p><p>      The average venture-backed tech company run by a woman is started with one-third less capital and it has annual revenues that are 12 percent higher.  That's out of that white paper that Illuminate Ventures has -- has put forward.  </p><p>      Women do launch nearly half of the new businesses in the United States.  And women increasingly are getting more college- or university-level degrees than men.  This is one of the things that we can observe is we have an educated workforce here.  Can we tap into that in a different way?  </p><p>      And the angels -- so here's a little bit of angel funding statistics.  In 2009, $17.6 billion in angel investments were made. Only 10 percent went to women.  Now, the question is:  Is this industry-specific?  Is it company-specific?  It may not be gender- specific, and this is where I think we need to study this a little bit further.  </p><p>      The Dow Jones VentureSource, basically the site of this data, says that 11 percent of U.S. firms with venture backing in 2009 had women founders.  Now, why is it only 11 percent of the venture-backed firms in the United States have a woman involved?  Not sure, not sure, but it's definitely a question to be asking going forward.  </p><p>      Some of the reasons -- some of the reasons put forward of why are women not accessing early-stage equity, one reason is that women don't ask.  There are some sociology studies basically that say that women are afraid or they just don't come forward and they don't ask; that women are twice as likely to use debt, use their own money, and they -- they just aren't going forward to try to find out what else would be possible.  </p><p>      Another reason is that the old boys network still exists.  So if you look at the venture capital funds or the angel investors, nearly 80 percent of them are men.  And so this a conversation going on in Silicon Valley right now about a number of women trying to stand up support networks.  One is called Astia.  It's a women venture-backed accelerator.  It's an interesting model to look at.  Illuminate Ventures is trying to fund women co-founders.    </p><p>      Sheryl Sandberg, who is the COO of Facebook, and Gina Vailankanni, who's the former CEO of Ning, both very interesting women in Silicon Valley.  They just about 10 days ago did angel investments in something called The Levo League, which is a nonprofit trying to support women in -- with professional skills.  And so when you see -- they don't make angel investments.  I mean, you don't really see Sheryl or Gina making these kinds of investments.  And so it's an interesting thing to observe.    </p><p>      And the question is, especially out of a high-powered group like this, is could we study this in a more sort of scientific way?  </p><p>      So that's -- that's a little bit of -- of what I think on the four prescriptions are to look at.  I -- I would say the conclusion here is that entrepreneurs are probably the best-suited to lead us out of uncertain times.  So back to the leadership characteristics of how -- how come entrepreneurs succeed?  They handle ambiguity.  They're extremely resilient.  </p><p>      The example of Google -- I was at Stanford when both Sergey Brin and Larry Page were students.  They were going around campus talking about an algorithm-based business.  I had no idea what they were talking about.  This was a total myth.  I was like, that's a weird mathematics company, I mean, like it clearly wasn't about math. Right?  </p><p>      All these years later, who could live without Google?  I mean, that's about 10 years ago.  And I will say that when they started, they were just two guys.  They were just two guys.  They were two students.  They were told there was no need for another search business.  They were told Yahoo owns the market.  They were told that their technology really wasn't that great.  And yet, I mean, look at what's happened there.  </p><p>      And so it's a story that you hear over and over about, you know, what will it take?  It will take people who will be resilient.  And the entrepreneurs, I think, are probably the best ones to lead us forward and to lead us out now.  And so we need to do what we can to support them.  </p><p>      I'll close by saying I grew up in Seattle.  And Seattle as a city -- and it was talked about a little bit here in one of the case studies, but for the future of how to compete in a world economy, it's an interesting study.  Because in the 70s in Seattle, my family was in the timber industry so it was typically timber and Boeing, and Boeing was pulling their people out of Seattle and it was really terrible times for the Pacific Northwest.  </p><p>      And there were two guys that put a billboard up along I-5, I mean, which was our freeway, right, and it basically said:  Will the last person leaving Seattle please turn out the light?  Because everybody was moving because Boeing was pulling all of their people out and the timber industry really just wasn't doing all that great.    </p><p>      And so having grown up and seen that, and now when you go back to Seattle, it's phenomenal.  I mean, it's Microsoft and Amazon and Starbucks and Nordstrom's and Costco and so many of the biotech firms. I mean, it is really a vibrant city.  It's a so much better city.  I mean, it's a great place to live and it's an entrepreneurial city that when you can look at it 30 years later, or close to 40 years later, and say what really happened here?  </p><p>      It's something that we should be studying and it's definitely this cross-sector concept.  Right?  I mean, it's businesses that went in there, but it's government regulators and industries and other things that also took hold in the city of Seattle.  Between May 2010 and 2011, Seattle added more jobs than any other metro area except for Dallas and Houston.  So just in the last year, we see it as one of the kind of job centers for the United States.  </p><p>      And lest you think this is just Amazon and Microsoft, because they are driving certainly a big technology trend out of Seattle, the companies that I like to point to are Costco.  Costco is not employing hugely, highly skilled workers.  They're training workers and they're making lives a lot better and they are creating jobs in Seattle. They've created 150,000 jobs, in fact, as a company.  That is not high-trained, high-skilled labor.  </p><p>      And Starbucks is another example.  They've employed about 140,000 people.  And so again, the -- one of the factors when you look at Seattle is that half of the population has a college degree.  And so that is one of these things about let's have entrepreneurship education at the university level.  But when you look at Costco and you look at Starbucks as big job generators in Seattle, the -- it's not highly skilled.  It's highly trained.  And so we should be thinking in those terms as well.  </p><p>      So I'll close by saying that pioneering entrepreneurs, the competitive, visionary, risk-taking entrepreneurs that bring out the best in America and that's what we need, like, we ought to bring out the best right now.  </p><p>      So I hope this starts the conversation, instead of ends the conversation.  And I'm happy to take questions, but I really am happy, too, to stay in touch with people.  And I hope you all will stay in touch with each other.  </p><p>      That's it.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)   </p><p>      So are there any questions?  No questions?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  A statement that you can then turn into a question because I'm interested in your view.  You know, one of the really special things about the Silicon Valley ecosystem is the tolerance for failure.  Among young people, I am told, you're not a real woman or man unless you've gone out and started something, and many of them or most of them fail, but it's no big deal.  You land on your feet.  You go to work for another company.   You try another one.  The whole entrepreneurial experience over time is trial and error.  That's really what so many entrepreneurs do.  </p><p>      So I know this is a little big wacky, particularly coming from someone who's a Fed president, but how...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)   </p><p>      ... I mean, how do we -- how do we celebrate failure?  How do we essentially encourage young entrepreneurs who maybe spectacularly fail, but -- but build that culture in which failure is not fatal. It's just -- just -- just a part of a learning process.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILKINSON</emphasis>:  Yeah, so that's a great question.  And it is something that I studied a little bit.  There are definitely -- there's a woman named Amy Edmondson at Harvard Business School who studied a lot on this topic, on failure and making it a learned -- a learning skill.  Right?  </p><p>      And so that's one of the things.  You see organizations that encourage and foster innovation.  They will say a failure is not catastrophic.  It's incremental.  And so that's one of the mindsets around.  I'm happy to fail incrementally.  And in fact, in the research that I've done, the high-impact entrepreneurs will set a failure ratio.  </p><p>      And so if you're Pierre Omidyar, for example, the founder of eBay, he'll say, \"Hey, I really want to fail 10 percent of the time or 15 percent of the time or 20 percent of the time.  I will strive to do that.\"  It's not catastrophic.  Nobody wants to, like, you know, completely wash up and -- and young people do, and then they come back from it.  So there's -- there's a whole bunch of research on resilience.    </p><p>      But on the mindset of failure, I think one of the things we need to do is try to set these targets.  Back to Pierre Omidyar, in his philanthropy he does this as well.  That's sort of revolutionary in philanthropy.  Really, he wants 10 percent or 15 percent of the dollars he gives away to not work.  And then the idea there is because if -- if -- if he's not pushing the envelope in that way, he's not actually getting the -- the up-side of an innovative approach.  </p><p>      And so Silicon Valley is a unique place for this kind of thinking.  I -- I believe it's starting to trickle across other organizations.  I think D.C. is one of the last places that it probably reaches. </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)   </p><p>      And in some cases, for obvious reasons, I mean, we don't really -- I mean, there are different things to think about when you're running a large institution and a federal institution.  It's -- that's a lot different proposition than if you're starting up a five-person startup.  Right?   </p><p>      I think the mentality of trying to figure out, \"hey, can I set these targets and can I push the envelope in this kind of way\" is -- is the same mindset.  But, you know, I -- I think there -- there are differences in the -- in the failure thing.  </p><p>      I'll give another anecdote, which is I interviewed Gilman Louie. He is the founder of In-Q-Tel.  This is the CIA venture arm.  And he is a venture capitalist.  He came from Silicon Valley.  He was also at Mattel as the chief creativity officer.  He's basically a video gamer. For those of you who haven't followed video gaming, it's massive. It's a massive industry.  </p><p>      So George Tenet brought him into the CIA a number of years ago and said, \"Hey, we need to be more innovative at the CIA.\"  And Gilman Louie, one of the best quotes that I have in my research, basically said he couldn't believe it.  He couldn't believe that when in a room like this, that CIA officers would throw their bodies, you know, if there was a grenade that came into the room.  They would do anything. I mean, that seemed like a really high-risk proposition.  </p><p>      And yet if you ask them to raise their hand and disagree or make a decision that would be controversial, they would never do it. They'd run for the door.  He was, like, you know, how does that work? How does this risk-tolerance equation work in an institution like the CIA, in particular as an example?  But I think it's a mentality to try to think differently.  </p><p>      Yes?  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I was wondering in your research, just, you brought up nanotechnology and now with video gaming, just the tech industry in general, whether patent reform or some kind of -- of change to the patent laws is necessary for entrepreneurs to -- to continue to come out of -- of those industries?  I know right now there are some patent wars going on between some of the really big tech companies.  But how does that filter down to the entrepreneurial level, if at all?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILKINSON</emphasis>:  Yeah.  So this is part of the conversation that I hear quite a lot about especially with patent reform having, you know, first- to-file having just been something put forward.  For entrepreneurs and for venture funders, a lot of people are unhappy about that.  Not everyone, but there are a fair number of people who are not happy with the first-to-file.  </p><p>      And the idea is that big companies can hire big lawyers to just file every single patent that could possibly be out there.  And if you are a small entrepreneur, it's -- it's hard.  It's hard to mobilize that as a resource or it's hard to get there as quickly as a big company could get their lawyer to file a patent.  </p><p>      And so I'm not sure it's definitely in the dialogue right now. I'm not sure what to say the solution is.  But I do hear especially, you know, the kind of startup people who are trying to file patents feeling unhappy or concerned, certainly.  There's a dialogue around, you know, in order to raise capital, in many cases you have to have a patent -- it's the chicken and egg problem.  But you might not be able to be first-to-file if somebody with huge amount of resources has -- has filed before you can get your prototype going.  So I -- I mean there's a real tension there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  So I -- I want to pick up the cross-collaboration question a little bit.  And to look at the examples you might know of or potential you might know of for how government can partner with entrepreneurs to learn to be more nimble about seizing opportunity.  </p><p>      We -- in America, we know big knows how to work with big.  Big government works with big business.  It works with big universities. But what you described in Silicon Valley and what a lot of us are experiencing is a new big, which is about being small, smart, connected and networked.  </p><p>      So how can government work with members of this new big to figure out how to take opportunity and be nimble?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILKINSON</emphasis>:  So Michael Bloomberg is a great example of this in New York City.  He is an entrepreneur.  Right?  So he's in -- the entrepreneurial mayor so that gives him a certain way of thinking that potentially other government people are not thinking in the same way.  </p><p>      He has brought a number of very young people into his administration.  There's a woman who does his social networking strategy who's, I don't know, 28 years old.  And in the big hurricane that New York -- that we had and then New York had as well, that was an experiment of how do you mobilize and connect and, you know, tell citizens where -- where the hurricane effects are happening or where to go or, you know, the power outages and all of that.  </p><p>      So I think bringing in young, nimble entrepreneurial people into what we be traditionally thought of as sort of high-level government positions is one way.  And I think New York City you see that happening.  </p><p>      Gavin Newsom is another example who was -- he's the mayor of San Francisco.  Now he's the lieutenant governor of California.  He is an entrepreneur.  PlumpJack is his wine and hospitality at the hotel industry as well, and so you see Gavin Newsom as a -- as a mayor and now lieutenant governor doing that pretty well.  </p><p>      But I think there's got to be a new way of thinking about talent. So much of government is working your way up.  And in the newly networked world, it is not that.  It's about collaborating.  And it's -- and it's really there's -- there's a power dynamic happening that I can observe where 25-year-olds are hugely valuable.   </p><p>      And in the kind of new economy and the new network system, government leaders who maybe didn't come up with these same sort of sets of skills need to really understand that the -- the killer combination might be coming from a 25-year-old.  So I think that there is -- we just need to think about things in a different way and bring in the people who have the skills.  </p><p>      Yes?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Do you see a connection between your idea about the supportive ecosystem and our decline in manufacturing?  I mean, what can we do to revitalize manufacturing?  Does your theory apply?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILKINSON</emphasis>:  So, yeah, this is a tricky one.  I'm not exactly sure.  And I'm not sure in some cases, not in all cases, but in some cases of manufacturing, I'm not sure we want those -- to be revitalizing those jobs.  I mean, I would say from the research that I can see is we want to in some cases, not all cases, but in some cases we want to re-train and -- and not invest in old industries.  </p><p>      And so if there are manufacturing jobs in -- in industries that potentially are not competitive or are going away, I -- I don't think we need to be spending as much time there.  And I do think we need to be thinking about the next.  Right?    </p><p>      And so to the ecosystem effect, I mean, Detroit is an example that I know a little bit about.  It was talked about here and that's certainly a manufacturing base.  The question mark that I have for Detroit is could you bring in entrepreneurs?  And could you have or could you foster a culture there that is not just boosting up the old?  </p><p>      Could it be -- you know, Tesla Motors is an example -- right? -- that sits in California.  Why does it not sit in Detroit?  I'm not sure.  But see, that's sort of -- a little bit of the ecosystem question is could you get some of these more innovative people to be spawning off of manufacturing, but not just revitalizing old manufacturing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Yeah.  So Amy, you -- you gave us some great insights about the behavioral characteristics of the entrepreneurs themselves who build these impressive organizations.  Can you -- can you give us any insight into the -- just the -- the structure of the businesses and the architecture that they use to scale them?  Were there any kind of commonalities that you noticed across the various businesses that you looked at?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILKINSON</emphasis>:  So I will condition this and say that all of my research is basically on the leadership skills, so it's on the people element.  I can observe some of the way that they structured their businesses, but I don't have scientific data that says that they scaled in a certain way or that they had this much capital or they received capital.  </p><p>      I mean, I -- I'm very interested in Sheryl's study out of the Kauffman Foundation in trying to understand that more.  But I can't speak as effectively to how they structured companies.  I can speak to as leaders what they did and what their mindsets and skill sets were.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  So the cost of a college education is really out of reach for many, many people.  And I've heard that community colleges struggle with technology education programs that constantly fall behind because technology changes so quickly.  So do you have a sense or ideas about other ways to get skills to people, to broaden the base of folks that can participate more fully in entrepreneurial activities?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILKINSON</emphasis>:  So one of the things that's talked about quite a lot is virtual education.  And so you're seeing -- Stanford University is experimenting with this.  Instead of paying, you know, $50,000 in tuition, can you get the same sort of classroom experience in a virtual way?  I think we will see this revolution of university education go online.  We're already seeing it.  I think that's a way that it's accessible to a lot greater number of people at a lot less expense.  </p><p>      I don't think -- I personally don't think it replaces classroom learning.  But I completely agree with you that the cost of a college education is -- is out of reach for a number of people.  And then the debt burden that many students carry afterwards is also, you know, a real -- a real problem for the United States.  </p><p>      But I think that one of the potential solutions is online learning.  And we see more and more and more of it all the time to enhance skills not only for young people, but for people who are trying to update their skills.    </p><p>      I mean, there's a huge market for this in the age of 30- to 50- year-old executives -- right? -- or mid-level managers in companies because in many cases they're also getting out to -- out of date very quickly.  And so can you do online modules to keep you up to speed in terms of being more technically adept or more nimble.  So I think that's one of the potential solution sets.  </p><p>      Are there other questions?  All right.  Oh, yes?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi.  Kind of just to piggyback on that question.  You definitely touched on education entrepreneurship.  And with the global competition of innovation and what-not, how do you see the U.S. competing when there's such a disparity in the K through 12 system in education?  </p><p>      Do you see, you know, that would be the optimal choice if -- if you did have the ability to bring entrepreneurial classes in high schools and middle schools, but do you really see that when there's so much testing on math and reading, not really critical thinking?  And do you think that that's a -- another avenue that the government can kind of look at or do you see that actually happening?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILKINSON</emphasis>:  So I think that's a really good question.  And I think that's part of the conversation we need to have about education in the United States.  And it's also one of the reasons why you see such a strong move towards charter schools, I think, and social entrepreneurs who are trying to infuse other solutions into our U.S. education system.  </p><p>      So in my data set, for example, I've interviewed Wendy Kopp at Teach For America.  That model's been around more than 20 years. That's not a new kind of response, Teach For America.  And -- and it's controversial.  It's not always thought to be, you know, the best way forward for -- for education.  </p><p>      But I think you do see a number of social entrepreneurs, social innovators trying to tackle this question from a different angle.  I think you do see a number of leaders in business saying \" we need a different education system now; we need a different set of skills.\"    </p><p>      And in order for businesses to hire people, they -- we do need to reform the K-12 system.  I -- I think that's really, I mean, you hear Tom Friedman saying this; you hear a lot of people saying that that is the quiet crisis in the United States is that our education system doesn't seem to be urgent, and yet it's so hugely important for all of us to be focusing on from every single angle.  Right?  </p><p>      I mean, it's great to have this conversation at the Federal Reserve Bank.  I mean, it's great because I think that we are seeing that the U.S. education system really does need to be infusing new skills and different skills and testing students in different ways. And in the global system, my research has also gone, you know, I've done a number of interviews in China, in Asia particularly, and other emerging economies and the education systems are different.    </p><p>      We do have probably students who are more creative and in that way, in some cases, more willing to be entrepreneurial than some of these other systems, but we're really rapidly falling -- falling behind in skill sets.  </p><p>      So it's a good question and it's something that we -- we definitely need to be focusing on.  And I, you know, I think bankers of the world or government policymakers of the world or entrepreneurs of the world -- we all need to be weighing in on this.  I mean, this is not to be left to educators or education people alone.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  And we've talked a lot the last two days about the gap between GDP and unemployment.  And you alluded to it again, too.  </p><p>      In terms of closing that gap, it seems like a lot of the causes of it is that, particularly with increased accessibility and advances in technology, businesses are doing more with less.,,And so -- I mean, you see it especially in manufacturing where you have technology doing the work of laborers.    </p><p>      And so I was wondering if -- how -- if you perhaps envisioned that those types of people who would ordinarily be laborers can be re- tooled to be entrepreneurs themselves?  And using increased accessibility to technology to -- for them to create services and commodities more locally, as opposed to being -- having the ambition to be these -- these huge companies?  </p><p>      And for instance, I think one example is you see actually in D.C., people aren't opening restaurants anymore.  They're buying a truck and an iPhone to use as a register and then all of the sudden they're in the food service industry.  So is there a way to take that model of skill sets and infusing it with kind of every day people?  </p><p>      And -- and I think the -- the -- what was said earlier about people thinking of entrepreneurs as the Steve Jobs and sort of these unique figures, if culturally there's something intrinsic that perhaps we have difficulty changing perceptions, as opposed to what it takes to be an entrepreneur, especially locally?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILKINSON</emphasis>:  Sure.  So I think that this is part of -- I mean, it's part of the reason why I'm writing a book is that I believe everyone needs to be an entrepreneur regardless of where you plug in. Meaning if you're in government, you need to be more entrepreneurial and -- and adaptive and nimble if you're starting a nonprofit, if you're starting a business.  </p><p>      To your example of, you know, if you used to be in manufacturing or if you thought about starting a restaurant, and now you can use technology in a new way, I believe that we do need to have everyone think that entrepreneurship is accessible to them.  </p><p>      One of the ways is, you know, community colleges, updating skills virtually, are there -- is there online training?  I mean, what other vehicles can we use to sort of get this message out to people and enable them to be effective in -- in a new kind of economy because we definitely are moving towards a new kind of economy.    </p><p>      I mean, there are statistics that say by the time you are 38 years old that people will have, I think it's like 12 or 15 jobs. Right?  And that was not my father's career.  I mean, my father was 30 years at one company.  And so when we see the shift of labor dynamics and the economy and the innovation economy, I think you have isolated one of the really important things is that everyone needs to believe they can be an entrepreneur.  </p><p>      And this is where the Kauffman data -- I do love the fact that, you know, the average person starting a company or as the Inc. 500 is 40 years old.  I mean, we also sort of think that the entrepreneurs are the 20-year-old dropouts from Harvard University like Mark Zuckerberg.  And in fact, they're 40 -- right? -- which is great because it means that if you -- you didn't miss the boat at age 20 or 25 or 30 or 35; like, you know, you still can get out there and do it. And since we talked to averages before, I mean, if that's the average, I mean, so you can be a lot older and -- and still be doing that. Right?  </p><p>      And so it's one of the questions that I grapple with of how do you get this message out.  I'm trying to write a commercial book. Simon &amp; Schuster is publishing my book and I'm trying to get it out through a number of different channels.  But I -- I do think that entrepreneurship education will come in many forms.  So I think the -- the question is a really good one.  </p><p>      All right.  Thank you.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Amy, thank you so much for your insights.  It was really terrific.  And I'm glad to know that there is still hope.    </p><p>      So I want to close by really thanking the people that make this happen, particularly the organizing committee for this -- for this -- this group, this conference.  </p><p>      It -- my staff continues to delight and surprise me and challenge me intellectually all of the time.  It's incredible.  They're -- I think someone in one of the earlier panels talked about the privilege of working at the Federal Reserve.  And it really -- it really is the case for many of us that work here.  </p><p>      It's a community of dialogue and openness and looking for the right answer, not -- not just always the political answer or anything along those lines.  It really is a tremendous place.  </p><p>      So I want to thank the lead organizers from the Atlanta Fed, Todd Greene.  Thank you, Todd.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)   </p><p>      And we're going to be working together again soon.  In 2013, we'll have our biannual Community Development Research Conference and we will be partnering again with the Atlanta Fed.  This has been a delight and we're looking forward to working with you again.  </p><p>      Karen Leone de Nie, who is, I think, Todd's  right hand in this.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)   </p><p>      From the Kauffman Foundation, Alicia Robb, who really brought them to the table and brought us a whole new look at entrepreneurship. Alicia, thank you.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)   </p><p>      And then from our team here at the board, Joseph Firschein, who I just can't function without.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)   </p><p>      And Cayenne Bishop, who -- who is -- never misses a detail on any of these types of conferences and I always have such great confidence when you are involved in anything, so thank you, Cayenne.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      As well as -- well, I don't see them in the room, but Kelly Esman (ph) and Chalice Friar (ph) who make everything work behind the scenes, who get our -- our Internet access going and our webstreaming happening, so thank you to them as well.    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)   </p><p>      So I just wanted to loop back on the -- and close with some thoughts from entrepreneurs themselves on the point I made earlier about what fascinates us about entrepreneurship.  So I think entrepreneurship speaks to the fundamental American values of discovery, excellence, optimism, finding a better way to do something, creating the next hip product or making a market or capturing -- it captures our imagination.  </p><p>      I mean, we'd like to think about that in American -- in American life that we can find a better way to do things.  </p><p>      So during this proceeding, we explored the role of small business in stabilizing communities, creating jobs, the unique experience and needs of minority-owned businesses, opportunities in urban and rural communities, and the importance of access to capital.  </p><p>      I went out and googled, I used the Google search engine to -- to look at -- to come up with some quotes from a few entrepreneurs as I thought it would be fitting to close this conference hearing from them.  </p><p>      So the first one is, \"I never perfected an invention that I did not think about in terms of the service it might give others.  I find out what the world needs then I proceed to invent.\"  Thomas Edison.  </p><p>      \"The important thing is not being afraid to take a chance. Remember the greatest failure is to not try.  Once you find something you love to do, be the best at doing it.\"  Debbi Fields, the founder of Mrs. Fields Cookies.  </p><p>      And finally, \"We were young but we had good advice and good ideas and lots of enthusiasm.\"  Bill Gates, Microsoft.  </p><p>      So with that, I wish you a good travels home.  And this is not the end, certainly, for what we see happening here at the Federal Reserve on this topic.  We're going to have many, many more dialogues like this in the future.  And we look forward to having you with us again.  </p><p>      Thank you.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)   </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5484-3SB1-F15W-H000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

He is originally from Russia. It's Sergey and Larry who started Google. It's eBay, so that's Pierre and Jeff Skoll, both of them are foreign born. So Pierre is from Paris and Jeff is originally from Toronto, that -- that's the original eBay set of people. Yahoo, that's Jerry Yang. He's from Taiwan.</p><p>I mean, these guys were all school at Stanford when I was there either as an undergrad or later in graduate school. They are products that have produced a great number of jobs for the United States and it came right out of that university.</p><p>And so one of the, sort of, policy prescriptions, and Schramm did say this yesterday, was what about an entrepreneurship visa? This is being talked about on the Hill. The question mark is do we give foreign-born innovators immediately green card status? Or do we try to put parameters around it that they have to create a certain number of U.S. jobs or they have to come with a certain amount of capital in order to get that entrepreneurship visa?</p><p>But that, to me, is a really strong thing that we should be doing really pretty quickly in order to -- to seize some of these people and help them stay in the United States.</p><p>There's also data that says if we would staple a green card to the back of diplomas of STEM graduates, so this was mentioned yesterday as well -- this is science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduate degree students. If we would give them a green card when we gave them a diploma, we would have 70,000 innovators staying in the United States.</p><p>Really, I don't think we want to educate those people and send them away. Right? Because they are going to Shenzhen or Shanghai or Bangalore or Dubai or name any other place in the world that they are going to, to start their companies. We don't want to have educated them in our universities and then kick them out.</p><p>So those are immediate sort of policy things to try to support the people who are -- who we're educating. And I also want to make the point here that it's not just technology people. So I did move from San Francisco to Washington, D.C. And Levi Strauss was a German- born immigrant, right, the quintessential American jeans -- that is definitely not a technology story. In the last couple years you see a lot of cupcake makers, you see a number of, you know, green-tech, clean-tech businesses. There are a number of consumer-based business that are not technology-related and those people as well could be foreign-born and we want to have them doing whatever they're doing, especially if it's scaling high-growth businesses inside our borders. So that's the first point.</p><p>The second is to advance entrepreneurship education. And this was talked about even this morning. I believe the questioner came forward and said the good news, there's Kauffman statistics on this as well, the Kauffman data basically says that 40 percent of young adults, this is age 18 to 24, they have an interest in starting a business.</p><p>That's really good news for the United States. Seventy percent of new college graduates -- they want to start their own businesses. Sixty percent of gen-Y business owners consider themselves serial entrepreneurs. These are people who have already started one business and they basically believe that they will continue to start businesses and that's what their future will look like.</p><p>That's really encouraging that our young people are going to take hold in that way. But one of the things that we need to do is make sure we have the right education system that is actually fostering the right skill sets.</p><p>And there is this kind of crazy mythology going on that it's good to drop out of -- of our education system. Right? And so this is Steve Jobs dropped out of Reed College. It's Mark Zuckerberg drops out of Harvard. Bill Gates drops out of Harvard, and it's oh so glorious to be a drop-out.</p><p>That's, in fact, not the case. And there is some data -- I'd be real interested to see if we could in, you know, this room or if the government could try to -- to marshal more data. There's some -- some technology accelerators, Y Combinator and Tech Stars, which have produced some of the best technology businesses in the valley. They have put together a survey trying to look at this question. It does use some Bureau of Labor Statistics data, but it uses some other sources of data that they have as well.</p><p>And, you know, so here are the results -- 46 percent of founders have an undergraduate degree; 45 percent have a master's degree in this data set; only 2 percent have Ph.D.s. So I'm sorry to all of you Ph.D.s in the room. You're dark horse candidates for starting a high- growth high-tech business. Seven percent have less than an undergraduate degree. And so this is very different from what we hear. Right? Only 7 percent of this data set has dropped out or has started something without a college degree or -- or higher.</p><p>And so what do we do about this? The Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship is a really fantastic program in the high school-age for teaching entrepreneurship skills. I think we should be boosting that, fostering it. Every student in the United States should know about it. FIRST Robotics is a competition that is taking hold, really, across the United States. And Dean Kamen is one of the people that I have interviewed in my research, said -- I love this quote -- he says, \"Critical thinking is the sport in which every student can go pro.\"</p><p>Because this is thinking critical thinking skills of how do high school students take a box of stuff and make a robot out of it, and then how does their robot play basketball, or just kind of ball sport, with other robots? And it's got unbelievable ability to learn about teamwork, to learn about collaboration, to learn math, to learn engineering, to learn about robotics. That's a model also that I believe we should be trying to foster at a -- at a greater level.</p><p>At the university level, MIT has got the Venture Mentor program. It's one of the most successful models in the United States. We should be trying to replicate that or seeing other universities pick something up about that.</p><p>And in this conversation, we talked about community colleges. There's a massive amount of value there as well. Whether it's at the community college level or after-school learning centers, you know, we really want to be infusing the curriculum of -- of entrepreneurship.</p><p>And some of that is blocking and tackling skills. Right? Some of that is just accounting. How do you read a balance sheet? How do you read an income statement? How do you assemble a team? How do you market a product? I mean, some of it is real sort of basic skill sets that we can be diffusing across a number of different platforms. So the education piece I think is under-talked about in terms of how to -- to solve this problem.</p><p>Third point is building ecosystems. And obviously we had panels talking about the infrastructure of ecosystems or ecosystems in different cities. I think that this conference I'm very, very grateful to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the board of governors and the Kauffman Foundation for putting something like this together. I think this is an example of building an ecosystem.</p><p>I think we should all be trying to carry this conversation forward, not only yesterday and today, but in collaborative networks. That is something I see quite a lot in my research. It doesn't matter where you live, we are all networked together and this is an ecosystem now of people who have participated in this very conference, for example.</p><p>The point was made that we can't stay in silos. I see this quite a lot in my research as well. And so this is how do universities collaborate with businesses, collaborate with government? How do people talk to each other? There is a language, often, in each one of these silos and you need to understand and speak the language that the other people speak in a different silo.</p><p>My background has gone across sectors, so I was a McKinsey consultant and a JPMorgan banker, started a company, and then came into Washington as a White House Fellow. And I'll tell you, like, in the White House, nobody knew what McKinsey Consulting was. I thought it was crazy, but it was very, very true. I mean, and out of business school, that was kind of a -- a big deal. In the political world, people thought it was Baker McKenzie law firm. And it's like, OK, that's fine. But, I mean, it really is -- even -- even within that, like it's crazy that we don't talk to each other regardless of what the silos are.</p><p>So I think that we'll see a lot more of this tri-sector leadership or hybrid leaders is -- is something that I'm calling the people who will cross sectors, whether it's their backgrounds will cross sectors or they will just communicate and talk with people in different sectors. I think that is increasingly important in building ecosystems.</p><p>To the data point, so there's been a huge amount of talk about gaps in data -- data. One of the things that I see, and I'm not exactly sure how this can work or if it might work, but in the Silicon Valley there's a massive amount of data collection. And it's going on at places like Google and Facebook. And data mining and, you know, data analytics, the people who have the most data in the world that I know right now are -- are those people.</p><p>Palantir Technologies is an example of a startup in -- in Silicon Valley that has come to do quite a lot of data mining for the CIA. Now the Treasury Department has picked them up a little bit.</p><p>I mean, there are examples here on the collaborative efforts where I -- I throw that out sort of as a question to people in this room is how -- how can we, especially where there are gaps in the -- in the data here, how can we sort of work together and figure that out because there are certainly other -- other sources of data that are increasingly powerful.</p><p>So to this ecosystem's point, one of the things that was talked about in the nanotechnology point, half of all Net nanotechnology firms have been started by professors. So an immediate policy recommendation here, and the Kauffman Foundation does write about this and talk about this, but it's trying to commercialize or opening technology licensing offices on university campuses for faculty. And so the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 requires faculty innovators to work through their own university technology licensing offices. The technology licensing offices often create delays.</p><p>And the question is, you know, is that a policy that we can change? And can we change it pretty easily and pretty quickly so that in the nanotechnology field or other fields, if there are faculty members who can commercialize technologies, can we make that easier?</p><p>And that -- that's just, you know, one way to do it would be to mandate federal research grants that go to universities, that go conditioned on the idea that faculty members could choose their licensing agents. That would be one policy prescription that could be made to try to facilitate this -- this collaborative effort.</p><p>So an anecdote which I love to share about the Palo Alto effect is the case study of PayPal. And I'm not sure how many people are familiar with PayPal, but it is a -- a company that in 2002 went public and then sold to eBay. And I graduated from Stanford Business School in 2002. That was a time of doom and gloom. I mean, if people don't remember it, it was the end of technology in Silicon Valley. Everybody -- the tech bubble burst and there were no more good ideas and there were certainly no opportunities for the future of -- of tech companies.</p><p>So PayPal is an example that I love because in 2002 they, in fact, iterated a business model eight times in eighteen months, so this is to the fast cycle iteration process. They sold to eBay. And then the more miraculous thing is that original team of people went on to basically found the whole Web 2.0 next wave.</p><p>And so this is to the ecosystem's point. They went on to start LinkedIn. They started YouTube; Yelp, which is going public; Digg; Tesla Motors; Slide; Clarium Capital; it's -- Kiva dot org is on the nonprofit side. They put the first $500,000 into Facebook.</p><p>A lot of people don't realize that is the \"PayPal Mafia,\" as they're called in Silicon Valley. And it's a group of 12 or 15 guys. Now, I say that specifically because they're mostly guys. They do come out of Stanford University and the University of Illinois Urbana- Champagne.</p><p>So Max Levchin is the technology kind of genius in that. And Peter Thiel is the manager CEO. But they've all gone on. There's a great story in last weekend's New York Times about Reid Hoffman. He came out of this network. He's the LinkedIn founder.</p><p>The point about the \"PayPal Mafia\" is they stayed in Silicon Valley. They funded each other's businesses. They -- they were angel funders, a lot of them, to each other's businesses and a number of other businesses there. It's a real ecosystem effect that happens. And the question mark is can we take that and replicate it? Can it happen in other places?</p><p>And there has been a fair amount of research done on this. The case study that I find most interesting right now is Roosevelt Island in New York City. So Mayor Bloomberg is trying to figure this out. Right now, there are seven universities vying to bring technology campuses into New York. Stanford University is one of them. Cornell is -- is another one; NYU and Columbia.</p><p>And that is something that people in this room I think we should all be watching and trying to figure out what happens at the local level; what happens -- what does the mayor do; you know, what are the regulations around that; how do you get the right universities in there, to invest their money; how do you get the students trained. I mean, this is a -- a pilot case study right now of can you take kind of this Stanford-Silicon Valley effect and can you move it into New York City? And can we have Silicon Alley be stronger is what people are saying, than Silicon Valley?</p><p>So to building ecosystems, I think that that's critical and we have to do it across -- this is the tri-sector leader idea.</p><p>And then the final point that I'll make is about supporting women. And this -- I was an investment banker. I think this is a very undervalued asset class. And we've talked about it a little bit here with women and minorities. We talked about how we don't have very good data, certainly. And I think that it was mentioned that maybe the funding is -- is going away for this.</p><p>I really would hope that we would be pushing women forward. You see individual efforts. Goldman Sachs, for example, has the Women Hold Up Half The Sky initiative. That's the report that they did 10 years ago about women in the emerging markets. That's done quite a lot to support women; the 10,000 Women initiative that that bank did, but a lot of other investment in women in the emerging markets. I think we need to look at this for women in the United States.</p><p>And so there are -- there are some statistics and I'll give you one out of Boston (ph) College. If women entrepreneurs in the United States started with the same capital as male entrepreneurs, they'd add a whopping 6 million jobs to the economy in five years. And the data from -- out of Boston (ph) College goes on to say 2 million of those would be in the first year alone.</p><p>So there -- there -- there are people who are out there studying this. There's a venture capital fund that was just stood up in Silicon Valley called Illuminate Ventures. They have a white paper out. And some of their data basically say that female-led high-tech startups have lower failure rates and they have greater capital efficiency than comparable companies led by men.</p><p>So, you know, there's a question mark. Can women do more with less? Or have they in the past because they've had less access to capital?</p><p>The average venture-backed tech company run by a woman is started with one-third less capital and it has annual revenues that are 12 percent higher. That's out of that white paper that Illuminate Ventures has -- has put forward.</p><p>Women do launch nearly half of the new businesses in the United States. And women increasingly are getting more college- or university-level degrees than men. This is one of the things that we can observe is we have an educated workforce here. Can we tap into that in a different way?</p><p>And the angels -- so here's a little bit of angel funding statistics. In 2009, $17.6 billion in angel investments were made. Only 10 percent went to women. Now, the question is -- Is this industry-specific? Is it company-specific? It may not be gender- specific, and this is where I think we need to study this a little bit further.</p><p>The Dow Jones VentureSource, basically the site of this data, says that 11 percent of U.S. firms with venture backing in 2009 had women founders. Now, why is it only 11 percent of the venture-backed firms in the United States have a woman involved? Not sure, not sure, but it's definitely a question to be asking going forward.</p><p>Some of the reasons -- some of the reasons put forward of why are women not accessing early-stage equity, one reason is that women don't ask. There are some sociology studies basically that say that women are afraid or they just don't come forward and they don't ask; that women are twice as likely to use debt, use their own money, and they -- they just aren't going forward to try to find out what else would be possible.</p><p>Another reason is that the old boys network still exists. So if you look at the venture capital funds or the angel investors, nearly 80 percent of them are men. And so this a conversation going on in Silicon Valley right now about a number of women trying to stand up support networks. One is called Astia. It's a women venture-backed accelerator. It's an interesting model to look at. Illuminate Ventures is trying to fund women co-founders.</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg, who is the COO of Facebook, and Gina Vailankanni, who's the former CEO of Ning, both very interesting women in Silicon Valley. They just about 10 days ago did angel investments in something called The Levo League, which is a nonprofit trying to support women in -- with professional skills. And so when you see -- they don't make angel investments. I mean, you don't really see Sheryl or Gina making these kinds of investments. And so it's an interesting thing to observe.</p><p>And the question is, especially out of a high-powered group like this, is could we study this in a more sort of scientific way?</p><p>So that's -- that's a little bit of -- of what I think on the four prescriptions are to look at. I -- I would say the conclusion here is that entrepreneurs are probably the best-suited to lead us out of uncertain times. So back to the leadership characteristics of how -- how come entrepreneurs succeed? They handle ambiguity. They're extremely resilient.</p><p>The example of Google -- I was at Stanford when both <person><nameText>Sergey Brin </nameText></person>and Larry Page were students. They were going around campus talking about an algorithm-based business. I had no idea what they were talking about. This was a total myth. I was like, that's a weird mathematics company, I mean, like it clearly wasn't about math. Right?</p><p>All these years later, who could live without Google? I mean, that's about 10 years ago. And I will say that when they started, they were just two guys. They were just two guys. They were two students. They were told there was no need for another search business. They were told Yahoo owns the market. They were told that their technology really wasn't that great. And yet, I mean, look at what's happened there.</p><p>And so it's a story that you hear over and over about, you know, what will it take? It will take people who will be resilient. And the entrepreneurs, I think, are probably the best ones to lead us forward and to lead us out now. And so we need to do what we can to support them.</p><p>I'll close by saying I grew up in Seattle. And Seattle as a city -- and it was talked about a little bit here in one of the case studies, but for the future of how to compete in a world economy, it's an interesting study. Because in the 70s in Seattle, my family was in the timber industry so it was typically timber and Boeing, and Boeing was pulling their people out of Seattle and it was really terrible times for the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>And there were two guys that put a billboard up along I-5, I mean, which was our freeway, right, and it basically said -- Will the last person leaving Seattle please turn out the light? Because everybody was moving because Boeing was pulling all of their people out and the timber industry really just wasn't doing all that great.</p><p>And so having grown up and seen that, and now when you go back to Seattle, it's phenomenal. I mean, it's Microsoft and Amazon and Starbucks and Nordstrom's and Costco and so many of the biotech firms. I mean, it is really a vibrant city. It's a so much better city. I mean, it's a great place to live and it's an entrepreneurial city that when you can look at it 30 years later, or close to 40 years later, and say what really happened here?</p><p>It's something that we should be studying and it's definitely this cross-sector concept. Right? I mean, it's businesses that went in there, but it's government regulators and industries and other things that also took hold in the city of Seattle. Between May 2010 and 2011, Seattle added more jobs than any other metro area except for Dallas and Houston. So just in the last year, we see it as one of the kind of job centers for the United States.</p><p>And lest you think this is just Amazon and Microsoft, because they are driving certainly a big technology trend out of Seattle, the companies that I like to point to are Costco. Costco is not employing hugely, highly skilled workers. They're training workers and they're making lives a lot better and they are creating jobs in Seattle. They've created 150,000 jobs, in fact, as a company. That is not high-trained, high-skilled labor.</p><p>And Starbucks is another example. They've employed about 140,000 people. And so again, the -- one of the factors when you look at Seattle is that half of the population has a college degree. And so that is one of these things about let's have entrepreneurship education at the university level. But when you look at Costco and you look at Starbucks as big job generators in Seattle, the -- it's not highly skilled. It's highly trained. And so we should be thinking in those terms as well.</p><p>So I'll close by saying that pioneering entrepreneurs, the competitive, visionary, risk-taking entrepreneurs that bring out the best in America and that's what we need, like, we ought to bring out the best right now.</p><p>So I hope this starts the conversation, instead of ends the conversation. And I'm happy to take questions, but I really am happy, too, to stay in touch with people. And I hope you all will stay in touch with each other.</p><p>That's it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So are there any questions? No questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: A statement that you can then turn into a question because I'm interested in your view. You know, one of the really special things about the Silicon Valley ecosystem is the tolerance for failure. Among young people, I am told, you're not a real woman or man unless you've gone out and started something, and many of them or most of them fail, but it's no big deal. You land on your feet. You go to work for another company. You try another one. The whole entrepreneurial experience over time is trial and error. That's really what so many entrepreneurs do.</p><p>So I know this is a little big wacky, particularly coming from someone who's a Fed president, but how...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>... I mean, how do we -- how do we celebrate failure? How do we essentially encourage young entrepreneurs who maybe spectacularly fail, but -- but build that culture in which failure is not fatal. It's just -- just -- just a part of a learning process.</p><p>AMY WILKINSON: Yeah, so that's a great question. And it is something that I studied a little bit. There are definitely -- there's a woman named Amy Edmondson at Harvard Business School who studied a lot on this topic, on failure and making it a learned -- a learning skill. Right?</p><p>And so that's one of the things. You see organizations that encourage and foster innovation. They will say a failure is not catastrophic. It's incremental. And so that's one of the mindsets around. I'm happy to fail incrementally. And in fact, in the research that I've done, the high-impact entrepreneurs will set a failure ratio.</p><p>And so if you're Pierre Omidyar, for example, the founder of eBay, he'll say, \"Hey, I really want to fail 10 percent of the time or 15 percent of the time or 20 percent of the time. I will strive to do that.\" It's not catastrophic. Nobody wants to, like, you know, completely wash up and -- and young people do, and then they come back from it. So there's -- there's a whole bunch of research on resilience.</p><p>But on the mindset of failure, I think one of the things we need to do is try to set these targets. Back to Pierre Omidyar, in his philanthropy he does this as well. That's sort of revolutionary in philanthropy. Really, he wants 10 percent or 15 percent of the dollars he gives away to not work. And then the idea there is because if -- if -- if he's not pushing the envelope in that way, he's not actually getting the -- the up-side of an innovative approach.</p><p>And so Silicon Valley is a unique place for this kind of thinking. I -- I believe it's starting to trickle across other organizations. I think D.C. is one of the last places that it probably reaches. (LAUGHTER)</p><p>And in some cases, for obvious reasons, I mean, we don't really -- I mean, there are different things to think about when you're running a large institution and a federal institution. It's -- that's a lot different proposition than if you're starting up a five-person startup. Right?</p><p>I think the mentality of trying to figure out, \"hey, can I set these targets and can I push the envelope in this kind of way\" is -- is the same mindset. But, you know, I -- I think there -- there are differences in the -- in the failure thing.</p><p>I'll give another anecdote, which is I interviewed Gilman Louie. He is the founder of In-Q-Tel. This is the CIA venture arm. And he is a venture capitalist. He came from Silicon Valley. He was also at Mattel as the chief creativity officer. He's basically a video gamer. For those of you who haven't followed video gaming, it's massive. It's a massive industry.</p><p>So George Tenet brought him into the CIA a number of years ago and said, \"Hey, we need to be more innovative at the CIA.\" And Gilman Louie, one of the best quotes that I have in my research, basically said he couldn't believe it. He couldn't believe that when in a room like this, that CIA officers would throw their bodies, you know, if there was a grenade that came into the room. They would do anything. I mean, that seemed like a really high-risk proposition.</p><p>And yet if you ask them to raise their hand and disagree or make a decision that would be controversial, they would never do it. They'd run for the door. He was, like, you know, how does that work? How does this risk-tolerance equation work in an institution like the CIA, in particular as an example? But I think it's a mentality to try to think differently.</p><p>Yes?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was wondering in your research, just, you brought up nanotechnology and now with video gaming, just the tech industry in general, whether patent reform or some kind of -- of change to the patent laws is necessary for entrepreneurs to -- to continue to come out of -- of those industries? I know right now there are some patent wars going on between some of the really big tech companies. But how does that filter down to the entrepreneurial level, if at all?</p><p>AMY WILKINSON: Yeah. So this is part of the conversation that I hear quite a lot about especially with patent reform having, you know, first- to-file having just been something put forward. For entrepreneurs and for venture funders, a lot of people are unhappy about that. Not everyone, but there are a fair number of people who are not happy with the first-to-file.</p><p>And the idea is that big companies can hire big lawyers to just file every single patent that could possibly be out there. And if you are a small entrepreneur, it's -- it's hard. It's hard to mobilize that as a resource or it's hard to get there as quickly as a big company could get their lawyer to file a patent.</p><p>And so I'm not sure it's definitely in the dialogue right now. I'm not sure what to say the solution is. But I do hear especially, you know, the kind of startup people who are trying to file patents feeling unhappy or concerned, certainly. There's a dialogue around, you know, in order to raise capital, in many cases you have to have a patent -- it's the chicken and egg problem. But you might not be able to be first-to-file if somebody with huge amount of resources has -- has filed before you can get your prototype going. So I -- I mean there's a real tension there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: So I -- I want to pick up the cross-collaboration question a little bit. And to look at the examples you might know of or potential you might know of for how government can partner with entrepreneurs to learn to be more nimble about seizing opportunity.</p><p>We -- in America, we know big knows how to work with big. Big government works with big business. It works with big universities. But what you described in Silicon Valley and what a lot of us are experiencing is a new big, which is about being small, smart, connected and networked.</p><p>So how can government work with members of this new big to figure out how to take opportunity and be nimble?</p><p>AMY WILKINSON: So Michael Bloomberg is a great example of this in New York City. He is an entrepreneur. Right? So he's in -- the entrepreneurial mayor so that gives him a certain way of thinking that potentially other government people are not thinking in the same way.</p><p>He has brought a number of very young people into his administration. There's a woman who does his social networking strategy who's, I don't know, 28 years old. And in the big hurricane that New York -- that we had and then New York had as well, that was an experiment of how do you mobilize and connect and, you know, tell citizens where -- where the hurricane effects are happening or where to go or, you know, the power outages and all of that.</p><p>So I think bringing in young, nimble entrepreneurial people into what we be traditionally thought of as sort of high-level government positions is one way. And I think New York City you see that happening.</p><p>Gavin Newsom is another example who was -- he's the mayor of San Francisco. Now he's the lieutenant governor of California. He is an entrepreneur. PlumpJack is his wine and hospitality at the hotel industry as well, and so you see Gavin Newsom as a -- as a mayor and now lieutenant governor doing that pretty well.</p><p>But I think there's got to be a new way of thinking about talent. So much of government is working your way up. And in the newly networked world, it is not that. It's about collaborating. And it's -- and it's really there's -- there's a power dynamic happening that I can observe where 25-year-olds are hugely valuable. And in the kind of new economy and the new network system, government leaders who maybe didn't come up with these same sort of sets of skills need to really understand that the -- the killer combination might be coming from a 25-year-old. So I think that there is -- we just need to think about things in a different way and bring in the people who have the skills.</p><p>Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Do you see a connection between your idea about the supportive ecosystem and our decline in manufacturing? I mean, what can we do to revitalize manufacturing? Does your theory apply?</p><p>AMY WILKINSON: So, yeah, this is a tricky one. I'm not exactly sure. And I'm not sure in some cases, not in all cases, but in some cases of manufacturing, I'm not sure we want those -- to be revitalizing those jobs. I mean, I would say from the research that I can see is we want to in some cases, not all cases, but in some cases we want to re-train and -- and not invest in old industries.</p><p>And so if there are manufacturing jobs in -- in industries that potentially are not competitive or are going away, I -- I don't think we need to be spending as much time there. And I do think we need to be thinking about the next. Right?</p><p>And so to the ecosystem effect, I mean, Detroit is an example that I know a little bit about. It was talked about here and that's certainly a manufacturing base. The question mark that I have for Detroit is could you bring in entrepreneurs? And could you have or could you foster a culture there that is not just boosting up the old?</p><p>Could it be -- you know, Tesla Motors is an example -- right? -- that sits in California. Why does it not sit in Detroit? I'm not sure. But see, that's sort of -- a little bit of the ecosystem question is could you get some of these more innovative people to be spawning off of manufacturing, but not just revitalizing old manufacturing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah. So Amy, you -- you gave us some great insights about the behavioral characteristics of the entrepreneurs themselves who build these impressive organizations. Can you -- can you give us any insight into the -- just the -- the structure of the businesses and the architecture that they use to scale them? Were there any kind of commonalities that you noticed across the various businesses that you looked at?</p><p>AMY WILKINSON: So I will condition this and say that all of my research is basically on the leadership skills, so it's on the people element. I can observe some of the way that they structured their businesses, but I don't have scientific data that says that they scaled in a certain way or that they had this much capital or they received capital.</p><p>I mean, I -- I'm very interested in Sheryl's study out of the Kauffman Foundation in trying to understand that more. But I can't speak as effectively to how they structured companies. I can speak to as leaders what they did and what their mindsets and skill sets were.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: So the cost of a college education is really out of reach for many, many people. And I've heard that community colleges struggle with technology education programs that constantly fall behind because technology changes so quickly. So do you have a sense or ideas about other ways to get skills to people, to broaden the base of folks that can participate more fully in entrepreneurial activities?</p><p>AMY WILKINSON: So one of the things that's talked about quite a lot is virtual education. And so you're seeing -- Stanford University is experimenting with this. Instead of paying, you know, $50,000 in tuition, can you get the same sort of classroom experience in a virtual way? I think we will see this revolution of university education go online. We're already seeing it. I think that's a way that it's accessible to a lot greater number of people at a lot less expense.</p><p>I don't think -- I personally don't think it replaces classroom learning. But I completely agree with you that the cost of a college education is -- is out of reach for a number of people. And then the debt burden that many students carry afterwards is also, you know, a real -- a real problem for the United States.</p><p>But I think that one of the potential solutions is online learning. And we see more and more and more of it all the time to enhance skills not only for young people, but for people who are trying to update their skills.</p><p>I mean, there's a huge market for this in the age of 30- to 50- year-old executives -- right? -- or mid-level managers in companies because in many cases they're also getting out to -- out of date very quickly. And so can you do online modules to keep you up to speed in terms of being more technically adept or more nimble. So I think that's one of the potential solution sets.</p><p>Are there other questions? All right. Oh, yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. Kind of just to piggyback on that question. You definitely touched on education entrepreneurship. And with the global competition of innovation and what-not, how do you see the U.S. competing when there's such a disparity in the K through 12 system in education?</p><p>Do you see, you know, that would be the optimal choice if -- if you did have the ability to bring entrepreneurial classes in high schools and middle schools, but do you really see that when there's so much testing on math and reading, not really critical thinking? And do you think that that's a -- another avenue that the government can kind of look at or do you see that actually happening?</p><p>AMY WILKINSON: So I think that's a really good question. And I think that's part of the conversation we need to have about education in the United States. And it's also one of the reasons why you see such a strong move towards charter schools, I think, and social entrepreneurs who are trying to infuse other solutions into our U.S. education system.</p><p>So in my data set, for example, I've interviewed Wendy Kopp at Teach For America. That model's been around more than 20 years. That's not a new kind of response, Teach For America. And -- and it's controversial. It's not always thought to be, you know, the best way forward for -- for education.</p><p>But I think you do see a number of social entrepreneurs, social innovators trying to tackle this question from a different angle. I think you do see a number of leaders in business saying \" we need a different education system now; we need a different set of skills.\"</p><p>And in order for businesses to hire people, they -- we do need to reform the K-12 system. I -- I think that's really, I mean, you hear Tom Friedman saying this; you hear a lot of people saying that that is the quiet crisis in the United States is that our education system doesn't seem to be urgent, and yet it's so hugely important for all of us to be focusing on from every single angle. Right?</p><p>I mean, it's great to have this conversation at the Federal Reserve Bank. I mean, it's great because I think that we are seeing that the U.S. education system really does need to be infusing new skills and different skills and testing students in different ways. And in the global system, my research has also gone, you know, I've done a number of interviews in China, in Asia particularly, and other emerging economies and the education systems are different.</p><p>We do have probably students who are more creative and in that way, in some cases, more willing to be entrepreneurial than some of these other systems, but we're really rapidly falling -- falling behind in skill sets.</p><p>So it's a good question and it's something that we -- we definitely need to be focusing on. And I, you know, I think bankers of the world or government policymakers of the world or entrepreneurs of the world -- we all need to be weighing in on this. I mean, this is not to be left to educators or education people alone.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: And we've talked a lot the last two days about the gap between GDP and unemployment. And you alluded to it again, too.</p><p>In terms of closing that gap, it seems like a lot of the causes of it is that, particularly with increased accessibility and advances in technology, businesses are doing more with less.,,And so -- I mean, you see it especially in manufacturing where you have technology doing the work of laborers.</p><p>And so I was wondering if -- how -- if you perhaps envisioned that those types of people who would ordinarily be laborers can be re- tooled to be entrepreneurs themselves? And using increased accessibility to technology to -- for them to create services and commodities more locally, as opposed to being -- having the ambition to be these -- these huge companies?</p><p>And for instance, I think one example is you see actually in D.C., people aren't opening restaurants anymore. They're buying a truck and an iPhone to use as a register and then all of the sudden they're in the food service industry. So is there a way to take that model of skill sets and infusing it with kind of every day people?</p><p>And -- and I think the -- the -- what was said earlier about people thinking of entrepreneurs as the Steve Jobs and sort of these unique figures, if culturally there's something intrinsic that perhaps we have difficulty changing perceptions, as opposed to what it takes to be an entrepreneur, especially locally?</p><p>AMY WILKINSON: Sure. So I think that this is part of -- I mean, it's part of the reason why I'm writing a book is that I believe everyone needs to be an entrepreneur regardless of where you plug in. Meaning if you're in government, you need to be more entrepreneurial and -- and adaptive and nimble if you're starting a nonprofit, if you're starting a business.</p><p>To your example of, you know, if you used to be in manufacturing or if you thought about starting a restaurant, and now you can use technology in a new way, I believe that we do need to have everyone think that entrepreneurship is accessible to them.</p><p>One of the ways is, you know, community colleges, updating skills virtually, are there -- is there online training? I mean, what other vehicles can we use to sort of get this message out to people and enable them to be effective in -- in a new kind of economy because we definitely are moving towards a new kind of economy.</p><p>I mean, there are statistics that say by the time you are 38 years old that people will have, I think it's like 12 or 15 jobs. Right? And that was not my father's career. I mean, my father was 30 years at one company. And so when we see the shift of labor dynamics and the economy and the innovation economy, I think you have isolated one of the really important things is that everyone needs to believe they can be an entrepreneur.</p><p>And this is where the Kauffman data -- I do love the fact that, you know, the average person starting a company or as the Inc. 500 is 40 years old. I mean, we also sort of think that the entrepreneurs are the 20-year-old dropouts from Harvard University like Mark Zuckerberg. And in fact, they're 40 -- right? -- which is great because it means that if you -- you didn't miss the boat at age 20 or 25 or 30 or 35; like, you know, you still can get out there and do it. And since we talked to averages before, I mean, if that's the average, I mean, so you can be a lot older and -- and still be doing that. Right?</p><p>And so it's one of the questions that I grapple with of how do you get this message out. I'm trying to write a commercial book. Simon &amp; Schuster is publishing my book and I'm trying to get it out through a number of different channels. But I -- I do think that entrepreneurship education will come in many forms. So I think the -- the question is a really good one.</p><p>All right. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Amy, thank you so much for your insights. It was really terrific. And I'm glad to know that there is still hope.</p><p>So I want to close by really thanking the people that make this happen, particularly the organizing committee for this -- for this -- this group, this conference.</p><p>It -- my staff continues to delight and surprise me and challenge me intellectually all of the time. It's incredible. They're -- I think someone in one of the earlier panels talked about the privilege of working at the Federal Reserve. And it really -- it really is the case for many of us that work here.</p><p>It's a community of dialogue and openness and looking for the right answer, not -- not just always the political answer or anything along those lines. It really is a tremendous place.</p><p>So I want to thank the lead organizers from the Atlanta Fed, Todd Greene. Thank you, Todd.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we're going to be working together again soon. In 2013, we'll have our biannual Community Development Research Conference and we will be partnering again with the Atlanta Fed. This has been a delight and we're looking forward to working with you again.</p><p>Karen Leone de Nie, who is, I think, Todd's right hand in this.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>From the Kauffman Foundation, Alicia Robb, who really brought them to the table and brought us a whole new look at entrepreneurship. Alicia, thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And then from our team here at the board, Joseph Firschein, who I just can't function without.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And Cayenne Bishop, who -- who is -- never misses a detail on any of these types of conferences and I always have such great confidence when you are involved in anything, so thank you, Cayenne.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>As well as -- well, I don't see them in the room, but Kelly Esman (ph) and Chalice Friar (ph) who make everything work behind the scenes, who get our -- our Internet access going and our webstreaming happening, so thank you to them as well.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So I just wanted to loop back on the -- and close with some thoughts from entrepreneurs themselves on the point I made earlier about what fascinates us about entrepreneurship. So I think entrepreneurship speaks to the fundamental American values of discovery, excellence, optimism, finding a better way to do something, creating the next hip product or making a market or capturing -- it captures our imagination.</p><p>I mean, we'd like to think about that in American -- in American life that we can find a better way to do things.</p><p>So during this proceeding, we explored the role of small business in stabilizing communities, creating jobs, the unique experience and needs of minority-owned businesses, opportunities in urban and rural communities, and the importance of access to capital.</p><p>I went out and googled, I used the Google search engine to -- to look at -- to come up with some quotes from a few entrepreneurs as I thought it would be fitting to close this conference hearing from them.</p><p>So the first one is, \"I never perfected an invention that I did not think about in terms of the service it might give others. I find out what the world needs then I proceed to invent.\" Thomas Edison.</p><p>\"The important thing is not being afraid to take a chance. Remember the greatest failure is to not try. Once you find something you love to do, be the best at doing it.\" Debbi Fields, the founder of Mrs. Fields Cookies.</p><p>And finally, \"We were young but we had good advice and good ideas and lots of enthusiasm.\" Bill Gates, Microsoft.</p><p>So with that, I wish you a good travels home. And this is not the end, certainly, for what we see happening here at the Federal Reserve on this topic. We're going to have many, many more dialogues like this in the future. And we look forward to having you with us again.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

A sense of 'What's the point of it all?' And also a sort of indecision about what I wanted to do.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Luckily for Mr Taylor, those disappointing exam results weren't too much of a setback. He still managed to secure for himself a place at Oxford University to study PPE.</p><p>But for the hundreds of thousands of British schoolchildren whose A-level grades were downgraded by Ofqual's algorithms last week, that is not a feeling they are likely to share.</p><p>Instead, Taylor seems to have clumsily stumbled into the midst of Britain's biggest scandal yet over algorithmic bias - an issue that has exploded into the mainstream. Ministers may have now opted for an about turn but either way this was a debate that was urgently required.</p><p>An obscure article of EU data protection law that covers decisions based on algorithms says individuals \"shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based on automated processing including profiling\" if it has a legal effect on them. Up until now, there has been relatively little scrutiny of the algorithms that increasingly govern our lives.</p><p>From credit checks and insurance premiums to the algorithms used by fast food chains such as McDonald's to sell us more hamburgers, the quiet but steady creep of AI into every facet of our everyday existence has generated a new set of questions over ethics, bias and fairness.</p><p>But while some poor AI decision-making is unlikely to cause too much upset, in others it is socially toxic.</p><p>So it is with the scandal over algorithmic A-level marking, which at a stroke has catapulted this formerly fringe, nerdy issue into millions of British living rooms.</p><p>Algorithms - complex equations used by computers to make decisions - may be fiendishly complex but the problem with relying on them too much to make decisions like this is startlingly simple.</p><p>'At a stroke the fiasco has catapulted this nerdy issue into millions of homes' The judgments they reach are only as good as the data that they are based upon - which is often either incomplete, incorrect or subject to the same human bias that pervades society at large.</p><p>In this case, relying on the use of postcode data and historic school exam grades rather than the judgments of real-life human teachers who know individual pupils, seems like an easy way to exacerbate and embed existing socio-economic bias, to favour weak candidates at better and smaller schools while discriminating against strong pupils from others that have historically underperformed.</p><p>To be fair, it's true that Taylor and his team at Ofqual faced a tough task being forced to rapidly craft an effective exam-marking system during the pandemic, after the cancellation of tests.</p><p>But given the huge importance of these results to the future prospects of millions of young people, how rigorous was the effort to ensure the system was fair? What sort of external oversight existed to monitor the process? And above all, who was regulating the algorithms that were being applied? Perhaps this is the time to ask whether, instead of trying to regulate the big tech companies, it may be more useful to regulate the algorithms being applied to decision-making? In other words - and for want of a better phrase - do we need an \"algorithm tsar\" to help prevent this kind of thing happening again? The person or agency would be responsible for ensuring algorithms were fair and free of bias, laying down ground-rules and would be empowered to approve or reject poorly-designed schemes before they were used.</p><p>After all, this is a highly specialist field of knowledge. Within the Government, only limited expertise exists, often forcing civil servants to rely on third party providers who may have little vested interest in the consequences of their work.</p><p>It's no secret that there is a chronic shortage of skilled professionals in AI. Tencent, the Chinese tech giant, says there are only 300,000 skilled AI engineers globally where millions are needed.</p><p>That means salaries for skilled workers have surged in recent years, often placing them outside the pool of people government departments can realistically seek to recruit.</p><p>Taylor really should have known better than to preside over this fiasco.</p><p>As well as being the chairman of Ofqual, he is also the chairman of the Centre for Ethics and Data Innovation, an independent advisory body to the UK government addressing the benefits and risks of AI. If any organisation was qualified to kick the tyres of Ofqual's algorithms, this was it. Yet so far, perhaps unsurprisingly, the CDEI has been silent on the exam shambles.</p><p>In fact, Taylor himself was strangely prescient about the kind of threat posed by algorithmic decisions of this kind.</p><p>In a CDEI report last year he wrote: \"Artificial intelligence and algorithmic systems can now operate vehicles, decide on loan applications and screen candidates for jobs. The technology has the potential to improve lives and benefit society, but it also brings ethical challenges which need to be carefully navigated if we are to make full use of it.\"</p><p>Quite so.</p><p/><p>'At a stroke the fiasco has catapulted this nerdy issue into millions of homes'</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-162444903</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M9-67W1-DYTY-C0PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"884\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0001YS7</classCode><className>MCDONALD'S CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS722513 LIMITED-SERVICE RESTAURANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC5812 EATING PLACES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>MCD (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000006</classCode><className>ACADEMIC TESTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CTIZ</classCode><className>SCANDALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009JZD</classCode><className>GRADES &amp;

This year there has been a marked slowdown in China's non-financial overseas foreign direct investment (OFDI), which has been down 45 percent year-on-year to $57 billion in 7MCY17. Its potential impact on One Belt, One Road (OBOR), and by extension, CPEC, has been flagged by this column earlier. (Read 'CPEC: risks ahead,' published August 8, 2017).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Operating at the intersection of finance and politics, China's state regulators have been increasingly scrutinizing overseas acquisitions of major Chinese private-sector groups in sectors ranging from electronics and big-tech to luxury hotels and resorts and Hollywood cinemas. But developments reported last week suggest that OBOR may also be in for some belt tightening.</p><p>First, China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) issued guidelines for Chinese firms investing in OBOR countries to avoid 'vicious' competition and corruption. Those guidelines were promptly endorsed by China's State Council (cabinet), which underscored the need to 'pay attention to mutually beneficial cooperation with local governments and companies', through 'eligible domestic enterprises' making investments in OBOR projects. A restricted list of sectors includes 'real estate, hotels, entertainment, sport clubs, outdated industries,' besides 'chaotic regions'.</p><p>So far as numbers go, OBOR-related investments are well on the rise. 'Chinese acquisitions in the 68 countries officially associated with President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy totaled $33 billion as of Aug 14, surpassing the $31bn for all of 2016,' as per Reuters, which also noted a 'smooth approval process for Belt and Road-related deals'.</p><p>Statistics are a hazy thing in China. But the upward trend in OBOR investments is clear. Caixin, the leading Chinese financial journal also noted last week that in 7MCY17, 'New nonfinancial ODI into 50 countries involved in the (OBOR) initiative amounted to $7.65 billion, accounting for 13.4% of the total ODI, 5.7 percentage points higher than same period last year.'</p><p>The recent endorsement of the ongoing OFDI clampdown by the highest level of Chinese government raises some questions for Pakistan's policy planners. Are OBOR-bound investments also in for some shake-up? Should Pakistan, whose OBOR tab is said to be north of $55 billion, brace itself for a slowdown, even as majority of early-harvest CPEC projects reach advanced stages of completion? How would the new policy affect CPEC's hoped-for private-sector spillover for local firms getting in on the act?</p><p>BR Research spoke to a half-dozen independent economists and ex-government officials who keep a close eye on CPEC progress. And the consensus seems to be that CPEC-related Chinese investments will not be affected in the wake of China's restrictive OFDI guidelines. But there was ample word of caution by these individuals, most of who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>'No, CPEC-bound investments will not be affected as China's interest is driven mostly by strategic factors. But the Chinese, who have been patient with Pakistan's bureaucratic inefficiency, wouldn't want CPEC projects to bring bad name to China. Initially they allowed their State-owned enterprises (SOEs) to go in and invest in early-harvest projects. But going forward, I expect scrutiny over the high rates of return that have justifiably been criticised in Pakistan,' according to one Islamabad-based economist.</p><p>Dr. Kaiser Bengali, another distinguished economist, sees things differently. 'I see CPEC's multiplier effect mainly in China. Why would China rein in its investments in Pakistan? Their companies are enjoying high rates of return; they have tax concessions; and now their security is also being paid for by Pakistani taxpayers. They will even bring toilet paper from China as it is tax exempt,' said the outspoken economist.</p><p>As per an influential economist at a leading Islamabad-based think tank, some delays in CPEC projects' implementation may be in the offing, but for different reasons. 'Following some transparency and procurement-related issues in Pakistan, the Beijing-based CPEC monitoring unit has now also been tasked with vetting Chinese SOEs' procurement deals. This may lead to a slowdown in CPEC projects,' he speculated.</p><p>If state-led Chinese investments in CPEC seem secure at the moment, what about the private-sector spillover inspired by all that CPEC activity? Would the new investment guidelines not limit the ambition of Chinese private sector to come in and take a stab at business opportunities here?</p><p>'As for the private sector spillover, I don't see the Chinese private sector going beyond visiting and talking to actually investing at this stage,' said another economist. Dr. Bengali noted that recent security incidents, especially in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, are a setback to building Chinese investor confidence.</p><p>'Having seen that the CPEC's major projects in energy, roads, railways, and ports are being led by the Chinese SOEs, any hopes of private-sector spillover materializing anytime soon are premature. The spillover will depend on how fast the Special Economic Zones come online. I see that happening in the medium term, say anywhere between three to four years,' the think-tank economist commented.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSREC-BUSREC2308201700013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSREC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P9P-WH71-JCH9-G52D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381934</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Business Recorder All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Recorder</publicationName><volume>Vol. 53</volume><issueNumber>No. 233</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 23, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Pakistan</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000255</classCode><className>CAPITAL MOVEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000749</classCode><className>FOREIGN INVESTMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Local Governments</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001627</classCode><className>STATISTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000108</classCode><className>APPROVALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX000752</classCode><className>FOREIGN POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N721110MM</classCode><className>RESORTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE000DA1F</classCode><className>XI JINPING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC302</classCode><className>CHINA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC309</classCode><className>PAKISTAN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Its philosophy is based on the principle that it's far worse to miss out on an opportunity than it is to make a mistake here and there when buying into a company. It has been doing this for 110 years and in that period had to reduce its dividend only once - during the Great Depression, in 1933.</p><p>What's the wisest thing you could tell your 20-year-old self that you didn't know when you started out?</p><p>The present is far more valuable than the regrets over the past or anxiety over the future.</p><p>Facebook, Twitter or Instagram?</p><p>Twitter.

But not learning soon enough the value of having an exit strategy in place before investing must be the biggest.</p><p>What's the best investment you've ever made? And how much of it was due to luck?</p><p>Calling it luck is a bit random, but considering how chaotic markets (and life) are, getting into and out of EOH, mostly in time, was a lot more than I could have wished for, or foresaw at the time.</p><p>What was your first job? And can you remember how much you were paid?</p><p>I trained as a pilot in the SA Air Force. I earned about R500-R700 a month.</p><p>What is your greatest extravagance?</p><p>After all these years, it's still to squeeze in behind a drum kit and make music with a bunch of very talented guys.</p><p>Big Tech or old-fashioned industrial stalwart?</p><p>My achilles heel is people doing &amp; neat&amp; things. My inner nerd has always been attracted to companies that are at the forefront of technology and products. But what I really appreciate is growing dividends and the cash flow to sustain that growth. And companies in either sector can give you that.</p><p>SA or offshore?</p><p>Spreading risk through geographies and currencies is sensible - offshore must be a part of the investment decision.</p><p>How much of a portfolio should be for the wildcard picks?</p><p>It depends on what percentage of your assets you are prepared to write off - immediately. Knowing what the loss will be when you have to sell according to your stop-loss level tells you how many times in a row you can afford to be wrong. Risking 10% of your assets at a time leaves you with about six bad decisions in a row to reduce your investment by half. Personally I don't venture more than 2.5%.</p><p>Art, wine, rare books or cars?</p><p>My partner is a publisher and loves books and reading even more than I do and as a result we live in a house that is basically a library.</p><p>Would you buy your primary home or rent?</p><p>Considering my thoughts on the necessity of offshore exposure, it seems risky to have one's (normally) biggest asset locked in one country. I suspect renting is a more sensible choice.</p><p>If you weren't a fund manager what would your dream job be?</p><p>I am one of the very fortunate few who have managed to have two dream jobs. When I couldn't continue flying, the world of investments seemed interesting. I had no idea that years later it would still be so meaningful and such a joy to be involved in.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLFM-FMfmFM2908MonBlueLabel</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLFM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXN-D8V1-DYT4-K4GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

Yet any regulatory action could have broader implications for the tech sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The FTC has reportedly opened an investigation into Facebook following news that the social networking giant allowed political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica LLC to access roughly 50 million Facebook users' data. The data was harvested from a personality quiz shared on Facebook, which required users to download an app that analyzed their personalities by reviewing information on their Facebook profiles. The developer of the app, which also collected some information about their Facebook contacts, then passed that data along to Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>An FTC inquiry would reportedly focus on whether sharing the information with Cambridge Analytica was a violation of a previously agreed to consent decree between the FTC and Facebook. In order to end an investigation into Facebook's privacy protections on the site back in 2011, Facebook agreed to obtain consent from users before collecting their personal information and sharing it with others.</p><p>Enforcing a legal action against Facebook could be difficult, due to the FTC's divided commission at present. The commission currently just includes Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican that President Donald Trump designated as acting FTC chairman in 2017, and Terrell McSweeny, a Democrat, who was appointed in 2014. Ohlhausen has historically been critical of more government regulation, while McSweeny has been more supportive.</p><p>In a statement emailed to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, an FTC spokesman said the agency was aware of concerns about Facebook, but he could not comment on whether the FTC was investigating the company.</p><p>\"We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously,\" the spokesman acknowledged in the email.</p><p>Facebook's shares gained 2.2% to $171.91 by 1:20 p.m. ET, recovering from a 9.2% fall following the Cambridge Analytica revelations over the first two days of the week.</p><p>Should the FTC move forward with proceedings, Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, said Facebook will need to answer if it clearly outlined to users the parameters of the personality test app, including the possibility that their data could be passed on to other users and whether they could opt out of that.</p><p>However, Goldman also questioned whether the government ultimately has the adequate knowledge and experience to regulate the activities of tech companies and third-party applications.</p><p>\"How do we dial up or down the regulation to cover the situation where we want to encourage a really robust app developer community, but we don't want them going in and misusing data?\" he asked.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is a growing chorus of consumer advocacy groups that seem to be calling on the government to take a bigger role in policing data privacy, calling such incidents a threat to democracy.</p><p>\"Communications technologies have become an essential part of our daily lives, but if we are unable to have control of our data, these technologies control us,\" Nuala O Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology said in a March 17 statement. \"For our democracy to thrive, this cannot continue.\"</p><p>Gene Munster, a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, downplayed the risk of hefty fines for Facebook, saying any FTC ruling likely would amount to less than 5% of Facebook's cash holdings. Yet he warned that any regulatory action could have broader implications for other major tech players, including Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp.</p><p>Notably, Commerce Committee Chairman Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said last month at an FTC nomination hearing that he expects the regulator to have an \"increased focus on the American tech sector and the growing influence of Silicon Valley.\" At the same hearing, discussion centered on whether tech firms that grow too large can wield too much power over consumers and competition.</p><p>\"The risk here is more than just a bad news cycle and [the chance] that Facebook gets a tarnished reputation,\" said Munster. \"The risk is the bigger theme around breaking up big tech [and] this is a slippery slope for regulators.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-43936143</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYH-46R1-F19Y-C2T3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Today it's the fustier crew of competition regulators and policy wonks \u2014 more commonly spotted in carpeted conference rooms \u2014 who appear to have seized the pulpit. Investors in Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.</p><p>will no doubt testify to this shift in power after the threat of U.S. antitrust action caused their shares to fall at the start of this week (Apple's have rallied slightly). There was certainly a great show of purpose from the attendees at an OECD trust-buster gathering that I attended in Paris on Monday, helped no doubt by the Americans finally starting to follow Europe's lead in tackling the tech giants' monopolistic tendencies. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's top competition official, lined up with officials from the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, as well as top regulators from Britain, France and Germany, to offer pointers about what lies in store for the industry. While there's still plenty of tension between officials on both sides of the Atlantic, the overall picture was of a regulatory class that's determined to make up for lost time. Even in Europe, there's a sense of having left too much in the hands of the market for too long. Vestager, looking back over her five-year tenure that resulted in three fines against Google, admitted: \"We could have been faster.\" Regret is a powerful thing, especially when the political pressure to act is rising. The example of Instagram was frequently referred to as something that flew under everyone's radar: Its sale to Facebook for $1 billion was waved through in 2012, largely because it had a handful of staff, earned no revenue and was to be kept at arm's length. The fact that Instagram is now a behemoth in its own right has woken up regulators to the need to take a tougher line on big tech gobbling up promising startups. Instagram had 30 million users at the time Facebook acquired it. Today, it has more than 1 billion. Crucially, Instagram shares vast amounts of user data with its parent network, a practice that drew objections from German regulators earlier this year. Back in 2012, though, there were few concerns: U.K. competition watchdogs wrote at the time that most third parties \"did not believe that photo apps are attractive to advertisers,\" citing the fact that \"limited\" user data was captured. In fairness to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, it's not his fault that he had a more acute grasp of Instagram's potential, but this shouldn't stop the market cops from trying to up their game to avoid even more social media power ending up in one man's hands. How many other Instagrams have flown under the radar? It's hard to say. Andrea Coscelli, head of the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority, estimates that Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have together bought close to 250 companies in the past five years. For every big-budget acquisition like Facebook's WhatsApp deal, there are several like \"tbh,\" a teen social network bought by Zuckerberg in 2017 and quietly shut down afterwards. There's a feeling among regulators that startups aren't really being given the chance to grow and compete \u2014 they get bought as soon as they enter Big Tech's \"kill zone\" (where promising potential rivals are simply taken out). Expect more of a push to tackle this practice, such as by lowering the burden of evidence required to identify potential anti-competitive harm from a takeover. Ariel Ezrachi, professor of competition law at Oxford University, says officials are becoming alert to \"the cost of doing nothing.\" So should Google, Facebook and the rest expect a concerted antitrust crackdown from the U.S. to match the EU's? Maybe, though at the OECD meeting there wasn't much appetite for aggressive action like breakups. Both the DOJ official Andrew Finch and the FTC's Noah Phillips were at pains to stress that size wasn't bad in itself; but \"big, behaving badly,\" is a problem, Finch said. As such, hefty fines are a more likely outcome. While there are plenty of other American voices calling for a revival of the kind of monopoly dismantling seen during the days of John D. Rockefeller, Finch said the current era felt less like the Gilded Age and more like the 1990s and 2000s, when companies used patents to stunt the growth of their rivals. \"These moments tend to work themselves out,\" he told me. Not exactly the kind of tub-thumping in which Elizabeth Warren might engage. So the smart money's still on Europe taking the more adventurous and aggressive antitrust measures. But there's no ignoring the shift on both sides of the Atlantic. People want tougher rules, and they will come. --- Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Brussels.

And for them, the worst is almost certainly yet to come. On Monday, lawmakers in the House announced that they would investigate whether the country's most powerful tech companies had abused their power over the digital economy. Rep. </p><p>David Cicilline, D-R.I., the head of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, made the motivations clear: Four decades of lax antitrust enforcement and bad case law have failed competition and consumers. It's now on Congress to determine whether new laws are needed to police the ever-growing power of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple. (Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) The announcement of the bipartisan investigation added to what had been an already-awful few days for the tech giants. News broke over the weekend and into Monday that the two U.S. antitrust agencies, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, had completed their internal process of deciding jurisdiction over the big four tech companies, with the Justice Department landing Google and Apple, while the FTC will oversee Facebook and Amazon. According to reports, the agencies are now on the precipice of opening antitrust investigations into Google at Justice and Facebook at the FTC. This is not a performance. The agencies don't go through an often arduous clearance process for show. Eight years ago, when the FTC began investigating Google's search practices, then-FTC Chair Jon Leibowitz had to strike a handshake deal with DOJ antitrust chief Christine Varney and agree to give up turf on other matters to get Google. The result was a months-long, staff-intensive investigation that ended only when the commissioners failed to agree on a lawsuit. Swapping oversight of Google and Facebook was probably just as burdensome. The agencies wouldn't go through it if they didn't have serious plans to investigate and potentially sue those companies. As difficult as this moment is for the tech giants, it's only the beginning. For years, antitrust activists have targeted the companies for what they see as abuses of their dominant positions in search, retail commerce, Web hosting, mobile apps, operating systems and other parts of our online world. This week's boiling news cycle shows that those views have penetrated the thinking of antitrust enforcers and policymakers in the United States, who will soon join their international counterparts in investigating the power of the companies and finding ways to fix any possible abuses they find. The proposed fixes span the regulatory and enforcement spectrum. Hal Singer, an economist at Georgetown University, says regulators should apply the same regime to Facebook and Amazon as they do to integrated cable companies such as Comcast and put rules in place stopping them from using their dominant platforms to promote their adjacent products and services. Others propose an approach similar to that of Yale professor Fiona Scott Morton, who has, among other things, suggested creating a new agency that would oversee the tech monopolists and, if necessary, force Facebook and others to allow their users to move their data elsewhere. Even more ardent pro-enforcement folks say structural separation is the only real cure: They argue that the antitrust agencies forcing Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon to spin off Amazon Web Services and so on would bolster competition and consumer freedom. Whatever the fix might be, a fix is coming. There's little to no chance that Google, Facebook and Amazon escape this moment of antitrust scrutiny unharmed, especially given that enforcers around the world have already opened investigations and brought cases against the four. The suspicions and evidence that triggered those probes exist on this side of the Atlantic as well. Now that the agencies have claimed their turf, domestic versions of these investigations could evolve quickly. For all of the grief the FTC has caught for its reluctance to use its authority to make more stringent antitrust rules and bring more aggressive cases, the launch of its digital economy task force suggests imminent enforcement in the tech space. Joe Simons, the FTC's chairman, was at the agency more than a decade ago when it designed a path to revamp its enforcement against harmful hospital mergers: carry out hearings , launch a task force and, eventually, bring cases . Simons has followed that path precisely when examining the digital economy. A major case or two against the big tech companies now firmly in the FTC's jurisdiction - Amazon and Facebook - seems a probable result. And in Congress, the tech giants face two of their most ardent and powerful critics. Lina Khan, counsel for the House antitrust subcommittee, has spent much of her career studying the power of Amazon and the other major tech platforms and has identified ways in which she thinks the companies have violated the law. In Cicilline, the growing pro-enforcement movement has found a lawmaker with both the power and interest needed to drag big tech executives to Capitol Hill and grill them on the power and harms Khan and others have identified. Big Tech's antitrust woes may only grow. Should Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., or Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., win the Democratic nomination and the White House in 2020, scholars like Khan and Morton could quickly find themselves with far more power to make their vision for heightened antitrust enforcement a reality. Rohit Chopra, the FTC's activist Democratic commissioner whom Khan formerly advised, would be the odds-on favorite to take over as chairman. Tech monopolies would be on notice - as would corporate power in agriculture, pharmaceuticals and throughout the economy. Of course, the most extreme scenarios are at least 18 months away. But Facebook and its fellow tech titans have plenty to worry about now. _ _ _ Knox is an editor at Global Competition Review, an antitrust journal and news service.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are moving to investigate Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple over their aggressive business practices, and the House Judiciary Committee has announced an antitrust probe of unidentified technology companies.

This was against the advice of the National Commission of Audit. <br/>As part of his magic act, Treasurer, Joe Hockey, has also kicked in $484 million over five years for the introduction of the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program, in place of  the disappearing innovation programs. <br/>However, with the abolition of other programs also accessed by start-ups and venture capitalists, which trims $845 million over five years, the net effect to the ecosystem is a loss of $361 million. <br/>There was also no mention of the government's \"Cloud-first policy\", however, there still looks to be opportunity for channel players in that space with government agencies looking to achieve efficiencies, according to experts. <br/>Communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told ARN the Government remained committed to better leveraging the benefits of Cloud computing, but would not reveal the reasoning behind the savage cuts to innovation funding. <br/>\"The Department of Finance has recently commenced public consultation on the development of a new Cloud procurement panel - expected to be in operation by December 2014,\" he said. <br/>Turnbull said the Department of Finance would also release a revised Cloud Computing Policy in the coming months. \"The Cloud Computing Policy will make it mandatory for agencies to adopt a Cloud first approach, consistent with the Government's E-Government Policy. </p><p>\"The Department of Communications, the Department of Finance and the Attorney-General's Department are also working to streamline the current data storage policy and guidelines. He said the government had also developed a series of small business guides to help small businesses take advantage of Cloud services. They will be published on the \"The Department of Communications has also developed a Cloud Computing Regulatory Stock Take [RST}, which provides a detailed overview of the regulation affecting the Australian Cloud services market,\" he said. The RST will be published soon.Distribution Central chief executive, Nick Verykios, said the government was robbing the country of innovative opportunity in an attempt to follow accounting process.  <br/>\"As a CEO I am livid, there is no point hiding behind the truth,\" he said.\"Accounting does not run companies, just like accounting does not run countries.  <br/>\"This government has no clue when it comes to the outcomes of investment. They have taken away all the incentives left to invest in this country. Successful businesses have always been the ones who have invested ahead of the curve.\"  <br/>Verykios said questions regarding business confidence were being asked very early in the piece. He reiterated his call for the government to invest in the country's future.  <br/>\"I hope common sense prevails and that the people who thought this was all a good idea are held accountable,\" he said. \"Imagine if I ran my business that way, I would be crucified.  <br/>\"I would like to see them investing significantly in making sure Australia is not an afterthought in the information revolution. I have spoken to a lot of people and the common theme is 'why would you bother to stay here as a company?'\"  <br/>Treasurer, Joe Hockey, said the government's focus would be on strengthening the overall business environment so that enterprises \"large or small\" could create more jobs in Australia.  <br/>Despite this, the government is also yet to move on flagged changes to the Employee Share Share Scheme, which would benefit startups.But, in a rare bright spot, the government not only ignored the National Commission of Audit's recommendation to scrap the Export Market Development grant but also increased funding of the program by $50 million.  <br/>Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA) president, Suzanne Campbell was disappointed the government didn't announce any changes to the current Employee Share Scheme.  <br/>\"In relation to innovation, while applauding the creation of the world's largest medical research endowment fund, the AIIA is seeking to better understand how the establishment of the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Programme will redress the abolition of programs including Commercialisation Australia, Enterprise Connect, Industry Innovation Precincts and Industry Innovation Funds, to ensure that Australia is well positioned to create sustainable prosperity and meet emerging global competition.\"  </p><p>Data#3 managing director, John Grant  said the abolition of the innovation programs would impact the sector, but also cited the need to encourage the private sector to invest more in startups.<br/><br/><br/>\"Predictably, they took some big knives to the whole innovation budget, but it's a pity there weren't more incentives for the private sector.<br/><br/><br/>\"We should be fuelling the creation of new products and services to take to market and this budget doesn't do any of that.\"One would hope they start to leverage some of the levers around incentivising business and venture capital to invest in ICT.\"<br/><br/><br/>Grant said the extra spending in infrastructure, the increase inmedical research funding from the $7 Medicare co-payment and the 1.5 per cent reduction in company tax, would all have a positive flow-on effect for the economy.<br/><br/><br/>\"At the end of the day it's about companies generating more profit and individuals earning more income and paying more tax, and I don't think that was addressed in this budget,\" he said.<br/><br/><br/>\"The only way it's really going to change our balance sheet is by revenue growth.\"<br/><br/><br/>He said the consolidation of government agencies and the continued move to Cloud and IT-as-a-service would help drive the industry. \"There's going to be some reductions in the spend in relation to the implementation of staff reductions and spending cuts.<br/><br/><br/>\"But there will be an increase in spend around Cloud and outsourcing opportunities. Service providers need to re-orient around areas where the spend is going to be and that's something that the channel is very good at.<br/><br/><br/>\"There's been a big government agency consolidation, and that will mean consolidation of IT systems, which will generate opportunity for the industry.\"<br/><br/><br/>Increase efficiencies<br/><br/><br/>Kaseya managing director, Dermott McCann, said the budget was a bit of a non-event and urged the channel to show the market and government how to increase efficiencies through Cloud adoption.<br/><br/><br/>\"If we are going to have to try and do more with less the opportunity is for our channel partners to work closely with the government departments and those other businesses that are affected by the more challenging circumstances,\" he said.<br/><br/><br/>\"Channel partners need to promote Cloud solutions that you can manage remotely, and automate everything.\"<br/><br/><br/>McCann said the IT management area was continuing to grow. \"We don't want to see people losing their jobs but the IT industry needs to speed up the innovative technologies with Cloud automation and that's an opportunity as well as a challenge.\"<br/><br/></p><p>He said it was a shame there was no attempt to close loopholes big tech companies use to avoid paying higher levels of tax.<br/><br/><br/>\"The technology challenges people faced before the budget are no different to what they are today. Resellers need to work closely with their vendors to understand what's changing and why it's changing, and it's an opportunity for everyone.<br/><br/><br/>\"ICT is a significant contributor to the nation. If we can dramatically reduce costs then perhaps the powers that be might look at the next budget and consider investing more in technology and in training up the next generation of IT professionals.\" 2014 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FISVMW-38386045</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FISVMW2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CGY-B4V1-JDJN-60KG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">Syndigate.info</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Financial Services Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35457\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>June 12, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009DIT</classCode><className>SALESFORCE.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>CRM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

First announced by Premier Li Keqiang in 2017 and detailed further Feb. 18, it will link a cluster of Chinese cities, including Shenzhen and Guangzhou, with the autonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Details of the plan were welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, who thanked the central government for placing \"much importance\" on the views of Hong Kong.</p><p>Indeed, analysts and technology experts say Hong Kong's technology, media and telecom companies will flourish with increased cross-border cooperation with mainland companies and the greater sharing of ideas and intelligence.</p><p>The biggest beneficiaries of the GBA plan may be China's largest tech companies.</p><p>The initiative will give Shenzhen-headquartered Tencent Holdings Ltd. a springboard into Southeast Asia, where it has been looking to expand, Salomon Wettstein, a partner at technology consulting firm Synpulse Schweiz AG, said in an interview.</p><p>The company has been actively investing in Southeast Asia, alongside homegrown rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., to secure major equity stakes in the region's leading tech startups. Recently, Tencent invested in Indonesia-based PT Go-Jek Indonesia, while Alibaba led a US$1.1 billion funding round for online retailer PT. Tokopedia.</p><p>In its home market, Tencent's gaming business has been subjected to an industrywide nine-month gaming license approval freeze, followed by its exclusion from three rounds of game lists.</p><p>Given the company's openness toward collaborating with other tech players to build its technology ecosystem, Wettstein added that the GBA plan will be a positive step for the Chinese tech titan's international growth plans.</p><p>The blueprint also focuses on strengthening infrastructural connectivity between the cities to build a tighter network that will ultimately benefit Hong Kong, Lam had said Feb. 21 during a symposium.</p><p>For big tech companies such as Tencent and Alibaba, infrastructural enhancements in terms of transportation, merchandising and payments and other essential services like e-passport \"will be a focal point,\" Charles Wong, chairman of financial technology developer Priv\u00e9 Technologies said.</p><p>Even Shenzhen-headquartered Chinese telecom-equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., which is under global scrutiny primarily from the U.S. due to accusations of espionage, stands to gain from the GBA, according to Nick Marro, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit.</p><p>\"On a more macro level   [the GBA plan] could help with [Huawei's and Tencent's] human resource strategies, by allowing them to more easily tap into talent located in Hong Kong,\" Marro said.</p><p>Microsoft Corp.Hong Kong's director for One Commercial Partner and Small, Medium and Corporate Customers, Serena Cheung, said the geographical disparity and diverse language capabilities within the GBA will also boost the development of artificial intelligence in the region.</p><p>\"Artificial intelligence will play a key role for companies to collaborate and operate more effectively. For example, one of our key [artificial intellligence] breakthroughs is machine translation,\" Cheung said.</p><p>Analysts also point to how Hong Kong-based technology, media and telecom companies may find themselves straddled with regulatory compliance issues.</p><p>Varying approaches to internet governance will affect the most basic day-to-day business functions, which could strain any potential productivity gains under the initiative, Marro said.</p><p>China's cybersecurity legislation enforces stricter regulations, requiring enterprises to constantly self-assess their risk controls and receive governmental seals of approval. These cybersecurity laws also require organizations to notify compliance officers in the event of a data breach. However, in Hong Kong this is entirely voluntary.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-50130801</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHK-DWS1-JDVW-N45T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

They wanted to kill landmark privacy regulations that would soon ban Internet providers, such as Comcast and AT&amp;T, from storing and selling customers' browsing histories without their express consent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So after weeks of closed-door debates on Capitol Hill over who would take up the issue first -- the House or the Senate -- Republican members settled on a secret strategy, according to Hill staff and lobbyists involved in the battle. While the nation was distracted by the House's pending vote to repeal Obamacare, Senate Republicans would schedule a vote to wipe out the new privacy protections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On March 23, the measure passed on a straight party-line vote, 50 to 48. Five days later, a majority of House Republicans voted in favor of it, sending it to the White House, where President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>signed the bill in early April without ceremony or public comment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"While everyone was focused on the latest headline crisis coming out of the White House, Congress was able to roll back privacy,\" said former Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler, who worked for nearly two years to pass the rules.</p><p>The process to eliminate them took only a matter of weeks. The blowback was immediate.</p><p>Constituents heckled several of the lawmakers at town halls. \"You sold my privacy up the river!\" one person yelled at <person><nameText>Sen. Jeff Flake, </nameText></person>R-Ariz. -- lead sponsor of the Senate bill -- at a gathering in April. Several late-night comedians roasted congressional Republicans: \"This is what's wrong with Washington, D.C. I guarantee you there is not one person, not one voter of any political stripe anywhere in America who asked for this,\" Stephen Colbert said.</p><p>The quick undoing of the Internet privacy rules has prompted lawmakers in more than a dozen states to propose local laws to restore privacy protections to their constituents.</p><p>The FCC privacy rules were among the first of more than a hundred regulations and laws being targeted for elimination or massive overhaul by Trump and Republican members of Congress who want to dismantle Obama-era regulations they view as burdensome.</p><p>How the privacy rules came to be undone helps to explain and inform the strategies behind the broader range of Republican initiatives in the works. The rollback of privacy, for example, was the first step by the Republican-led FCC to overhaul Obama-era net neutrality rules.</p><p>The rolling crises within Trump's administration and Republican infighting has slowed Republican lawmakers' work on Capitol Hill. But they remain positioned to capitalize on their control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, a power structure that has not existed in more than a decade.</p><p>\"Trump and the Republicans are doing so many different things on parallel tracks, the news media and activists can't follow it all,\" said Trump adviser and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \"This is by design.\"</p><p>The Internet privacy rules were adopted in October during the last days of the Obama administration after an intense battle that pitted large Internet service providers, the advertising industry and tech giants against consumer advocates and civil rights groups.</p><p>The rules required Internet service providers to get explicit consent before they gather their customers' data -- their browsing histories, the locations of businesses they physically visit and the mobile applications they use -- and sell it to third parties. Proponents said the rules were necessary because consumers must use a provider to access the Internet.</p><p>The requirements were modeled after a law passed decades ago by Congress that prohibited telephone companies from collecting customers' calling histories and selling the information to third parties. \"There has been an expectation from the beginning of the telecommunications era that your privacy is not up for sale,\" said Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., who fought to preserve the rules.</p><p>The industry, Republican FCC commissioners and lawmakers said the restrictions were too broad and should be limited to highly sensitive data, such as personal medical information, not data gathered from activities like online car shopping. The rules, they said, would cause consumers to miss out on customized promotions. And, opponents said, the threat to privacy was overstated -- a provider might learn that a person visited a website but would not typically know what the person did while there.</p><p>Because the commission's privacy rules passed on a party-line vote, three Democrats in favor and two Republicans opposed, the rules were viewed as extremely partisan. This made them vulnerable from the start, said Jon Leibowitz, co-chair of the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, a group financed by Internet providers, which led the effort to eliminate the requirements.</p><p>The campaign to kill the FCC rules began just a few weeks after Trump's November victory.</p><p>Lobbyists from trade groups funded by large broadband companies -- including Leibowitz's group and the Consumer Technology Association -- made phone calls and held small, private meetings with Republican congressional aides, according to Hill staff, consultants and lobbyists on both sides of the issue. They were shopping for bill sponsors and approached Flake and Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who had been vocal opponents of the rules when they were being crafted at the FCC. The two agreed to champion the cause.</p><p>\"We had a broad coalition of groups, and we thought, 'We don't like it; let's present this to them,' \" said Julie Kearney, vice president of regulatory affairs with the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group for the industry. \"The administration and Congress did not come to us.\"</p><p>Flake and Blackburn declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Kearney said trade groups for Internet service providers asked Congress to use a legislative maneuver under the Congressional Review Act that allows Congress to kill recently adopted regulations with a simple majority vote. Before the 2016 elections, the 21-year-old act had been used only once, in 2001. Since November, Congress and Trump have employed it 14 times to kill Obama-era initiatives.</p><p>\"The last administration was very aggressive with regulations,\" Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., who voted to eliminate the privacy rules. \"We are looking for the quickest ways to do something about it.\"</p><p>By January, trade groups for tech companies such as Facebook and Google had joined the fight to undo the privacy rules, according to records and interviews. Those companies are regulated by a different government body, the Federal Trade Commission, but they worried that Congress might someday find a way to expand the reach of the rules so that they apply to all technology companies.</p><p>Trade groups for large advertisers also got involved in the effort to repeal the law, as did the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Consumer and civil rights groups were quickly outnumbered by their opponents, by a ratio of at least 50 to 1, according to Hill staff and lobbyists.</p><p>\"This collaboration between Silicon Valley and cable companies has never been done before,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president and chief executive of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit that advocates for an open Internet and affordable technology. \"Their united, massive economic and political power was insurmountable.\"</p><p>During the battle, Flake and Blackburn received large campaign donations from eight of the major Internet providers and big tech companies that wanted to see the rules killed, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>The groups gave Flake $22,700 in donations, compared with an average $4,510 they gave other senators between January and April. The groups gave Blackburn $20,500, compared with the $2,045 average donated to other House members in the same time. That is about three times the amount of money Flake and Blackburn received from those groups during the first quarter of last year.</p><p>Groups that worked to preserve the FCC rules donated no money to lawmakers during the first quarter of this year, according to the analysis.</p><p>By February, neither the House nor the Senate had introduced a bill. It appeared to some that the issue may have stalled -- which caused several consumer and civil rights groups such as the Color of Change to let down their guard.</p><p>\"We didn't think they would have the audacity to go after privacy . . . We dismissed the low rumblings,\" said Brandi Collins, a senior campaign director at Color of Change, who said data-directed advertising often targets minorities.</p><p>By the end of February, the trade groups for large Internet providers, the advertising industry and tech companies were working in tandem with congressional members who had taken up their cause. Howard Waltzman, a lawyer and lobbyist for the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, said this was \"the pivotal moment.\"</p><p>An opinion piece under Flake's byline appeared in the Wall Street Journal on March 1, saying the rules took away \"consumer choice\" because people's browsing histories could not be used to offer them \"innovative and cost-saving product offerings.\" The column said the rules would \"create confusion\" among customers because the FCC and FTC would regulate different parts of the \"Internet ecosystem.\" The same arguments and similar phrasing were used in a letter the industry coalition sent to Congress.</p><p>Hours after Flake's opinion piece appeared in the Journal, he introduced a Senate bill to kill the rules. A week later, Blackburn did the same in the House.</p><p>For weeks, neither Flake nor Blackburn scheduled a vote because members feared a potential backlash from voters, according to lobbyists and several Hill staff members.</p><p>\"There was a bit of chicken played between the House and Senate,\" said Dallas Harris, another lobbyist for Public Knowledge.</p><p>Finally, Flake scheduled the vote for March 22. It was not until then that the campaign against it took off.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union, Free Press and other groups delivered a petition with 100,000 signatures to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other congressional leaders hours before the Senate began its debate on the bill.</p><p>When Senate Republicans passed the bill the following day on a narrow party-line vote, the issue finally exploded across the Internet and in mainstream, liberal and conservative media.</p><p>NBC, CNN, FOX and MSNBC carried stories about the vote. And conservative online platforms -- such as Breitbart News and Reddit sites devoted to Trump -- were packed with posts from Trump supporters who were angry about the bill.</p><p>More than 20,000 calls flooded House members' office phone lines, and more than a dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus -- a congressional group of conservative and libertarian Republicans -- told Blackburn they would likely not vote for the bill, several Hill staff told The Washington Post.</p><p>Waltzman said the fight intensified: \"Suddenly, we were dealing with flat-out lies. Members were saying, 'These companies can see literally everything you do online.' That is simply not true.\"</p><p>Fearing more House Republicans could defect, Hill staff said, McConnell and other Republican leaders asked the Trump administration to issue a statement signaling that he would sign the bill. The White House staff did so.</p><p>Within hours, Blackburn introduced the bill on the House floor and called for a vote.</p><p>Rep. Michael E. Capuano, D-Mass., took to the floor, screaming: \"What are you thinking? . . . Just last week I bought underwear on the Internet. Why should you know what size I take? Or the color? Or any of that information?\"</p><p>Fifteen Republicans voted against the bill, but the measure still passed 215 to 205.</p><p>---</p><p>The Washington Post's Alice Crites contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLTRIB-5345578</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLTRIB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NNS-D6B1-DYT5-M12G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1956\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>May 30, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>RULES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>PRIVACY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>INTERNET</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>GROUPS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>BILL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CONGRESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>VOTE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FLAKE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>REPUBLICANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TRUMP</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Warren's proposal last week to classify some technology giants as utilities and undo previous industry mergers jolted Silicon Valley. It also hit a nerve among Democrats and Republicans in Congress, who've grown increasingly concerned that curbs on anticompetitive conduct are poorly enforced. That all but ensures that restraining the power of dominant companies will be a focus of the 2020 campaign as Democrats seek to unseat President Donald Trump. Later this month, presidential candidates Amy Klobuchar and Julian Castro are set to appear at an Iowa event along with Warren to discuss monopoly power in rural communities. </p><p>Still, Warren's prescription for targeting big tech is not without political and legal risks. Breaking up a company would entail years of litigation and could alienate some voters who enjoy its services. And even advocates of reining in big companies aren't necessarily on board. \"Elizabeth Warren's proposal is very radical because it's front-running the intellectual debate rather than codifying what the intellectual debate has produced,\" said Luigi Zingales, director of the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago. \"The people who think there is a problem are probably in the minority, even in the academic world.\" Warren's broadside is part of a wider rethinking of antitrust enforcement in the U.S. that until now has been mostly relegated to legal conferences and academic papers. At its heart is the view that antitrust officials have fallen down on the job, leaving broad swaths of the economy dominated by large firms insulated from competition. Plenty of lawyers and economists dispute there's a problem, but its proponents have pushed the break-em-up idea to center stage in the antitrust circles of Washington and academia. There's a split on how to deal with the issue. One view, advanced by Barry Lynn's Open Markets Institute in Washington, calls for throwing out the current playbook and reorienting antitrust enforcement away from its emphasis on consumer prices. Lynn advocates for reining in the ability of big platforms to squeeze sellers. One way to do that \u2014 which Warren embraces \u2014 is prohibiting tech platforms from moving into different lines of business where they can abuse their power as middlemen. Another camp supports stepped-up enforcement under the existing framework based on consumers. That's a balanced approach that was articulated at a conference last week in Washington that featured former Justice Department and FTC officials. It's an approach Warren would reject, said William Kovacic, a former FTC commissioner who is now a professor at George Washington University Law School. \"She'd say, \u2018it's nice and it's cute, but you guys don't have the guts or the vision to see what has to be done and I do and everything that went on in here is a timid response to a serious problem, and the house is burning down and you still want to water the bushes in the backyard,'\" Kovacic said. Warren's not alone in favoring a more aggressive approach. Joe Simons, the head of the Federal Trade Commission, has acknowledged the possibility enforcers may have fallen short. He set up a task force last month to investigate tech companies and possibly unwind past mergers. The chairman of the House's antitrust panel, Democratic Congressman David Cicilline said earlier this year that when it comes to tech companies, \"every option is on the table.\" Talk like that would have been dismissed as fanciful just a couple of years ago when Silicon Valley was the darling of the Obama administration. Now it's grappling with what increasingly seems to be an existential threat. And it's coming not just from liberal Democrats like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Even Republicans are on the attack. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri told the Conservative Political Action Conference this month that Facebook and Google are \"a law unto themselves\" and are threatening competition. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas even retweeted Warren, saying she was right to criticize Facebook for having too much power. Warren has called for legislation that would treat large tech companies like Amazon as utilities and ban them from owning participants on the platform. Under that scenario, Amazon's marketplace, for example, would be split from its AmazonBasics business. Google search would be spun off from the rest of the company. Warren also said she'd seek to undo past mergers that she said undermined competition, including Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and Google's purchase of DoubleClick. Preventing tech platforms from moving into other lines of business \u2014 also called vertical integration \u2014 is an idea backed by Lina Khan, an antitrust scholar who wrote an influential paper on Amazon's threat to competition. Khan, who was recently hired to work for the House antitrust subcommittee, lauded Warren's proposal. She argues that separation addresses the risk that technology platforms like Amazon and Google will discriminate against companies that depend on them. Breaking up companies is practically unheard of today in antitrust enforcement. The last example occurred in 1982 when AT&amp;T reached a settlement with the Justice Department to give up its local phone companies. Nearly 20 years later in the U.S. antitrust case against Microsoft, a federal judge ordered the company split up, a decision later reversed on appeal. Warren, like many others, credited the Microsoft case for paving the way for Google's success. Since then, U.S. enforcers don't have much to show when it comes to policing tech platforms, while European officials have brought antitrust cases against Google and Facebook. The FTC and Justice Department are frequently criticized for approving mergers that allowed Facebook and Google to strengthen their dominance. In 2013, the FTC under President Barack Obama closed an investigation into whether Google violated antitrust laws by skewing search results. Some experts are still mystified by that decision. \"Why didn't you pull the trigger? You had the shot,\" Kovacic said. \"That's what they have not answered for us.\" Bringing a case today to force a breakup of a tech company (let alone three of them) would require years of litigation and face a skeptical judiciary, according to Kovacic. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled against a group of states and the U.S. in an antitrust case against American Express Co. that some saw as hobbling enforcement against tech platforms. And there's a risk Warren's proposal will alienate some voters, given that people understand the benefits the companies provide, said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. While her vision will find support among liberal Democrats, Crane said, it also resonates in some quarters on the right. Former Trump adviser Stephen Bannon reportedly supports regulating Google and Facebook like utilities. \"The question is how deep will the political support be for the kind of very aggressive change in direction that Liz Warren is pushing,\" said Crane. \"Will she ultimately get traction and will it turn into votes? I'm a little skeptical that's going to happen for her.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Sen.

It wasn't a warning about offensive content, cyber security or online privacy. Rather, it was about rallying its millions of users to help protect the company's business model and data secrecy.   The Australian Government is boldly going where no other country has gone in taking on tech giants Google and Facebook. It has proposed a new \" Mandatory News Media Bargaining Code \" which would require these two tech giants to do two things.   One, they would have to pay Australian media companies a fair amount for the use of their journalism.   Two, they would have to hand over a lot more information about the data they collect on their prized algorithms.   The Australian Government is boldly going where no other government has gone before in taking on Facebook and Google. ( Reuters: Dado Ruvic ) The special sauce  Around the same time as these pop-up warnings began to appear, Google quietly reached out to Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. Government sources say the tech giant signalled a preparedness to pay up. Exactly how much it was willing to offer media companies is unclear, but somewhere in the \"tens of millions of dollars per year\".   Money, it seems, wasn't the main concern. The red line for Google was apparently the data sharing.   Under the mandatory code proposed by the competition regulator, Google and Facebook would be required to provide media companies with \" clear information about the data they collect through users' interactions with news on digital platforms; for example how long users spend on an article, how many articles they consume in a certain period, and other information about user engagement with news content across digital platform services\".  Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume. Watch Duration: 1 minute 39 seconds 1 m 39 s  Communications Minister Paul Fletcher says Facebook has made \"heavy-handed\" threats.  They would also have to give \"28 days' notice of algorithm changes likely to materially affect referral traffic to news, algorithm changes designed to affect ranking of news behind paywalls, and substantial changes to the display and presentation of news, and advertising directly associated with news\".   This information about which news stories and ads appear in your Facebook feed or Google search goes to the heart of the business models of these technology companies.   It's the \"special sauce\" they will guard jealously to the end. This is what the fight is really about. With the rest of the world watching, Google and Facebook do not want a precedent set here in Australia.  The nuclear option  Facebook has now upped the ante, joining the Google approach of trying to harness its millions of users to pressure the Government. It's threatening to ban Australian users from accessing news content from its site completely to avoid having to comply with this new law.   Google has also reacted fiercely against the proposal. ( Unsplash: Mitchell Luo )  This is the nuclear option. Stopping users sharing legitimate news content may not necessarily be easy, but it can be done.   If Facebook does pull the trigger and block all news content, the company's Australian boss Will Easton reckons media companies will be worse off. \"During the first five months of 2020 Facebook sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's news feed to Australian publishers,\" he says, suggesting this traffic was worth about $200 million to the media companies.   The companies themselves scoff at this, arguing it's Facebook making far more by using and monetising their journalism.   Some fear a threat to democracy too if Facebook carries out its threat. Roughly one third of Australians access their news via the social media platform and if trusted journalism disappears from the site, fake news and all manner of conspiracies could prosper.  A high stakes stand-off  This is a high stakes stand-off. If Facebook is right, it won't end well for media companies, millions of loyal users or the Government.  Crushed: Digital giants vs Australian media  Within a couple of years the likes of Google and Facebook will devour more than half local ad revenues, leaving only crumbs for traditional media players.  Read more  Communications Minister Paul Fletcher casts doubt on the Facebook threat, pointing out \"it's not without precedent for (the tech giants) to make heavy-handed threats\".   Privately though, senior government figures don't think Facebook is bluffing at all.   Given what's at stake globally for the tech giants, few doubt they will go ahead with sacrificing the quality of their Australian operations to avoid this law.   So, will there be much political blowback for the Coalition from angry Facebook and Google users? The calculation within the Government is \"not much\". The view is Australians will support this new law in the interests of \"fairness\" and will simply seek their news content elsewhere. We'll see.   The reality is, the Government can hardly back down now. To do so, particularly when media companies are cheering it on, would be a humiliating capitulation.    As the Treasurer has said, \"we don't respond to coercion or heavy-handed threats\". That means no retreat in the big tech battle.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42978556369</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RH-4DT1-JCSC-J1N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ABC Online</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 2, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But she shouldn't deny it. Everything she said (her top three quotes below) contains a truth that publishers should take to heart:</p><p>\"Mark doesn't care about publishers.\"</p><p>? Mark Zuckerberg actually does care about publishers, insofar as he cares about using news to increase user engagement on the platform, sources close to the Facebook CEO have told me.</p><p>? What Zuckerberg doesn't care about is supporting news publishers for the sake of supporting news publishers, these sources said. His primary concern is engaging users, not satisfying content creators.</p><p>\"We will help you revitalize journalism ... in a few years the reverse looks like I'll be holding your hands with your dying business like in a hospice.\"</p><p>? News publishers can't exist without digital distribution any more than publishers in 19th century could exist without the printing press.</p><p>? The platform doesn't necessarily have to be Facebook, but until another tech behemoth steps up and supplants Facebook -- with an audience of 2.5 billion across its services -- as the global social network, that platform is going to be Facebook.</p><p>\"We are not interested in talking to you about your traffic and referrals any more. That is the old world and there is no going back.\"</p><p>? Facebook has spent the last year reducing the traffic it sends to publishers, and prffublishers need to wake up to that.</p><p>? Without free traffic from Facebook, news publishers need to strengthen their brands and create content people are willing to pay for. If you feel like you're running into more paywalls these days, that's why.</p><p>The Big Picture: Journalism is a business, not a charity project. We've heard too many journalists criticize Facebook as if it had an obligation to support journalism. It doesn't. Publishers have an obligation to understand their business, including the changing nature of distribution, and respond accordingly.</p><p>Zuckerberg chases interactive</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg believes the future of video is interactive, sources with knowledge of his thinking tell me. That means rather than passively watching shows while engaging on a second screen, you will engage directly with shows, their hosts and other viewers through the primary screen.</p><p>TechCrunch's Josh Constine reports that Facebook \"has acqui-hired Vidpresso, buying its seven-person team and its technology but not the company itself\":</p><p>? \"The six-year-old Utah startup works with TV broadcasters and content publishers to make their online videos more interactive with on-screen social media polling and comments, graphics and live broadcasting integrated with Facebook, YouTube, Periscope and more.\"</p><p>? \"The goal appears to be to equip independent social media creators with the same tools these traditional outlets use so they can make authentic but polished video for the Facebook platform.\"</p><p>The Big Picture: Zuckerberg is \"racing against Twitch, YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat to become [the place] where people watch together and don't feel like asocial slugs afterward.\"</p><p>A Passage to India</p><p>Sign of the global times: \"Facebook has struck a landmark deal with Spain's top soccer league to broadcast its matches in India,\" my colleague Charles Riley reports. \"The games will be shown live and for free\" ... and will also broadcast \"in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal.\"</p><p>The next time Facebook says \"we're not a media company,\" remind them that they broadcast one of the most popular sports leagues in the world to a region of nearly 2 billion people.</p><p>YouTube's New Upfront</p><p>We wrote in June about how companies like YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat are letting content creators monetize their accounts, creating a new economy for every creative mind with a smartphone or computer.</p><p>Bloomberg's Lucas Shaw now reports that YouTube is paying talent upfront \"to use and promote new features.\" The amounts range from \"tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\"</p><p>What else they're offering:</p><p>? \"YouTube has [made] it easier for creators to sell merchandise and [expand] the number of users who can sell a monthly subscription.\"</p><p>? \"The new Super Chat lets fans of a given YouTube star pay to highlight their messages in live streams.\"</p><p>Facebook and Amazon's Twitch are also experimenting with monetization efforts. As we wrote in June, New TV is still a nascent economy, but it's likely to grow more sophisticated -- and lucrative -- as creators explore new ways of using the medium.</p><p>The fight against Big Tech</p><p>The activists who took on Facebook and Google to give users more control over their data -- the great resource of our time -- have received the New York Times Magazine treatment, compliments of Nicholas Confessore.</p><p>We can't recommend this piece highly enough:</p><p>? \"To Silicon Valley, personal information had become a kind of limitless natural deposit ...

There's only one problem: Facebook has now categorized you as a patient, and you constantly receive targeted ads about local cancer services that show up on your computer screen at work for all your co-workers to see, right when you're up for a big promotion. Many users experience a version of this scenario when they receive creepily personalized ads while browsing on Facebook. When those ads follow users onto sites outside Facebook, it feels like an invasion of privacy. But how do you regulate data privacy in an age of big-data black boxes?</p><p> Mark Zuckerberg's testimony about the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal alerted users about what personal data Facebook routinely collects and shares with third-party apps. But many questions were left unanswered. How many apps are collecting this data, and what are they doing with it? Are there more Cambridge Analyticas out there? It took a political scandal to get the attention of Congress this time. Where will it happen next, and how long will it be before the public finds out? While Zuckerberg claimed that even he is not fully aware of everything that happens in the Facebook digital economy, the evidence suggests that health-care information may lead to the next major data-related crisis. In early April, MSNBC reported that Facebook recently launched a project based in its secretive \"Building 8\" group to get hospitals to share anonymized patient data with them. The project was reportedly put on hold in the wake of the current scandal, but the stated plan was to match hospitals' patient data on diagnoses and prescription information with Facebook so the company could combine that data with its own to construct digital profiles of patients. Even setting aside the voluminous evidence showing that true anonymization of data is virtually impossible, Facebook's stated intent was never to leave the data anonymized. But requesting the hospitals' data in that form would allow Facebook to sidestep the issue of obtaining patients' consent, as required by federal law. The company has reason to believe that, if asked, patients would not consent to this practice. In 2016, Facebook was sued by a metastatic cancer patient who accused the company of violating his privacy by collecting data about his participation on cancer websites outside of Facebook. The case was dismissed and is under appeal, but this clearly has not stopped the company from pursuing data initiatives in health care. Indeed, Zuckerberg admitted in his congressional testimony last week that Facebook does collect some medical data from users. Considering the large number of patient support groups on Facebook that use the site for peer-to-peer health care and social support, there is plenty of medically-relevant data to be mined. Membership in some patient groups numbers in the tens of thousands, with average daily posts of several hundred or more. A sampling of the types of data users post includes \"tests, treatments, surgeries, sex drive, and relationships\" on a breast cancer support site. Other data include location, personal profile information such as age, race, sex, educational background, employment, even cellphone numbers. In addition, many posts include photos that can be subjected to facial recognition software. It is not surprising that Facebook wants to move into the digital health market: So does Amazon.com, Google, Apple, Uber and all of the other big tech companies. These businesses see an opportunity to profit from user's personal health data because, unlike narrowly defined medical data, health and wellness data is not considered protected health information and therefore is not protected by privacy laws. In contrast to the personal data users might post on Facebook, patient records at hospitals and other covered entities are protected by privacy laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Yet, for years, patient data has been sold to medical data miners and brokers in a multibillion-dollar global trade. The pharmaceutical industry is a major player in this marketplace, spending billions of dollars annually on direct-to-consumer advertising aimed at influencing physicians' prescribing practices and patients' requests for brand-name drugs. But social media companies such as Facebook struggled to attract this lucrative advertising market. In June 2017, Facebook addressed this challenge by convening drug marketers at the inaugural Facebook Health Summit, an event where the company wooed the pharmaceutical industry with new features designed to address their specific needs. Danielle Salowski, Facebook's industry manager for health, said the company re-engineered their advertising features so pharmaceutical advertisers could turn off comments on their Facebook brand pages and on their ads, to help them avoid the negative publicity associated with the legal requirement of reporting adverse reactions to drugs. This activity could simply be understood as advertising in the age of big data, a practice our society has so far agreed to accept. But the unique risks from health- and medical-data mining and digital profiling of patients suggests greater stakes worthy of regulatory attention. Congress accused Facebook of illegal marketing of opioids and noted that many other types of drugs are also sold on the platform. Patients with life-threatening conditions or limited means to pay for health care are at greater risk of harm from targeted advertising of products or services by unscrupulous vendors. In addition, the lack of transparency, increasing interconnection of health and technology, and growing reliance on risk modeling in health care means that combining health- and medical-data sources to target patients could harm anyone who has a serious illness or the risk of developing one. The insurance industry uses social media intelligence and profiling to inform algorithms that automate pricing, claims handling and fraud detection. When health risks are understood as financial risks, contextual information from users' digital profiles can be used against them to raise premiums or deny claims. That means everyone is at risk. Members of Congress were criticized for displaying through misguided questions their lack of understanding about how Facebook works. But in the current data economy, Facebook and other big tech companies operate as black boxes that are impossible for outside users to fully understand. We really don't know most of the time what is being done with the data we post online, except when housing discrimination, exploitative advertising practices or foreign interference in elections is exposed. The Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed that at least 87 million of us are at risk of being exploited or discriminated against. And really, why should we trust Facebook and third-party app developers to respect users' privacy when their business model depends on doing the opposite? Facebook clearly recognizes the enhanced value of its user data when combined with medical data. That should tell lawmakers that the definition of \"protected health information\" needs an update. If we can still think of big data as something that could be harnessed for social benefit, we need to create regulations that allow users to consent to participate, like they do in clinical trials. We don't need to lock down all the data; we just need to distribute the power to access and share it so patients and future patients receive benefits, rather than harms, from sharing their experiences online. * Ostherr is a media scholar and digital health technology researcher at Rice University.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mark Zuckerberg's testimony about the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal alerted users about what personal data Facebook routinely collects and shares with third-party apps.

The shutdown is also starting to create serious problems for financial technology firms -- slowing dealmaking, impairing supervision and casting a pall over the presumed pre-eminence of the U.S. as a fintech superpower.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's coming as quite a surprise for many Silicon Valley investors and Wall Street firms that have long viewed the federal government as a drag on innovation rather than a facilitator of it. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The federal government's influence on fintech is proving even more expansive than many expected, touching on the latest developments in banking, derivatives, securities, online lending and more.  The halt of most agency operations is impacting a host of key issues concerning every fintech business, from the rate at which money can be raised to how (and even whether) business plans are finalized. However, not all pockets of the industry are impacted in the same way.</p><p>Most visibly affected are companies issuing securities to raise capital.  Large technology firms planning to do initial public offerings (IPOs) -- think Lyft, Airbnb and Slack -- could be affected with no one at the Securities and Exchange Commission to process registration statements of firms seeking to sell stock to the public. Planned IPOs would then have to be delayed, and if the stock market deteriorated, indefinitely postponed.  In any event, when the SEC reopens, staff face a daunting backlog of filings.</p><p>But the problem isn't just with the big tech firms.</p><p>Under the radar are also dozens of delays facing technology startups that have filed to make securities offerings as \"mini-IPOs\" under Regulation A+.  Among them are cryptocurrency and blockchain-related firms.  </p><p>In 2018, the SEC asserted  jurisdiction in the sector and held that most (if not all) initial coin offerings (ICOs) were securities, and that would-be ICO issuers needed to register or find a proper alternative route like private offerings or Regulation A+ offerings.  However, with SEC staff furloughed, dozens of the latter can't be reviewed and processed, grinding new issuances to a halt. Only companies that were deemed \"qualified\" (or registered) with the SEC before the crisis will be able to move forward.</p><p>Not Just IPOs ...</p><p>Marketplace lenders that securitize their loans face similar problems.  Again, with no SEC staff in place, online lenders will be prevented from getting permission from the agency to repackage their loans and sell them to investors in the public market.  To make do, many platform lenders may find themselves stuck with loans and dependent on bridge and credit financing during the shutdown. The irony, of course, is that some of these very same lenders might also be serving as emergency backstops for cash-strapped federal workers who aren't being paid -- and with few means to sell their loans off to investors, many online lenders might have to charge higher rates for furloughed borrowers.</p><p>Other intermediaries face even stiffer challenges.  </p><p>The SEC has held that online platforms that trade digital assets must register with the agency as  broker-dealers, alternative trading systems, or national securities exchanges.  Yet the registration of such intermediaries -- many of them nervous about the legality of their own operations as unlicensed market participants -- is impossible with an agency on furlough. Notably, some aren't even sure whether their compliance meets newly declared expectations, and there is no one to confirm or deny it.</p><p>Similarly, applications for bitcoin-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) won't happen until the shutdown standoff ends, and neither will registrations for less controversial, but highly popular, robo-advisers.  </p><p>Although most federal agencies have kept some enforcement staff on duty, surveillance efforts are sure to be impaired.  Most enforcement staff will be preoccupied with prosecuting offenses already being litigated (to the extent federal courthouses are still open).  New cases, in the meantime, will likely slow dramatically.  The Federal Trade Commission's Complaint Assistant website, for example, has been shut down entirely.</p><p>Policy Development Frozen</p><p>Fintech policy development is for the most part on hold across the country.  </p><p>On Dec. 11, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission requested comments on Ether and its use on the Ethereum Network in order to better inform its understanding of the technology, mechanics and markets for virtual currencies beyond bitcoin.  The comment period won't expire until mid-February, but there is no staff in place to begin undertaking the review.</p><p>Meanwhile, the in-house think tanks for the agency -- the so-called advisory committees that discuss issues like cybersecurity and virtual currency policy -- have canceled meetings, even though most members have jobs in the private sector.</p><p>The partial government shutdown has also, according to the National Law Review, hampered the Treasury Department's many anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an office tasked with writing and applying guidelines for money transmitters, won't be working on regulatory guidance or rulemaking. It also won't be able to assist requests made by foreign law enforcement agencies for financial intelligence. Though sufficient staff will remain to allow FinCEN to maintain the IT systems that banks, online lenders, fintech firms and others use to file Suspicious Activity Reports, it is unclear whether there will be enough people in place, if any, to monitor them.  </p><p>And nobody is working from home, either for free or out of patriotism: By rule, furloughed workers are not permitted to even check their government email.</p><p>Not all regulators have been impacted in such dramatic ways, however.  </p><p>Both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve aren't subject to congressional appropriations and thus are able to function normally.  State agencies are similarly unaffected. Thus, the processing of banking licenses will continue, as will the development of policy at the FDIC, in particular aiming to make banks as competitive as fintech firms. Interestingly, issuers can still conceivably engage in intrastate offerings with state regulators.</p><p>Another surprisingly unscathed agency is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which receives its funding from the Fed.  As such, key initiatives, including its new innovation sandbox, remain actively under development.  Similarly, because the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is funded through assessments on banks, its operations, including the development of its \"fintech charter\" program, will continue, as will its assessment of potential applicants.</p><p>Finally, the processing of crowdfunding portals applications can continue since they are for the most part done by the self-regulatory body, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.</p><p>Still, with the shutdown continuing with no obvious end in sight, it's worth wondering just how much damage the dysfunction is ultimately wrecking the reputation of the U.S. as an attractive place to launch and do fintech business.  With other regimes in Europe, and even Asia, working actively to add clarity and stronger protections, a prolonged halt to government functions could spell trouble for America's competitiveness in the sector.</p><p>Editor's Note: Brummer is a professor at Georgetown Law.

But the tech executives weren't the only ones who came prepared for class on Wednesday. Senators on the Intelligence Committee clearly did their homework on a wide range of technical topics, and they peppered the executives with questions on issues ranging from doctored videos known as \"deepfakes\" to encryption. The grilling marked a stark departure from hearings earlier this year with Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, when senators on the Judiciary and Commerce committees were panned for their technical illiteracy. </p><p>CBS News tweeted \"Sen. Hatch: \u2018If [a version of Facebook will always be free], how do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?' \"Mark Zuckerberg: \u2018Senator, we run ads.'\" Continued foreign interference on the platforms has ratcheted up pressure on lawmakers to better assess not only how these platforms were exploited ahead of the 2016 election, but also what threats could emerge next. And it's evident they are putting in the work: Over the last year, Intelligence Committee senators have been working with advisers to better understand the rise of disinformation on social networks. They've met with tech executives behind closed doors and in open hearings, as well as third-party experts such as Renee DiResta, director of research for social media threat detection company New Knowledge. DiResta has been battling disinformation campaigns online for years \u2014 and she has been helping lawmakers from both parties understand technical topics and develop questions ahead of hearings for the last year. \"They've worked with external experts as advisers throughout that time, reaching out to make sure they fully understand all of the technical facets of the problems as they come up,\" she said. After working with the committee behind-the-scenes, she publicly testified in August \u2014 and told me she was pleased to see the questions she got back were \"similarly high caliber to what we heard\" on Wednesday. The senators' display of technical knowledge also comes as they grapple with potential next steps to rein in big tech. Even as lawmakers and technology executives struck a conciliatory tone during Wednesday's hearing \u2014 stressing the importance of cooperation between government and the companies \u2014 they are also considering legislative action. Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., laid out some options in his opening remarks, including regulation of the social media platforms and legislation that facilitates information sharing on cyberthreats between companies and the government. \"There are no unsolvable problems,\" he said. The top Democrat on the committee, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, set the tone at Wednesday's hearing in his opening remarks, warning that the threats to discourse, privacy and democracy will only intensify with new advances in technology and artificial intelligence. Warner cautioned deepfakes, or doctored videos, could amplify the fake news dilemma the technology giants are grappling with today. \"We're on the cusp of a new generation of exploitation and, potentially harnessing hacked personal information to enable tailored and targeted disinformation and social engineering efforts,\" he said. \"That should frighten us all.\" Warner and Florida Republican Marco Rubio began ringing the alarm about deepfakes earlier this year. Warner floated the idea of holding the companies liable for failing to take them down in a policy paper, and Rubio called them a national security threat in a speech. Maine Sen. Angus King pressed on deepfakes later in the hearing, asking Sandberg if Facebook could tag videos that have been manipulated and warn consumers that they may be misleading. \"Deepfakes is a new area, and we know people are going to continue to find new ones,\" Sandberg said. \"As always, we're going to do a combination of investing in technology and investing in people so that people can see the most authentic information on our service.\" Deepfakes were just one of many emerging technologies discussed as lawmakers attempted to address concerns ranging from election interference to censorship in a hearing that highlighted the complicated relationship that exists between Silicon Valley and Washington. As the technology companies continue to grow, they are increasingly treading into the crosshairs of regulators. As Wednesday's hearing was wrapping up, the Justice Department warned that leading technology companies may be \"intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas\" and hurting competition. And lawmakers' interest is unlikely to wane: Less than two hours after the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing finished, Dorsey was testifying again in front of the House Energy and Commerce. Though senators were intent on determining whether the social networks have taken adequate steps to address election security, past points of contention between Silicon Valley and the government reemerged during the hearing. As law enforcement leaders warn that the spread of encryption is hindering critical investigations, Sandberg made a point to stress Facebook's commitment to consumer security and privacy. \"We are strong believers in encryption,\" Sandberg said. \"Encryption helps keep people safe, it's what secures our banking system, it's what secures the security of private messages, and consumers rely on it and depend on it.\" There was one thing both lawmakers and executives seemed to agree on: That private-public cooperation was necessary to address disinformation at the hands of foreign adversaries. And it's clear lawmakers expect the companies to engage. Google drew bipartisan criticism for not sending an executive that lawmakers deemed senior enough to testify at the hearing. Lawmakers left an empty chair for Google next to the other witnesses to draw attention to the company's absence. Rubio lashed out at the company for not sending an executive. \"Maybe it's cause they're arrogant,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg accompanied by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, right, before the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on \u2018Foreign Influence Operations and Their Use of Social Media Platforms' on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018, in Washington.

COO Sheryl Sandberg said the company would work with Congress to reach \"the right regulation\" to ensure transparent communication about problematic information found on its platform. The company's executives have testified on Capitol Hill numerous times this year on a range of topics, from data privacy concerns to discussions about bad actors to whether social media algorithms improperly muted conservative voices. Executives at Facebook and Twitter have vigorously denied allegations of partisan bias.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While it remains unclear whether Congress will coalesce around a common legislative approach to taming the Wild West of social media, two individuals with extensive antitrust knowledge   a former Federal Trade Commission chairman and a prominent Silicon Valley attorney   said the FTC is already positioned to address some of the allegations of data misuse on the social media company's platforms.</p><p>The FTC earlier this year opened an investigation into whether Facebook's admissions about data privacy breaches indicate the company is in violation of a 2011 consent order to improve transparency regarding its privacy policy. If Facebook is found to be in violation of its consent decree, the government can assess penalties against the company. Alphabet Inc.'s Google LLC, for example, in 2012 agreed to pay a $22.5 million civil penalty to resolve claims that it misrepresented policies regarding privacy and targeted ads in violation of a 2011 FTC administrative order.</p><p>\"The allegation is, [Facebook and Google are] doing that again,\" said Gary Reback, an antitrust lawyer at Carr &amp; Ferrell, in an interview. \"Once that kind of thing happens, the FTC can order more invasive kinds of things because there's been a violation of a previous FTC order.\"</p><p>Reback was among the lawyers who helped spur a federal antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. in the 1990s, in which the company was accused of abusing its power and operating a monopoly in the desktop operating systems market. Microsoft ultimately reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice.</p><p>Reback does not believe that Congress will act on legislative measures that have been floated before the FTC takes action.</p><p>\"The easiest avenue to do something is where [the FTC] already [has] a history in place ... as opposed to trying to promulgate some new broad regulation,\" he said.</p><p>William Kovacic, a former FTC chairman and current law professor at George Washington University, said in an interview that given the FTC's ample resources, it is likely that the agency will play a significant role in any government action taken against social media companies.</p><p>\"It s hard to imagine that with all of the tools the FTC has, that the agency will not emerge as a focal point for inquiries and possibly law enforcement,\" Kovacic said. \"There's an inevitability about it.\"</p><p>Kovacic labeled the FTC's current investigation of Facebook as a \"bellwether\" of future social media policy, adding that regulators often \"use significant individual matters to convey a broader message to the business community and to use those as a way of establishing broader policy norms or standards.\"</p><p>On Sept. 13 and 14, the FTC began a series of hearings aimed at examining approaches to modernize its enforcement priorities for issues such as antitrust law and data privacy. The regulatory agency did not respond to a request for comment about what the commission hopes to accomplish as a result of the hearings or the status of the investigation into whether Facebook violated the FTC's consent order.</p><p>In the meantime, some U.S. legislators remain focused on social media and technology companies. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, for example, has pushed for policy proposals from a white paper released by his office, including requiring social media companies to notify users when they have interacted with fake accounts. At a live event with The Atlantic on Sept. 13, Warner said that he has had \"serious\" follow-up meetings with Facebook and Twitter Inc. on what substantive policy might look like.</p><p>\"There is a high chance that people realize that the days of the wild, wild west are over   that there needs to be some guardrails,\" the senator said.</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump also recently called out Google with allegations that the company's search results were \"rigged\" to \"shut out\" conservative voices. Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this month said he plans to meet with state attorneys general to examine whether social media giants are \"intentionally stifling\" certain viewpoints.</p><p>It remains unclear whether legislators will act on President Trump's concerns about partisan bias on Google and social media, though the topic has been the subject of Congressional hearings.</p><p>Chris Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University who specializes in antitrust law, said in an interview that it would be difficult for lawmakers to regulate social media content, given the First Amendment concerns such action would raise.</p><p>\"Even if the regulation attempts to prevent Facebook, Twitter and so on from censoring the content of certain kinds of speech, it would be essentially like regulating newspaper editors [and] mandating that they carry conservative content, which is pretty plainly illegal,\" Sagers said.</p><p>Sagers said that big tech's immense data collection capabilities and market dominance raises some antitrust concerns, but breaking up these firms through an antitrust lawsuit would not likely do much to improve consumers' online experiences.</p><p>\"Social media is one of those markets where there is a so-called network effect: You as the consumer want to be on the platform that everybody's on,\" Sagers said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-46501154</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TBR-S0D1-F19Y-C3GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"990\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Historically, how these companies use this data has been subject to oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's top privacy watchdog.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But a big court defeat for the FTC is putting the agency's power to protect your online privacy in jeopardy, analysts say. The ruling could wind up giving Google and Facebook, not to mention other companies in the internet ecosystem, the ability to escape all privacy oversight from the FTC, and possibly from the rest of government, too, critics claim, unless Congress intervenes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the wake of the setback, the FTC is mulling an appeal \u2014 which would mean either asking for a rehearing at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, or escalating to the Supreme Court, according to a person close to the agency.</p><p>But unless regulators can persuade the courts to overturn Monday's decision, the result will be \"a fatal blow\" to consumer protection, said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy.</p><p>\"The decision will enable a company like Google ... to engage in unfair marketing and data-gathering practices without having to worry about possible FTC consequences,\" he said.</p><p>The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did Facebook and Google.</p><p>What's potentially confusing is that the case doesn't talk about Facebook or Google. The substance of the case concerns another company, AT&amp;T. But the meat of the lawsuit actually matters less right now than how the Ninth Circuit dealt with it \u2014 which was to throw it out on a procedural argument that, analysts say, sets a precedent affecting the entire internet economy. The case makes it possible for companies to effectively avoid privacy regulations by setting up or buying a phone or internet service provider.</p><p>In its lawsuit, the FTC said AT&amp;T had unacceptably tricked customers with its marketing surrounding unlimited data plans. AT&amp;T's unlimited data plans aren't truly \"unlimited,\" regulators argued, because AT&amp;T actually slowed down its heaviest data users to dial-up speeds after they consumed a certain amount of mobile data.</p><p>The FTC has used this truth-in-advertising approach for decades to go after numerous companies, and it represents one of the agency's core legal tools.</p><p>But this time, the FTC's lawsuit never got off the ground. The regulators' claims of \"unfair and deceptive\" behavior don't apply, <person><nameText>Judge Richard Clifton </nameText></person>ruled, because no part of AT&amp;T falls within the FTC's jurisdiction. Clifton's argument set off a shock wave among policy analysts \u2014 and here's why.</p><p>As a telephone and internet provider, AT&amp;T is known in legal circles as a \"common carrier,\" and the FTC is explicitly forbidden by Congress from taking action against common carriers. Until now, most legal experts interpreted this ban to mean that the FTC could still go after such firms for their marketing and advertising claims, because only the core parts of the business were actually engaged in common-carrier activities such as offering home phone service or mobile data.</p><p>Clifton's opinion surprised some policy analysts because it went much further, saying that all parts of AT&amp;T, not just the core business, qualify for the FTC's common-carrier exemption.</p><p>\"The immediate effect [of the ruling] is that the FTC can't pursue AT&amp;T\" for not being transparent enough about its unlimited data plans, said Paul Gallant, a telecom analyst at Cowen and Company, in a research note. \"However, the court also ruled that the FTC is precluded from regulating any aspect of an ISP for privacy, even other units of the company. So [Monday's] ruling seems encouraging for some ISPs like Verizon.\"</p><p>Verizon, of course, is increasingly becoming an online content player with its recent acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo. Under the Ninth Circuit's decision, the FTC would be barred from going after either subsidiary for any privacy abuses, analysts say, because Verizon also provides phone and internet service out of a separate department and can claim common-carrier status.</p><p>Playing this forward, consumer protection advocates say Clifton's argument would allow any company to evade FTC oversight simply by launching or buying a small telecom service. Google already benefits from this line of reasoning because it operates Google Fiber. A company such as Facebook, whose goal is to connect a billion additional people to the internet, could acquire its own broadband provider and claim common-carrier status.</p><p>Monday's ruling shines a spotlight on the Federal Communications Commission, the only federal agency with a mandate to regulate common carriers such as AT&amp;T and Google Fiber. The FCC is currently developing a set of privacy regulations specifically for internet providers. But unlike the FTC, the nation's top telecom regulator is limited to regulating only the parts of telecom companies that actually deal with internet and phone service, analysts say.</p><p>Between the FCC's inability to regulate much beyond the communications-related units of a company and the FTC's newfound prohibition on regulating any part of a company that owns a communications business, the Ninth Circuit decision creates a gap in consumer protection law, said Berin Szoka, president of the market-oriented think tank TechFreedom.</p><p>\"Companies like Yahoo and AOL, all based [on] the Ninth Circuit [decision], may fall into a no man's land of consumer protection, policed by neither agency,\" Szoka said.</p><p>Even such companies as Apple could find themselves benefiting from this loophole, according to a lawyer who works for the telecom industry. If the FCC attempts to regulate iMessage or other messaging apps, justifying the move as a form of common-carrier regulation, the companies behind them could claim common-carrier status as well \u2014 and exemption from FTC oversight, said the lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak more freely.</p><p>The FCC said Wednesday it is still reviewing the Ninth Circuit's decision.</p><p>The FTC's common-carrier exemption was never intended to lead to this result, said David Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University who led the agency's consumer protection bureau from 2009 to 2012.</p><p>The purpose of the exemption was to create a division of labor among different regulatory agencies, \"not to have large swathes of the economy be unregulated by the federal government,\" he said. Thanks to Monday's decision, \"AT&amp;T could start selling high volumes of snake oil and be immune from federal law. Does that make any sense? I don't think so.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>File photo If you look up a candidate's name using Google, it now pulls up a quick summary of how much the candidate's campaign has raised. associated press/March 2010 The Alphabet Inc. division unveiled a new mobile messaging application Wednesday called Allo containing a digital personal assistant, based on AI technology that powers other Google services like Inbox.

They wanted to kill landmark privacy regulations that would soon ban Internet providers, such as Comcast and AT&amp;T, from storing and selling customers' browsing histories without their express consent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So after weeks of closed-door debates on Capitol Hill over who would take up the issue first \u2014 the House or the Senate \u2014 Republican members settled on a secret strategy, according to Hill staff and lobbyists involved in the battle. While the nation was distracted by the House's pending vote to repeal Obamacare, Senate Republicans would schedule a vote to wipe out the new privacy protections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On March 23, the measure passed on a straight party-line vote, 50 to 48. Five days later, a majority of House Republicans voted in favor of it, sending it to the White House, where President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>signed the bill in early April without ceremony or public comment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"While everyone was focused on the latest headline crisis coming out of the White House, Congress was able to roll back privacy,\" said former Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler, who worked for nearly two years to pass the rules.</p><p>The process to eliminate them took only a matter of weeks. The blowback was immediate.</p><p>Constituents heckled several of the lawmakers at town halls. \"You sold my privacy up the river!\" one person yelled at <person><nameText>Sen. Jeff Flake, </nameText></person>R-Ariz. \u2014 lead sponsor of the Senate bill \u2014 at a gathering in April. Several late-night comedians roasted congressional Republicans: \"This is what's wrong with Washington, D.C. I guarantee you there is not one person, not one voter of any political stripe anywhere in America who asked for this,\" Stephen Colbert said.</p><p>The quick undoing of the Internet privacy rules has prompted lawmakers in more than a dozen states to propose local laws to restore privacy protections to their constituents.</p><p>The FCC privacy rules were among the first of more than a hundred regulations and laws being targeted for elimination or massive overhaul by Trump and Republican members of Congress who want to dismantle Obama-era regulations they view as burdensome.</p><p>How the privacy rules came to be undone helps to explain and inform the strategies behind the broader range of Republican initiatives in the works. The rollback of privacy, for example, was the first step by the Republican-led FCC to overhaul Obama-era net neutrality rules.</p><p>The rolling crises within Trump's administration and Republican infighting has slowed Republican lawmakers' work on Capitol Hill. But they remain positioned to capitalize on their control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, a power structure that has not existed in more than a decade.</p><p>\"Trump and the Republicans are doing so many different things on parallel tracks, the news media and activists can't follow it all,\" said Trump adviser and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \"This is by design.\"</p><p>The Internet privacy rules were adopted in October during the last days of the Obama administration after an intense battle that pitted large Internet service providers, the advertising industry and tech giants against consumer advocates and civil rights groups.</p><p>The rules required Internet service providers to get explicit consent before they gather their customers' data \u2014 their browsing histories, the locations of businesses they physically visit and the mobile applications they use \u2014 and sell it to third parties. Proponents said the rules were necessary because consumers must use a provider to access the Internet.</p><p>The requirements were modeled after a law passed decades ago by Congress that prohibited telephone companies from collecting customers' calling histories and selling the information to third parties. \"There has been an expectation from the beginning of the telecommunications era that your privacy is not up for sale,\" said Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., who fought to preserve the rules.</p><p>The industry, Republican FCC commissioners and lawmakers said the restrictions were too broad and should be limited to highly sensitive data, such as personal medical information, not data gathered from activities like online car shopping. The rules, they said, would cause consumers to miss out on customized promotions. And, opponents said, the threat to privacy was overstated \u2014 a provider might learn that a person visited a website but would not typically know what the person did while there.</p><p>Because the commission's privacy rules passed on a party-line vote, three Democrats in favor and two Republicans opposed, the rules were viewed as extremely partisan. This made them vulnerable from the start, said Jon Leibowitz, co-chair of the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, a group financed by Internet providers, which led the effort to eliminate the requirements.</p><p>The campaign to kill the FCC rules began just a few weeks after Trump's November victory.</p><p>Lobbyists from trade groups funded by large broadband companies \u2014 including Leibowitz's group and the Consumer Technology Association \u2014 made phone calls and held small, private meetings with Republican congressional aides, according to Hill staff, consultants and lobbyists on both sides of the issue. They were shopping for bill sponsors and approached Flake and Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who had been vocal opponents of the rules when they were being crafted at the FCC. The two agreed to champion the cause.</p><p>\"We had a broad coalition of groups, and we thought, \u2018We don't like it; let's present this to them,' \" said Julie Kearney, vice president of regulatory affairs with the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group for the industry. \"The administration and Congress did not come to us.\"</p><p>Flake and Blackburn declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Kearney said trade groups for Internet service providers asked Congress to use a legislative maneuver under the Congressional Review Act that allows Congress to kill recently adopted regulations with a simple majority vote. Before the 2016 elections, the 21-year-old act had been used only once, in 2001. Since November, Congress and Trump have employed it 14 times to kill Obama-era initiatives.</p><p>\"The last administration was very aggressive with regulations,\" Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., who voted to eliminate the privacy rules. \"We are looking for the quickest ways to do something about it.\"</p><p>By January, trade groups for tech companies such as Facebook and Google had joined the fight to undo the privacy rules, according to records and interviews. Those companies are regulated by a different government body, the Federal Trade Commission, but they worried that Congress might someday find a way to expand the reach of the rules so that they apply to all technology companies.</p><p>Trade groups for large advertisers also got involved in the effort to repeal the law, as did the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Consumer and civil rights groups were quickly outnumbered by their opponents, by a ratio of at least 50 to 1, according to Hill staff and lobbyists.</p><p>\"This collaboration between Silicon Valley and cable companies has never been done before,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president and chief executive of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit that advocates for an open Internet and affordable technology. \"Their united, massive economic and political power was insurmountable.\"</p><p>During the battle, Flake and Blackburn received large campaign donations from eight of the major Internet providers and big tech companies that wanted to see the rules killed, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>The groups gave Flake $22,700 in donations, compared with an average $4,510 they gave other senators between January and April. The groups gave Blackburn $20,500, compared with the $2,045 average donated to other House members in the same time. That is about three times the amount of money Flake and Blackburn received from those groups during the first quarter of last year.</p><p>Groups that worked to preserve the FCC rules donated no money to lawmakers during the first quarter of this year, according to the analysis.</p><p>By February, neither the House nor the Senate had introduced a bill. It appeared to some that the issue may have stalled \u2014 which caused several consumer and civil rights groups such as the Color of Change to let down their guard.</p><p>\"We didn't think they would have the audacity to go after privacy ... We dismissed the low rumblings,\" said Brandi Collins, a senior campaign director at Color of Change, who said data-directed advertising often targets minorities.</p><p>By the end of February, the trade groups for large Internet providers, the advertising industry and tech companies were working in tandem with congressional members who had taken up their cause. Howard Waltzman, a lawyer and lobbyist for the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, said this was \"the pivotal moment.\"</p><p>An opinion piece under Flake's byline appeared in the Wall Street Journal on March 1, saying the rules took away \"consumer choice\" because people's browsing histories could not be used to offer them \"innovative and cost-saving product offerings.\" The column said the rules would \"create confusion\" among customers because the FCC and FTC would regulate different parts of the \"Internet ecosystem.\" The same arguments and similar phrasing were used in a letter the industry coalition sent to Congress.</p><p>Hours after Flake's opinion piece appeared in the Journal, he introduced a Senate bill to kill the rules. A week later, Blackburn did the same in the House.</p><p>For weeks, neither Flake nor Blackburn scheduled a vote because members feared a potential backlash from voters, according to lobbyists and several Hill staff members.</p><p>\"There was a bit of chicken played between the House and Senate,\" said Dallas Harris, another lobbyist for Public Knowledge.</p><p>Finally, Flake scheduled the vote for March 22. It was not until then that the campaign against it took off.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union, Free Press and other groups delivered a petition with 100,000 signatures to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other congressional leaders hours before the Senate began its debate on the bill.</p><p>When Senate Republicans passed the bill the following day on a narrow party-line vote, the issue finally exploded across the Internet and in mainstream, liberal and conservative media.</p><p>NBC, CNN, FOX and MSNBC carried stories about the vote. And conservative online platforms \u2014 such as Breitbart News and Reddit sites devoted to Trump \u2014 were packed with posts from Trump supporters who were angry about the bill.</p><p>More than 20,000 calls flooded House members' office phone lines, and more than a dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 a congressional group of conservative and libertarian Republicans \u2014 told Blackburn they would likely not vote for the bill, several Hill staff told The Washington Post.</p><p>Waltzman said the fight intensified: \"Suddenly, we were dealing with flat-out lies. Members were saying, \u2018These companies can see literally everything you do online.' That is simply not true.\"</p><p>Fearing more House Republicans could defect, Hill staff said, McConnell and other Republican leaders asked the Trump administration to issue a statement signaling that he would sign the bill. The White House staff did so.</p><p>Within hours, Blackburn introduced the bill on the House floor and called for a vote.</p><p>Rep. Michael E. Capuano, D-Mass., took to the floor, screaming: \"What are you thinking? ... Just last week I bought underwear on the Internet. Why should you know what size I take? Or the color? Or any of that information?\"</p><p>Fifteen Republicans voted against the bill, but the measure still passed 215 to 205.</p><p>---</p><p>The Washington Post's Alice Crites contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>\"You sold my privacy up the river!\" one person yelled at <person><nameText>Sen.

The software giant already took its turn through the regulatory wringer starting two decades ago, a years-long confrontation that resulted in the finding that the Redmond, Washington-based company had illegally maintained its monopoly for personal-computer operating-system software. The case dealt with the company's moves to kneecap the Netscape web browser by bundling its own product, Internet Explorer, into Windows, the dominant PC operating system. A federal judge ordered the company split in two in 2000, a fate Microsoft avoided when an appeals court reversed that part of the ruling and the company eventually settled. That 2002 settlement led to nine years of court supervision of the company's business practices and required Microsoft to give the top 20 computer makers identical contract terms for licensing Windows, and gave computer makers greater freedom to promote non-Microsoft products like browsers and media-playing software. </p><p>Because observers and legal pundits almost uniformly agree the software giant did virtually everything wrong in the course of the investigation \u2014 which had its start as early as 1990, followed by a 1998 Justice Department lawsuit \u2014 in retrospect its story serves as a useful instruction manual of what not to do. While no formal inquiries have yet been opened, the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department carved up the territory of big tech \u2014 Amazon.com, Apple, Google and Facebook \u2014 as they prepare to dig in on antitrust issues. The Department of Justice will look at Google, which dominates the online search and advertising spaces, and Apple, whose pervasive App Store is likely to be under examination. The FTC drew Facebook, with its behemoth social networking and messaging apps and a slew of recent privacy missteps, and e-commerce giant Amazon, which has been pushing into areas like grocery and health. As these companies build their legal teams and prepare strategies for the fight ahead, here are several lessons that Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook can learn from Microsoft's battle with the feds. \u2014 Don't deny the obvious. Or don't even put up a fight about whether you have a monopoly. Microsoft, whose Windows software accounted for about 90% of the market for PC operating systems, opted to argue that the space was actually competitive. Parts of the argument included videos where Microsoft employees offered a straight-faced marketing pitch for the benefits of rival Linux programs with a tiny share of the market. The impulse is understandable \u2014 monopoly sounds like a dirty word. But U.S. antitrust law doesn't expressly forbid having a monopoly; it outlaws doing certain things to establish, maintain or extend one. That led some legal scholars to argue that Microsoft would have been better served by copping to the Windows monopoly and establishing a legal beachhead against the idea that it did anything illegal to gain it or keep it. Arguing against something so self-evident via the company's very first witness strained credibility and started the case off on a bad footing.It's easy to imagine a similar issue applying to Google, which has more than 84% of the web-search market and controls 82% of mobile-phone operating systems. In the app-store business, Google and iPhone maker Apple together control more than 95% of all U.S. mobile app spending by consumers, according to Sensor Tower data. It could be more effective for these companies not to start by denying that leadership position \u2014 if you have 80% or 90% percent of a market, arguing that you don't really dominate isn't the hill you want your legal reasoning to die on. \u2014 Don't resort to spin. Microsoft's credibility with the press was no higher, hurt by constant counterfactual statements and spin. Each day, after a bruising in court as government lawyer David Boies poked holes in executive testimony and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson alternated between chuckling at the witnesses and chastising them, Microsoft deployed a hapless PR person to the steps of the courthouse to recite the words, \"Today was another good day for Microsoft.\" It never was. \u2014 Assume everything will be made public. Among the list of horrifying moments for Microsoft in court was the public showing of parts of the 20 hours of depositions of co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Bill Gates. The tapes (yes, they were tapes \u2014 this was the 90s) showed an ill-lit, evasive and combative Gates engaging in Clintonian word-wrangling, such as asking about the definition of the word \"definition\" and arguing what \"market share\" meant. Microsoft claimed it had been assured the tapes would never be shown in court, or the company would have taken greater care with Gates's appearance and manner. During their playback in court, the judge laughed at several points \u2014 not the impression the software giant wanted to make on either Jackson or the public. Jackson told New Yorker reporter Ken Auletta that Gates came off as \"arrogant\" in the depositions. Just as bad for Microsoft, an array of internal emails were read aloud in court that contradicted the testimony of its executives, which further angered Jackson. The take-away? Assume everything will be aired in the court of public opinion. If it was true 20 years ago, it's even more apparent in the current era of oversharing, thanks to the tech companies' own services. \u2014 Don't be condescending about the technology. Most lawyers, judges and regulators don't appreciate being told or having it implied that they lack the ability to comprehend certain tech concepts. Or that the reason they think there's been an antitrust violation is because they just don't \"get\" the technology. It was true that Jackson and Boies seldom used a computer at the time. But it didn't require a computer science doctorate to divine the legal merits of the case. At the height of Microsoft's hubris (or carelessness, or both), the company sent Windows chief Jim Allchin to the stand with a doctored video that purported to show how computing performance would be degraded when the browser was removed from Windows on a single PC. It was actually done on several different computers and was an illustration of what might happen rather than a factual test, as the company initially claimed \u2014 a fact that came to light only after several days of the government picking through every inconsistency in the video. Microsoft remade the simulation several times in an effort to save the testimony. The company seemed to think it could get away with baldy stating a technological claim and mocking up something that backed it up, perhaps reasoning that no one would know the difference, but it miscalculated badly. \u2014 Choose your lawyers wisely. Microsoft took on the U.S. government led by a combative Gates and an equally aggressive general counsel, Bill Neukom. Gates, the son of an attorney, was outraged, frustrated and convinced the company was being unfairly targeted. One of the company's outside lawyers, from the firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, said the company could put a ham sandwich into Windows if it wanted to. And throughout, Neukom not only failed to tamp down his executives' worst impulses, he seemed to amp them up. His legal style led observers to point out that his last name \u2014 pronounced \u2018nuke \u2018em' \u2014 was quite fitting. The U.S. government's latest antitrust targets should take heed: If your top executive's style tends toward waving a red flag in front of a bull, you may be wise to consider a top lawyer with a more conciliatory style. Google's top executives have already raised the ire of lawmakers for refusing to appear before Congress, and no one has ever accused Jeff Bezos of being afraid of a fight. At Facebook, where Zuckerberg regards Gates as a mentor and observers see similarities in their styles and temperaments, this lesson might be particularly important. \u2014 There are many different ways to lose. Right now, the companies are only at risk of an inquiry \u2014 the agencies are deciding what, if any, action to take. But even at this stage, they should keep in mind that a loss doesn't only mean a full-scale breakup or forced divestiture. Companies can avoid that extreme fate and still find, as Microsoft did, that the years of distraction from the fight have hampered their business and sucked up executive time and mental energy. In an interview last year at the Code Conference, Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith lamented the distraction the case caused, and cited it as a reason the company missed out on the search market \u2014 the business that fueled the runaway success of Google, now under the microscope itself. Others have pinned Microsoft's abysmal performance in mobile computing partially on constraints and distractions from the case. Some of the company's business missteps can fairly be attributed to poor execution and strategic errors that had nothing to do with the government dispute. Still, the notion that merely fighting an antitrust battle may do almost as much harm as losing one brings us to our last point. \u2014 Consider settling early. It's hard to say with certainty what the late 1990s and early 2000s might have looked like for Microsoft had it found a way to settle with the government earlier than 2002. Still, for the government's current targets, it's worth weighing a settlement against the impact of several years of investigation, a possible loss in court and potentially harsher restrictions or remedies. Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google probably have a pretty good idea of what regulators may object to, and it's worthwhile for them to consider ways to assuage those concerns while keeping the core of their businesses and future ambitions intact. The alternative is years of investigations, possibly damaging evidence and testimony, and ample distraction, all leading up to what could be a devastating loss in court.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Microsoft Corp.'s office in Hong Kong on March 4, 2016.

We have  two governors, both exclusive, Florida's Rick Scott, Mississippi's Phil  Bryant, both on huge job pushes right now.  Today's signature Wall Street  throwdown features Charlie Gasparino and Chapwood Fund's Jared Levy.   That's going to be great, fighting over whether something smells fishy in  the Tesla bond deal being underwritten by Morgan Stanley.  You might want  to get some popcorn for that one.  And of course, there is today's \"Money  Talker\", the latest round in Icahn versus eBay.  Because even when they say  it's not it is always about money.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FRANCIS:  New Fed chair Janet Yellen just wrapping up her testimony before  the Senate banking committee.  Let's check in with Scott Shellady on the  floor of the CME.  You know, one thing in particular caught my attention.   She said the economic data, particularly consumer spending had softened  since she testified before the House committee.  That was just two weeks  ago! Things have gotten worse in the past two weeks, does that make you  nervous, Scott? </p><p>SCOTT SHELLADY, TREAN GROUP SENIOR V.P.:  Well, you know what?  It is not  making me nervous because I think I've felt this way for two or three  months now ever since the retailers gone to came in weak over Christmas.   So, here is where we sit.  We've got a Fed that is going to be trying to  taper.  And they're tapering because - not because the economy can handle  it.  We're actually in a soft patch right now.  But they are going to taper  because it is a failed economic policy.  And if they stop the taper I think  that also sends another bad signal and the market could actually tumble  from there as well, because, though, that reads into the fact that maybe  the Fed sees something that is worse than we actually think.  So we're in a  very precarious spot right now.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So what do you think she should do? </p><p>SHELLADY:  Well, this is what I think is going to happen.  I think that we  try to put Q.E. out of there to inflate our way out of this problem and get  some growth.  We didn't buy any growth.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  </p><p>SHELLADY:  Aim two and a half percent GDP, that didn't happen, and we  definitely didn't get any inflation.  So, what the Fed is going to have to  start doing now is fight deflation.  So, I think ultimately we're going to  have to stimulate, but maybe not in the way that we've been doing up until  now.  Maybe interest on overnight reserves or some other way because this  is not going to be the way to work.  I think that ultimately you're going  to watch what happened in Japan.  And if we do have the deflation,  deflation is the one thing that the Fed is really scared about. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.  So, meanwhile, against that backdrop, leave that markets  board up right now, look at the S&amp;P 500.  It is trading at 1853.59.  All- time intraday high, 1858.  We're flirting with record territory here.  So,  why are we seeing such a move in the S&amp;P if you're painting a precarious  picture there?</p><p>SHELLADY:  Right.  I know, it is perverse, is it?  And why do we see the  ten-year yields rally at the same time? </p><p>FRANCIS:  There you go.  </p><p>SHELLADY:  Well, this is what's going to be.  This is the world we're in.   We're going to see ten percent - we're going to put ten percent on the  stocks by end of the year.  Maybe even 15 percent because we're going to  either stimulate in a different manner, or, the economy does finally catch  up and justifies these asset prices where they are.  But in either scenario  I think we're going to add to stocks, just because I think ultimately I  think it's going to be the stimulus.  I don't think it's going to be the  economy is not going to catch up.  And number two is that the ten-year is  telling me that we still have a lot to worry about.  That's why it didn't,  the ten-year didn't break when we saw the stocks rally last week and early  this week.  Now, the ten year are starting to rally and the yields are  starting to break, and we are still rallying as far as the stock market  goes.  We are in trouble.  We need to see bunches of good numbers.  Boy,  oh, boy, is this jobs number on Friday, next Friday, very important.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Nice setup for us, Scott, thanks so much.</p><p>SHELLADY:  Already.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, everyone is talking Tesla today.  Shares hitting the brinks  after wild week of gains.  Auto makers planning a bond offering to raise  $1.6 billion for its new battery factory.  But here is where the  controversy comes in.  So, one of the banks that is backing the deal,  Morgan Stanley just released a report with a huge price target raise that  sent the stock soaring.  Is there a conflict of interest in there?  Get  ready to rumble in today's Wall Street Throwdown.  It is Chapwood  Investments, Jared Levy, against our very own Charlie Gasparino.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  The whistle .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Charlie.  </p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS:  You've got to do that in my ear?</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes he did have to do that, he wanted to get your attention ahead  of time and ensure that it was a fair fight.  What do you think?  You're  the one Charlie Gasparino, you're one that sort of raised the issue.  Isn't  that convenient?  They raised .</p><p>GASPARINO:  Gambling here - Is it gambling?</p><p>FRANCIS:  From 153 to 320.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  And then boom it's announced the next day that they're  underwriting the convert deal.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  Well, the one of the - one of the .</p><p>FRANCIS:  One of four.</p><p>GASPARINO:  I mean this is so obvious it is not even worth debating.   Anybody that says it is not obvious is crazy.  And just doesn't know how  Wall Street works.  The bottom line is this, these Wall Street firm sells -  somewhere ten years after we had a major settlement in terms of Wall Street  allegedly cleaning up its sell-side research, separating, creating the  alleged or the infamous Chinese Wall, making it more sturdy it is just as  broken.  This stuff goes on every day.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.  Jared, Charles has just called you crazy and said you  don't know how Wall Street works, by the way.</p><p>GASPARINO:  One other thing, we should put out.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Just not to throw .</p><p>GASPARINO:  One other thing we should put out - They didn't just like, you  know, say Tesla is a good company.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No, 153 to 320.  I mean that's .</p><p>GASPARINO:  They went insane.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jared, are you crazy? </p><p>JARED LEVY, CHAPWOOD FUND MANAGING PARTNER:  OK, maybe a little bit.  You  know, I've been doing this for 20 years, right?  And I think Charlie is  giving way too much credit to the four analysts that maybe just graduated  from Wharton over at Morgan Stanley.  Like they're calling Goldman and  JPMorgan, say, hey guys, guess what?  First of all, we're going to issue  debt and we're going to dilute the shares.  Which normally sends stock  lower by the way.  Just to read .</p><p>GASPARINO:  Convertible debt? </p><p>LEVY:  Yeah.  Convertible - whatever your .</p><p>GASPARINO:  It's going to convert.</p><p>LEVY:  Issue debt or whatever you're diluting stock.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.  OK.  So then why did they increase the price target?</p><p>FRANCIS:  I think they're pumping up a customer is Charlie's accusation.</p><p>LEVY:  This is why - this is why .</p><p>GASPARINO:  Then why .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEVY:  Charlie, wait, wait, listen to me.  Would you listen to me for a  second?</p><p>FRANCIS:  Talk.</p><p>LEVY:  OK, here's the deal.  You've got - you're doubling volume.  This  gigafactory is going to double the potential volume.  It changes the whole  case.  If you read the report from Morgan Stanley they changed their base  case.  These guys can't make up numbers.  And if the numbers suck that bad,  if the numbers suck that bad, they couldn't get one percent yields on their  debt.</p><p>GASPARINO:  He just made my point.  Diluting..</p><p>FRANCIS:  He did sort of make the point.</p><p>GASPARINO:  They're diluting the shareholder and they are saying .</p><p>FRANCIS:  And yet, they are till raising the price target.</p><p>GASPARINO:  They are not raising it.  They doubled it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  They doubled it.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  And this is insane.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Jared, you are kind of making his case .</p><p>GASPARINO:  And here's the other thing.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That even worse bet.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  Here's the other thing.  Yes, they do get on the phone and talk  to the bankers and they do talk to the company.  And someone says this is  our customer.  Yeah, that all does happen.  Just - let the viewer know that  out there.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Jared?</p><p>LEVY:  Yeah.  It happens, Charlie, but again -- </p><p>GASPARINO:  OK.  Thank you, you made my point again.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEVY:  You cannot listen to me.  You cannot make up numbers.</p><p>GASPARINO:  I'm trying, dude.</p><p>LEVY:  You can't - There is a fair market out there, Charlie.   And it's all like I could say, oh, yeah .</p><p>GASPARINO:  Bear market.  </p><p>LEVY:  Buy this .</p><p>GASPARINO:  Because we could call these guys .</p><p>LEVY:  For $2 million, because you're my buddy.  Buy this old Fiat from  1974, pay 2 million because it's worth it. You wouldn't do that because  you've got clients to represent.  You've got clients to report to.  They  can't just make up numbers.</p><p>GASPARINO:  So, you're telling me - you're telling me - you're telling me  it's beyond Morgan Stanley with the biggest retail brokerage network in the  world, in America, 18,000 brokers, to pump up a client?  You are saying  that?</p><p>LEVY:  I am 100 percent saying that. </p><p>GASPARINO:  The Brooklyn Bridge is for sale, dude.</p><p>LEVY:  And JPMorgan.</p><p>GASPARINO:  The Brooklyn Bridge is for sale.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO:  The Brooklyn Bridge is for sale.</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right.  I think I hear a whistle. </p><p>(WHISTLE)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Thank you, gentlemen.  All right.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Thanks, Jared.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Thanks so much.</p><p>Coming up, two governor exclusives.  First, Florida's big push to be the  new hot spot for the tech industry.  Governor Rick Scott tells us about how  he is successfully bringing jobs down to the Sunshine state.  And later,  Mississippi governor Phil Bryant on his state's plan to create jobs.  Is  the key, fracking regulations?  We're going to get the inside scoop, more  \"MONEY\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Significant economic turnaround is underway in Florida where  private sector job creation is booming.  Especially in the tech industry.   The sunshine state becoming a hotbed for innovation and businesses are  taking notice.  Moving their operations down south and creating nearly half  a million new jobs.  Since Governor Rick Scott took office in 2010.  I  spoke to him just a short time ago in a Fox Business exclusive.</p><p>(on camera):  Thank you so much for coming on the program.  </p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R) FLORIDA:  Well, tell me, is it true, did you all go to  Roger Ailes (ph) and say, look, we need to move to Florida?  We like the  fact there is no income tax, better weather, close to Latin America.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  You're speaking my language.  Singing my song, speaking my  language.  Yes.  I love that idea.  We would move to Florida in a  heartbeat.  Tell me, you're doing incredible things in your state that  would make other states very envious.  I'm looking at Amazon moving to  Tampa, bringing more than 1,000 jobs with it.  300 million in capital.   Time Warner moving to Tampa, with 500 new jobs.  $5 million in capital  investment.  What did you have to offer them to get that done? </p><p>SCOTT:  You know, we're a great state.  No income tax and we're a right-to- work state.  The gateway to Latin America.  We have 5 million multilingual  speakers.  We have great universities, have brand new - brand new  universities that are just doing science technology, engineering and math.   So, we're talking to companies every day and they are clearly moving.  And  people are moving here, but companies are expanding.  Yesterday I was with  a technology company that is adding over 100 jobs just in technology.  But  even the non-technology companies are moving here because of our  technology.  Hertz, 700 jobs.  Average income, $100,000.  People want to be  here.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  They do, but you're doing something different recently because  Florida has had those tremendous assets for a while, yet, when you took  office the unemployment rate was 11.4 percent.  It is now down to 6.2.  So  all those things have been in place.</p><p>SCOTT:  You're right, we've changed.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah, what have you changed recently because other states should  follow your example I would think? </p><p>SCOTT:  In the four years before I came into office, the state lost 832,000  jobs.  Unemployment went from 3.5 to 11.1 percent.  So, right after I got  elected I sat down with site selectors from around the country and said  here is why you should come to Florida.  And they said, you know, we don't  talk to Florida. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Why?</p><p>SCOTT:  And that has completely changed.  We're talking to them now and  saying what do your clients need?</p><p>FRANCIS:  But why?  What was the reason? Why did they say they didn't talk  to Florida before?</p><p>SCOTT:  Well, they said that last administration wouldn't return their  phone calls.  Wasn't focused, took forever, if you were even interested in  making a decision.  So I sat down with them.  I said, here's my cell  number.  Call me directly.  I will solve every problem I can.  Plus, in the  meantime, we've cut taxes 24 times in three years.  This year we'll cut  taxes $500 million.  I've cut about 3,000 regulations.  We've streamlined  the permitting process.  And we just do what I did in business.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jacksonville, for example, becoming a big hub for startups.</p><p>SCOTT:  Yeah.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  In 2013 there was a big crowd funding event that drew 130,000  attendees.  20 percent came from out-of-state.  Is Jacksonville the next  big tech center, the same way that we have heard about Austin and, of  course, we know about Silicon Valley and we are hearing about places in the  Midwest?  Is Jacksonville really hot? </p><p>SCOTT:  Jacksonville is hot.  But you know, Gainesville, Orlando, Tampa.   We're going to have - I think the biggest Hispanic technology conference  ever in the world is going to be in Miami in May.  So people want to be  here.  We've got great young people.  We've got great universities, great  state colleges.  They want to be here to build their companies.  We already  have the third most number of technology companies in the country in  Florida.  So we are the next, the whole state is the next Silicon Valley.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Is it essential to be tech focused?  I mean I keep hearing you  say that you have I.T. professionals that are trained.  If another state is  watching this and wanting to follow in your footsteps, is it essential that  you have that tech component and the tech training?</p><p>SCOTT:  Oh, I think it is very important.  But what I'm working on is to  make sure universities and state colleges are graduating the students for  the future.  Where are all the jobs going, that's the degrees we're going  to focus on and then continue to recruit companies that are already here to  expand?  Make sure they stay here.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>SCOTT:  Because other governors are trying to recruit like I am.  We're  just going to try to do it better than anyone else.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You've got me convinced.  I'm ready to open the Fox Business  bureau right on the beach.  I can't wait .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCOTT:  You would love it. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>SCOTT:  All right, have a great day.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right.  We want to show you some headlines that are crossing  right now from \"The Wall Street Journal.\"  Quizno's, you see it on so many  corners, preparing to file for bankruptcy.  The general reporting they have  a $570 million debt load right now.  One thing really interesting about the  story, their list of creditors, some of the biggest names in private money.   Avenue, Fortress, and Oak Tree, are among the folks that they owe money to  right now, going into bankruptcy.</p><p>All right, up next, babies are a big business.  And of course, there is an  app for that.  A new app claiming it is the answer for anyone trying to get  pregnant or not!  Also trying not to get pregnant, similarly important.   Let me tell you.  The CEO of Kindara is here.  And we all want to retire  someday, but a new survey says, it is still out of reach for many.  We have  got some of the worst-case scenario situations and more importantly, the  way to fix them to make sure you're set no matter what!</p><p>Do you ever have too much money?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  No false-positives about it, an innovative new app is helping  thousands of women get pregnant or not get pregnant.  Also, very important.   It's in the spotlight for innovation today.  Here now with the cofounder  and the CEO of Kindara, Will Sacks.  Will, I can't wait to hear how this  works.  How does an app help you get pregnant?  I mean is it just a naked  picture of a really attractive person or how does it work? </p><p>WILL SACKS, KINDARA COFOUNDER &amp; CEO:  No, we haven't integrated that yet.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No.</p><p>SACKS:  But so, Kindara is based on data tracking.  So, similarly, you  know, people have heard of apps to track their weight, to track what they  eat.  And Kindara is an app based on tracking their personal data related  to your fertility.  So, women use it be entering their personal fertility  signs every day.  And then we analyze those signs to give them a very  accurate and detailed picture of what is happening with their fertility  every single day of their cycle.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Wow, it sounds like there is a lot of liability in there if your  app messes up really in either direction.  Do you worry about that at all? </p><p>SACKS:  We have good lawyers, first of all.   FRANCIS:  That is fantastic.  That is always very important.  </p><p>SACKS:  Which is important and we don't worry about it too much on the  pregnancy side.  The worst-case scenario is the woman, it takes her longer  to get pregnant.  So that is not a big deal for us.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Not for you.  It might be for her though.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Go ahead.  Keep going.  Sorry, I'm trying to -- </p><p>SACKS:  Right.  It might take her an extra few cycles, you know.  And then  on the birth control side we don't provide prediction to each individual  woman.  It's up to her to interpret her own data.  So, that is how we make  sure that we're not giving people bad data and they are getting a maximum  understanding of their bodies every day.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  You have more than 55,000 monthly users.  The users are reporting  nearly 500 pregnancies a week.  That sounds scary and dangerous.  The app  has helped 10,000 women get pregnant in the last year.  How do you monetize  that?  Are you charging them?</p><p>SACKS:  We're not right now.  We're really focused on growth, currently.   We see a lot of opportunity in the future to use people's individual  situation, to connect them with products and services and practitioners who  are going to help them meet their goals.  So a woman who is trying to get  pregnant, we can help her maybe identify a hormone problem and then connect  her with a practitioner or a product that's going to help her with that  problem.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, how do you see monetizing this down the road?  Is it a fee- for-service?  Or are you, you know, letting folks, diapers.com advertise to  these folks?  Or how do you see making money?  Because the show is called  \"MONEY\" and we love money.</p><p>SACKS:  Yes, so the two main things that we're thinking about, are first  the practitioner directory to connect women with relevant practitioners in  their area. </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>SACKS:  We make money on that referral fee.  And second, advice, like the  mint.com for fertility.  So we can connect women with products and services  that are going to help them as they go through their journey to conceive.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Do you - real quick - do you see other applications for this  beyond pregnancy?  Are there other things that you want to do?</p><p>SACKS:  Yes.  We see ourselves as a full women's health platform.  So,  right now we're really focused on fertility and pregnancy.  And in the  future we'll focus on other women's health challenges like breast feeding  and ovulation and even menopause.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Will, thanks so much.  Appreciate it.  Good luck to you.</p><p>SACKS:  Yes, thanks, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right, I want to show you two stocks right now.  Let me show  you the AMC first.  It is higher after a big jump in quarterly revenue  reported there on the back of \"Walking Dead.\"  And you can see they are -  those investors liking that result.  Up about 6.5 percent.  I'd like to  show you TiVo as well, the stock has been soaring.  It beat its revenue  estimates.  Expects to benefit from the ComcastTime Warner deal.  And you  could see there that stock also great day for those investors.  Up about  6.4 percent on the day.  </p><p>So, this is so cool.  I just have to show it to you.  I've been fascinated  with this all day.  Boeing's new Black phone.  It may look like an ordinary  cell phone.  It could really be something out of the spy movie.  The Black  phone not only encrypts all of your calls, it also self-destructs if anyone  tries to crack it open.  The secretive cell also works on multiple  frequency bands and networks to make it even harder to hack into.  It is so  secretive in fact, that Boeing has not even provided a price or release  date.  It is 36 months in the making.  Hopefully they will release it soon.   So far investors on board with the Boeing Black.  The stock is up a little  more than one and a half percent on the day.  I like that.  I don't have  any secrets, but I want the phony anyway because it is just cool.</p><p>All right, next up, more on the Icahn-eBay saga.  A new round of  accusations against the legendary activist investor, this time from eBay's  founder and chairman.  What is next?  Tweet me.  And tell me what you think  it is today's \"Money Talker.\"</p><p>And who is making money today?  Hollywood's star's career has defied  \"Gravity\" and has been taking off three decades ago.  She is seeing her  biggest pay day yet.  That is so obvious.  \"Piles of Money\" for her,  though, coming up. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Shares of the Best Buy on the move right now.  The company beats  profit expectations.  David Strasser is an analyst at Janney Montgomery  Scott.  David, you're on a conference call this morning.  What did you hear  that surprise you?</p><p>DAVID STRASSER:  Well, I think they are focused.  You know, 18 months ago  this company everyone thought was going out of business, because the Amazon  was going to put them out of business.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>STRASSER:  I would actually argue today.  They are probably one of the best  brick and click, or you know, hybrid models out there that the investments  they've made, the ones that they're working on, are making them very tough  to compete with online.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Interesting.  Do you think they'll have to downsize their retail  stores even more, though?</p><p>STRASSER:  I mean I think so.  I mean, no, they have markets where they  have probably more density of stores than they need and I think over time  it is inevitable that will happen.  I mean they are taking hours out of the  store to some degree, because, you know, 12.5 percent of their business,  you know, is now online.  I mean some of that productivity you just don't  need as much investment in NSGA.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You know, you = we're looking at the chart, though.  It looks  very negative, the stock fell off a cliff here.  But you sound really  positive.  Do you think there is an opportunity? </p><p>STRASSER:  Yeah, there is an opportunity here.  I mean I think the proof of  concept still is going to come in queue four.  You know, they are at a  tough queue four.  Even though they beat today, they had lowered numbers  due to a very promotable holiday.  You know, but I think as you look at  everybody who has worked in retail over the last couple of weeks I don't  think anybody had a very good holiday and they are, you know, it's clearly  not something specific to them.  I mean there are some pluses and minuses  to their business right here. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>STRASSER:  This business - the stock, I think goes higher from here but  ultimately you need a good Q 4 for it to really have a big move.</p><p>FRANCIS:  David Strasser, thanks so much for taking time out for us.  We  appreciate it.  Back to work.</p><p>STRASSER:  All right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You're like thanks a lot.  All right, Carl Icahn throwing yet  another punch in his very public battle with eBay.  The billionaire  investor firing off his third letter to shareholders this week, he is  behind the typewriter, you know, sending his letters out, furious, riling  everyone up.  The ecommerce giant isn't backing down, the founder and  chairman himself just responded so who's going to win this fight?  Here for  the \"Money Talker\" is A.J. Capital Hilary Cramer.  We have Tuttle Wealth  Management's Matthew Tuttle.  And the \"Wall Street Journal's\" James  Freeman.  Icahn is on fire.  Once again, is he right or is he a giant pain  in the ass?  What do you think, Matthew?</p><p>MATTHEW TUTTLE, TUTTLE WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Well, it depends where you are  sitting.  If you an eBay shareholder he's brought up a lot of questions  that you want definite answers to, and, you know, it is no secret that  boards of directors are often going to do things that in their own best  interest and not looking up for the shareholder.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.  </p><p>TUTTLE:  So .</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  He might be both, to answer your  questions.  I mean and shareholders have definitely been enjoying the ride  last month or so, since his interest has come out.  But some of his tactics  - it is hard to take him seriously.  He starts out saying you'd got to  split eBay from PayPal.  That doesn't really catch on, so then he says,  basically these letters saying the board needs to be taken out.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You know, having cook on the board will pay pal while they are  planning PayPal's features a kin to having Pete Carroll, coach of the  Seahawks, sitting in when the Denver Broncos were constructing their game  plan for the Super Bowl, but then again, maybe he did.  </p><p>Carl Icahn is about intimidation.  Corporate raider who started in the  1980s.  He is the man who brought TWA down, that he made money and  thousands of people without a pension.  The good news is this isn't going  to happen to e-bay.  Either, e-bay and PayPal will stay together or they  will split apart.  </p><p>HILARY KRAMER, A&amp;G CAPITAL:  In my opinion, e-bay and PayPal need to stay  together.  And because there is synergy there as PayPal continues to grow - -  </p><p>FRANCIS:  But I wonder about Icahn does.  I mean, if you look what he did  with Apple, you know, he gets in.  He has a plan.  He wants apple, you  know, to relieve all of this cash.  He brought the shares up.  He didn't  achieve what he wanted that made money.  It was the same thing with the  debt.  Something doesn't -- </p><p>MATTHEW TUTTLE, CEO, TUTTLE TACTICAL MANAGEMENT:  It depends on where you  are.  If you are an e-bay shareholder, you sitting there and cheering him  on.  I mean, it is up to an up percent last time I looked today.  And if  you read --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Is he enacted as investor doing the right thing for shareholders?  </p><p>KRAMER:  He does the right thing --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Putting pressure on corporate boards making sure business is run  in the best way possible.  The back of the day's board, it is fact  challenge.  This is not a journalistic explanation of what happened.  You  look at -- you read his case on the sale of Skype and you think there's  something criminal, you learn later while the big winner actually was in  resale more silver lake, and saying that the stock value was here and then  18 months later it was here and that some kind of scandal.  I mean, stocks  fluctuate.  Investor sentiment changes and his attack is questionable but  as far as shareholders, people like him buying pressure on management.  So  a lot of times, yes.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Can it be disruptive for the company, though?  I mean, it is good  for shareholders.  Is it bad?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TUTTLE:  It is not going to be disruptive for the company.  It makes the  board of directors mad.  But it is not going to effect.  </p><p>KRAMER:  It is going to make the lawyers richer.  And I think there is  distraction going on.  E-bay shares will go higher.  But e-bay share is  going higher because the market is going higher in March.  We are going to  have a nice bull market, the month of March, and companies are heading --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  And we need to change the name activist investor.  I mean,  activist investor makes him sound like, you know, a puritanical things  where he is out there.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KRAMER:  That is what he was and now he just annoys me.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would be more confident if he is taking on a very old company,  you know, horrible -- hardly managed, bloated cash, struggling pension plan  that can't be sustained.  This is a fairly young company, a fairly dynamic.   I mean, he may be right here.  I am not saying he is not, but I think it is  harder call for investors than when he is taking on sort of the obvious  reason --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Well, maybe the stock of those companies doesn't move as readily.   Maybe he is targeting companies where the stock has more beta.  </p><p>TUTTLE:  Well, also, I mean, e-bay shares didn't do that well last year  when the market went up.  So, if I am an e-bay shareholder, I look at what  happened last year.  I am not too happy.  So, I am cheering him on if he  can make this thing --.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Go, Carl!  </p><p>All right, thanks guys.  </p><p>Up next, another governor exclusive, Mississippi's Phil Bryant lays out how  he is beefing up the job market in his state.  He lays out his secrets of  success because at the end the date is all about money, just as Carl Icahn.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  I am Cheryl Casone with your  FOX business brief.  </p><p>General Motors could be fined $35 million federal safety regulators  determined.  The GM failed to act quickly enough to recall 1.6 million cars  with faulty ignition switches.  Earlier this week, GM doubled the number of  recalled cars, but document show that automaker knew about the problem as  early as 2004.  The case is link to 33 accidents and 13 deaths.  </p><p>Wells Fargo having 700 mortgage jobs across the country.

Swiss voters will vote on a proposal to impose minimum wage of  $25 an hour.  If it happens it would be the highest minimum wage in the  world.  Yes, it would.  Several local economists are issuing stark warnings  to Swiss citizens that you could lead to job cuts and hurt smaller  companies.  </p><p>All right over to Haiti, a local android tablet maker ramping up production  on hot demand.  Surtab started in the capital of Port-Au-Prince with an  initial run of 4,000 devices.  That is now being increased to 7,000 tablets  a month.  The Surtab looks similar to the ipad mini, it is a coincidence  I'm sure.  But it is just a fraction of the price.  The cheapest model is  $100.  It is a symbol of what the island nation can achieve as it continues  to recover from the devastating earthquake back in 2010.  Good for them.  </p><p>And landing in Malaysia, which is pushing new rules on hotels and resorts  to become more appealing to Muslim tourists, Islamic tourism is now $125  billion industry.  And the Malaysian government wants hotels to stop  serving alcohol.  Wait a minute, what?  In offset, it is crazy.  And offer  food and facilities that comply with religious guidelines.  I'm not sure  about this.  Muslim visitors to Malaysia have already tripled in the past  decade.  It is expected to grow more than 50 percent in the next six years.  </p><p>All right, two hot topics right now, building a better economy and job  creation.  Our next guest has shown success in both areas adding 10,000  jobs and lowering unemployment by more than two points in just two years.  </p><p>Joining me now on the FOX Business exclusive is Mississippi governor, Phil  Bryant.  </p><p>Governor, thank you so much joining us on the show.  </p><p>GOV. PHIL BRYANT, MISSISSIPPI:  It is always delightful to be here.  Thank  you for having me.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Everyone in your state is a buzz thinking this will be the year  of the Tuscaloosa Marine shale.  This is a tremendous geological formation,  EnCana Corporation and Goodrich are both planning of spending hundreds of  millions of dollars to get in there.  Is this the year for that shale  formation?  </p><p>BRYANT:  Absolutely.  If you look at the companies that I hear you talked  about, EnCana, Goodrich is here, almost half a billion dollars worth of  investment just now, about 22,000 people in the state of Mississippi  employed in the oil and gas industry.  It is blooming in Mississippi.  Our  Tuscaloosa Marine Shale is something we are counting on.  We put a lot of  investment in it.  I cut taxes on that region for oil that is produced by  hydraulic fracturing and that has stimulated the growth in that area.  That  and our stability to help regulate, if you will, that industry on the state  level, our state's first initiative that are working hard without GCC (ph)  as chairman of the interstate oil and gas compact commission, that is  critical along with permitting speed.  We are second in the nation.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  I mean, are you receiving any push back from  environmentalists?  Because I know your neighbors over in Louisiana had a  recent oil spill.  People get very nervous about fracking.  I mean, that is  unrelated but it gets environmentalists up in arms and people who care  about the land.  Are you getting any push back?  </p><p>BRYANT:  Well, it certain, we always do.  We had the largest spill in  America's history.  If you look at what happened with the BP spill a few  years ago, we were able to manage that.  If you look at what happened in  Louisiana, no loss of marine life, no injuries occurred there.  These are  going to occur in any type of industry.  The important part of it is having  an immediate response to let everyone in Washington know we care more about  our land, our water, our environment than they do and we are here to  protect it and the same time grow our energy.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Great point.  </p><p>You look at places like California, where there are need of revenue and  jobs.  They have the Monterey Shale which they are pretty much ignoring,  you know, that they don't want to disturb.  Can you quantify for you what  the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale means to you?  How many jobs, how many dollars,  what do you see down a road?  </p><p>BRYANT:  Sure.  I think it made in this meeting as 9,000 new jobs.  I think  it means billions of dollars of investment.  I think it means new  infrastructure, Mississippians is coming home that are now working in North  Dakota and Oklahoma and perhaps Texas.  And so, those Mississippians are  working there because our jobs in the energy industry there, we want them  to come back to Mississippi and take jobs we are creating here in the oil  and gas industry.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  And what do you have to do to provide the right employees in the  right labor force?  Because I covered energy for a really long time and it  was always hard to find the best engineers and the best skilled folks.   What are you doing to provide the industry with that?  </p><p>BRYANT:  Well, of course, as workforce is trying, working with community  colleges.  We put several million dollars in to work for safety training  facilities at one of our community colleges in southwest Mississippi.   Working with Mississippi State to get petroleum engineering program back up  and running.  That went out of existence in the 1980s when everyone was  saying that gas and liquid is out of business and we have to depend on  other forms of energy.  And now that it is back, we are having to restart,  if you will, some of that.  But we do that in a very rapid manner as a  sense of urgency of getting the work force ready.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  </p><p>Governor, thanks so much for coming on and good luck to you.  I can't wait  to hear about the progress.  </p><p>BRYANT:  Thank you so much for having me.  We will talk more about it.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Counting down to the last hour trading right now.  </p><p>Liz Claman, what do you got coming up on the closing bell, another jammed- pack show?  </p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FBN HOST, COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL:  Yes, always.  Always  because is that last and all-important hour.  </p><p>Listen.  There is a stock that is falling about nine percent today.  But  you need to perhaps put that aside because it is up more than 100 percent  over the past year and that is neutral system.  On this very day, word is  announced that the Obama administration will change the labels on food to  make the calories a lot bigger so we can really see what we are eating.  </p><p>Dawn Zier is joining us.  She has turned this company around since 2012.   Again, the stock is up exponentially.  There's a big short position on it  but there is a lot on short position on whitewater's, its competitor as  well, but it has not kept pace with new Nuetra (ph) system.  Dawn is going  to talk about what she makes of the new labeling that is expected to be  announced tomorrow with the first lady Michelle Obama.  </p><p>We are also going to be talking to the first lady of NASCAR driving, Danica  Patrick, in a FOX Business exclusive.  You know she has been working with  go daddy for years.  Go Daddy, the Web site operator.  But listen, they are  now trying to inspire people to start small businesses.  Wait till you see  the latest, I can call it nothing, Melissa, but shtick.  We will show you  the most incredible clip, sounds like reality TV, five people who have been  paid to quit their jobs and start their own business about to make their  pitch while she drives the track at 150 miles an hour.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  They are great ad shtick.  No one does it like them.  I can't  wait to see that.  I love Danica Patrick.  </p><p>Liz, great show.  I can't wait.  </p><p>All right, coming up, just think of the first lady.  We were just talking  about this.  She wants us all in shaped.  That means new sweeping changes  could be coming to a food label near you.  Companies will add extra  nutritionally information on their packaging, some say it will hurt the  bottom line big time.  </p><p>We will check it out because you never have too much \"Money\" and I think  too much information.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right, I want to show you shares of GAP because investors  there, really sitting on their hands as they wait for earnings to come out  \"after the bell.\"  They announced last week that they would raise the  minimum hourly wage to $9 in 2014 and then up to $10 in 2015.  A lot of  people think Banana Republic might be showing some improvement.  So we will  find out about that \"after the bell.\"  Look at that.  Yu can see the stock  there has been doing better of late and there are experiences as well.  </p><p>All right, it is time for a little \"Spare Change\" if you like to spend  those extra nickels and dimes on snack food, that is, you may be in for  some big changes.  The White House is proposing new requirements for  nutrition labels that could affect every single packaged food product that  you buy.  </p><p>Rich Edson is on the story in D.C.</p><p>Rich, I thought these labels, it sort of blast you with the calories.  They  want to make sure you know exactly what you are getting into.  </p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Right.  And you know, and  it is not just the size of the calorie count but the number, the actual  number is probably going to be bigger.  You think of it this way.  So you  know, let's say you pick up a cookie package and you see 100 calories on  that back and that is not bad.  Then you see the serving size as like half  a cookie.  Well, what the FDA says, you know, is that they will update  serving size requirements to reflect the amounts that people actually eat.   So you are going to see that.  It will be more prominently displayed in the  number will be larger.  Then on top of that, they are also going to break  out added sugars.  People say that basically you want to know naturally  assuring sugar but also the amount of sugar that is added into a product  and a few other changes.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  We are looking at the label side by side and you can see the  calorie counters is just a whole lot bigger.  How do food producers feel  about this?  I mean, obviously, they have to go through the cost in  designing a new label, right?  How do they feel about it?  </p><p>EDSON:  Right.  When you talk to analysts about this one and they say that  the label cost, it will be an additional cost but I don't think that is  necessarily the problem.  They say that when you are going forward on all  of this and you look it where food trends have been in the U.S. for the  last four years since 2010, there have been and you will declines in  American buying habits.  They are moving away from processed prepackaged  foods moving more toward healthier foods.  </p><p>So if you have a situation where calorie count numbers are starting to move  up because of serving sizes have changed that may change the way people buy  these foods and could hurt the process food makers.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  I guess although, I mean, it is just more information.  I  feel like it is the same thing like when the restaurants here in New York,  Dunkin Donuts, you know, when they had to put up the calories for  everything thing.  They thought it would drive Dunkin out of business.  And  instead, you just learned that the brand muffin was the most fattening  thing you could possibly have, you might as well have a donut because it  led.  It hasn't been that terrible so, we will see.  </p><p>Anyway, Rich, thanks so much.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>EDSON:  Thanks.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Up next, what is the worst thing you can imagine happening to  your retirement?  The average 401(k) account plummeted by 25 percent during  the last financial crisis, meaning there are a lot of people out there with  some catching up to do.  Small-businesses are also feeling this week.  We  have some real-life fixes to some of the biggest problems facing your  golden years.  We are going to fix it.  You can never have too much money.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Whether it's on Wall Street or Main Street, here's who's making  money today.  </p><p>Anyone with a stake in sears?  The struggling department store posting  declining sales due to a quote \"tough and terrible holiday corner,\" that's  crop.  But a plan to raise a billion in cash by going out to (INAUDIBLE)  has investors reacting possibly, at least shares are up nearly six percent  right now.  The CEO Eddie Lanford (ph) is benefiting nicely.  The  billionaire hedge fund manager has more than 25 million shares meaning he  just made an extra $57 million, because he needed it.  </p><p>Also making money, miss congeniality herself, Sandra Bullock.  The  Hollywood actress earning tens of millions of dollars for her role in the  award-winning movie \"Gravity.\"  Word is Bullock has deal included $20  million up front and that after that she gets 15 percent of Warner Brothers  share of the box office revenue plus a cut from home rental and TV sales.   That is already looking to be about $50 million.  Wow.  Means the Oscar  winner is lining up for a $70 million payday.  Truly out of this world!   Good for her.  </p><p>Making even more money than that, top executives at private equity firm  Carlyle Group, the three founders each received around $93 million in  dividend and salary last year.  That is up 60 percent from the year before.   It reflects how well the group has been doing lately.  Income rose more  than 20 percent last year.  And its fourth quarter earnings more than  tripled.  Nice job.  </p><p>All right, one thing almost everyone can agree on, retirement saving is a  tricky thing.  Ups and downs in the market, housing bubbles, unexpected  expenses, there is a way to fix those worst case scenarios, so listen up.  </p><p>Brian Graft is the CEO and director of the American society of pension  professionals and actuaries.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>Let's get right to it.  Let me hit you with one of the first problems.   This is a high-tech business owner, the small owner, although I know,  someone in this situation right now.  The small business is doing well,  they don't have a lot of employees, but they offer the employees a 401(k).   There are new tax rules out there that, basically, double tax this  distribution.  So it may make it go away.  How do you deal with that  situation, how do you help your employees to save for retirement?  What do  you do?  </p><p>BRIAN GRAFT, CEO, DIRECTOR, THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF PENSION PROFESSIONALS  AND ACTUARIES:  Well, Melissa, it's a perfectly -- it is a real problem out  there with this proposal by Chairman Camp that was introduced yesterday  that he would actually double tax contributions on behalf of small business  owners.  So the concern is if from the small business owner, it started to  have doubled tax.  They no longer have an incentive to keep that plans  going --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  So what should they do?  </p><p>GRAFT:  So what we've got to do is, one, make sure that this double tax  proposal doesn't get enacted and proposals like that.  Instead, what we  need to be doing is encouraging more small business owners to have plans  like your friend because the key to retirement for workers is having a plan  at work.  People making between $30,000 and $50,000, when they're covered  by a plan at work, 70 percent of them participate.  When they don't have a  plan at work, less than five percent on them save on their own.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Absolutely.  Let's get on the second scenario, public  schoolteacher.  The problem is that this person has just gotten through  putting their kids through college.  </p><p>GRAFT:  Right.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  And, basically, was using all their retirement savings for this.   There are lots of people in this situation.  </p><p>GRAFT:  Right.  Millions, actually.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So now they want to try and catch up.  How do you start catching  up?  </p><p>GRAFT:  Well, the key is to kind of make sure that you're thinking about  this in advance, but a critical part of the law today is the allowance of  catch-up contributions.  They're very important because there are a lot of  people who are putting their kids through college, and then all of a sudden  -- hopefully if all things go well, kids go through college.  They can now  catch up with respect to their retirement savings.  Unfortunately, another  proposal introduced yesterday would freeze benefit limits and contribution  limits at current levels for over a decade.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I know.  But rather than talking about laws that may or may not  be enacted, how do you help the person catch up?  What's the first thing  you would ask them to do?  </p><p>GRAFT:  Well, what they've got to do is plan for the catch-up scenario.  So  they know they've got a burden in terms of costs and expenses while the  kids are going through college.  They need to know that because the law  allows them to put more money aside, they have an opportunity to do so.  So  they're going to go ahead and take that into account.  </p><p>And fortunately, and millions of Americans actually do this, they then  increase their contributions as they get closer to retirement so they can  catch up with respect o the savings that they missed while the kids were  away in college.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  Brian, thanks so much.  We appreciate your time.  </p><p>GRAFT:  You're welcome.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  All right, that's all we have more you.  I hope that you are  making money today.  Be sure to tune in tomorrow.  Thank you for joining us  here at our new time.  I hope you'll stay with us, 2 p.m. here on the east  coast.  The \"Countdown to the Closing bell\" starts right now with Liz  Claman.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

We have two governors, both exclusive, <person><nameText>Florida's Rick Scott, </nameText></person>Mississippi's <person><nameText>Phil Bryant, </nameText></person>both on huge job pushes right now. Today's signature Wall Street throwdown features Charlie Gasparino and Chapwood Fund's Jared Levy. That's going to be great, fighting over whether something smells fishy in the Tesla bond deal being underwritten by Morgan Stanley. You might want to get some popcorn for that one. And of course, there is today's \"Money Talker\", the latest round in Icahn versus eBay. Because even when they say it's not it is always about money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FRANCIS: New Fed chair <person><nameText>Janet Yellen </nameText></person>just wrapping up her testimony before the Senate banking committee. Let's check in with Scott Shellady on the floor of the CME. You know, one thing in particular caught my attention. She said the economic data, particularly consumer spending had softened since she testified before the House committee. That was just two weeks ago! Things have gotten worse in the past two weeks, does that make you nervous, Scott?</p><p>SCOTT SHELLADY, TREAN GROUP SENIOR V.P.: Well, you know what? It is not making me nervous because I think I've felt this way for two or three months now ever since the retailers gone to came in weak over Christmas. So, here is where we sit. We've got a Fed that is going to be trying to taper. And they're tapering because - not because the economy can handle it. We're actually in a soft patch right now. But they are going to taper because it is a failed economic policy. And if they stop the taper I think that also sends another bad signal and the market could actually tumble from there as well, because, though, that reads into the fact that maybe the Fed sees something that is worse than we actually think. So we're in a very precarious spot right now.</p><p>FRANCIS: So what do you think she should do?</p><p>SHELLADY: Well, this is what I think is going to happen. I think that we try to put Q.E. out of there to inflate our way out of this problem and get some growth. We didn't buy any growth.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>SHELLADY: Aim two and a half percent GDP, that didn't happen, and we definitely didn't get any inflation. So, what the Fed is going to have to start doing now is fight deflation. So, I think ultimately we're going to have to stimulate, but maybe not in the way that we've been doing up until now. Maybe interest on overnight reserves or some other way because this is not going to be the way to work. I think that ultimately you're going to watch what happened in Japan. And if we do have the deflation, deflation is the one thing that the Fed is really scared about.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. So, meanwhile, against that backdrop, leave that markets board up right now, look at the S&amp;P 500. It is trading at 1853.59. All- time intraday high, 1858. We're flirting with record territory here. So, why are we seeing such a move in the S&amp;P if you're painting a precarious picture there?</p><p>SHELLADY: Right. I know, it is perverse, is it? And why do we see the ten-year yields rally at the same time?</p><p>FRANCIS: There you go.</p><p>SHELLADY: Well, this is what's going to be. This is the world we're in. We're going to see ten percent - we're going to put ten percent on the stocks by end of the year. Maybe even 15 percent because we're going to either stimulate in a different manner, or, the economy does finally catch up and justifies these asset prices where they are. But in either scenario I think we're going to add to stocks, just because I think ultimately I think it's going to be the stimulus. I don't think it's going to be the economy is not going to catch up. And number two is that the ten-year is telling me that we still have a lot to worry about. That's why it didn't, the ten-year didn't break when we saw the stocks rally last week and early this week. Now, the ten year are starting to rally and the yields are starting to break, and we are still rallying as far as the stock market goes. We are in trouble. We need to see bunches of good numbers. Boy, oh, boy, is this jobs number on Friday, next Friday, very important.</p><p>FRANCIS: Nice setup for us, Scott, thanks so much.</p><p>SHELLADY: Already.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, everyone is talking Tesla today. Shares hitting the brinks after wild week of gains. Auto makers planning a bond offering to raise $1.6 billion for its new battery factory. But here is where the controversy comes in. So, one of the banks that is backing the deal, Morgan Stanley just released a report with a huge price target raise that sent the stock soaring. Is there a conflict of interest in there? Get ready to rumble in today's Wall Street Throwdown. It is Chapwood Investments, Jared Levy, against our very own Charlie Gasparino.</p><p>FRANCIS: Oh, yeah. There you go. The whistle .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Charlie.</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS: You've got to do that in my ear?</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes he did have to do that, he wanted to get your attention ahead of time and ensure that it was a fair fight. What do you think? You're the one Charlie Gasparino, you're one that sort of raised the issue. Isn't that convenient? They raised .</p><p>GASPARINO: Gambling here - Is it gambling?</p><p>FRANCIS: From 153 to 320.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: And then boom it's announced the next day that they're underwriting the convert deal.</p><p>GASPARINO: Well, the one of the - one of the .</p><p>FRANCIS: One of four.</p><p>GASPARINO: I mean this is so obvious it is not even worth debating. Anybody that says it is not obvious is crazy. And just doesn't know how Wall Street works. The bottom line is this, these Wall Street firm sells - somewhere ten years after we had a major settlement in terms of Wall Street allegedly cleaning up its sell-side research, separating, creating the alleged or the infamous Chinese Wall, making it more sturdy it is just as broken. This stuff goes on every day.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Jared, Charles has just called you crazy and said you don't know how Wall Street works, by the way.</p><p>GASPARINO: One other thing, we should put out.</p><p>FRANCIS: Just not to throw .</p><p>GASPARINO: One other thing we should put out - They didn't just like, you know, say Tesla is a good company.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, 153 to 320. I mean that's .</p><p>GASPARINO: They went insane.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jared, are you crazy?</p><p>JARED LEVY, CHAPWOOD FUND MANAGING PARTNER: OK, maybe a little bit. You know, I've been doing this for 20 years, right? And I think Charlie is giving way too much credit to the four analysts that maybe just graduated from Wharton over at Morgan Stanley. Like they're calling Goldman and JPMorgan, say, hey guys, guess what? First of all, we're going to issue debt and we're going to dilute the shares. Which normally sends stock lower by the way. Just to read .</p><p>GASPARINO: Convertible debt?</p><p>LEVY: Yeah. Convertible - whatever your .</p><p>GASPARINO: It's going to convert.</p><p>LEVY: Issue debt or whatever you're diluting stock.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right. OK. So then why did they increase the price target?</p><p>FRANCIS: I think they're pumping up a customer is Charlie's accusation.</p><p>LEVY: This is why - this is why .</p><p>GASPARINO: Then why .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEVY: Charlie, wait, wait, listen to me. Would you listen to me for a second?</p><p>FRANCIS: Talk.</p><p>LEVY: OK, here's the deal. You've got - you're doubling volume. This gigafactory is going to double the potential volume. It changes the whole case. If you read the report from Morgan Stanley they changed their base case. These guys can't make up numbers. And if the numbers suck that bad, if the numbers suck that bad, they couldn't get one percent yields on their debt.</p><p>GASPARINO: He just made my point. Diluting..</p><p>FRANCIS: He did sort of make the point.</p><p>GASPARINO: They're diluting the shareholder and they are saying .</p><p>FRANCIS: And yet, they are till raising the price target.</p><p>GASPARINO: They are not raising it. They doubled it.</p><p>FRANCIS: They doubled it.</p><p>GASPARINO: And this is insane.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jared, you are kind of making his case .</p><p>GASPARINO: And here's the other thing.</p><p>FRANCIS: That even worse bet.</p><p>GASPARINO: Here's the other thing. Yes, they do get on the phone and talk to the bankers and they do talk to the company. And someone says this is our customer. Yeah, that all does happen. Just - let the viewer know that out there.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jared?</p><p>LEVY: Yeah. It happens, Charlie, but again --</p><p>GASPARINO: OK. Thank you, you made my point again.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEVY: You cannot listen to me. You cannot make up numbers.</p><p>GASPARINO: I'm trying, dude.</p><p>LEVY: You can't - There is a fair market out there, Charlie. And it's all like I could say, oh, yeah .</p><p>GASPARINO: Bear market.</p><p>LEVY: Buy this .</p><p>GASPARINO: Because we could call these guys .</p><p>LEVY: For $2 million, because you're my buddy. Buy this old Fiat from 1974, pay 2 million because it's worth it. You wouldn't do that because you've got clients to represent. You've got clients to report to. They can't just make up numbers.</p><p>GASPARINO: So, you're telling me - you're telling me - you're telling me it's beyond Morgan Stanley with the biggest retail brokerage network in the world, in America, 18,000 brokers, to pump up a client? You are saying that?</p><p>LEVY: I am 100 percent saying that.</p><p>GASPARINO: The Brooklyn Bridge is for sale, dude.</p><p>LEVY: And JPMorgan.</p><p>GASPARINO: The Brooklyn Bridge is for sale.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO: The Brooklyn Bridge is for sale.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. I think I hear a whistle.</p><p>(WHISTLE)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Thank you, gentlemen. All right.</p><p>GASPARINO: Thanks, Jared.</p><p>FRANCIS: Thanks so much.</p><p>Coming up, two governor exclusives. First, Florida's big push to be the new hot spot for the tech industry. <person><nameText>Governor Rick Scott </nameText></person>tells us about how he is successfully bringing jobs down to the Sunshine state. And later, Mississippi governor <person><nameText>Phil Bryant </nameText></person>on his state's plan to create jobs. Is the key, fracking regulations? We're going to get the inside scoop, more \"MONEY\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Significant economic turnaround is underway in Florida where private sector job creation is booming. Especially in the tech industry. The sunshine state becoming a hotbed for innovation and businesses are taking notice. Moving their operations down south and creating nearly half a million new jobs. Since <person><nameText>Governor Rick Scott </nameText></person>took office in 2010. I spoke to him just a short time ago in a Fox Business exclusive.</p><p>(on camera): Thank you so much for coming on the program.</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R) FLORIDA: Well, tell me, is it true, did you all go to Roger Ailes (ph) and say, look, we need to move to Florida? We like the fact there is no income tax, better weather, close to Latin America.</p><p>FRANCIS: You're speaking my language. Singing my song, speaking my language. Yes. I love that idea. We would move to Florida in a heartbeat. Tell me, you're doing incredible things in your state that would make other states very envious. I'm looking at Amazon moving to Tampa, bringing more than 1,000 jobs with it. 300 million in capital. Time Warner moving to Tampa, with 500 new jobs. $5 million in capital investment. What did you have to offer them to get that done?</p><p>SCOTT: You know, we're a great state. No income tax and we're a right-to- work state. The gateway to Latin America. We have 5 million multilingual speakers. We have great universities, have brand new - brand new universities that are just doing science technology, engineering and math. So, we're talking to companies every day and they are clearly moving. And people are moving here, but companies are expanding. Yesterday I was with a technology company that is adding over 100 jobs just in technology. But even the non-technology companies are moving here because of our technology. Hertz, 700 jobs. Average income, $100,000. People want to be here.</p><p>FRANCIS: They do, but you're doing something different recently because Florida has had those tremendous assets for a while, yet, when you took office the unemployment rate was 11.4 percent. It is now down to 6.2. So all those things have been in place.</p><p>SCOTT: You're right, we've changed.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, what have you changed recently because other states should follow your example I would think?</p><p>SCOTT: In the four years before I came into office, the state lost 832,000 jobs. Unemployment went from 3.5 to 11.1 percent. So, right after I got elected I sat down with site selectors from around the country and said here is why you should come to Florida. And they said, you know, we don't talk to Florida.</p><p>FRANCIS: Why?</p><p>SCOTT: And that has completely changed. We're talking to them now and saying what do your clients need?</p><p>FRANCIS: But why? What was the reason? Why did they say they didn't talk to Florida before?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, they said that last administration wouldn't return their phone calls. Wasn't focused, took forever, if you were even interested in making a decision. So I sat down with them. I said, here's my cell number. Call me directly. I will solve every problem I can. Plus, in the meantime, we've cut taxes 24 times in three years. This year we'll cut taxes $500 million. I've cut about 3,000 regulations. We've streamlined the permitting process. And we just do what I did in business.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jacksonville, for example, becoming a big hub for startups.</p><p>SCOTT: Yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS: In 2013 there was a big crowd funding event that drew 130,000 attendees. 20 percent came from out-of-state. Is Jacksonville the next big tech center, the same way that we have heard about Austin and, of course, we know about Silicon Valley and we are hearing about places in the Midwest? Is Jacksonville really hot?</p><p>SCOTT: Jacksonville is hot. But you know, Gainesville, Orlando, Tampa. We're going to have - I think the biggest Hispanic technology conference ever in the world is going to be in Miami in May. So people want to be here. We've got great young people. We've got great universities, great state colleges. They want to be here to build their companies. We already have the third most number of technology companies in the country in Florida. So we are the next, the whole state is the next Silicon Valley.</p><p>FRANCIS: Is it essential to be tech focused? I mean I keep hearing you say that you have I.T. professionals that are trained. If another state is watching this and wanting to follow in your footsteps, is it essential that you have that tech component and the tech training?</p><p>SCOTT: Oh, I think it is very important. But what I'm working on is to make sure universities and state colleges are graduating the students for the future. Where are all the jobs going, that's the degrees we're going to focus on and then continue to recruit companies that are already here to expand? Make sure they stay here.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>SCOTT: Because other governors are trying to recruit like I am. We're just going to try to do it better than anyone else.</p><p>FRANCIS: You've got me convinced. I'm ready to open the Fox Business bureau right on the beach. I can't wait .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCOTT: You would love it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>SCOTT: All right, have a great day.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. We want to show you some headlines that are crossing right now from \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Quizno's, you see it on so many corners, preparing to file for bankruptcy. The general reporting they have a $570 million debt load right now. One thing really interesting about the story, their list of creditors, some of the biggest names in private money. Avenue, Fortress, and Oak Tree, are among the folks that they owe money to right now, going into bankruptcy.</p><p>All right, up next, babies are a big business. And of course, there is an app for that. A new app claiming it is the answer for anyone trying to get pregnant or not! Also trying not to get pregnant, similarly important. Let me tell you. The CEO of Kindara is here. And we all want to retire someday, but a new survey says, it is still out of reach for many. We have got some of the worst-case scenario situations and more importantly, the way to fix them to make sure you're set no matter what!</p><p>Do you ever have too much money?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: No false-positives about it, an innovative new app is helping thousands of women get pregnant or not get pregnant. Also, very important. It's in the spotlight for innovation today. Here now with the cofounder and the CEO of Kindara, Will Sacks. Will, I can't wait to hear how this works. How does an app help you get pregnant? I mean is it just a naked picture of a really attractive person or how does it work?</p><p>WILL SACKS, KINDARA COFOUNDER &amp; CEO: No, we haven't integrated that yet.</p><p>FRANCIS: No.</p><p>SACKS: But so, Kindara is based on data tracking. So, similarly, you know, people have heard of apps to track their weight, to track what they eat. And Kindara is an app based on tracking their personal data related to your fertility. So, women use it be entering their personal fertility signs every day. And then we analyze those signs to give them a very accurate and detailed picture of what is happening with their fertility every single day of their cycle.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow, it sounds like there is a lot of liability in there if your app messes up really in either direction. Do you worry about that at all?</p><p>SACKS: We have good lawyers, first of all. FRANCIS: That is fantastic. That is always very important.</p><p>SACKS: Which is important and we don't worry about it too much on the pregnancy side. The worst-case scenario is the woman, it takes her longer to get pregnant. So that is not a big deal for us.</p><p>FRANCIS: Not for you. It might be for her though.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Go ahead. Keep going. Sorry, I'm trying to --</p><p>SACKS: Right. It might take her an extra few cycles, you know. And then on the birth control side we don't provide prediction to each individual woman. It's up to her to interpret her own data. So, that is how we make sure that we're not giving people bad data and they are getting a maximum understanding of their bodies every day.</p><p>FRANCIS: You have more than 55,000 monthly users. The users are reporting nearly 500 pregnancies a week. That sounds scary and dangerous. The app has helped 10,000 women get pregnant in the last year. How do you monetize that? Are you charging them?</p><p>SACKS: We're not right now. We're really focused on growth, currently. We see a lot of opportunity in the future to use people's individual situation, to connect them with products and services and practitioners who are going to help them meet their goals. So a woman who is trying to get pregnant, we can help her maybe identify a hormone problem and then connect her with a practitioner or a product that's going to help her with that problem.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, how do you see monetizing this down the road? Is it a fee- for-service? Or are you, you know, letting folks, diapers.com advertise to these folks? Or how do you see making money? Because the show is called \"MONEY\" and we love money.</p><p>SACKS: Yes, so the two main things that we're thinking about, are first the practitioner directory to connect women with relevant practitioners in their area.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>SACKS: We make money on that referral fee. And second, advice, like the mint.com for fertility. So we can connect women with products and services that are going to help them as they go through their journey to conceive.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you - real quick - do you see other applications for this beyond pregnancy? Are there other things that you want to do?</p><p>SACKS: Yes. We see ourselves as a full women's health platform. So, right now we're really focused on fertility and pregnancy. And in the future we'll focus on other women's health challenges like breast feeding and ovulation and even menopause.</p><p>FRANCIS: Will, thanks so much. Appreciate it. Good luck to you.</p><p>SACKS: Yes, thanks, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, I want to show you two stocks right now. Let me show you the AMC first. It is higher after a big jump in quarterly revenue reported there on the back of \"Walking Dead.\" And you can see they are - those investors liking that result. Up about 6.5 percent. I'd like to show you TiVo as well, the stock has been soaring. It beat its revenue estimates. Expects to benefit from the Comcast Time Warner deal. And you could see there that stock also great day for those investors. Up about 6.4 percent on the day.</p><p>So, this is so cool. I just have to show it to you. I've been fascinated with this all day. Boeing's new Black phone. It may look like an ordinary cell phone. It could really be something out of the spy movie. The Black phone not only encrypts all of your calls, it also self-destructs if anyone tries to crack it open. The secretive cell also works on multiple frequency bands and networks to make it even harder to hack into. It is so secretive in fact, that Boeing has not even provided a price or release date. It is 36 months in the making. Hopefully they will release it soon. So far investors on board with the Boeing Black. The stock is up a little more than one and a half percent on the day. I like that. I don't have any secrets, but I want the phony anyway because it is just cool.</p><p>All right, next up, more on the Icahn-eBay saga. A new round of accusations against the legendary activist investor, this time from eBay's founder and chairman. What is next? Tweet me. And tell me what you think it is today's \"Money Talker.\"</p><p>And who is making money today? Hollywood's star's career has defied \"Gravity\" and has been taking off three decades ago. She is seeing her biggest pay day yet. That is so obvious. \"Piles of Money\" for her, though, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Shares of the Best Buy on the move right now. The company beats profit expectations. David Strasser is an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. David, you're on a conference call this morning. What did you hear that surprise you?</p><p>DAVID STRASSER: Well, I think they are focused. You know, 18 months ago this company everyone thought was going out of business, because the Amazon was going to put them out of business.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>STRASSER: I would actually argue today. They are probably one of the best brick and click, or you know, hybrid models out there that the investments they've made, the ones that they're working on, are making them very tough to compete with online.</p><p>FRANCIS: Interesting. Do you think they'll have to downsize their retail stores even more, though?</p><p>STRASSER: I mean I think so. I mean, no, they have markets where they have probably more density of stores than they need and I think over time it is inevitable that will happen. I mean they are taking hours out of the store to some degree, because, you know, 12.5 percent of their business, you know, is now online. I mean some of that productivity you just don't need as much investment in NSGA.</p><p>FRANCIS: You know, you = we're looking at the chart, though. It looks very negative, the stock fell off a cliff here. But you sound really positive. Do you think there is an opportunity?</p><p>STRASSER: Yeah, there is an opportunity here. I mean I think the proof of concept still is going to come in queue four. You know, they are at a tough queue four. Even though they beat today, they had lowered numbers due to a very promotable holiday. You know, but I think as you look at everybody who has worked in retail over the last couple of weeks I don't think anybody had a very good holiday and they are, you know, it's clearly not something specific to them. I mean there are some pluses and minuses to their business right here.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>STRASSER: This business - the stock, I think goes higher from here but ultimately you need a good Q 4 for it to really have a big move.</p><p>FRANCIS: David Strasser, thanks so much for taking time out for us. We appreciate it. Back to work.</p><p>STRASSER: All right.</p><p>FRANCIS: You're like thanks a lot. All right, Carl Icahn throwing yet another punch in his very public battle with eBay. The billionaire investor firing off his third letter to shareholders this week, he is behind the typewriter, you know, sending his letters out, furious, riling everyone up. The ecommerce giant isn't backing down, the founder and chairman himself just responded so who's going to win this fight? Here for the \"Money Talker\" is A.J. Capital Hilary Cramer. We have Tuttle Wealth Management's Matthew Tuttle. And the \"Wall Street Journal's\" James Freeman. Icahn is on fire. Once again, is he right or is he a giant pain in the ass? What do you think, Matthew?</p><p>MATTHEW TUTTLE, TUTTLE WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Well, it depends where you are sitting. If you an eBay shareholder he's brought up a lot of questions that you want definite answers to, and, you know, it is no secret that boards of directors are often going to do things that in their own best interest and not looking up for the shareholder.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>TUTTLE: So .</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL: He might be both, to answer your questions. I mean and shareholders have definitely been enjoying the ride last month or so, since his interest has come out. But some of his tactics - it is hard to take him seriously. He starts out saying you'd got to split eBay from PayPal. That doesn't really catch on, so then he says, basically these letters saying the board needs to be taken out.</p><p>FRANCIS: You know, having cook on the board will pay pal while they are planning PayPal's features a kin to having Pete Carroll, coach of the Seahawks, sitting in when the Denver Broncos were constructing their game plan for the Super Bowl, but then again, maybe he did.</p><p>Carl Icahn is about intimidation. Corporate raider who started in the 1980s. He is the man who brought TWA down, that he made money and thousands of people without a pension. The good news is this isn't going to happen to e-bay. Either, e-bay and PayPal will stay together or they will split apart.</p><p>HILARY KRAMER, A&amp;G CAPITAL: In my opinion, e-bay and PayPal need to stay together. And because there is synergy there as PayPal continues to grow - -</p><p>FRANCIS: But I wonder about Icahn does. I mean, if you look what he did with Apple, you know, he gets in. He has a plan. He wants apple, you know, to relieve all of this cash. He brought the shares up. He didn't achieve what he wanted that made money. It was the same thing with the debt. Something doesn't --</p><p>MATTHEW TUTTLE, CEO, TUTTLE TACTICAL MANAGEMENT: It depends on where you are. If you are an e-bay shareholder, you sitting there and cheering him on. I mean, it is up to an up percent last time I looked today. And if you read --</p><p>FRANCIS: Is he enacted as investor doing the right thing for shareholders?</p><p>KRAMER: He does the right thing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: Putting pressure on corporate boards making sure business is run in the best way possible. The back of the day's board, it is fact challenge. This is not a journalistic explanation of what happened. You look at -- you read his case on the sale of Skype and you think there's something criminal, you learn later while the big winner actually was in resale more silver lake, and saying that the stock value was here and then 18 months later it was here and that some kind of scandal. I mean, stocks fluctuate. Investor sentiment changes and his attack is questionable but as far as shareholders, people like him buying pressure on management. So a lot of times, yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: Can it be disruptive for the company, though? I mean, it is good for shareholders. Is it bad?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TUTTLE: It is not going to be disruptive for the company. It makes the board of directors mad. But it is not going to effect.</p><p>KRAMER: It is going to make the lawyers richer. And I think there is distraction going on. E-bay shares will go higher. But e-bay share is going higher because the market is going higher in March. We are going to have a nice bull market, the month of March, and companies are heading --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: And we need to change the name activist investor. I mean, activist investor makes him sound like, you know, a puritanical things where he is out there.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KRAMER: That is what he was and now he just annoys me.</p><p>FREEMAN: I would be more confident if he is taking on a very old company, you know, horrible -- hardly managed, bloated cash, struggling pension plan that can't be sustained. This is a fairly young company, a fairly dynamic. I mean, he may be right here. I am not saying he is not, but I think it is harder call for investors than when he is taking on sort of the obvious reason --</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, maybe the stock of those companies doesn't move as readily. Maybe he is targeting companies where the stock has more beta.</p><p>TUTTLE: Well, also, I mean, e-bay shares didn't do that well last year when the market went up. So, if I am an e-bay shareholder, I look at what happened last year. I am not too happy. So, I am cheering him on if he can make this thing --.</p><p>FRANCIS: Go, Carl!</p><p>All right, thanks guys.</p><p>Up next, another governor exclusive, Mississippi's <person><nameText>Phil Bryant </nameText></person>lays out how he is beefing up the job market in his state. He lays out his secrets of success because at the end the date is all about money, just as Carl Icahn.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: I am Cheryl Casone with your FOX business brief.</p><p>General Motors could be fined $35 million federal safety regulators determined. The GM failed to act quickly enough to recall 1.6 million cars with faulty ignition switches. Earlier this week, GM doubled the number of recalled cars, but document show that automaker knew about the problem as early as 2004. The case is link to 33 accidents and 13 deaths.</p><p>Wells Fargo having 700 mortgage jobs across the country. Wells Fargo has cut 6900 mortgage workers since July.</p><p>And McDonald's in spending in build your own burger test, the fast-food giant launched to concept of single California location offer a tablets customers can use deflector bun, patty, cheese and toppings choices. McDonald says the move is bringing in new customers and more than a tropic (ph).</p><p>Well, that is the latest from the FOX Business Network giving you the power to prosper. \"Money\" will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: From the U.S. to every corner of the globe, money has been flying the around the world today starting in Switzerland where lawmakers are trying to convince the public that a minimum wage would hurt jobs and the economy. Swiss voters will vote on a proposal to impose minimum wage of $25 an hour. If it happens it would be the highest minimum wage in the world. Yes, it would. Several local economists are issuing stark warnings to Swiss citizens that you could lead to job cuts and hurt smaller companies.</p><p>All right over to Haiti, a local android tablet maker ramping up production on hot demand. Surtab started in the capital of Port-Au-Prince with an initial run of 4,000 devices. That is now being increased to 7,000 tablets a month. The Surtab looks similar to the ipad mini, it is a coincidence I'm sure. But it is just a fraction of the price. The cheapest model is $100. It is a symbol of what the island nation can achieve as it continues to recover from the devastating earthquake back in 2010. Good for them.</p><p>And landing in Malaysia, which is pushing new rules on hotels and resorts to become more appealing to Muslim tourists, Islamic tourism is now $125 billion industry. And the Malaysian government wants hotels to stop serving alcohol. Wait a minute, what? In offset, it is crazy. And offer food and facilities that comply with religious guidelines. I'm not sure about this. Muslim visitors to Malaysia have already tripled in the past decade. It is expected to grow more than 50 percent in the next six years.</p><p>All right, two hot topics right now, building a better economy and job creation. Our next guest has shown success in both areas adding 10,000 jobs and lowering unemployment by more than two points in just two years.</p><p>Joining me now on the FOX Business exclusive is Mississippi governor, <person><nameText>Phil Bryant.</nameText></person></p><p>Governor, thank you so much joining us on the show.</p><p>GOV. <person><nameText>PHIL BRYANT, </nameText></person>MISSISSIPPI: It is always delightful to be here. Thank you for having me.</p><p>FRANCIS: Everyone in your state is a buzz thinking this will be the year of the Tuscaloosa Marine shale. This is a tremendous geological formation, EnCana Corporation and Goodrich are both planning of spending hundreds of millions of dollars to get in there. Is this the year for that shale formation?</p><p>BRYANT: Absolutely. If you look at the companies that I hear you talked about, EnCana, Goodrich is here, almost half a billion dollars worth of investment just now, about 22,000 people in the state of Mississippi employed in the oil and gas industry. It is blooming in Mississippi. Our Tuscaloosa Marine Shale is something we are counting on. We put a lot of investment in it. I cut taxes on that region for oil that is produced by hydraulic fracturing and that has stimulated the growth in that area. That and our stability to help regulate, if you will, that industry on the state level, our state's first initiative that are working hard without GCC (ph) as chairman of the interstate oil and gas compact commission, that is critical along with permitting speed. We are second in the nation.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. I mean, are you receiving any push back from environmentalists? Because I know your neighbors over in Louisiana had a recent oil spill. People get very nervous about fracking. I mean, that is unrelated but it gets environmentalists up in arms and people who care about the land. Are you getting any push back?</p><p>BRYANT: Well, it certain, we always do. We had the largest spill in America's history. If you look at what happened with the BP spill a few years ago, we were able to manage that. If you look at what happened in Louisiana, no loss of marine life, no injuries occurred there. These are going to occur in any type of industry. The important part of it is having an immediate response to let everyone in Washington know we care more about our land, our water, our environment than they do and we are here to protect it and the same time grow our energy.</p><p>FRANCIS: Great point.</p><p>You look at places like California, where there are need of revenue and jobs. They have the Monterey Shale which they are pretty much ignoring, you know, that they don't want to disturb. Can you quantify for you what the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale means to you? How many jobs, how many dollars, what do you see down a road?</p><p>BRYANT: Sure. I think it made in this meeting as 9,000 new jobs. I think it means billions of dollars of investment. I think it means new infrastructure, Mississippians is coming home that are now working in North Dakota and Oklahoma and perhaps Texas. And so, those Mississippians are working there because our jobs in the energy industry there, we want them to come back to Mississippi and take jobs we are creating here in the oil and gas industry.</p><p>FRANCIS: And what do you have to do to provide the right employees in the right labor force? Because I covered energy for a really long time and it was always hard to find the best engineers and the best skilled folks. What are you doing to provide the industry with that?</p><p>BRYANT: Well, of course, as workforce is trying, working with community colleges. We put several million dollars in to work for safety training facilities at one of our community colleges in southwest Mississippi. Working with Mississippi State to get petroleum engineering program back up and running. That went out of existence in the 1980s when everyone was saying that gas and liquid is out of business and we have to depend on other forms of energy. And now that it is back, we are having to restart, if you will, some of that. But we do that in a very rapid manner as a sense of urgency of getting the work force ready.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>Governor, thanks so much for coming on and good luck to you. I can't wait to hear about the progress.</p><p>BRYANT: Thank you so much for having me. We will talk more about it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Counting down to the last hour trading right now.</p><p>Liz Claman, what do you got coming up on the closing bell, another jammed- pack show?</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FBN HOST, COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL: Yes, always. Always because is that last and all-important hour.</p><p>Listen. There is a stock that is falling about nine percent today. But you need to perhaps put that aside because it is up more than 100 percent over the past year and that is neutral system. On this very day, word is announced that the Obama administration will change the labels on food to make the calories a lot bigger so we can really see what we are eating.</p><p>Dawn Zier is joining us. She has turned this company around since 2012. Again, the stock is up exponentially. There's a big short position on it but there is a lot on short position on whitewater's, its competitor as well, but it has not kept pace with new Nuetra (ph) system. Dawn is going to talk about what she makes of the new labeling that is expected to be announced tomorrow with the first lady Michelle Obama.</p><p>We are also going to be talking to the first lady of NASCAR driving, Danica Patrick, in a FOX Business exclusive. You know she has been working with go daddy for years. Go Daddy, the Web site operator. But listen, they are now trying to inspire people to start small businesses. Wait till you see the latest, I can call it nothing, Melissa, but shtick. We will show you the most incredible clip, sounds like reality TV, five people who have been paid to quit their jobs and start their own business about to make their pitch while she drives the track at 150 miles an hour.</p><p>FRANCIS: They are great ad shtick. No one does it like them. I can't wait to see that. I love Danica Patrick.</p><p>Liz, great show. I can't wait.</p><p>All right, coming up, just think of the first lady. We were just talking about this. She wants us all in shaped. That means new sweeping changes could be coming to a food label near you. Companies will add extra nutritionally information on their packaging, some say it will hurt the bottom line big time.</p><p>We will check it out because you never have too much \"Money\" and I think too much information.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, I want to show you shares of GAP because investors there, really sitting on their hands as they wait for earnings to come out \"after the bell.\" They announced last week that they would raise the minimum hourly wage to $9 in 2014 and then up to $10 in 2015. A lot of people think Banana Republic might be showing some improvement. So we will find out about that \"after the bell.\" Look at that. Yu can see the stock there has been doing better of late and there are experiences as well.</p><p>All right, it is time for a little \"Spare Change\" if you like to spend those extra nickels and dimes on snack food, that is, you may be in for some big changes. The White House is proposing new requirements for nutrition labels that could affect every single packaged food product that you buy.</p><p>Rich Edson is on the story in D.C.</p><p>Rich, I thought these labels, it sort of blast you with the calories. They want to make sure you know exactly what you are getting into.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Right. And you know, and it is not just the size of the calorie count but the number, the actual number is probably going to be bigger. You think of it this way. So you know, let's say you pick up a cookie package and you see 100 calories on that back and that is not bad. Then you see the serving size as like half a cookie. Well, what the FDA says, you know, is that they will update serving size requirements to reflect the amounts that people actually eat. So you are going to see that. It will be more prominently displayed in the number will be larger. Then on top of that, they are also going to break out added sugars. People say that basically you want to know naturally assuring sugar but also the amount of sugar that is added into a product and a few other changes.</p><p>FRANCIS: We are looking at the label side by side and you can see the calorie counters is just a whole lot bigger. How do food producers feel about this? I mean, obviously, they have to go through the cost in designing a new label, right? How do they feel about it?</p><p>EDSON: Right. When you talk to analysts about this one and they say that the label cost, it will be an additional cost but I don't think that is necessarily the problem. They say that when you are going forward on all of this and you look it where food trends have been in the U.S. for the last four years since 2010, there have been and you will declines in American buying habits. They are moving away from processed prepackaged foods moving more toward healthier foods.</p><p>So if you have a situation where calorie count numbers are starting to move up because of serving sizes have changed that may change the way people buy these foods and could hurt the process food makers.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. I guess although, I mean, it is just more information. I feel like it is the same thing like when the restaurants here in New York, Dunkin Donuts, you know, when they had to put up the calories for everything thing. They thought it would drive Dunkin out of business. And instead, you just learned that the brand muffin was the most fattening thing you could possibly have, you might as well have a donut because it led. It hasn't been that terrible so, we will see.</p><p>Anyway, Rich, thanks so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>EDSON: Thanks.</p><p>FRANCIS: Up next, what is the worst thing you can imagine happening to your retirement? The average 401(k) account plummeted by 25 percent during the last financial crisis, meaning there are a lot of people out there with some catching up to do. Small-businesses are also feeling this week. We have some real-life fixes to some of the biggest problems facing your golden years. We are going to fix it. You can never have too much money.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether it's on Wall Street or Main Street, here's who's making money today.</p><p>Anyone with a stake in sears? The struggling department store posting declining sales due to a quote \"tough and terrible holiday corner,\" that's crop. But a plan to raise a billion in cash by going out to (INAUDIBLE) has investors reacting possibly, at least shares are up nearly six percent right now. The CEO Eddie Lanford (ph) is benefiting nicely. The billionaire hedge fund manager has more than 25 million shares meaning he just made an extra $57 million, because he needed it.</p><p>Also making money, miss congeniality herself, Sandra Bullock. The Hollywood actress earning tens of millions of dollars for her role in the award-winning movie \"Gravity.\" Word is Bullock has deal included $20 million up front and that after that she gets 15 percent of Warner Brothers share of the box office revenue plus a cut from home rental and TV sales. That is already looking to be about $50 million. Wow. Means the Oscar winner is lining up for a $70 million payday. Truly out of this world! Good for her.</p><p>Making even more money than that, top executives at private equity firm Carlyle Group, the three founders each received around $93 million in dividend and salary last year. That is up 60 percent from the year before. It reflects how well the group has been doing lately. Income rose more than 20 percent last year. And its fourth quarter earnings more than tripled. Nice job.</p><p>All right, one thing almost everyone can agree on, retirement saving is a tricky thing. Ups and downs in the market, housing bubbles, unexpected expenses, there is a way to fix those worst case scenarios, so listen up.</p><p>Brian Graft is the CEO and director of the American society of pension professionals and actuaries. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>Let's get right to it. Let me hit you with one of the first problems. This is a high-tech business owner, the small owner, although I know, someone in this situation right now. The small business is doing well, they don't have a lot of employees, but they offer the employees a 401(k). There are new tax rules out there that, basically, double tax this distribution. So it may make it go away. How do you deal with that situation, how do you help your employees to save for retirement? What do you do?</p><p>BRIAN GRAFT, CEO, DIRECTOR, THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF PENSION PROFESSIONALS AND ACTUARIES: Well, Melissa, it's a perfectly -- it is a real problem out there with this proposal by Chairman Camp that was introduced yesterday that he would actually double tax contributions on behalf of small business owners. So the concern is if from the small business owner, it started to have doubled tax. They no longer have an incentive to keep that plans going --</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. So what should they do?</p><p>GRAFT: So what we've got to do is, one, make sure that this double tax proposal doesn't get enacted and proposals like that. Instead, what we need to be doing is encouraging more small business owners to have plans like your friend because the key to retirement for workers is having a plan at work. People making between $30,000 and $50,000, when they're covered by a plan at work, 70 percent of them participate. When they don't have a plan at work, less than five percent on them save on their own.</p><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely. Let's get on the second scenario, public schoolteacher. The problem is that this person has just gotten through putting their kids through college.</p><p>GRAFT: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: And, basically, was using all their retirement savings for this. There are lots of people in this situation.</p><p>GRAFT: Right. Millions, actually.</p><p>FRANCIS: So now they want to try and catch up. How do you start catching up?</p><p>GRAFT: Well, the key is to kind of make sure that you're thinking about this in advance, but a critical part of the law today is the allowance of catch-up contributions. They're very important because there are a lot of people who are putting their kids through college, and then all of a sudden -- hopefully if all things go well, kids go through college. They can now catch up with respect to their retirement savings. Unfortunately, another proposal introduced yesterday would freeze benefit limits and contribution limits at current levels for over a decade.</p><p>FRANCIS: I know. But rather than talking about laws that may or may not be enacted, how do you help the person catch up? What's the first thing you would ask them to do?</p><p>GRAFT: Well, what they've got to do is plan for the catch-up scenario. So they know they've got a burden in terms of costs and expenses while the kids are going through college. They need to know that because the law allows them to put more money aside, they have an opportunity to do so. So they're going to go ahead and take that into account.</p><p>And fortunately, and millions of Americans actually do this, they then increase their contributions as they get closer to retirement so they can catch up with respect o the savings that they missed while the kids were away in college.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Brian, thanks so much. We appreciate your time.</p><p>GRAFT: You're welcome.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, that's all we have more you. I hope that you are making money today. Be sure to tune in tomorrow. Thank you for joining us here at our new time. I hope you'll stay with us, 2 p.m. here on the east coast. The \"Countdown to the Closing bell\" starts right now with Liz Claman.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

We have two governors, both exclusive, <person><nameText>Florida's Rick Scott, </nameText></person>Mississippi's <person><nameText>Phil Bryant, </nameText></person>both on huge job pushes right now. Today's signature Wall Street throwdown features Charlie Gasparino and Chapwood Fund's Jared Levy. That's going to be great, fighting over whether something smells fishy in the Tesla bond deal being underwritten by Morgan Stanley. You might want to get some popcorn for that one. And of course, there is today's \"Money Talker\", the latest round in Icahn versus eBay. Because even when they say it's not it is always about money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FRANCIS: New Fed chair <person><nameText>Janet Yellen </nameText></person>just wrapping up her testimony before the Senate banking committee. Let's check in with Scott Shellady on the floor of the CME. You know, one thing in particular caught my attention. She said the economic data, particularly consumer spending had softened since she testified before the House committee. That was just two weeks ago! Things have gotten worse in the past two weeks, does that make you nervous, Scott?</p><p>SCOTT SHELLADY, TREAN GROUP SENIOR V.P.: Well, you know what? It is not making me nervous because I think I've felt this way for two or three months now ever since the retailers gone to came in weak over Christmas. So, here is where we sit. We've got a Fed that is going to be trying to taper. And they're tapering because - not because the economy can handle it. We're actually in a soft patch right now. But they are going to taper because it is a failed economic policy. And if they stop the taper I think that also sends another bad signal and the market could actually tumble from there as well, because, though, that reads into the fact that maybe the Fed sees something that is worse than we actually think. So we're in a very precarious spot right now.</p><p>FRANCIS: So what do you think she should do?</p><p>SHELLADY: Well, this is what I think is going to happen. I think that we try to put Q.E. out of there to inflate our way out of this problem and get some growth. We didn't buy any growth.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>SHELLADY: Aim two and a half percent GDP, that didn't happen, and we definitely didn't get any inflation. So, what the Fed is going to have to start doing now is fight deflation. So, I think ultimately we're going to have to stimulate, but maybe not in the way that we've been doing up until now. Maybe interest on overnight reserves or some other way because this is not going to be the way to work. I think that ultimately you're going to watch what happened in Japan. And if we do have the deflation, deflation is the one thing that the Fed is really scared about.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. So, meanwhile, against that backdrop, leave that markets board up right now, look at the S&amp;P 500. It is trading at 1853.59. All- time intraday high, 1858. We're flirting with record territory here. So, why are we seeing such a move in the S&amp;P if you're painting a precarious picture there?</p><p>SHELLADY: Right. I know, it is perverse, is it? And why do we see the ten-year yields rally at the same time?</p><p>FRANCIS: There you go.</p><p>SHELLADY: Well, this is what's going to be. This is the world we're in. We're going to see ten percent - we're going to put ten percent on the stocks by end of the year. Maybe even 15 percent because we're going to either stimulate in a different manner, or, the economy does finally catch up and justifies these asset prices where they are. But in either scenario I think we're going to add to stocks, just because I think ultimately I think it's going to be the stimulus. I don't think it's going to be the economy is not going to catch up. And number two is that the ten-year is telling me that we still have a lot to worry about. That's why it didn't, the ten-year didn't break when we saw the stocks rally last week and early this week. Now, the ten year are starting to rally and the yields are starting to break, and we are still rallying as far as the stock market goes. We are in trouble. We need to see bunches of good numbers. Boy, oh, boy, is this jobs number on Friday, next Friday, very important.</p><p>FRANCIS: Nice setup for us, Scott, thanks so much.</p><p>SHELLADY: Already.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, everyone is talking Tesla today. Shares hitting the brinks after wild week of gains. Auto makers planning a bond offering to raise $1.6 billion for its new battery factory. But here is where the controversy comes in. So, one of the banks that is backing the deal, Morgan Stanley just released a report with a huge price target raise that sent the stock soaring. Is there a conflict of interest in there? Get ready to rumble in today's Wall Street Throwdown. It is Chapwood Investments, Jared Levy, against our very own Charlie Gasparino.</p><p>FRANCIS: Oh, yeah. There you go. The whistle .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Charlie.</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS: You've got to do that in my ear?</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes he did have to do that, he wanted to get your attention ahead of time and ensure that it was a fair fight. What do you think? You're the one Charlie Gasparino, you're one that sort of raised the issue. Isn't that convenient? They raised .</p><p>GASPARINO: Gambling here - Is it gambling?</p><p>FRANCIS: From 153 to 320.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: And then boom it's announced the next day that they're underwriting the convert deal.</p><p>GASPARINO: Well, the one of the - one of the .</p><p>FRANCIS: One of four.</p><p>GASPARINO: I mean this is so obvious it is not even worth debating. Anybody that says it is not obvious is crazy. And just doesn't know how Wall Street works. The bottom line is this, these Wall Street firm sells - somewhere ten years after we had a major settlement in terms of Wall Street allegedly cleaning up its sell-side research, separating, creating the alleged or the infamous Chinese Wall, making it more sturdy it is just as broken. This stuff goes on every day.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Jared, Charles has just called you crazy and said you don't know how Wall Street works, by the way.</p><p>GASPARINO: One other thing, we should put out.</p><p>FRANCIS: Just not to throw .</p><p>GASPARINO: One other thing we should put out - They didn't just like, you know, say Tesla is a good company.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, 153 to 320. I mean that's .</p><p>GASPARINO: They went insane.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jared, are you crazy?</p><p>JARED LEVY, CHAPWOOD FUND MANAGING PARTNER: OK, maybe a little bit. You know, I've been doing this for 20 years, right? And I think Charlie is giving way too much credit to the four analysts that maybe just graduated from Wharton over at Morgan Stanley. Like they're calling Goldman and JPMorgan, say, hey guys, guess what? First of all, we're going to issue debt and we're going to dilute the shares. Which normally sends stock lower by the way. Just to read .</p><p>GASPARINO: Convertible debt?</p><p>LEVY: Yeah. Convertible - whatever your .</p><p>GASPARINO: It's going to convert.</p><p>LEVY: Issue debt or whatever you're diluting stock.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right. OK. So then why did they increase the price target?</p><p>FRANCIS: I think they're pumping up a customer is Charlie's accusation.</p><p>LEVY: This is why - this is why .</p><p>GASPARINO: Then why .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEVY: Charlie, wait, wait, listen to me. Would you listen to me for a second?</p><p>FRANCIS: Talk.</p><p>LEVY: OK, here's the deal. You've got - you're doubling volume. This gigafactory is going to double the potential volume. It changes the whole case. If you read the report from Morgan Stanley they changed their base case. These guys can't make up numbers. And if the numbers suck that bad, if the numbers suck that bad, they couldn't get one percent yields on their debt.</p><p>GASPARINO: He just made my point. Diluting..</p><p>FRANCIS: He did sort of make the point.</p><p>GASPARINO: They're diluting the shareholder and they are saying .</p><p>FRANCIS: And yet, they are till raising the price target.</p><p>GASPARINO: They are not raising it. They doubled it.</p><p>FRANCIS: They doubled it.</p><p>GASPARINO: And this is insane.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jared, you are kind of making his case .</p><p>GASPARINO: And here's the other thing.</p><p>FRANCIS: That even worse bet.</p><p>GASPARINO: Here's the other thing. Yes, they do get on the phone and talk to the bankers and they do talk to the company. And someone says this is our customer. Yeah, that all does happen. Just - let the viewer know that out there.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jared?</p><p>LEVY: Yeah. It happens, Charlie, but again --</p><p>GASPARINO: OK. Thank you, you made my point again.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEVY: You cannot listen to me. You cannot make up numbers.</p><p>GASPARINO: I'm trying, dude.</p><p>LEVY: You can't - There is a fair market out there, Charlie. And it's all like I could say, oh, yeah .</p><p>GASPARINO: Bear market.</p><p>LEVY: Buy this .</p><p>GASPARINO: Because we could call these guys .</p><p>LEVY: For $2 million, because you're my buddy. Buy this old Fiat from 1974, pay 2 million because it's worth it. You wouldn't do that because you've got clients to represent. You've got clients to report to. They can't just make up numbers.</p><p>GASPARINO: So, you're telling me - you're telling me - you're telling me it's beyond Morgan Stanley with the biggest retail brokerage network in the world, in America, 18,000 brokers, to pump up a client? You are saying that?</p><p>LEVY: I am 100 percent saying that.</p><p>GASPARINO: The Brooklyn Bridge is for sale, dude.</p><p>LEVY: And JPMorgan.</p><p>GASPARINO: The Brooklyn Bridge is for sale.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO: The Brooklyn Bridge is for sale.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. I think I hear a whistle.</p><p>(WHISTLE)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Thank you, gentlemen. All right.</p><p>GASPARINO: Thanks, Jared.</p><p>FRANCIS: Thanks so much.</p><p>Coming up, two governor exclusives. First, Florida's big push to be the new hot spot for the tech industry. <person><nameText>Governor Rick Scott </nameText></person>tells us about how he is successfully bringing jobs down to the Sunshine state. And later, Mississippi governor <person><nameText>Phil Bryant </nameText></person>on his state's plan to create jobs. Is the key, fracking regulations? We're going to get the inside scoop, more \"MONEY\" coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: Significant economic turnaround is underway in Florida where private sector job creation is booming. Especially in the tech industry. The sunshine state becoming a hotbed for innovation and businesses are taking notice. Moving their operations down south and creating nearly half a million new jobs. Since <person><nameText>Governor Rick Scott </nameText></person>took office in 2010. I spoke to him just a short time ago in a Fox Business exclusive.</p><p>(on camera): Thank you so much for coming on the program.</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R) FLORIDA: Well, tell me, is it true, did you all go to Roger Ailes (ph) and say, look, we need to move to Florida? We like the fact there is no income tax, better weather, close to Latin America.</p><p>FRANCIS: You're speaking my language. Singing my song, speaking my language. Yes. I love that idea. We would move to Florida in a heartbeat. Tell me, you're doing incredible things in your state that would make other states very envious. I'm looking at Amazon moving to Tampa, bringing more than 1,000 jobs with it. 300 million in capital. Time Warner moving to Tampa, with 500 new jobs. $5 million in capital investment. What did you have to offer them to get that done?</p><p>SCOTT: You know, we're a great state. No income tax and we're a right-to- work state. The gateway to Latin America. We have 5 million multilingual speakers. We have great universities, have brand new - brand new universities that are just doing science technology, engineering and math. So, we're talking to companies every day and they are clearly moving. And people are moving here, but companies are expanding. Yesterday I was with a technology company that is adding over 100 jobs just in technology. But even the non-technology companies are moving here because of our technology. Hertz, 700 jobs. Average income, $100,000. People want to be here.</p><p>FRANCIS: They do, but you're doing something different recently because Florida has had those tremendous assets for a while, yet, when you took office the unemployment rate was 11.4 percent. It is now down to 6.2. So all those things have been in place.</p><p>SCOTT: You're right, we've changed.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, what have you changed recently because other states should follow your example I would think?</p><p>SCOTT: In the four years before I came into office, the state lost 832,000 jobs. Unemployment went from 3.5 to 11.1 percent. So, right after I got elected I sat down with site selectors from around the country and said here is why you should come to Florida. And they said, you know, we don't talk to Florida.</p><p>FRANCIS: Why?</p><p>SCOTT: And that has completely changed. We're talking to them now and saying what do your clients need?</p><p>FRANCIS: But why? What was the reason? Why did they say they didn't talk to Florida before?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, they said that last administration wouldn't return their phone calls. Wasn't focused, took forever, if you were even interested in making a decision. So I sat down with them. I said, here's my cell number. Call me directly. I will solve every problem I can. Plus, in the meantime, we've cut taxes 24 times in three years. This year we'll cut taxes $500 million. I've cut about 3,000 regulations. We've streamlined the permitting process. And we just do what I did in business.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jacksonville, for example, becoming a big hub for startups.</p><p>SCOTT: Yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS: In 2013 there was a big crowd funding event that drew 130,000 attendees. 20 percent came from out-of-state. Is Jacksonville the next big tech center, the same way that we have heard about Austin and, of course, we know about Silicon Valley and we are hearing about places in the Midwest? Is Jacksonville really hot?</p><p>SCOTT: Jacksonville is hot. But you know, Gainesville, Orlando, Tampa. We're going to have - I think the biggest Hispanic technology conference ever in the world is going to be in Miami in May. So people want to be here. We've got great young people. We've got great universities, great state colleges. They want to be here to build their companies. We already have the third most number of technology companies in the country in Florida. So we are the next, the whole state is the next Silicon Valley.</p><p>FRANCIS: Is it essential to be tech focused? I mean I keep hearing you say that you have I.T. professionals that are trained. If another state is watching this and wanting to follow in your footsteps, is it essential that you have that tech component and the tech training?</p><p>SCOTT: Oh, I think it is very important. But what I'm working on is to make sure universities and state colleges are graduating the students for the future. Where are all the jobs going, that's the degrees we're going to focus on and then continue to recruit companies that are already here to expand? Make sure they stay here.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>SCOTT: Because other governors are trying to recruit like I am. We're just going to try to do it better than anyone else.</p><p>FRANCIS: You've got me convinced. I'm ready to open the Fox Business bureau right on the beach. I can't wait .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCOTT: You would love it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>SCOTT: All right, have a great day.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. We want to show you some headlines that are crossing right now from \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Quizno's, you see it on so many corners, preparing to file for bankruptcy. The general reporting they have a $570 million debt load right now. One thing really interesting about the story, their list of creditors, some of the biggest names in private money. Avenue, Fortress, and Oak Tree, are among the folks that they owe money to right now, going into bankruptcy.</p><p>All right, up next, babies are a big business. And of course, there is an app for that. A new app claiming it is the answer for anyone trying to get pregnant or not! Also trying not to get pregnant, similarly important. Let me tell you. The CEO of Kindara is here. And we all want to retire someday, but a new survey says, it is still out of reach for many. We have got some of the worst-case scenario situations and more importantly, the way to fix them to make sure you're set no matter what!</p><p>Do you ever have too much money?</p><p>FRANCIS: No false-positives about it, an innovative new app is helping thousands of women get pregnant or not get pregnant. Also, very important. It's in the spotlight for innovation today. Here now with the cofounder and the CEO of Kindara, Will Sacks. Will, I can't wait to hear how this works. How does an app help you get pregnant? I mean is it just a naked picture of a really attractive person or how does it work?</p><p>WILL SACKS, KINDARA COFOUNDER &amp; CEO: No, we haven't integrated that yet.</p><p>FRANCIS: No.</p><p>SACKS: But so, Kindara is based on data tracking. So, similarly, you know, people have heard of apps to track their weight, to track what they eat. And Kindara is an app based on tracking their personal data related to your fertility. So, women use it be entering their personal fertility signs every day. And then we analyze those signs to give them a very accurate and detailed picture of what is happening with their fertility every single day of their cycle.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow, it sounds like there is a lot of liability in there if your app messes up really in either direction. Do you worry about that at all?</p><p>SACKS: We have good lawyers, first of all. FRANCIS: That is fantastic. That is always very important.</p><p>SACKS: Which is important and we don't worry about it too much on the pregnancy side. The worst-case scenario is the woman, it takes her longer to get pregnant. So that is not a big deal for us.</p><p>FRANCIS: Not for you. It might be for her though.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Go ahead. Keep going. Sorry, I'm trying to --</p><p>SACKS: Right. It might take her an extra few cycles, you know. And then on the birth control side we don't provide prediction to each individual woman. It's up to her to interpret her own data. So, that is how we make sure that we're not giving people bad data and they are getting a maximum understanding of their bodies every day.</p><p>FRANCIS: You have more than 55,000 monthly users. The users are reporting nearly 500 pregnancies a week. That sounds scary and dangerous. The app has helped 10,000 women get pregnant in the last year. How do you monetize that? Are you charging them?</p><p>SACKS: We're not right now. We're really focused on growth, currently. We see a lot of opportunity in the future to use people's individual situation, to connect them with products and services and practitioners who are going to help them meet their goals. So a woman who is trying to get pregnant, we can help her maybe identify a hormone problem and then connect her with a practitioner or a product that's going to help her with that problem.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, how do you see monetizing this down the road? Is it a fee- for-service? Or are you, you know, letting folks, diapers.com advertise to these folks? Or how do you see making money? Because the show is called \"MONEY\" and we love money.</p><p>SACKS: Yes, so the two main things that we're thinking about, are first the practitioner directory to connect women with relevant practitioners in their area.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>SACKS: We make money on that referral fee. And second, advice, like the mint.com for fertility. So we can connect women with products and services that are going to help them as they go through their journey to conceive.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you - real quick - do you see other applications for this beyond pregnancy? Are there other things that you want to do?</p><p>SACKS: Yes. We see ourselves as a full women's health platform. So, right now we're really focused on fertility and pregnancy. And in the future we'll focus on other women's health challenges like breast feeding and ovulation and even menopause.</p><p>FRANCIS: Will, thanks so much. Appreciate it. Good luck to you.</p><p>SACKS: Yes, thanks, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, I want to show you two stocks right now. Let me show you the AMC first. It is higher after a big jump in quarterly revenue reported there on the back of \"Walking Dead.\" And you can see they are - those investors liking that result. Up about 6.5 percent. I'd like to show you TiVo as well, the stock has been soaring. It beat its revenue estimates. Expects to benefit from the Comcast Time Warner deal. And you could see there that stock also great day for those investors. Up about 6.4 percent on the day.</p><p>So, this is so cool. I just have to show it to you. I've been fascinated with this all day. Boeing's new Black phone. It may look like an ordinary cell phone. It could really be something out of the spy movie. The Black phone not only encrypts all of your calls, it also self-destructs if anyone tries to crack it open. The secretive cell also works on multiple frequency bands and networks to make it even harder to hack into. It is so secretive in fact, that Boeing has not even provided a price or release date. It is 36 months in the making. Hopefully they will release it soon. So far investors on board with the Boeing Black. The stock is up a little more than one and a half percent on the day. I like that. I don't have any secrets, but I want the phony anyway because it is just cool.</p><p>All right, next up, more on the Icahn-eBay saga. A new round of accusations against the legendary activist investor, this time from eBay's founder and chairman. What is next? Tweet me. And tell me what you think it is today's \"Money Talker.\"</p><p>And who is making money today? Hollywood's star's career has defied \"Gravity\" and has been taking off three decades ago. She is seeing her biggest pay day yet. That is so obvious. \"Piles of Money\" for her, though, coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: Shares of the Best Buy on the move right now. The company beats profit expectations. David Strasser is an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. David, you're on a conference call this morning. What did you hear that surprise you?</p><p>DAVID STRASSER: Well, I think they are focused. You know, 18 months ago this company everyone thought was going out of business, because the Amazon was going to put them out of business.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>STRASSER: I would actually argue today. They are probably one of the best brick and click, or you know, hybrid models out there that the investments they've made, the ones that they're working on, are making them very tough to compete with online.</p><p>FRANCIS: Interesting. Do you think they'll have to downsize their retail stores even more, though?</p><p>STRASSER: I mean I think so. I mean, no, they have markets where they have probably more density of stores than they need and I think over time it is inevitable that will happen. I mean they are taking hours out of the store to some degree, because, you know, 12.5 percent of their business, you know, is now online. I mean some of that productivity you just don't need as much investment in NSGA.</p><p>FRANCIS: You know, you = we're looking at the chart, though. It looks very negative, the stock fell off a cliff here. But you sound really positive. Do you think there is an opportunity?</p><p>STRASSER: Yeah, there is an opportunity here. I mean I think the proof of concept still is going to come in queue four. You know, they are at a tough queue four. Even though they beat today, they had lowered numbers due to a very promotable holiday. You know, but I think as you look at everybody who has worked in retail over the last couple of weeks I don't think anybody had a very good holiday and they are, you know, it's clearly not something specific to them. I mean there are some pluses and minuses to their business right here.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>STRASSER: This business - the stock, I think goes higher from here but ultimately you need a good Q 4 for it to really have a big move.</p><p>FRANCIS: David Strasser, thanks so much for taking time out for us. We appreciate it. Back to work.</p><p>STRASSER: All right.</p><p>FRANCIS: You're like thanks a lot. All right, Carl Icahn throwing yet another punch in his very public battle with eBay. The billionaire investor firing off his third letter to shareholders this week, he is behind the typewriter, you know, sending his letters out, furious, riling everyone up. The ecommerce giant isn't backing down, the founder and chairman himself just responded so who's going to win this fight? Here for the \"Money Talker\" is A.J. Capital Hilary Cramer. We have Tuttle Wealth Management's Matthew Tuttle. And the \"Wall Street Journal's\" James Freeman. Icahn is on fire. Once again, is he right or is he a giant pain in the ass? What do you think, Matthew?</p><p>MATTHEW TUTTLE, TUTTLE WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Well, it depends where you are sitting. If you an eBay shareholder he's brought up a lot of questions that you want definite answers to, and, you know, it is no secret that boards of directors are often going to do things that in their own best interest and not looking up for the shareholder.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>TUTTLE: So .</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL: He might be both, to answer your questions. I mean and shareholders have definitely been enjoying the ride last month or so, since his interest has come out. But some of his tactics - it is hard to take him seriously. He starts out saying you'd got to split eBay from PayPal. That doesn't really catch on, so then he says, basically these letters saying the board needs to be taken out.</p><p>FRANCIS: You know, having cook on the board will pay pal while they are planning PayPal's features a kin to having Pete Carroll, coach of the Seahawks, sitting in when the Denver Broncos were constructing their game plan for the Super Bowl, but then again, maybe he did.</p><p>Carl Icahn is about intimidation. Corporate raider who started in the 1980s. He is the man who brought TWA down, that he made money and thousands of people without a pension. The good news is this isn't going to happen to e-bay. Either, e-bay and PayPal will stay together or they will split apart.</p><p>HILARY KRAMER, A&amp;G CAPITAL: In my opinion, e-bay and PayPal need to stay together. And because there is synergy there as PayPal continues to grow - -</p><p>FRANCIS: But I wonder about Icahn does. I mean, if you look what he did with Apple, you know, he gets in. He has a plan. He wants apple, you know, to relieve all of this cash. He brought the shares up. He didn't achieve what he wanted that made money. It was the same thing with the debt. Something doesn't --</p><p>MATTHEW TUTTLE, CEO, TUTTLE TACTICAL MANAGEMENT: It depends on where you are. If you are an e-bay shareholder, you sitting there and cheering him on. I mean, it is up to an up percent last time I looked today. And if you read --</p><p>FRANCIS: Is he enacted as investor doing the right thing for shareholders?</p><p>KRAMER: He does the right thing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: Putting pressure on corporate boards making sure business is run in the best way possible. The back of the day's board, it is fact challenge. This is not a journalistic explanation of what happened. You look at -- you read his case on the sale of Skype and you think there's something criminal, you learn later while the big winner actually was in resale more silver lake, and saying that the stock value was here and then 18 months later it was here and that some kind of scandal. I mean, stocks fluctuate. Investor sentiment changes and his attack is questionable but as far as shareholders, people like him buying pressure on management. So a lot of times, yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: Can it be disruptive for the company, though? I mean, it is good for shareholders. Is it bad?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TUTTLE: It is not going to be disruptive for the company. It makes the board of directors mad. But it is not going to effect.</p><p>KRAMER: It is going to make the lawyers richer. And I think there is distraction going on. E-bay shares will go higher. But e-bay share is going higher because the market is going higher in March. We are going to have a nice bull market, the month of March, and companies are heading --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: And we need to change the name activist investor. I mean, activist investor makes him sound like, you know, a puritanical things where he is out there.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KRAMER: That is what he was and now he just annoys me.</p><p>FREEMAN: I would be more confident if he is taking on a very old company, you know, horrible -- hardly managed, bloated cash, struggling pension plan that can't be sustained. This is a fairly young company, a fairly dynamic. I mean, he may be right here. I am not saying he is not, but I think it is harder call for investors than when he is taking on sort of the obvious reason --</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, maybe the stock of those companies doesn't move as readily. Maybe he is targeting companies where the stock has more beta.</p><p>TUTTLE: Well, also, I mean, e-bay shares didn't do that well last year when the market went up. So, if I am an e-bay shareholder, I look at what happened last year. I am not too happy. So, I am cheering him on if he can make this thing --.</p><p>FRANCIS: Go, Carl!</p><p>All right, thanks guys.</p><p>Up next, another governor exclusive, Mississippi's <person><nameText>Phil Bryant </nameText></person>lays out how he is beefing up the job market in his state. He lays out his secrets of success because at the end the date is all about money, just as Carl Icahn.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: I am Cheryl Casone with your FOX business brief.</p><p>General Motors could be fined $35 million federal safety regulators determined. The GM failed to act quickly enough to recall 1.6 million cars with faulty ignition switches. Earlier this week, GM doubled the number of recalled cars, but document show that automaker knew about the problem as early as 2004. The case is link to 33 accidents and 13 deaths.</p><p>Wells Fargo having 700 mortgage jobs across the country.

Swiss voters will vote on a proposal to impose minimum wage of $25 an hour. If it happens it would be the highest minimum wage in the world. Yes, it would. Several local economists are issuing stark warnings to Swiss citizens that you could lead to job cuts and hurt smaller companies.</p><p>All right over to Haiti, a local android tablet maker ramping up production on hot demand. Surtab started in the capital of Port-Au-Prince with an initial run of 4,000 devices. That is now being increased to 7,000 tablets a month. The Surtab looks similar to the ipad mini, it is a coincidence I'm sure. But it is just a fraction of the price. The cheapest model is $100. It is a symbol of what the island nation can achieve as it continues to recover from the devastating earthquake back in 2010. Good for them.</p><p>And landing in Malaysia, which is pushing new rules on hotels and resorts to become more appealing to Muslim tourists, Islamic tourism is now $125 billion industry. And the Malaysian government wants hotels to stop serving alcohol. Wait a minute, what? In offset, it is crazy. And offer food and facilities that comply with religious guidelines. I'm not sure about this. Muslim visitors to Malaysia have already tripled in the past decade. It is expected to grow more than 50 percent in the next six years.</p><p>All right, two hot topics right now, building a better economy and job creation. Our next guest has shown success in both areas adding 10,000 jobs and lowering unemployment by more than two points in just two years.</p><p>Joining me now on the FOX Business exclusive is Mississippi governor, <person><nameText>Phil Bryant.</nameText></person></p><p>Governor, thank you so much joining us on the show.</p><p>GOV. <person><nameText>PHIL BRYANT, </nameText></person>MISSISSIPPI: It is always delightful to be here. Thank you for having me.</p><p>FRANCIS: Everyone in your state is a buzz thinking this will be the year of the Tuscaloosa Marine shale. This is a tremendous geological formation, EnCana Corporation and Goodrich are both planning of spending hundreds of millions of dollars to get in there. Is this the year for that shale formation?</p><p>BRYANT: Absolutely. If you look at the companies that I hear you talked about, EnCana, Goodrich is here, almost half a billion dollars worth of investment just now, about 22,000 people in the state of Mississippi employed in the oil and gas industry. It is blooming in Mississippi. Our Tuscaloosa Marine Shale is something we are counting on. We put a lot of investment in it. I cut taxes on that region for oil that is produced by hydraulic fracturing and that has stimulated the growth in that area. That and our stability to help regulate, if you will, that industry on the state level, our state's first initiative that are working hard without GCC (ph) as chairman of the interstate oil and gas compact commission, that is critical along with permitting speed. We are second in the nation.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. I mean, are you receiving any push back from environmentalists? Because I know your neighbors over in Louisiana had a recent oil spill. People get very nervous about fracking. I mean, that is unrelated but it gets environmentalists up in arms and people who care about the land. Are you getting any push back?</p><p>BRYANT: Well, it certain, we always do. We had the largest spill in America's history. If you look at what happened with the BP spill a few years ago, we were able to manage that. If you look at what happened in Louisiana, no loss of marine life, no injuries occurred there. These are going to occur in any type of industry. The important part of it is having an immediate response to let everyone in Washington know we care more about our land, our water, our environment than they do and we are here to protect it and the same time grow our energy.</p><p>FRANCIS: Great point.</p><p>You look at places like California, where there are need of revenue and jobs. They have the Monterey Shale which they are pretty much ignoring, you know, that they don't want to disturb. Can you quantify for you what the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale means to you? How many jobs, how many dollars, what do you see down a road?</p><p>BRYANT: Sure. I think it made in this meeting as 9,000 new jobs. I think it means billions of dollars of investment. I think it means new infrastructure, Mississippians is coming home that are now working in North Dakota and Oklahoma and perhaps Texas. And so, those Mississippians are working there because our jobs in the energy industry there, we want them to come back to Mississippi and take jobs we are creating here in the oil and gas industry.</p><p>FRANCIS: And what do you have to do to provide the right employees in the right labor force? Because I covered energy for a really long time and it was always hard to find the best engineers and the best skilled folks. What are you doing to provide the industry with that?</p><p>BRYANT: Well, of course, as workforce is trying, working with community colleges. We put several million dollars in to work for safety training facilities at one of our community colleges in southwest Mississippi. Working with Mississippi State to get petroleum engineering program back up and running. That went out of existence in the 1980s when everyone was saying that gas and liquid is out of business and we have to depend on other forms of energy. And now that it is back, we are having to restart, if you will, some of that. But we do that in a very rapid manner as a sense of urgency of getting the work force ready.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>Governor, thanks so much for coming on and good luck to you. I can't wait to hear about the progress.</p><p>BRYANT: Thank you so much for having me. We will talk more about it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Counting down to the last hour trading right now.</p><p>Liz Claman, what do you got coming up on the closing bell, another jammed- pack show?</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FBN HOST, COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL: Yes, always. Always because is that last and all-important hour.</p><p>Listen. There is a stock that is falling about nine percent today. But you need to perhaps put that aside because it is up more than 100 percent over the past year and that is neutral system. On this very day, word is announced that the Obama administration will change the labels on food to make the calories a lot bigger so we can really see what we are eating.</p><p>Dawn Zier is joining us. She has turned this company around since 2012. Again, the stock is up exponentially. There's a big short position on it but there is a lot on short position on whitewater's, its competitor as well, but it has not kept pace with new Nuetra (ph) system. Dawn is going to talk about what she makes of the new labeling that is expected to be announced tomorrow with the first lady Michelle Obama.</p><p>We are also going to be talking to the first lady of NASCAR driving, Danica Patrick, in a FOX Business exclusive. You know she has been working with go daddy for years. Go Daddy, the Web site operator. But listen, they are now trying to inspire people to start small businesses. Wait till you see the latest, I can call it nothing, Melissa, but shtick. We will show you the most incredible clip, sounds like reality TV, five people who have been paid to quit their jobs and start their own business about to make their pitch while she drives the track at 150 miles an hour.</p><p>FRANCIS: They are great ad shtick. No one does it like them. I can't wait to see that. I love Danica Patrick.</p><p>Liz, great show. I can't wait.</p><p>All right, coming up, just think of the first lady. We were just talking about this. She wants us all in shaped. That means new sweeping changes could be coming to a food label near you. Companies will add extra nutritionally information on their packaging, some say it will hurt the bottom line big time.</p><p>We will check it out because you never have too much \"Money\" and I think too much information.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, I want to show you shares of GAP because investors there, really sitting on their hands as they wait for earnings to come out \"after the bell.\" They announced last week that they would raise the minimum hourly wage to $9 in 2014 and then up to $10 in 2015. A lot of people think Banana Republic might be showing some improvement. So we will find out about that \"after the bell.\" Look at that. Yu can see the stock there has been doing better of late and there are experiences as well.</p><p>All right, it is time for a little \"Spare Change\" if you like to spend those extra nickels and dimes on snack food, that is, you may be in for some big changes. The White House is proposing new requirements for nutrition labels that could affect every single packaged food product that you buy.</p><p>Rich Edson is on the story in D.C.</p><p>Rich, I thought these labels, it sort of blast you with the calories. They want to make sure you know exactly what you are getting into.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Right. And you know, and it is not just the size of the calorie count but the number, the actual number is probably going to be bigger. You think of it this way. So you know, let's say you pick up a cookie package and you see 100 calories on that back and that is not bad. Then you see the serving size as like half a cookie. Well, what the FDA says, you know, is that they will update serving size requirements to reflect the amounts that people actually eat. So you are going to see that. It will be more prominently displayed in the number will be larger. Then on top of that, they are also going to break out added sugars. People say that basically you want to know naturally assuring sugar but also the amount of sugar that is added into a product and a few other changes.</p><p>FRANCIS: We are looking at the label side by side and you can see the calorie counters is just a whole lot bigger. How do food producers feel about this? I mean, obviously, they have to go through the cost in designing a new label, right? How do they feel about it?</p><p>EDSON: Right. When you talk to analysts about this one and they say that the label cost, it will be an additional cost but I don't think that is necessarily the problem. They say that when you are going forward on all of this and you look it where food trends have been in the U.S. for the last four years since 2010, there have been and you will declines in American buying habits. They are moving away from processed prepackaged foods moving more toward healthier foods.</p><p>So if you have a situation where calorie count numbers are starting to move up because of serving sizes have changed that may change the way people buy these foods and could hurt the process food makers.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. I guess although, I mean, it is just more information. I feel like it is the same thing like when the restaurants here in New York, Dunkin Donuts, you know, when they had to put up the calories for everything thing. They thought it would drive Dunkin out of business. And instead, you just learned that the brand muffin was the most fattening thing you could possibly have, you might as well have a donut because it led. It hasn't been that terrible so, we will see.</p><p>Anyway, Rich, thanks so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>EDSON: Thanks.</p><p>FRANCIS: Up next, what is the worst thing you can imagine happening to your retirement? The average 401(k) account plummeted by 25 percent during the last financial crisis, meaning there are a lot of people out there with some catching up to do. Small-businesses are also feeling this week. We have some real-life fixes to some of the biggest problems facing your golden years. We are going to fix it. You can never have too much money.</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether it's on Wall Street or Main Street, here's who's making money today.</p><p>Anyone with a stake in sears? The struggling department store posting declining sales due to a quote \"tough and terrible holiday corner,\" that's crop. But a plan to raise a billion in cash by going out to (INAUDIBLE) has investors reacting possibly, at least shares are up nearly six percent right now. The CEO Eddie Lanford (ph) is benefiting nicely. The billionaire hedge fund manager has more than 25 million shares meaning he just made an extra $57 million, because he needed it.</p><p>Also making money, miss congeniality herself, Sandra Bullock. The Hollywood actress earning tens of millions of dollars for her role in the award-winning movie \"Gravity.\" Word is Bullock has deal included $20 million up front and that after that she gets 15 percent of Warner Brothers share of the box office revenue plus a cut from home rental and TV sales. That is already looking to be about $50 million. Wow. Means the Oscar winner is lining up for a $70 million payday. Truly out of this world! Good for her.</p><p>Making even more money than that, top executives at private equity firm Carlyle Group, the three founders each received around $93 million in dividend and salary last year. That is up 60 percent from the year before. It reflects how well the group has been doing lately. Income rose more than 20 percent last year. And its fourth quarter earnings more than tripled. Nice job.</p><p>All right, one thing almost everyone can agree on, retirement saving is a tricky thing. Ups and downs in the market, housing bubbles, unexpected expenses, there is a way to fix those worst case scenarios, so listen up.</p><p>Brian Graft is the CEO and director of the American society of pension professionals and actuaries. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>Let's get right to it. Let me hit you with one of the first problems. This is a high-tech business owner, the small owner, although I know, someone in this situation right now. The small business is doing well, they don't have a lot of employees, but they offer the employees a 401(k). There are new tax rules out there that, basically, double tax this distribution. So it may make it go away. How do you deal with that situation, how do you help your employees to save for retirement? What do you do?</p><p>BRIAN GRAFT, CEO, DIRECTOR, THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF PENSION PROFESSIONALS AND ACTUARIES: Well, Melissa, it's a perfectly -- it is a real problem out there with this proposal by Chairman Camp that was introduced yesterday that he would actually double tax contributions on behalf of small business owners. So the concern is if from the small business owner, it started to have doubled tax. They no longer have an incentive to keep that plans going --</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. So what should they do?</p><p>GRAFT: So what we've got to do is, one, make sure that this double tax proposal doesn't get enacted and proposals like that. Instead, what we need to be doing is encouraging more small business owners to have plans like your friend because the key to retirement for workers is having a plan at work. People making between $30,000 and $50,000, when they're covered by a plan at work, 70 percent of them participate. When they don't have a plan at work, less than five percent on them save on their own.</p><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely. Let's get on the second scenario, public schoolteacher. The problem is that this person has just gotten through putting their kids through college.</p><p>GRAFT: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: And, basically, was using all their retirement savings for this. There are lots of people in this situation.</p><p>GRAFT: Right. Millions, actually.</p><p>FRANCIS: So now they want to try and catch up. How do you start catching up?</p><p>GRAFT: Well, the key is to kind of make sure that you're thinking about this in advance, but a critical part of the law today is the allowance of catch-up contributions. They're very important because there are a lot of people who are putting their kids through college, and then all of a sudden -- hopefully if all things go well, kids go through college. They can now catch up with respect to their retirement savings. Unfortunately, another proposal introduced yesterday would freeze benefit limits and contribution limits at current levels for over a decade.</p><p>FRANCIS: I know. But rather than talking about laws that may or may not be enacted, how do you help the person catch up? What's the first thing you would ask them to do?</p><p>GRAFT: Well, what they've got to do is plan for the catch-up scenario. So they know they've got a burden in terms of costs and expenses while the kids are going through college. They need to know that because the law allows them to put more money aside, they have an opportunity to do so. So they're going to go ahead and take that into account.</p><p>And fortunately, and millions of Americans actually do this, they then increase their contributions as they get closer to retirement so they can catch up with respect o the savings that they missed while the kids were away in college.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Brian, thanks so much. We appreciate your time.</p><p>GRAFT: You're welcome.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, that's all we have more you. I hope that you are making money today. Be sure to tune in tomorrow. Thank you for joining us here at our new time. I hope you'll stay with us, 2 p.m. here on the east coast. The \"Countdown to the Closing bell\" starts right now with Liz Claman.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONEY-2014022701cb230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BMF-21S1-JB20-G4PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7786\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MONEY</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>February 27, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>MS (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX002009</classCode><className>CONSUMER SPENDING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000913</classCode><className>INFLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000552</classCode><className>ECONOMIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000816</classCode><className>GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000465</classCode><className>DEFLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000198</classCode><className>BONDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000382</classCode><className>CONSUMER SPENDING &amp;

Warren listed Amazon Marketplace, Google's ad exchange and Google Search as examples of platform utilities under this law.</p><p>\"Therefore, Amazon Marketplace and Basics, and Google's ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart,\" said Warren in her proposal.</p><p>Breakups are tough</p><p>Douglas Melamed, a law professor at Stanford University who specializes in antitrust law, said that even if Warren were able to appoint regulators to evaluate previous mergers, undoing those combinations would be a tall task.</p><p>\"Ultimately, [regulators] have to persuade a court, and a court is going to look at [the mergers] and say ... either you were asleep at the switch, or this merger wasn't illegal and now you're just looking at the way that Instagram flourished under Facebook's ownership and saying, Well, that's reason enough to separate it,\" said Melamed.</p><p>But Melamed, who also previously oversaw Intel Corp.'s legal and government affairs departments, added that if a regulatory agency such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission did end up re-examining high-profile tech mergers that have already closed, it would be valuable to resolve existing concerns with them, even if the agency finds that the mergers did not stifle competition.</p><p>\"Now, there's this drumbeat from people saying these companies are behaving badly, and the companies deny it, but of course no one believes them,\" he said. \"What you don't really have is a thoughtful investigation by people who have the capacity to get the facts and then apply the law in a sensible way.\"</p><p>Bipartisan support</p><p>Some Republicans also believe big tech has become too powerful.</p><p>Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke out when Facebook took down ads posted by Warren that called for the breakup of the social media giant and its peers.</p><p>\"Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech,\" Cruz said in a March 12 tweet. \"They shouldn't be censoring Warren, or anybody else. A serious threat to our democracy.\"</p><p>Similarly, during Attorney General William Barr's confirmation hearing in January, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., noted the \"extraordinary concentration of power\" in Silicon Valley and asked Barr what role the U.S. Department of Justice would play in addressing anti-competitive conduct. Hawley also said it is possible the FTC has allowed big tech companies to violate antitrust laws.</p><p>Proving harm</p><p>Although many on both sides of the aisle agree that large tech firms have become too powerful, Donald Polden, a law professor at Santa Clara University who has expertise in antitrust law and securities regulation, argued that regulators will still have a tough time implementing broad proposals to rein in big tech.</p><p>\"It would be extremely difficult for an antitrust court to come in and say, 'OK, we're going to split Amazon into multiple pieces,'\" Polden said in an interview, \"[Warren] definitely needs to have more specific proposals in this area.\"</p><p>In order for antitrust regulators to unwind the previous acquisitions of Facebook, Google and Amazon, they must successfully prove that these companies have engaged in \"harmful\" business practices that had \"devastating effects\" on consumers, which would be challenging given the various benefits the firms also offer to consumers, Polden said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-50546548</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNV-P021-F19Y-C19R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"750\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Elizabeth Warren proposes to break up the Big Tech giants of Amazon, Google and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Her focus is a bit odd, because Warren, as a Harvard academic, first achieved national attention as co-author of a study claiming that medical bills were to blame for 62 percent of bankruptcies. It ignited a scholarly debate that continues. But health-care companies have gotten big - Pricewater-houseCoopers reported 255 mergers and acquisitions in the second quarter of 2018 alone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Warren was also the one who established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency to police the scams and hustles inflicted on households in the run-up to the financial panic of 2008 and the Great Recession. Many of the worst actors were big banks.</p><p> So it's not just Big Tech that needs the equivalent of trust busting - something I proposed in a column a year ago.</p><p> Health-care companies, banks, airlines, railroads, media companies, Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Telecom and more are too big and stifle competition, innovation, job creation, wages and customer choice. The share of young companies has been declining in America.</p><p> Yet Warren chose Big Tech rather than the areas where she has the most expertise. One can assume she's trying to get ahead of a left-moving Democratic Party at a time when  pro mi   nent technology giants are in bad odor.</p><p> In a Medium column where she fleshed out her ideas, she wrote, \"Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"</p><p> Paradoxically, however, she nearly undermines her argument by claiming that the Microsoft antitrust action in the 1990s helped clear a path for internet companies like Google and Facebook to emerge.</p><p> Well, maybe. But Microsoft is bigger and healthier than ever, and the \"successes\" she cites are now giant corporations she says need breaking up themselves. So perhaps the Microsoft lawsuit cleared a path, but the fundamental problem of bigness remains.</p><p> Like the Green New Deal and raising top marginal tax rates on the rich, breaking up Big Tech is an idea in motion, the start of a conversation. But it has political appeal beyond the left, as Big Tech's reputation has taken a big slide in a new Harris Poll.</p><p> And like the other proposals, it stands little chance of becoming law anytime soon because of the red-state lock on the Senate. Presidents alone can't make this happen, but they can appoint regulators - no small thing.</p><p> The late 19th century's Gilded Age was characterized by monopolies and cartels, as well as high inequality, protected by the political power of the wealthy. It didn't last, giving birth to the Progressive era, with antitrust and regulation reining in the worst abuses.</p><p> This tough stance continued through much of the 20th century, with an exclamation point being the 1982 breakup of the Bell System.</p><p> But big business and conservative intellectuals began fighting back in the 1970s. Especially influential was Robert Bork, more widely known for his failed nomination to the Supreme Court. Bork's most consequential achievement was dramatically redefining antitrust laws.</p><p> Instead of protecting smaller businesses and ensuring competition, antitrust laws should encourage economic efficiency, Bork argued. This revolutionary interpretation gradually took hold in the federal courts until it was the standard by which mergers and company size were judged. Or given a pass. The Bell System essentially reconstituted itself in recent years.</p><p> Especially since the 1980s, critical sectors of the economy have been taken over by cartels and semi-monopolies with unbeatable pricing power along the supply chain.</p><p> Not just the courts backed lax antitrust. It was supported by both Republican and Democratic administrations, as well as deregulation such as the Glass-Steagall Act. The big banks brought on the Great Recession - the best argument yet against bigness - yet they came out of the crisis even bigger.</p><p> As a result, Warren and the Democratic left would have to win many elections and gain a Supreme Court majority before a new era of trust busting could get underway. It's a rough ride that Theodore Roosevelt never faced.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCT-4189892</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABD503A1E409 NWBKCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNM-4MV1-DXVP-V1XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bulletin<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Barbara Boxer also -- is testament to Silicon Valley's continued lobbying clout in Washington despite the tech recession.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This week, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, whose chief, Robert Herz, is the devil incarnate to California's tech executives, issued its long-expected rule to force companies to count these options as an expense on corporate income statements starting next year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Stock options, which give employees the right to buy shares of their company's stock at a fixed price within a set period, were a source of vast wealth in the Bay Area during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s -- and of outrage in the bubble's aftermath.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Enormous options-fueled executive pay packages, reaching hundreds of millions of dollars, became a source of scandal with the bubble's collapse and the ensuing bankruptcies of Enron and other large corporations due to accounting malfeasance.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>Chronicle Washington Bureau</p></bodyText></section><p>If the rule by the private, independent accounting board -- which is given the oversight of accounting rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- takes effect after a 90-day comment period, many companies are expected to stop issuing options to their rank-and-file employees.</p><p> Tech executives paint a dire scenario of what will ensue: They contend that because options give employees a stake in their companies and the potential to share in wealth creation, the disappearance of options will severely inhibit a company's ability to attract and motivate skilled workers, dealing a blow to California's technology innovation and changing the culture of Silicon Valley.</p><p> The effect will be largest on startup firms that lack the cash to lure talent, they say. And they link stock options to the rising competitive threat from China and the uproar over offshoring jobs overseas, noting that the Chinese government has incorporated stock options into its five-year economic plan to boost its tech industry.</p><p> \"These people aren't kidding,\" said venture capitalist John Doerr at a recent dinner with top tech executives and reporters in Washington, where Doerr put stock options at the top of the industry's concerns. \"This is a very real and present and growing threat to America's innovation leadership.\"</p><p> Counting the options as an immediate expense can deliver a huge hit to earnings -- turning profits to losses for many tech companies. Options are currently noted only in a footnote in financial statements.</p><p> But while they are a cost to shareholders, the options are hard to value before they are exercised. Many economists and financial analysts agree that the models the accounting board proposes to use are poorly suited to the task.</p><p> Options critics, however, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman William Donaldson, contend that the concerns are overwrought and that options were indeed a source of corporate excess. They contend -- along with powerful Senate allies including Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz. -- that Congress has no business meddling in accounting rules developed by an independent board. They also charge that it is absurd to ignore options' value, as current rules do.</p><p> More than 500 corporations have begun treating options as an expense, and many others have cut back on issuing them. Hewlett-Packard shareholders recently approved a resolution asking the company to report options as an expense, removing the Palo Alto computer giant from the fray in Washington, against the wishes of its executives.</p><p> By and large, however, Silicon Valley has proven to be a major holdout on options, and its top executives are pulling the trigger against the accounting board by asking Congress to intervene.</p><p> The legislation stands a chance of succeeding -- despite strong reluctance among many in Congress to intervene with an independent accounting board after a wave of corporate accounting scandals -- because of strong backing by California's top politicians and a rare alliance of Democratic and Republican leaders.</p><p> \"Especially against the backdrop of outsourcing, this is a proven tool especially for small companies that don't have a lot of capital to attract people and say, 'Come with us -- when we make it, you are going to share in the success,' \" said Rep. Anna Eshoo, the Atherton Democrat who is a lead sponsor of legislation to thwart the proposed rule and a close friend and political ally of Pelosi. \"This is just as important as venture capital. This is just as important as intellectual property. My fear is that if the (accounting board) gets its way, it's going to (kill) stock options for rank-and-file employees.\"</p><p> Eshoo has teamed with Rep. Richard Baker, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the House Financial Services subcommittee overseeing corporate governance. The legislation, backed by the support of the united House leadership, including Hastert, is gaining momentum.</p><p> In the Senate, Boxer has teamed with Wyoming Republican Sen. Mike Enzi, the body's only accountant, on a measure that has drawn the support of members including Dianne Feinstein and Democratic Whip Harry Reid of Nevada.</p><p> Rep. David Dreier, R-San Dimas (Los Angeles County), who heads the powerful House Rules Committee, said the legislation also has Bush's support.</p><p> \"Based on conversations I've had, the president of the United States is supportive of what we're trying to do,\" Dreier said. \"He told me to try to pass a bill.\"</p><p> The legislation went nowhere in the last Congress but has been altered to avoid a chief criticism by requiring expensing for options going to a company's top five executives. Rules on options grants for all other employees would remain unchanged. Small businesses would be exempt, and startup companies would have a three-year grace period on expensing options to their top executives after they go public.</p><p> The bills also would require the government to study the economic impact of mandatory options expensing. The accounting board has refused to consider the economic fallout of its rule, arguing that should not be its concern. Eshoo argues that the economic impact will be huge and that Congress has a duty to take it into account.</p><p> Lobbyists said the sheer size of the accounting board's rule, at 220 pages, will aid their cause.</p><p> \"It's going to be a good weapon just as show-and-tell to wave that regulation in front of members,\" said John Palafoutas, top lobbyist for AeA, a big tech trade group. \"Several accounting firms have said they'll charge half a million dollars to implement the regulations, and I think people are just going to be a little suspicious of that kind of thing.\"</p><p> Still, the bill remains a hard sell to members who are loath to appear soft on corporate accounting as the fraud trials of top executives continue. Indeed, Congress forced the accounting board to retreat on expensing stock options a decade ago -- and members who led the charge, including Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., came under sharp criticism for doing so when the accounting scandals broke.</p><p> Eshoo dismisses that criticism.</p><p>\"If the (board's) proposal had been on the books at the time, it wouldn't have prevented any one of those scandals from happening,\" she said. \"But the abuse from some corporate leaders introduced some very familiar language to most households in the country -- two words, stock options -- and it sullied the term. But I think that is obviously separate from working to protect broad-based stock options for rank-and-file employees.\"E-mail Carolyn Lochhead at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:clochhead@sfchronicle.com\">clochhead@sfchronicle.com</email>.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO (2), (1) Dennis Hastert, (2) Nancy Pelosi</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SFCHRN2004</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4C39-D3G0-00G9-24Y5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8172</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"1332\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName> The San Francisco Chronicle</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4092\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2004 The Chronicle Publishing Co.</copyright><edition>FINAL EDITION</edition><publicationDate month=\"04\" day=\"05\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>APRIL 5, 2004, MONDAY,</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>ENRON CREDITORS RECOVERY CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>ENRNQ (OTC)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0SECURITIES &amp;

It wasn't a warning about offensive content, cyber security or online privacy. Rather, it was about rallying its millions of users to help protect the company's business model and data secrecy.   The Australian Government is boldly going where no other country has gone in taking on tech giants Google and Facebook. It has proposed a new \" Mandatory News Media Bargaining Code \" which would require these two tech giants to do two things.   One, they would have to pay Australian media companies a fair amount for the use of their journalism.   Two, they would have to hand over a lot more information about the data they collect on their prized algorithms.   The Australian Government is boldly going where no other government has gone before in taking on Facebook and Google. ( Reuters: Dado Ruvic ) The special sauce  Around the same time as these pop-up warnings began to appear, Google quietly reached out to Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. Government sources say the tech giant signalled a preparedness to pay up. Exactly how much it was willing to offer media companies is unclear, but somewhere in the \"tens of millions of dollars per year\".   Money, it seems, wasn't the main concern. The red line for Google was apparently the data sharing.   Under the mandatory code proposed by the competition regulator, Google and Facebook would be required to provide media companies with \" clear information about the data they collect through users' interactions with news on digital platforms; for example how long users spend on an article, how many articles they consume in a certain period, and other information about user engagement with news content across digital platform services\".  Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume. Watch Duration: 1 minute 39 seconds 1 m 39 s  Communications Minister Paul Fletcher says Facebook has made \"heavy-handed\" threats.  They would also have to give \"28 days' notice of algorithm changes likely to materially affect referral traffic to news, algorithm changes designed to affect ranking of news behind paywalls, and substantial changes to the display and presentation of news, and advertising directly associated with news\".   This information about which news stories and ads appear in your Facebook feed or Google search goes to the heart of the business models of these technology companies.   It's the \"special sauce\" they will guard jealously to the end. This is what the fight is really about. With the rest of the world watching, Google and Facebook do not want a precedent set here in Australia.  The nuclear option  Facebook has now upped the ante, joining the Google approach of trying to harness its millions of users to pressure the Government. It's threatening to ban Australian users from accessing news content from its site completely to avoid having to comply with this new law.   Google has also reacted fiercely against the proposal. ( Unsplash: Mitchell Luo )  This is the nuclear option. Stopping users sharing legitimate news content may not necessarily be easy, but it can be done.   If Facebook does pull the trigger and block all news content, the company's Australian boss Will Easton reckons media companies will be worse off. \"During the first five months of 2020 Facebook sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's news feed to Australian publishers,\" he says, suggesting this traffic was worth about $200 million to the media companies.   The companies themselves scoff at this, arguing it's Facebook making far more by using and monetising their journalism.   Some fear a threat to democracy too if Facebook carries out its threat. Roughly one third of Australians access their news via the social media platform and if trusted journalism disappears from the site, fake news and all manner of conspiracies could prosper.  A high stakes stand-off  This is a high stakes stand-off. If Facebook is right, it won't end well for media companies, millions of loyal users or the Government.  Crushed: Digital giants vs Australian media  Within a couple of years the likes of Google and Facebook will devour more than half local ad revenues, leaving only crumbs for traditional media players.  Read more  Communications Minister Paul Fletcher casts doubt on the Facebook threat, pointing out \"it's not without precedent for (the tech giants) to make heavy-handed threats\".   Privately though, senior government figures don't think Facebook is bluffing at all.   Given what's at stake globally for the tech giants, few doubt they will go ahead with sacrificing the quality of their Australian operations to avoid this law.   So, will there be much political blowback for the Coalition from angry Facebook and Google users? The calculation within the Government is \"not much\". The view is Australians will support this new law in the interests of \"fairness\" and will simply seek their news content elsewhere. We'll see.   The reality is, the Government can hardly back down now. To do so, particularly when media companies are cheering it on, would be a humiliating capitulation.    As the Treasurer has said, \"we don't respond to coercion or heavy-handed threats\". That means no retreat in the big tech battle.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42979045047</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RH-4DT1-JCSC-J1XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ABC Online</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 2, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The broader market hardly looks cheap following nine years of gains.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most the red ink since Friday has been reserved for the highest profile names in U.S. tech - including members of the acclaimed FANG group of stocks, largely known for heady growth, massive market capitalizations and stellar share-price gains in recent years.</p><p>Facebook fell 3.3 per cent on Friday and as much as 2.6 per cent on Monday before recovering some lost ground and ending the day down 0.8 per cent.</p><p>Amazon.com Inc.has fallen a total of 4.5 per cent over the same period.</p><p>Netflix Inc.is down 8.7 per cent and Google Inc.'s parent company, Alphabet Inc., is down 4.2 per cent.</p><p>Beyond FANG, Apple Inc. has fallen 6.3 per cent over the past two days and Microsoft Corp. has declined 2.9 per cent - adding up to a big headache for big tech.</p><p>Monday's action coincided with a high-profile downgrade: Mizuho Securities lowered its recommendation on Apple to \"neutral\" from \"buy,\" and cut its price target to $150 (U.S.) from $160 - essentially arguing that the high share price already reflects the benefits of new iPhones and other gadgets.</p><p>\"The stock has meaningfully outperformed on a year-to-date basis and we believe enthusiasm around the upcoming product cycle is fully captured at current levels,\" Mizuho analyst Abhey Lamba said, according to Reuters.</p><p>That's just one analyst's opinion - 36 others recommend Apple as a \"buy\" - but it taps into market sensitivity toward valuations at a time when many big tech stocks have diverged from the broader market.</p><p>Apple, Amazon, <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>and Facebook had risen more than 30 per cent each this year, before the two-day setback, triple the gain for the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Googlewas a comparative slouch, but nonetheless had risen 24 per cent.</p><p>Even with the two-day decline, these stocks are still up between 18 per cent and 24 per cent this year - which suggests that if investors are worried that they have run up too quickly, the turbulence could persist.</p><p>The market's nervousness began on Friday after Goldman Sachs released a research note that asked, \"Is 'FANG' mispriced?\" Over the next 10 pages of text and charts, the note identified risks associated with recent strong returns.</p><p>\"This outperformance, driven by secular growth and the death of the reflation narrative, has created positioning extremes, factor crowding and difficult-todecipher risk narratives,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said in their note.</p><p>That is, hedge funds and mutual funds have stuffed their portfolios with the same technology stocks, as managers chase companies that can deliver profit and revenue growth regardless of the political or economic backdrop. As any contrarian investor will tell you, that kind of stampede into a sector can hurt when it ends.</p><p>Goldman Sachs analysts noted that the recent low volatility of tech stocks has been another draw for investors, but could be hiding the risks associated with these stocks.</p><p>\"We believe low realized volatility can potentially lead people to underestimate the risks inherent in these businesses including cyclical exposure, potential regulations regarding online activity or antitrust concerns or disruption risk as they encroach into each other's businesses,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said. Perhaps investors have become too accustomed to a smooth ride in the broader market as well.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has rallied 32 per cent since February, 2016, and the worst setback over this period was a mere 6-per-cent decline over a three-week period last June.</p><p>It's hardly cheap, either. The index has a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.5, according to Bloomberg - a 16-year high and the highest valuation over the course of the nine-year-old bull market.</p><p>When stock prices are rising faster than profits, investors have a good reason to be cautious.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20170613rbimbermantechbubble</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NSH-PGP1-F06S-348B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"673\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

That makes his recent threats to rein in big tech and social media firms all the more puzzling.</p><p>Trump's fury over being fact checked by Twitter about claims of election fraud with mail-in ballots led him to issue an executive order Thursday that cracks down on social media companies -- the very firms that have been posting strong gains on Wall Street. </p><p>Twitter shares have pulled back in recent days but are still up slightly for the year. Facebook and YouTube owner Alphabet are in the green for 2020, too. Shares of Snapchat's parent company are higher as well.</p><p>The tech sector, including Microsoft and FAANG stocks Apple, Amazon and Netflix, has enjoyed a strong rebound from the coronavirus-induced market lows. The Nasdaq is up more than 40% since March 23 and is now only about 4% from its record high of 9,838.37 on February 19. </p><p>Which makes Trump's continued war against Big Tech all the more mystifying. </p><p>The tech sector and social media had been one of the primary engines of jobs growth in America since Trump took office before the Covid-19 pandemic upended the labor market and economy. </p><p>Any crackdown on Big Tech firms has the potential to lead to even more job losses and could hamper their ability to keep churning out strong profit growth.</p><p>Techs helped prop up market and economy before Covid-19</p><p>\"This crisis has accelerated the digital transformation that businesses and consumers are undertaking,\" said Brad Neuman, director of market strategy for fund manager Alger in a report last week. </p><p>\"From e-commerce to cloud computing and telemedicine to genetic testing and manipulation, the trends that have been in place have only been supported by the pandemic,\" Neuman added.</p><p>Sure, there are some legitimate antitrust concerns about several tech giants given the number of big acquisitions made by Facebook, Google and Amazon in recent years. And there is rare bipartisan support in Washington for tougher regulations to rein in the FAANGs. </p><p>But Tony Bedikian, head of global markets with Citizens Bank, said that tech and social media giants are likely to be at the forefront of a new working-from-home normal. </p><p>So the last thing that Trump should want is to propose a major overhaul of how tech companies operate that could lead to a massive plunge in their stocks, especially since the top five tech firms -- Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook -- make up more than 20% of the S&amp;P 500's market value. </p><p>That means that any investor who owns a passively managed index fund is, like it or not, making a huge bet on the FAANGs. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for the overall market to keep rallying if tech stocks are lagging.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

(For an edited transcript of the discussion, click here).</p><p>\"Hasn't history shown that any type of new payment technology that focuses on the merchant never takes off?\" asked Thomas C. McCrohan, a managing director for business services with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. \"Unless you focus on the consumer, these technologies never take off.\"</p><p>The analysts said that financial companies have put plenty of effort into developing mobile payments systems, but were divided over whether there is enough demand for innovations such as the mobile wallet - the notion that a phone could store multiple card accounts and be used to initiate contactless transactions.</p><p>\"I don't think it's going to happen,\" McCrohan said. \"It's a solution looking for a problem right now, here in the U.S.\"</p><p>One difficulty, of course, is persuading the wireless carriers to implement the needed payments hardware in their phones, and there is little progress seen in developing a business model that could spur them to do so.</p><p>\"I don't see why Visa and MasterCardhave any meaningful motivation to give up economies to either the carriers or the handset manufacturers,\" said Andrew Jeffrey, a managing director for equity research at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. \"I'm not a believer in mobile payments. I believe that there's a tremendous amount of smoke and absolutely no fire.\"</p><p>Others were more bullish, especially as consumers begin to realize the capabilities of smart phones.</p><p>\"As more people manage their lives using a smart phone, I think the next step is a payment of some sort,\" said Brett Huff, a research analyst with Stephens Inc. \"I think that online payments, and accessing services via mobile, will be a key driver.\"</p><p>For Greg Smith, a managing director for financial technology equity research at Duncan-Williams Inc., it all comes down to options. \"People are going to want choice, and want to use different payment types at different times,\" he said.</p><p>Eventually, \"you will be able to completely facilitate commerce on a mobile phone,\" he said, \"but I do think it will take a long time.\"</p><p>Square Inc., the start-up offering a device that lets people accept cards using Apple Inc.'s iPhones, generated plenty of discussion, much of it critical. The analysts questioned its business model, which calls for Square to accept the risk for payments accepted by its merchant clients, and its pricing, which will likely have very thin profit margins.</p><p>Despite these caveats, several people agreed that there is value is offering card acceptance to very small merchants, whether the service is provided by Square or better-known companies such as Hypercom Corp. or VeriFone Systems Inc.</p><p>Mobile acceptance is \"a pretty popular product. It's clearly something the press has picked up upon, and I think some consumers are pretty excited about it,\" said Darren Peller, a vice president and senior analyst for IT consulting and computer services with Barclays Capital. \"I think it's something that shows the use, the potential use, of mobile for payments products.\"</p><p>Smith said the value in these systems is that they \"open up a world of small-value payments, and for somebody that's taking payments infrequently, it makes perfect sense. But is that going to be a humongous market? Probably not, at the end of the day.\"</p><p>Several of the analysts criticized interchange rates, not because they are too high, but because they are too complex. \"The complexity of those is the reason that many of the acquirers are able to get away with charging somewhat egregious spreads,\" Peller said.</p><p>Jeffrey said simpler rate tables would translate into more transparency, and ultimately less discord. \"I think interchange would be less of an issue for merchants if they knew that when Greg walks in with a particular card they're going to pay X,\" he said. \"A hundred pages of interchange rules are daunting for anyone.\"</p><p>There was less agreement about whether interchange should be regulated in Washington. \"It's hard to see the benefits\" of interchange regulations being set by lawmakers, Peller said.</p><p>And lower rates are not expected to translate into lower prices at retailers. \"What happens if interchange comes down? Do they really pass that on to the consumer?\" Smith asked. \"No. They make more money. It just comes out of one hand and into the other, and the consumers lose because their rewards programs go down.\"</p><p>There was universal agreement that there will be increased M&amp;A activity among banking technology vendors, largely because there has been so little in the past year. There is now a pent-up demand for deals, and buyers are sitting on cash that needs to be spent.</p><p>However, many of the big tech providers have already been bought, or merged with each other, and Smith predicted that the next notable trend would be for major vendors to get bought by even bigger tech companies that have a broad focus and want to hone their financial services expertise.</p><p>\"To me, the next big wave is going to be an IBM or an HP making a run at one of these guys. I think that definitely will happen at some point, to get somebody like a Fiserv or an FIS, with banking expertise,\" he said. \"The HPs of the world aren't growing dramatically anyway, so they don't need huge organic growth. If they could consolidate data centers and leverage that bank domain expertise, I think that could be a valid reason.\"</p><p>The conversation took place soon after reports emerged that Fidelity National Information Services Inc. was mulling a bid to sell itself to a group of private-equity companies. Though a deal never happened, Peller said buyers are eager to invest their money.</p><p>As soon as people feel \"more comfortable that you're going to see banks continue lending, then I think you absolutely will see more deals,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARDLN-00130528201026595</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARDLN2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7YJX-T440-YB35-R2BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305424</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1074\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Daily active users totaled 1.62 billion on average for September 2019, up 9%.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter also expects Facebook to beat expectations on the top and bottom line.</p><p>Pachter further believes there is \"virtually no chance\" that existing antitrust laws can be used to force a divestiture of any of Facebook's businesses. However, he did say regulatory pressures could prevent the company from pursuing future M&amp;A.</p><p>\"Facebook arguably has a monopoly over the social media landscape, but has no opportunity to charge users for its service; instead, the company delivers advertising to its users, and its total revenues make up only a small portion of global advertising,\" Pachter wrote in a Jan. 24 note.</p><p>For his part, Michael Kramer, founder of New York-based investment advisory firm Mott Capital Management, will be listening closely for Facebook's 2020 expense outlook on the Jan. 29 earnings call, as growing costs could have a significant impact on the company's bottom line.</p><p>Kramer expects Facebook's 2020 expense guidance will rise to a range of $54 billion to $59 billion, as compared to its 2019 cost expectations of $46 billion to $48 billion. That range included the $5 billion in accruals recorded related to the company's FTC settlement.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently acknowledged that his platform's increased investments in security will \"significantly impact our profitability,\" but added that it is \"our responsibility to keep people safe.\" The company noted it has developed more advanced artificial intelligence techniques to remove fake accounts and has added more security reviewers.</p><p>Facebook is not the only large tech company under pressure from regulators.

According to Zacks, \"AbbVie s key drug Humira has been performing well based on strong demand trends for the drug, despite new competition. Moreover, Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. AbbVie s shares outperformed the industry in 2017 supported by a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies, regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication for Imbrivica and settlement of its Humira patent disputes with Amgen. Also, several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in 2018. However, HCV sales continue to be hurt by intensifying competition. Estimates have remained stable ahead of the Q4 earnings release. AbbVie has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC)</emphasis> was downgraded by analysts at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.americanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx?Zacks=1\">Zacks Investment Research </url> from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, \"AmerisourceBergenhas been trading below the broader industry over the last year. However, the company is expected to benefit from generics growth.\u00a0AmerisourceBergen\u00a0has been actively pursuing acquisitions to strengthen its core areas. Solid performance in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment is a positive. Strong sales in the oncology unit have enhanced AmerisourceBergenDrug Corporation (ABDC) sales. \u00a0The company has announced that it will acqure H.D. Smith, the largest independent wholesaler in the United States. On the flipside,\u00a0AmerisourceBergen\u00a0faces headwinds due to the slowdown in hepatitis C revenues and conversion of branded drugs to the lower price generics. Furthermore, a temporary slowdown in PharMEDium&amp;#39;s growth is expected to mar the company s bottom line.\u00a0\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Avery Dennison (NYSE:AVY)</emphasis> was downgraded by analysts at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.americanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx?Zacks=1\">Zacks Investment Research </url> from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, \"Avery Dennison&amp;#39;s earnings per share guidance range for 2017 is $4.90-$4.95. The midpoint of the guidance range reflects year-over-year growth of 23%. The company expected reported sales growth in the range of 8% for the full year. Its consistent execution of strategies continues to enhance competitive advantage while driving profitable growth. Focus on productivity, acquisitions, aggressive cost control and share repurchases will also drive results.\u00a0 Its segments remain well poised for growth. Moreover, its shares have outperformed the industry year to date. However, raw material cost inflation and transition costs related to Yongle acquisition will dent margins in the near term. The company has a positive record of earnings surprises. Its estimates have gone up lately.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Becton Dickinson and (NYSE:BDX)</emphasis> was downgraded by analysts at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.americanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx?Zacks=1\">Zacks Investment Research </url> from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, \"In the last six months, \u00a0Becton, Dickinson and Company, popularly known as BD, has outperformed the broader industry. BD recently completed the acquisition of C. R. Bard. The company will establish a new segment   BD Interventional in which Bard will be integrated. We view the acquisition as a strategic one which will generate benefits from complementary businesses and geographical expansion. Further, BD announced that it will divest its soft tissue core needle biopsy products for $100 million to Merit Medical. On the flipside, lackluster performance by the Medical segment is a concern. Performance in the segment was affected by sluggishness in the Medication Management Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems units in the United States. BD temporarily paused shipments of its insulin infusion sets. The voluntary recall of Barricor blood collection tubes in the recent past also adds to our woes.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chubb (NYSE:CB)</emphasis> was downgraded by analysts at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.americanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx?Zacks=1\">Zacks Investment Research </url> from a buy rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, \"Chubb stands a good chance of taking leadership in the P&amp;C space, benefiting from compelling products and services. Its inorganic growth story is impressive, helping it achieve higher long-term ROE. Investment results are exhibiting improvement owing to improving rate environment. A strong capital position helps Chubb boost in shareholders  value and invest in strategic initiatives to drive growth. Notably, it is on track to achieve annual run-rate integration-related savings of $875 million (up from $800 million guided earlier) by the end of 2018. However, exposure to cat loss and escalating expenses raise concerns for Chubb. The company estimates fourth quarter cat loss from wildfire in California to be about $249 million and another $34 million from all other natural catastrophe. Shares of Chubb have undeperformed the industry in a year&amp;#39;s time.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL)</emphasis> was downgraded by analysts at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.americanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx?Zacks=1\">Zacks Investment Research </url> from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, \"Colgate has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company is encouraged by the progress on the Global Growth and Efficiency Program along with additional savings anticipated from the recent expansion of the program. Moreover, the company has been infamous among investors with its meet or beat earnings track record. Though it posted in-line earnings and topped sales estimates in third-quarter 2017, margins remained strained due to increased raw material and packaging costs, as well as higher advertising expenses. Further, it anticipates these costs to persist and impact margins in 2017. The company also perked up its costs guidance related to charges arising from the expansion and extension of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program through Dec 31, 2019. Nonetheless, Colgate s shareholder-friendly moves remain noteworthy.

According to Zacks, \"Roche s performance has been strong as sales are being boosted by new drug launches Tecentriq and Ocrevus. Sales of Tecentriq were mainly driven by strong uptake in non-small cell lung cancer indication. Roche dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla. The company also has a dominant position in lung cancer market. The FDA recently approved Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors. The recently announced Ignyta acquisition will further strengthen pipeline. However, sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline.

It should be noted that in November 2017, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in favor of Rovi, now TiVo, regarding set-top box patent case against Comcast. The ruling banned Comcast from importing certain X1 set-top boxes as the court found them violating two patents of Rovi. However, Comcast has decided to fight against the ruling in the US Patent and Trademark office, which may take another 8-12 months to resolve. Also, Comcast may not renew its existing licensing agreement with TiVo, which is set to expire in July this year, thereby resulting in a huge loss of revenues for the company.

According to Zacks, 'AbbVie's key drug Humira has been performing well based on strong demand trends for the drug, despite new competition. Moreover, Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. </p><p>AbbVie's shares outperformed the industry in 2017 supported by a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies, regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication for Imbrivica and settlement of its Humira patent disputes with Amgen. Also, several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in 2018. However, HCV sales continue to be hurt by intensifying competition. Estimates have remained stable ahead of the Q4 earnings release. AbbVie has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters.'AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research[2] from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, 'AmerisourceBergen has been trading below the broader industry over the last year. However, the company is expected to benefit from generics growth.\u00a0AmerisourceBergen\u00a0has been actively pursuing acquisitions to strengthen its core areas. Solid performance in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment is a positive. Strong sales in the oncology unit have enhanced AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC) sales. The company has announced that it will acqure H.D. Smith, the largest independent wholesaler in the United States. On the flipside,\u00a0AmerisourceBergen\u00a0faces headwinds due to the slowdown in hepatitis C revenues and conversion of branded drugs to the lower price generics. Furthermore, a temporary slowdown in PharMEDium's growth is expected to mar the company's bottom line.\u00a0' Becton Dickinson and (NYSE:BDX) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research[3] from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, 'In the last six months, Becton, Dickinson and Company, popularly known as BD, has outperformed the broader industry. BD recently completed the acquisition of C. R. Bard. The company will establish a new segment \u2014 BD Interventional in which Bard will be integrated. We view the acquisition as a strategic one which will generate benefits from complementary businesses and geographical expansion. Further, BD announced that it will divest its soft tissue core needle biopsy products for $100 million to Merit Medical. On the flipside, lackluster performance by the Medical segment is a concern. Performance in the segment was affected by sluggishness in the Medication Management Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems units in the United States. BD temporarily paused shipments of its insulin infusion sets. The voluntary recall of Barricor blood collection tubes in the recent past also adds to our woes.'Chubb (NYSE:CB) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research[4] from a buy rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, 'Chubb stands a good chance of taking leadership in the P...pace, benefiting from compelling products and services. Its inorganic growth story is impressive, helping it achieve higher long-term ROE. Investment results are exhibiting improvement owing to improving rate environment. A strong capital position helps Chubb boost in shareholders' value and invest in strategic initiatives to drive growth. Notably, it is on track to achieve annual run-rate integration-related savings of $875 million (up from $800 million guided earlier) by the end of 2018. However, exposure to cat loss and escalating expenses raise concerns for Chubb. The company estimates fourth quarter cat loss from wildfire in California to be about $249 million and another $34 million from all other natural catastrophe. Shares of Chubb have undeperformed the industry in a year's time.'Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research[5] from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, 'Colgate has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company is encouraged by the progress on the Global Growth and Efficiency Program along with additional savings anticipated from the recent expansion of the program. Moreover, the company has been infamous among investors with its meet or beat earnings track record. Though it posted in-line earnings and topped sales estimates in third-quarter 2017, margins remained strained due to increased raw material and packaging costs, as well as higher advertising expenses. Further, it anticipates these costs to persist and impact margins in 2017. The company also perked up its costs guidance related to charges arising from the expansion and extension of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program through Dec 31, 2019. Nonetheless, Colgate's shareholder-friendly moves remain noteworthy. Estimates have been stable lately ahead of the fourth quarter earnings release.'DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research[6] from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, 'In last one year DTE Energy's share price outperformed the broader industry's rally. The company's focus on improving its cost structure and making capital investments in renewable generation, utility infrastructure and environmental compliance assets is impressive. Currently, DTE Energy plans to invest $6.5 billion over the next 10 years for maintaining and upgrading the reliability of its electric utility systems. Apart from its utility operation, it also continues to make progress on its non-utility business, which provides diversity to its earnings stream. That said, increasingly stringent government regulations for curbing emissions and operational risks remain major concerns. Moreover, unfavorable weather conditions tend to adversely impact demand for utility services, which in turn might hamper the company's income and cash flow to some extent.'Eastman Chemical (NYSE:EMN) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research[7] from a buy rating to a hold rating.

Roche (OTCMKTS:RHHBY) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research[8] from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, 'Roche's performance has been strong as sales are being boosted by new drug launches-Tecentriq and Ocrevus. Sales of Tecentriq were mainly driven by strong uptake in non-small cell lung cancer indication. Roche dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla. The company also has a dominant position in lung cancer market. The FDA recently approved Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors. The recently announced Ignyta acquisition will further strengthen pipeline. However, sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline. Competition from biosimilars looms large on Roche's key drugs like Herceptin, Avastin and Rituxan.

According to Zacks, 'We are concerned about the uncertainty regarding the settlement of the ongoing dispute between TiVo and Comcast, which may hurt the company's 2018 revenue growth. It should be noted that in November 2017, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in favor of Rovi, now TiVo, regarding set-top box patent case against Comcast. The ruling banned Comcast from importing certain X1 set-top boxes as the court found them violating two patents of Rovi. However, Comcast has decided to fight against the ruling in the US Patent and Trademark office, which may take another 8-12 months to resolve. Also, Comcast may not renew its existing licensing agreement with TiVo, which is set to expire in July this year, thereby resulting in a huge loss of revenues for the company.

Because investors try to anticipate earnings, these companies' stocks tend to do well early in a market recovery.</p><p> Because technology and telecom clearly had the worst profit performance during the past two years, they should be poised for the biggest comebacks, Riley figures.</p><p> He says technology and telecom should also benefit from obsolescence. Technology hardware has an average life span of 3.7 years, and the last big tech-spending boom was in mid-1999.</p><p> Finally, tech and telecom could get a boost from a new tax law change that lets buyers write off more of a capital investment in the first year. \"You would think that CIOs (chief information officers) and company presidents would take advantage of this tax break, which expires in 2004,\" Riley says.</p><p> David Readerman, equity growth strategist with Thomas Weisel Partners, also says tech is due for a short-term rally.</p><p> Readerman looked at six major turning points in the market since 1987, measured by days of extreme volatility. He calculated which sectors did best and worst six months before and after each turning point.</p><p> He found that the sectors that did best before the turning point often did the worst after, and vice versa.</p><p> \"If history repeats itself, tech and telecom might be the best-performing sector on a four- to six-month basis,\" he says.</p><p> Longer term, Readerman says sectors tied to aging Baby Boomers -- especially health care and financial services -- will be the market leaders.</p><p> If tech and telecom are ready to bust out, there's no sign of it yet.</p><p> I looked at the performance since July 23 of the Standard &amp; Poor's 1,500 index, broken down into 58 sectors, weighted by market value.</p><p> Among the top 15 sectors, none are tech or telecom (except for the tiny category of office electronics, which includes Xerox and Zebra Technologies).</p><p> There was a boomerang effect, to some extent. Three of the top performing sectors -- biotech, pharmaceuticals and non-</p><p> regulated energy providers -- had been among this year's worst-performing sectors up until July 23.</p><p> But no tech or telecom sectors did better than the S&amp;P 1,500's overall gain of 13 percent.</p><p> The best-performing tech sectors since July 23 were IT consulting (up 11.3 percent) and software (up 11 percent). The worst were communications equipment (up 1.3 percent) and wireless telecommunications services (down 5.4 percent). Wireless telecom was the only sector that has not rebounded since July 23.</p><p> John Dolan of Dolan Capital Management says tech could stage a temporary comeback, but he doesn't see it lasting much longer than a month.</p><p> He says that the economy will continue to be weak and that defensive stocks -- namely consumer staples, utilities and to a lesser extent drugs -- will do well.</p><p> \"Of those that got hurt the worst, I think financials have the greatest recovery potential. They're already showing that,\" Dolan says.</p><p> David Sowerby, a portfolio manager with Loomis Sayles, says investors should pick individual stocks based on their merits and forget about their sector, market cap or growth-value orientation.</p><p> \"In the fall of 1997, we ran to large-cap growth stock. In the spring of 2000, we undid that, with the biggest beneficiary being small-cap value.</p><p> \"The polarization that has prevailed for the last five years is going to be significantly diminished,\" he says. \"Now that we've washed out most of this bear market, like the phoenix that rises up from the ashes, it's going to be good companies with solid valuations and fundamentals.\"</p><p> HOTTEST STOCKS: So which individual companies have done best since the bear went into hibernation?</p><p> The 15 best performers in the S&amp;P 500 range from beaten-down blue chips like General Electric, Merck and Abbott Labs to troubled companies like Calpine and Providian, which are both trading at less than $5 per share.</p><p> Many firms on the list have had accounting issues, but after assuming the worst about these companies, investors now seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt.</p><p> Some companies helped themselves by confronting their demons head on.</p><p> General Electric said last Friday it would split its complex GE Capital division into four pieces, in part to make them more transparent and easier to understand.</p><p> Monday, GE named Ralph Larsen, the respected former chairman and chief executive of Johnson &amp; Johnson, to its board. GE stock is up almost 23 percent since last Tuesday's close.</p><p> Beleaguered Halliburton also managed to turn itself around, at least for the moment. On July 22, Halliburton announced several charges it would take when it reported earnings two days later. That sent Halliburton stock down to $9.10, a 52-week low.</p><p> During its post-earnings conference call with analysts on Wednesday, however, management \"professionally and forcefully addressed all of the issues facing Halliburton,\" says Pierre Conner, an analyst with Hibernia SouthCoast Capital. He was impressed by the show but still hasn't changed his neutral rating on the company.</p><p> Michael Urban, an analyst for Deutsche Bank, was more impressed. He raised his rating from buy to strong buy after the call. \"They did a very good job of really addressing all of these issues systematically. They were showing progress on just about all of them,\" he says.</p><p> On asbestos litigation, the company said it is dealing with plaintiffs' lawyers and disclosed for the first time that it's considering a global settlement. It also released a study showing that its potential asbestos liability could be much lower than market analysts were projecting.</p><p> \"On the accounting front, they went through what was being investigated, why they did what they did, and how that compares to competitors,\" Urban says.</p><p> The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Halliburton's switch to a new type of accounting for cost overruns in 1999, when Vice President Dick Cheney was chief executive officer. Halliburton didn't disclose the switch for a couple years.</p><p> Halliburton told analysts that most of its competitors use the same accounting method.</p><p> \"Under normal circumstances,\" Halliburton could expect \"nothing or a slap on the wrist,\" for its alleged accounting violations, Urban says. But because of the \"political element,\" the penalty could be worse.</p><p> Halliburton is up 52 percent since last Tuesday, putting it back where it was three weeks

By night, he indulges his other passion: predicting Apple Inc.'s results.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leitao is part of a cadre of amateur forecasters, bloggers and hobbyists who sift through reams of data every quarter to guess at Apple's quarterly results - often putting professional analysts to shame by coming up with more accurate predictions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Co-founder of the Apple Independent Analysts Group, Leitao is ranked seventh for the December quarter out of 50 analysts who cover Apple by Fortune magazine, which found that his estimates turned out to be much closer to the results than those from prestigious banks such as Goldman Sachsand Morgan Stanley.</p><p>While Wall Street analysts' forecasts for Apple's revenue and earnings per share were off by an average of 21 per cent in the latest quarter, amateur analysts missed by just 10 per cent, according to the Fortune data.</p><p>This raises questions about how good Wall Street is at forecasting Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, famous for trouncing market forecasts quarter after quarter.</p><p>Leitao does not believe he and the more than 100 members of the Apple Independent Analysts Group - which he started as a hobby - are smarter than their professional peers. He suspects Wall Street is more inclined to play it safe.</p><p>It does not help that Apple itself tends to lowball its guidance.</p><p>\"In their work, there is a greater risk in coming out with aggressive estimates that are too high,\" Leitao said of analysts at top-tier brokerage firms.</p><p>In the last couple of years, Apple's earnings have exceeded Wall Street expectations tracked by Thomson Reuters by at least 13 per cent, and often a lot more. The exception was the September quarter of 2011, when they fell short.</p><p>Technology analysts say Apple is particularly tough to predict because of its secretive nature, and because it has a hand in everything from hardware (iPhones, iPads, Macs and iPods) to digital distribution (iTunes and its emerging iCloud remote storage service).</p><p>They also point to a lack of historical data on the tablet market, and Apple's fast expansion into more than 100 countries as challenges. Yet another blind spot is sales from Apple's own retail stores and apple.com - data that only the company has.</p><p>\"If you're talking about Apple where you're trying to model Macs and phones and new markets like tablets, that's obviously more challenging than making assumptions around Intelwhere you're only modeling PCs,\" said JMP analyst Alex Gauna.</p><p>Analysts refine their financial models by studying Asian companies that supply components to Apple, surveying retail executives, and extrapolating from sales of previous generations of iPhones and iPads.</p><p>Their counterparts covering Intel Corp.and other big tech companies regularly visit PC manufacturers in Asia to take the industry's temperature. But attempts to talk to Apple's more than 100 suppliers, including Foxconn or Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd., often run into a wall of silence.</p><p>Beyond normal U.S. Regulation Fair Disclosure rules governing the disclosure of material information, companies working for Apple are required to sign strict confidentiality agreements and risk losing Apple's business if they break them.</p><p>That rigor stems from the era of Steve Jobs, who kept an iron grip on his team and refused to release products until they were perfected for prime-time - a discipline that endures past his death in October.</p><p>\"They have built reg-FD discipline into their channel beyond anything I have ever seen before,\" Gauna said. \"If you don't happen to have a cousin who works on the assembly line at Foxconn, then everybody has an equal playing field.\"</p><p>Looking for an edge, analysts resort to visiting Apple stores on important product-launch dates to count heads and conduct surveys.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYGE-133738788FRDG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYGLR2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54WD-WXK1-JCT2-K339-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306536</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"639\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 CanWest Interactive, a division of CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc.

Such businesses stand to benefit as China continues to reduce its dependence on export-driven manufacturing, and instead relies more on domestic consumer spending to drive growth.</p><p>In particular, they say, investors should focus on the dynamic Chinese technology, internet and e-commerce companies that are likely to prosper from Beijing's greater emphasis on the quality of economic growth.</p><p>Already, the big surge in the Chinese sharemarket this year has been driven by big tech groups, such as e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and the messaging-and-gaming group Tencent Holdings, which are ranked in the top 10 most valuable tech companies in the world, alongside US giants such as Amazon.com and Facebook.</p><p>Analysts point out that China is already the world's largest e-commerce and mobile-payment market. Of China's roughly 750 million mobile-internet users, more than half use their smartphones to pay for products and services. Chinese mobile payments are estimated to have soared to around 60 trillion yuan ($11.7 trillion) last year, more than eight times the transaction volume of the US.</p><p>But the huge growth in the surge in the power and reach of Chinese tech companies is not without political risks.</p><p>Analysts warn that as Chinese citizens use their phones for everything from texting to e-commerce and banking, tech companies are accumulating unparalleled amounts of information about their lives. And this is bound to arouse the interest of the Chinese Communist Party, which Xi wants to see play an even more central role in the country's affairs.</p><p>Beijing already requires big e-commerce groups, such as Alibaba and Tencent, to share their data with the Chinese central bank, which then shares the personal data of some 400 million people - including their payment history - with about 50 state-owned banks. Analysts say that, going forward, Chinese tech firms will likely face even greater pressure to work with Chinese authorities.</p><p>And Beijing is already looking at ways to prevent these Chinese tech giants become too powerful. One possibility - which Chinese regulators have already flagged - would be for Beijing to take a 1 per cent stake stake in big tech companies such as Tencent and Weibo. This would give Beijing the right to appoint a government official to the companies' board to monitor, and perhaps even influence, their corporate decision-making.</p><p>Chinese authorities are also keen to harness the vibrancy and dynamism of its tech companies as it tries to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/opinion/columnists/worries-about-chinese-dynamism-as-beijing-seeks-greater-economic-control-20171018-gz3qyz\">revitalise its lumbering state-owned sector.</url> One way is to encourage more private investment in state-owned firms.</p><p>Two months ago, Chinese internet giants including Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba joined in a Beijing-backed plan to pump $US11.7 billion into the telecommunications giant, China Unicom in what was billed as a template for revitalising Chinese state-owned companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1026725668</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PV0-6N81-JBJ7-N24P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><timeReceived>04:36 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
