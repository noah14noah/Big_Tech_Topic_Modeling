In truth, the current crisis sparked by a disease bears only a passing resemblance to what unfolded back then. Both crises were genuinely global and precipitated a financial panic. In 1929, it was the failure of policymakers to act swiftly - especially in the US - that allowed a market crash to curdle into something far worse and more damaging as it engulfed the real economy.</p><p>After the US economy toppled into recession in 1929, the Federal Reserve misguidedly continued to tighten monetary policy for several years while the government largely stood by and watched, taking only limited and meagre action.</p><p>President Herbert Hoover summed up official attitudes when he declared in 1931 that \"privation and suffering\" were a \"symbol of the triumph of the American soul\".</p><p>By 1933, when a new administration under Franklin D Roosevelt began its New Deal policy to get millions of people back to work, unemployment had soared from 3pc to 25pc of the US workforce. US GDP had halved from $103bn (\u00a388bn) to $55bn while global trade contracted 66pc in US dollar terms between 1929 and 1934.</p><p>It's not impossible that something similar could happen now - but there are grounds for cautious optimism things may not turn out to be so bleak.</p><p>For one thing, however serious and potentially deadly the current pandemic may be, it is likely to be a temporary phenomenon that will eventually lift. In the interim, there will undoubtedly be serious and lasting economic damage, a surge in unemployment and the accumulation of huge debts. But unlike in 1929, policymakers around the world have been swift to respond with stringent measures designed to minimise the impact on jobs and corporate failures.</p><p>Assuming the pandemic is of limited duration, there is reason to believe the economy may ultimately rebound.</p><p>There is one area where comparisons with the Great Depression hold up well, however.</p><p>One group of companies which performed remarkably well during that era despite the slump were the technology companies of the age - manufacturers of radios, telephone companies and the movie business, which experienced a golden age during the Thirties.</p><p>Sales of radios and cinema tickets soared as people sought an escape from the drudgery of daily life. Many of the unemployed or underemployed had plenty of time on their hands to seek diversions with up to 80 million Americans going to the cinema each week during the Depression.</p><p>In much the same way, it is the technology giants of Silicon Valley - Netflix, Google, Facebook, Amazon etc - who stand to emerge as winners from the current crisis.</p><p>It's not just because of demand for entertainment and staying connected to friends and family during an extended period of quarantine.</p><p>More than ever, the rest of the economy depends on their services to continue functioning as millions of people work from home.</p><p>For the same reason, providers of basic infrastructure - including broadband networks and cloud service providers such as Microsoft and AWS - also stand to benefit.</p><p>Across the board, suppliers of public utilities like electricity and telecoms should hold up relatively well due to a combination of inelastic demand for these services and cost deflation.</p><p>Most of the big tech companies are also cash-rich, allowing them to thrive during an extended downturn and potentially pick up weaker competitors along the way, cementing their growing dominance over tracts of the economy.</p><p>Another potential advantage for these technology companies - albeit a temporary one - is the fact that the fight against the virus has diminished scrutiny of their activities and the threat they may pose to competition.</p><p>The push to regulate and muzzle the forces of big tech is likely to take a back seat - at least for a while. However, when the dust settles and the current crisis ends, one of the consequences is likely to be a further entrenchment of the tech industry's power and influence.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Nine and its partners Foxtel and Telstra had to give something away to have a chance of winning the ratings battle, even if the hefty price tag virtually guaranteed they would lose money on the match coverage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The worst deals, though, have asymmetric outcomes - a winner and a loser. Toll Holdings' sale to Japan Post for $6.5 billion in 2015 was a huge winner for Toll shareholders but a disaster for the buyer, who two years on wrote off $4.9 billion of the value it paid and sent the recently floated post operator to a loss.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For that reason the deal earns a spot among the decade's worst deals. The 10-year stretch that began with the global financial crisis and was marked by record low interest rates, successive booms in commodity prices and the rise of big tech has also been littered with poor decisions. The deals have cost shareholders dearly, ended corporate careers and, in the worst cases, proved terminal for the company.</p><p>1. Rio Tinto's purchase of Riversdale for $US3.7 billion, 2010 The sheer scale of the resources boom fuelled by China's rapid and ongoing development produced torrents of cash for the big miners, and an insatiable thirst for the next big project to satisfy its demand for commodities. Rio Tinto was far from alone in executing poor deals in its search for the next company maker. In 2007 it paid $US38 billion for Alcan, in part to ward off attention from BHP Billiton, and then proceeded to write off 75 per cent of the value. But the Riversdale saga stands out among a bad crop executed by one of the world's leading resource companies.</p><p>After buying the relatively unknown company to get hold of its hard-coking coal prospects in Mozambique for $US3.7 billion in 2010, Rio would sell the project five years later for just $50 million. The 13 billion tonnes of reserves claimed by Riversdale turned out to be closer to three billion tonnes. Rio's plans to transport 30 million tonnes a year of production by barge down the Zambezi River was blocked within a year of acquisition, and a year later a senior executive told then chief financial officer Guy Elliott the project had \"no commercial value\".</p><p>Three years after it was sold, the US Securities Exchange Commission charged Rio, Elliott and chief executive Tom Albanese (above) with fraud for raising billions of dollars from investors without disclosing the worsening position of Riversdale.</p><p>Authorities in Australia and the UK later joined in. Rio and the duo have strenuously denied the charges.</p><p>2. BHP Billiton's push into the US shale market, $US40 billion, 2011 Former BHP Billiton chief executive Marius Kloppers (left) will be remembered for the scale of his ambitions. Within months of taking the reins at the Big Australian, he had launched a takeover bid for Rio Tinto. When thwarted there, he hatched a deal to form a joint venture of the two iron ore giants' Pilbara operations, but it was frustrated by regulators. And he conducted a long and fruitless campaign to secure the world's biggest potash miner, Canada's Potash Corp.</p><p>For all the energy Kloppers expended, the only big deal he was able to close was a push into the booming US shale market, with the $US15 billion takeover of Petrohawk and the $US4.75 billion purchase of Chesapeake Energy's Lafayette shale gas prospects in Arkansas. Made at the top of the market, with oil prices at $US120 a barrel, the deals were aimed at giving BHP a fourth leg in energy to complement its leading positions in iron ore, copper and coal. With added exploration and bolt-on acquisitions, BHP was estimated to have spent $US40 billion by the time the oil price corrected back to $30 a barrel, as OPEC attempted to curb the US shale industry with overproduction.</p><p>Under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management, Klopper's successor, Andrew Mackenzie, finally agreed to sell the assets to a unit of oil major BP for $US10 billion. Along with roughly $10 billion in free cash flows over the life of its ownership, that means BHP halved its money on the deal, ripping up $US20 billion of shareholder funds.</p><p>3. Slater and Gordon's purchase of UK litigation group Quindell for $1.3 billion, 2015 It was a delicious irony for directors and executives who have been on the wrong end of class actions launched by their most famed local exponent. Law firm Slater and Gordon last year settled an action brought by rivals Maurice Blackburn for shareholders who lost their dough buying shares in the company because of its purchase of UK litigation group Quindell.</p><p>The payment - $36.5 million - from directors' and officers' insurance was meagre relative to the destruction caused.</p><p>The $1.3 billion purchase in 2015, from a company described by hedge fund Gotham City Research as \"a country club built on sand\", spawned a capital raising for $890 million before disaster struck.</p><p>After the UK's Financial Conduct Authority started an investigation, Quindell was forced to restate a profit to a loss and Slater and Gordon, the first stockmarket-listed law firm in the world, faced scrutiny for the way it accounted for work in hand. Shares collapsed from $8 to 8c before hedge funds bought up $500 million of bank debt and converted it to majority control of the company.</p><p>4. John B Fairfax's buyout of family members' stake in Marinya Media, 2008 Call it the curse of Fairfax. In 2007, John B Fairfax (above) made a triumphant return to the newspaper company that bears his family name. His Marinya Media had used $20 million of the proceeds from cousin Warwick's ill-fated 1987 buyout of John Fairfax to buy out Rural Press. Having done a great job building up that company, he sold it to Fairfax in a scrip deal that delivered Marinya a 14 per cent stake in the merged group worth $1.1 billion.</p><p>But a February 2008 buyout of the 68 per cent of Marinya held by other family members was secured by a $170 million margin loan against Fairfax shares, worth $4 apiece. As the global financial crisis unfolded short-sellers attacked, hoping to trigger forced selling, causing a board falling-out with chairman, the late Ron Walker (top). Fairfax shares continued their descent, and Marinya later diluted its stake to just under 10 per cent by not taking up a rights issue. It eventually sold out on Armistice Day, November 11, 2011.</p><p>At 85c a share - a discount to the 92c market price - John B had dusted $900 million and the family left the business once again.</p><p>Nine Entertainment, once the fiefdom of fierce rivals the Packers, is now buying Fairfax for 94c a share in a takeover that will see the family name disappear from the company.</p><p>5. Allco's buyout of Rubicon, 2008 The global financial crisis made mincemeat of anyone with excessive leverage and in Australia its most celebrated victim was Allco Finance Group, chaired by the late David Coe.</p><p>In November 2008, at the height of the crisis and less than a year after its merger with the $5 billion Rubicon property trust empire of Gordon Fell (above), Allco was placed in receivership.</p><p>It's a moot point whether it could have survived had it not bought out the remaining 80 per cent of Rubicon for $263.5 million. Both Allco and Rubicon relied on being able to finance billions of dollars in loans at very fine margins, and when credit markets seized up after the September 15 collapse of Lehman Brothers, the companies were doomed.</p><p>The merger drained $70 million in cash from Allco into the personal accounts of Coe, Allco director David Cooper and Fell at precisely the wrong time. Rhodes Scholar Fell's $35.89 million share of that helped him settle on the then record residential purchase of Point Piper mansion Routala for $28.7 million.</p><p>6. TPG's float of Myer, 2009 It's a mark of how poorly the $2.4 billion float of department store chain Myer by TPG Capital has performed that nearly 10 years on it remains a cautionary tale for investors. Led by Ben Gray (above), TPG made out handsomely, trading in and out of the 61-store Myer chain in less than four years. As of mid-September, shareholders who bought into the November 2009 float at $4.10 a share had lost 90 per cent of their money, with the shares at just 41c.</p><p>Gray and co unquestionably did an outstanding job for their private equity backers. They bought Myer from the listed Coles Myer in 2006 for $1.4 billion and sold it back to the public for $2.4 billion in 2009. In between, they sold its flagship properties and more than recouped TPG's outlay, and spent more than $300 million overhauling logistics. But they brought it to market more than a year before their 50-month turnaround plan was completed, and left investors with a company that has been unable to grow sales and profits or recover its issue price.</p><p>The tax man failed in an 11th-hour bid to recover $680 million in tax and penalties on the float profit spirited out of the country just days afterwards. Myer, meanwhile, has turned over board and management and is stalked by former Coles Myer executive chairman Solomon Lew as it tries to find a winning formula.</p><p>7. Japan Post's purchase of Toll Holdings, 2015 Toll Holdings shareholders could hardly believe their luck when Japan Post came knocking with a bumper $6.5 billion offer for the company in 2015. A 49 per cent premium for a company that analysts believed was not doing well seemed almost too good to be true, and so it turned out. Just two years later, Japan Post would write off $4.9 billion - 74 per cent of the purchase price.</p><p>In a reminder of the consequences of overpaying, new management at Japan Post would order changes at Toll that saw divisions rationalised and 1700 jobs cut. A buyer eager for a growth kicker ahead of its own $12 billion float apologised for its hasty acquisition and for failing to do its research.</p><p>It was the last big payday for founder Paul Little (below), who had left the group in 2011 but collected $338 million on his shares.</p><p>He had previously got the better end of a deal to split Toll's port and rail assets into a new debt-heavy company, Asciano, headed by his business partner, Mark Rowsthorn. After he left, new management led by John Mullen turned that business around before a $10 billion takeover spearheaded by Little's old adversary, Chris Corrigan. As executive chairman, Mullen is leading the turnaround at Toll.</p><p>8. Woolworths and Wesfarmers hardware expansion Wesfarmers had a halo from the runaway success of its Bunnings hardware business and had \"earned\" the right to move offshore when it bought the UK's Homebase business for $705 million in 2016. Surely they couldn't stuff it up.</p><p>In an extraordinary coincidence, the deal was announced the same morning that Woolworths unveiled plans to extract itself from the Masters hardware joint venture with US retailer Lowe's.</p><p>That had cost $2.3 billion to build and lost $600 million. Fast forward two years and new Wesfarmers chief executive Rob Scott unveiled $1 billion in writedowns on Homebase after hamfisted attempts to make it a Bunnings UK. It's been sold for \u00c2\u00a31.</p><p>At Woolworths, the Masters losses contributed to CEO Grant O'Brien (above) being replaced. He conceived the venture to put pressure on Wesfarmers at a time when management was precoccupied with the turnaround of Coles, but allowed Woolies' sales growth to drift so badly that it was trounced by Coles for years. Now Wesfarmers is spinning off the Coles supermarkets business because its returns are too low for the conglomerate.</p><p>9. AMP's $14.6 billion stake in AXA, 2011 Under the old six pillars policy, AXA - the former National Mutual - was off limits to its Sydney-based rival AMP. There's an argument it might have been better if things had stayed that way, rather than allowing AMP to get into a bidding contest with NAB.</p><p>The early-2011 deal for AMP and AXA's French majority shareholder to carve up the business in a $14.6 billion cash and scrip deal has not delivered the hoped-for riches, or lifted AMP out of a decades-long decline. The France-based AXA took the most attractive growth assets in Asia, while AMP doubled down on the life business just as it was entering a period of escalating claims and slimming profits. AMP shares used as currency in the bid were worth $5.60 then and are now just above $3; its present market capitalisation of $9 billion is $2 billion less than it was before the deal was announced - and that's after issuing all of those shares.</p><p>Profits of $812 million in the year before the deal rose to $869 million in 2017. Revenue has grown strongly, and the company continues to praise the North wealth management platform that was a key part of the deal. But it was a high price to pay.</p><p>10. BrisConnections float, 2008 In polite terms, toll roads have ended up as good investments for their next owners.</p><p>BrisConnections, however, might have been the worst of a bad bunch of private sector financings that featured overly optimistic traffic forecasts, outsized fees and big investor losses. Built for $4.8 billion, the 6.7km toll road connecting Brisbane Airport to the CBD was sold out of receivership to Transurban for $2 billion in 2015.The project was in trouble from the start. The float launched in early August 2008, just a month before the collapse of Lehman Brothers ushered in the darkest phase of the global financial crisis. Its $1 partly paid shares crashed in value by 60 per cent on the first day of trading, on their way to a low of 1c. A young punk from Melbourne, Nicholas Bolton (above), snapped up 20 per cent of the company for $50,000 and took it to the brink of a vote on liquidation in 2009. It later emerged that he had sold his voting rights to tunnel-builder Leighton and walked away with $45 million. Traffic was forecast to hit 170,000 cars a day but had reached just 50,000 when Transurban took over.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20181019DealNSW28000376914592</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5THG-S0T1-JD3N-52HV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2341\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>DealNSW Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 19, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0006AJL</classCode><className>TOLL HOLDINGS LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC00024OT</classCode><className>BHP BILLITON PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002FD0</classCode><className>RIO TINTO GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>NAICS541614 PROCESS, PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION &amp;

Despite the obvious benefits of Google's scale and reach, Google+ was a ghost town, and quickly became a punchline. The gag became that the only people who ever used it were Google employees and the company's die-hardest fans.Unfortunately, the Wall Street Journal[1] reported that a Google+ bug had exposed its users' personal data. </p><p>Between 2015 and March 2018, the platform enabled APIs to leech your friends' information, including their email addresses, birthdate, pictures and occupation. Sure, a lot of that information you already share online, but folks who had set their data to be only viewable by friends were similarly affected.What's troubling isn't merely the data breach -- since the world now seems to meet these regular occurrences with nought but a shrug -- but Google's attitude toward it. According to the report, company executives decided not to disclose the breach to avoid \"immediate regulatory interest.\" Suddenly, Google wasn't so desperate to be associated with Facebook or social networking.To be fair to Google, there are some differences between this and Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. The company doesn't believe that anyone took advantage of the bug to leech up to 500,000 profiles. Again, that's a drop in the ocean compared to the (up to) 87 million that Facebook were found to have shared. Not to mention that Google did find the bug and close it after an internal review process into its security systems.In a blog post[2], Google's engineering VP Ben Smith said that one of the reasons that Google chose not to disclose was because it didn't know what to disclose. As part of a so-called commitment to privacy, the company only kept API log data for two weeks at a time. So it simply doesn't know if hackers abused the platform because it wasn't looking for problems.In the same post, Ben Smith said that the company has decided to close (the consumer version of) Google+ due to low engagement. Now, that's clearly true, and Google has, in recent years, been far more willing to kill off unsuccessful projects[3]. But it also seems like an excuse designed to avoid demonstrating contrition for making a privacy snafu of this kind.Sadly, it's likely that Google will avoid any real consequences for both the breach and its silence. Its stock price, which dipped yesterday, has already rebounded, and officials don't appear to be talking penalties. Lawmakers, too, won't care about this breach when CEO Sundar Pichai sits before the Judiciary Committee in November[4] to talk about China and \"bias.\" Washington types would much rather use the time, as they did for Mark Zuckerberg[5], to soapbox their performative victimhood about Google's non-existent biases.Had the breach been discovered a little later, it would have come under the auspices of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. That would have forced Google to come clean about the problem within three days of its discovery, and threatened punishments. Instead, the news of this will get washed away in the torrent of Pixel 3 announcements, and very little will change. Except for, perhaps, another couple of people wondering if Big Tech is so powerful now that it needs breaking up. Or even if there just needs to be better fines handed out to companies that are found breaching privacy rules.Google knows so much about you. What you search for, what TV you're watching, and who you're talking to. It hosts your email, stores your files and even offers an Office platform for you to do your job on its platform.

Policy must consider the worst possible day, not the routine day.1</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The emergence of the Chinese company Huawei as a leading provider of integrated telecommunications systems is seen as such a security threat that the U.S. Government (USG) has sought to raise barriers to the use of the company's technology in U.S. infrastructure, and even threatened long-standing intelligence sharing arrangements with the nation's closest allies who choose to use less expensive Chinese technology.2</p><p>While arguably helpful in the short term, the USG must confront the basic problem of whether an acceptable alternative must be based in the United States, and whether the U.S. Government should support even a foreign champion with foreign, trade, and industrial policies to promote a viable global competitor to Huawei. As was done in the wake of initial successes by the Soviet space program, the United States should consider whether its strategic role as a global power requires increased government investment in research, industrial capacity, and programs with specific objectives comparable in scale to the U.S. space program of the 1960s.3</p><p>This article considers how the United States fell into this dilemma, how the government has assisted infrastructure development in the past, and options for how the USG\u2014in partnership with allies and the private sector\u2014might be able to promote competition in the global market place with a view toward enhancing the resilience of national security communications and critical infrastructure.</p><p>Opening Gambit</p><p>Telecommunications is both a homeland security and a national security issue because the entire economy depends on a shared, interoperable infrastructure, and because many national security communications ride on top of commercial infrastructure both in the United States and abroad.4Nonetheless, the United States generally considers free market solutions as more effective and agile, particularly when it comes to consumer products, even when that means foreign companies dominate a technology market. Even when the government is involved in the creation of a technology, privatization is the preferred outcome, as occurred with the internet.5The business of integrated telecommunications equipment, however, is not a \"consumer\" issue; it is about systems used by critical infrastructure. In addition, the business of integrated telecommunications equipment is not a \"free marketplace\" in the usual consumer sense because the multi-decade timelines for investing in national infrastructures inevitably create cyclic demands as carriers seek to recover their capital expenditure investments and manage financing of these procurements.6</p><p>The United States, in the wake of a major economic downturn in 2001\u201302, made \"free market\" decisions by allowing U.S. industry to succumb to global market forces even as China's companies, Huawei and ZTE, began to emerge in global markets. Now the United States finds itself struggling to control a national security issue without the usual means to compete, namely its own industry.</p><p>Despite U.S. efforts to create a more diverse market of telecommunications service providers, the trend for equipment manufacturing has been toward reconsolidation to achieve economies of scale.7Market consolidation during the past 15 years has reduced the global telecommunications equipment integrator market to primarily Finland's Nokia, Sweden's Ericsson, China's Huawei and ZTE, and South Korea's Samsung (all but Huawei are publicly traded).8The United States now mostly depends on Nokia and Ericsson, with a smattering of Huawei deployments in low-density rural areas (the Rural Wireless Association in December 2018 told the FCC that 25 percent of its members use Huawei equipment).9Nokia and Ericsson in recent years have been financially shaky, with debt bonds emerging from junk bond status in 2017 only to lowest-grade investment status in 2018 and 2019, and both companies have suffered negative net income most quarters since the beginning of 2017.10Nokia suffered a significant downturn in the stock market after announcing that it would not meet its original growth targets in 2020 and would not be paying dividends in order to help fund development costs.11</p><p>According to industry market research, Huawei's global market share (including China) for service provider equipment is now greater than that of Ericsson and Nokia combined.12As of 2016, Huawei reportedly supplied more than half of the 537 \"fourth generation\" (4G) mobile networks globally and 59 of the 90 4.5G networks, an intermediate step before 5G.13European providers use Nokia and Ericsson equipment but increasingly have turned to Huawei for better prices and \"advanced\" capabilities that are ready to deploy.14The Dutch telecommunications carrier in April 2019 cited a 60 percent price advantage when choosing Huawei.15More than half of Huawei's 5G contracts as of July 2019 were in Europe.16</p><p>This proliferation of Chinese technology is further enabled by Chinese telecommunications service providers working together with other Chinese industries and cities to develop 5G applications within China and offering to build 5G infrastructure for other countries as part of the broader investment Beijing offers under its Belt and Road Initiative.17As part of this overall effort, Huawei seeks to dominate the application of 5G for the \"Internet of Things\"\u2014used in infrastructure and manufacturing\u2014through technology development and the setting of international standards.18</p><p>Can't We Just Keep Huawei Out of the United States?</p><p>U.S. concerns with Chinese telecommunications companies\u2014especially the more successful Huawei\u2014are not new. The USG for years has sought to limit the proliferation of telecommunications equipment manufactured by China's Huawei largely on the grounds that Huawei enables espionage for China's security services.19The U.S. Congress released a report on the threat posed by Chinese telecommunications manufactured equipment in 2012.20Reports in 2019 from British and U.S. cybersecurity experts have cited a high degree of risk from a large number of security vulnerabilities well in excess of current industry norms.21The African Union in May 2019 renewed its partnerships with Huawei on a range of technologies, from broadband and cloud computing to 5G and artificial intelligence, despite accusations in the media that China used Huawei equipment during a period of five years to steal data from the Union's headquarters in Addis Ababa (construction of which was funded by Beijing).22</p><p>President Trump in May 2019 issued an Executive Order on supply chains and ordered the placement of non-U.S. affiliates of Huawei on the Commerce Department's Entity List.23In addition, Section 889 of theFiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Actbegan to take effect in August 2019. This bill prohibits federal agencies from using \"covered\" entities or their subsidiaries and affiliates, including Huawei and ZTE.24The bill prohibits federal contracts with companies that use covered entities as of August 2020. The actual impact of these recent policies will not be fully determined until rules and regulations are put in place; however, such impacts may be blunted significantly as part of a broader trade agreement.25Other proposed bills call for promoting the development of 5G industry and for ensuring the security of 5G and future mobile telecommunications systems and infrastructure within the United States.26</p><p>The exclusion policy has the potential to prevent further Chinese deployments within the United States but does not solve the longer-term problem of ensuring trusted communications infrastructure on a global basis for the United States or the proper functioning of other foreign critical infrastructure depended on by the U.S. military and other U.S. interests overseas.27Even for domestic infrastructure, the exclusion policy would not protect U.S. interests in the event that the Nordic companies continue to run into financial difficulties despite positive outlooks for growth in 5G sales.28</p><p>Most discussion of the Huawei issue centers around \"espionage;\" however, the greater concern is actually availability, given that encryption and authentication technology can be used to protect confidentiality and integrity of communications. Every critical infrastructure system in the United States, including that of the USG, depends on commercial telecommunications infrastructure.29On the worst possible day in a conflict with a peer adversary, the United States may not be able to count on the survivability of communication satellites, and satellites do not provide sufficient data rates for the full scope of information-based warfare strategies regardless.30Even surviving fiber links would be subject to disruption if the communications must pass through equipment provided by vendors from hostile countries, notably Huawei and ZTE. For example, Huawei completely dominates the telecommunications infrastructure in Iraq that the USG and its military presence depend on.31</p><p>Current policy depends on convincing other countries to use more expensive European equipment with capabilities reportedly lagging Huawei features by a year or more.32U.S. policy also potentially has the effect of asking other countries to rip out existing investments in Huawei equipment prior to installing new 5G equipment, which in the case of Europe would cost more than $60 billion, according to some estimates,33although others suggest it would cost much less.34Within the United States, small rural carriers would face existential financial hardships transitioning away from Huawei.35This policy impact could be mitigated in part with equipment that will be available by the end of 2019 to bridge the gap between old Huawei and new western equipment.36To counter future transition problems, telecommunications service providers, in part through the Open Radio Access (O RAN) Alliance, are promoting the global use of interoperable standards that would allow the service providers to avoid vendor lock-in for future generations.37</p><p>Some countries are seeking mitigation of the threat by limiting Huawei to the \"edge\" of their networks and excluding Huawei from the \"core;\" however, telecommunications companies and U.S. Government officials have noted that, with 5G, the distinction between the edge and the core largely disappears, suggesting this approach would not satisfy U.S. security concerns.38The British experience with inspections of Huawei equipment highlights the challenge of guaranteeing security through inspection as another means of mitigation.39A nation might seek to adopt a \"zero trust\" model for 5G; however, industry experience in developing \"trusted computing\" suggests that hardware as the \"root of trust\" has a degree of privilege that cannot be controlled against an untrusted supplier.40Meanwhile, Huawei is seeking to improve its code review process to mitigate concerns raised by the British reports.41</p><p>Some argue that U.S. policy should solve the global problem by \"killing\" Huawei through the cutoff from western supply chains; however, this view ignores the likelihood that Beijing would step in to assist its national champion even more so than it has already.42China to date has always fallen short of the information technology state of the art and thus succumbed to the market imperative to use better western components; however, bifurcation of the global market would alter this dynamic decisively.43The founder and chief executive of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei, prior to the G20 summit in June 2019 said;</p><p>The U.S. is helping us in a great way by giving us these difficulties. If we aren't allowed to use U.S. components, we are very confident in our ability to use components made in China and other countries.44</p><p>In response to U.S. policy and concern for their Chinese markets, Ericsson and Nokia reportedly are planning how they might need to bifurcate organizations and supply chains to remain in both western and Chinese markets, with potentially significant costs on top of already weak financial positions.45</p><p>According to Triolo and Allison of the Eurasia Group, in their paper on \"The Geopolitics of 5G\"</p><p>The United States and China also are competing to develop innovative technology applications that will run on top of deployed 5G networks. The United States has an advantage in terms of innovation capacity, but China will benefit from its head start building out its domestic 5G ecosystem and as Chinese companies then compete for market share abroad.46</p><p>Triolo and Allison note that, \"The push for a China-free 5G alternative is likely to delay 5G deployment where backup suppliers are forced to invest in new manufacturing capacity and human capital, further cementing China's first-mover advantage.\" They also note that;</p><p>A bifurcated 5G ecosystem would increase the risk that the global technology ecosystem would give way to two separate, politically divided technology spheres of influence. Such a split could result in some interoperability issues or lower economies of scale and higher transaction costs.47</p><p>Potential Damage to the U.S. Semiconductor Industry</p><p>Meanwhile, the semiconductor industry and other high-technology industries in the United States have expressed concern about the collateral effects of the Huawei policy resulting from market \"uncertainty\" and the potential loss of Chinese markets, which in some cases account for a significant fraction of their revenue (for example, Qualcomm, Micron Technology, Qorvo, Broadcom, and Texas Instruments each earn more than 40 percent of their revenues from China; Intel and Nvidia get more than 20 percent from China). Huawei depends particularly on U.S. optical and analog components from companies such as NeoPhotonics (49 percent of revenue from Huawei alone), Lumentum (18 percent), Inphi (14 percent), Qorvo (13 percent), II-VI (9 percent), and Finisar (8 percent).</p><p>Because U.S. economic policies have so strongly favored globalization, key capabilities in the high-technology sector during the past 30 years have moved overseas to a significant degree. At first this primarily involved assembly of electronic components; however, the most complex manufacturing\u2014including for advanced printed circuit boards and semiconductors and their associated supply chains\u2014increasingly are centered outside the United States. U.S. industry has focused on maintaining ownership of intellectual property through the design process but often depends on companies such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to make products.</p><p>How Did We Get to This Point?<br/>Huawei. Photo Credit: Tasnim News Agency</p><p>The lack of a U.S. industrial base for integrated telecommunications equipment manufacturing that could compete with Huawei and the European firms for the global deployment of 5G systems is the direct result of a \"perfect storm\" of regulatory, technology, and economic shifts at the end of the 1990s. As detailed in the extensive study published in 2011 by Lazonick and March, the primary U.S. company, Lucent Technologies, ultimately failed because it made short-term financial decisions without a long-term vision for technology and global market development.48\u00a0In particular:</p><p>The USG breakup of the Bell System in 1984 led by 1996 to the spinoff of Western Electric manufacturing and the world renown Bell Laboratories. The new company, Lucent, was intended to serve as a neutral provider to all of the emerging U.S. service providers. Canada's Nortel had spun off from the Bell System in 1949 as a result of an earlier anti-trust suit.49Telecommunications markets benefited from the boom times of the late 1990s and early 2000s but were then crushed in the wake of a general downturn in western economies in 2001\u201302.Lucent had an incumbent advantage with legacy technologies but failed to make the pivot to internet services and applications, in part because it sought to develop its own protocols rather than use the broadly accepted Internet Protocol.Lucent with the help of Bell Labs, along with Canada's Nortel, made great progress in optical network technology; however, the technology was deployed far faster than anyone was prepared to use it, leading to a collapse in demand after 2000 for Lucent, Nortel, and the submarine cable business. Lucent spun off its optical cable division to Furukawa Electric in 2001. Global demand for optical networks did not recover for more than a decade.50Lucent contributed to the early expansion of mobile networks with arguably superior technology for 3G networks, such as CDMA, but failed to capture markets in Europe and Asia that used other technology such as GSM.Lucent in 2000 spun off its profitable microelectronics division after forcing the division to compete for Lucent business with third-party providers.Lucent in 2000 also spun off its \"slower growing\" enterprise network division, leaving the company without an ability to compete when this market segment grew faster than the general telecommunications market after the 2001\u201302 economic downturn.</p><p>This toxic mix led to consolidation of the integrated equipment manufacturing firms in the West even as Huawei and ZTE emerged in global markets after the worst of the downturn, building on top of rapidly modernizing and expanding infrastructure in China.51The UK's Marconi went through a complicated series of mergers and divestments, with the telecommunications group eventually ending up in 2005 as part of Sweden's Ericsson.52Ericsson in 2010 absorbed what was left of Nortel after that company collapsed into bankruptcy in 2009.53Finland's Nokia absorbed Motorola Solutions in 2011, and then the communications group of Germany's Siemens in 2013. Meanwhile, in 2006 France's Alcatel absorbed Lucent; however, even this new firm could not thrive and was absorbed by Nokia in 2016.54The only other major player to arise during this period has been South Korea's Samsung, which so far has little overall market share in telecommunications equipment but seeks to build on its mobile phone and semiconductor reputations and South Korea's investment in broadband networks.55</p><p>Government's Longstanding Role in Promoting Critical Infrastructure</p><p>History provides a guide for how the government could help reset the playing field with the goal of creating stronger competition against China's heavily supported national telecommunications champion. Consensus on the government's role in infrastructure development did not emerge immediately and will remain a matter of discussion in terms of when such interventions are appropriate. Discussions in the early days of the nation primarily centered on toll roads and canals that were deemed vital to commerce and military mobility for the growing nation. Competition for commercial traffic led to fights among the States until the 1824 Supreme Court decision inGibbons v. Ogdenruled that the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution granted power to regulate interstate commerce to the U.S. Congress, overriding any decisions by the States.56From that point forward, the U.S. Government acted more decisively.</p><p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers took on a direct role in the planning, building, and management of national waterways once the U.S. Congress passed the General Survey Act of 1824.57The USG provided companies with financing and land rights for the building of the Transcontinental Railroad during the 1860s (the companies eventually paid off the loans).58During the Depression of the 1930s, the Roosevelt Administration led the effort to build dams and the national power grid to accelerate the spread of electric power.59 60The government has been involved in projects that created new infrastructure and involved long periods of investment, including for communications.In 1956, the Eisenhower Administration worked with the U.S. Congress to begin building the nation's Interstate Highway system of almost 50,000 miles, largely funded by the U.S. Government.61Starting in the late 1960s, the USG-funded research and development for packet-switched networks that by 1995 evolved into the commercial internet.62USG interest initially was to create communications that would be resilient in the event of wartime destruction of key telecommunication nodes; however, the interest pivoted to the creation of new commercial services that had been piloted inside government-funded networks.</p><p>In other cases, the government sought to create private sector capabilities that required a large investment boost to get started.</p><p>During the 1960s, the USG under President Kennedy funded a large-scale expansion of the nation's space industry through the Apollo program.63In 2019 dollars, NASA spent more than $250 billion between 1960 and 1973 to put a man on the moon\u2014creating a major impetus for communications, electronics, and computer development.64At its peak, the NASA budget represented more than 4 percent of the federal budget.65The international satellite communications company IntelSat, with a constellation of about 50 geostationary satellites, in the early 1960s was created by a multinational government consortium and then fully privatized by 2001.66InMarSat, with about a dozen geostationary satellites, has had a similar history, beginning in the late 1970s as an intergovernmental organization and transitioning to privatized operations in 1998.67</p><p>The government has used a combination of loans, investment, subsidies, taxes, fees, and procurement to save U.S. industry from imminent collapse, to stimulate innovation, or to stimulate the economy as a whole.</p><p>Since 1958 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has funded the development of emerging technologies for military applications, most famously the networking technology that underlies the internet.68In the late 1980s DARPA provided matching funds for SEMATECH, an industry consortium that managed grants for semiconductor manufacturing research.69The U.S. Congress in early 1980 granted Chrysler $1.5 billion in loan guarantees to help the number three automaker recover from bankruptcy.70Chrysler paid off the loans in 1982.71The Department of Defense (DOD) in 2000 used procurement funds to help the Iridium satellite phone business stay afloat and remained a major customer as the infrastructure went through bankruptcy, sale, and then regeneration, because the constellation provided a unique global communications capability.72DOD in 2005 used $50 million of Title III Defense Production Act funds to restore manufacturing capabilities of high-purity Beryllium metal that had been mothballed five years earlier because of declining demand and liability for health hazards to workers.73The USG exercised a major role in preserving industry and infrastructure during times of economic difficulties, most dramatically in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve intervened on an unprecedented scale to save financial institutions and automakers on the brink of collapse resulting from bad loans. The U.S. Congress authorized the spending of up to $750 billion under the Troubled Assets Recovery Program (TARP), primarily through loans and stock purchases. Assistance to the insurance company AIG alone amounted to $182 billion. The government at one point owned 92 percent of AIG stock but over time sold all of the stock, resulting in a net gain of about $22 billion for taxpayers.74The 2009American Recovery and Reinvestment Actmade extensive use of tax incentives for individuals and companies, but also set aside procurement funds, all intended as a short-term economic stimulus.75Of almost $800 billion, only about $100 billion was specified for infrastructure, and less than a third of that went to building infrastructure (including about $7 billion for broadband internet)\u2014illustrating the challenges for the USG to influence infrastructure either quickly or without a specified objective.76</p><p>The rise of the defense industrial base after World War II, which helped create \"Silicon Valley,\" is the best example of a long-term government investment for national security purposes.77This capacity was nurtured throughout the Cold War with massive, long-term investments through Defense Department procurements in combination with USG capabilities and facilities. By the year 2000, however, Defense Department policies sought to control costs through commercial-off-the-shelf products and an international supply chain.78Policy guidance continues to be \"buy, not make.\"79</p><p>Options for the Nation</p><p>Given the shortfalls of a \"just say no\" policy, the United States will need to compete in the telecommunications equipment integration sector, both in terms of products and trade strategy. The U.S. Government typically seeks to use procurement for federal networks and research and development investment as the primary levers for influencing high technology. U.S. industry already leads in component and subsystem technologies (notably in optics); however, that advantage has not overcome the boom and bust cycles of the equipment integration market. Thus, a new element will be required that will involve some combination of direct investment, subsidies, loans, and tax incentives as has been done for other industries, either for national security purposes or to preserve national economic or indusrial capabilities. In addition, the USG could include preferred telecommunications equipment manufacturers (no matter where they are from) in U.S. trade, defense, and foreign policy packages that the United States seeks to implement with other nations that are upgrading their telecommunications infrastructure.</p><p>Similar ideas have been raised before, including by this author and by James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.80Lewis cited three options: build networks from insecure components, build a national champion, or subsidize European producers. According to Lewis, the Obama Administration considered funding a national champion using theDefense Production Act, \"but it could at most allocate 1 percent of what China spent. The discussion of how to respond to the telecom problem made it as far as a Deputies Committee meeting, but none of the major information technology companies wanted to reenter this field. Though a few medium-size companies could have been candidates for investment, the administration ultimately decided to rely on Google and Silicon Valley to innovate our way out of the problem without the need for the government to spend anything.\"</p><p>The U.S. Defense Science Board's June 2019 report on \"Defense Applications of 5G Network Technology\" notes that \"the lack of a U.S. integrator and Radio Access Network vendor industrial base\" creates challenges. The report recommends that the Department of Defense \"should provide seed funding for western industrial base alternatives of key system components, e.g., Radio Access Networks.\"81</p><p>The scale of investment required\u2014as can be seen from the size of the European companies\u2014would require the U.S. Congress to appropriate additional funds, even if implemented under existing authorities, such as Title III of theDefense Production Act(annual appropriations typically range only in the 10s to 100s of millions of dollars).82Ericsson and Nokia each employ about 100,000 or more workers (although not just for telecommunications integrated equipment manufacturing), and each as of 2018 had net equities in the range of $10-20 billion and net assets in the range of $25\u201345 billion.83Nokia spent $16.6 billion acquiring Alcatel\u2013Lucent in 2016.84</p><p>Maintaining leadership requires huge research investments. Huawei is participating comprehensively in the international standards process and makes large investments in research and development, now increasing to $15\u201320 billion per year from levels of $13\u201315 billion in 2017\u201318.85European firms lag significantly. Nokia has increased investment in research and development to about 20 percent of its revenue or roughly $5 billion per year after a significant decline during 2013\u201315.86In addition, the European Investment Bank in August 2018 provided a $583 million five-year loan to Nokia in 2018, and Canada in January 2019 provided Nokia with a $40 million research grant.87Ericsson in 2017 increased investments to at least 15 percent of its revenue\u2014a bit more than $4 billion per year\u2014despite concurrent net income losses.88</p><p>The major U.S. telecommunications service providers with operations in the United States and abroad would need to be included at least in the planning process for such an investment policy given that they would be the ultimate customers for most of the equipment, have expertise on the markets and systems and, most likely, would serve as the final systems integrators and operators during implementation and deployment. Indeed, the service providers could be provided incentives to participate directly in the investment strategy; however, they are also burdened with high levels of debt from capital expenditures.89Other operators of critical infrastructure (financial systems, electric power, oil and gas distribution, transportation, etc.) also might benefit by participating in the planning and investments.</p><p>The following three options are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>Option 1: Champion the European and South Korean Companies</p><p>U.S. telecommunications infrastructure already depends on Ericsson and Nokia (and to a much lesser degree on Samsung90), each of which have a significant economic presence through their U.S. subsidiaries. As noted previously, these companies include some of the residual capabilities that once belonged to now-defunct U.S. integrated telecommunications equipment companies. The USG, perhaps working primarily through the U.S. subsidiaries, might be able support these companies with stock investments, tax policies, debt guarantees, loans, and procurements, particularly to stabilize their finances and to boost their research and development investments that lag significantly behind those of Huawei. Both companies have undergone significant adjustments in management and business portfolios to stabilize their financial situation while investing for future growth. Both companies expect global demand to grow as most countries seek to take advantage of the benefits of 5G. In the unlikely event that the two Nordic companies merged to gain economies of scale relative to Huawei (despite potential EU, Chinese, and U.S. anti-monopoly concerns and challenges merging product lines), the USG could support the new merged entity in the same way.</p><p>As a sign of the Samsung's commitment to diversifying its product line, press reports in July 2019 indicated that Samsung plans to invest more than $100 billion over the next 10 years to gain prominence in global chip processors.91Samsung, however, in November 2019 announced the closure of its US-based research lab for mobile phone chips after failing to win market share from Qualcomm from external customers.92</p><p>Option 2: U.S. Entities Acquire Either or Both European Companies</p><p>If the United States needs to have a home-based champion for 5G and beyond, the fastest approach might involve working with the private sector to acquire a controlling interest in parts of one of the existing European companies, possibly using authorities under the Defense Production Act Title III or else with a separate Congressional authorization. Nokia Networks would be the primary division of interest from Nokia along with Bell Labs, and Business Area Networks would be the key division within Ericsson.93Samsung's 5G segment may not be a good target for acquisition because it has much less market share and is part of a growth strategy for the otherwise very large vertically integrated South Korean conglomerate.94</p><p>The USG could use past models of loan guarantees, tax incentives, and direct investment. Either of these companies would benefit from significant U.S.-based investment and more innovative and agile management to help them stabilize their finances and close the gap in research and development that these companies have with Huawei.Both companies have significant presence in the United States and recently have sought to expand their U.S. research and production. For example, Ericsson plans to open a fully automated factory for advanced antenna systems in the United States by 2020 and previously set up a design center in Texas for 5G-related application specific integrated circuits (ASICs).95Nokia is expanding its operations in Texas, and operates the original Bell Labs facilities in New Jersey.96These companies, however, are major contributors to the economies of their home countries, suggesting a major acquisition might be resisted by those governments and the European Union.For example, Nokia owns Alcatel Submarine (undersea cables) that competes with the U.S. company now known as Subcom, as well as the optical networking capabilities of Alcatel\u2013Lucent, and is likely to be seen by the Europeans (particularly Paris) as an asset that needs to remain European.97Meanwhile, Ericsson is not a major player in optical networks and depends more on microwave for backhaul communications.98In addition, these companies have facets unrelated to integrated telecommunications equipment manufacturing that are, in part, artifacts of prior mergers and acquisitions. Culling out the equipment manufacturing alone, however, might leave behind unsustainable business organizations. Also, as Lucent experienced, the equipment manufacturing by itself may not be sustainable through demand cycles.99These companies also have existing business arrangements and obligations, in some cases with China, that may create complications for U.S. trade policy.100<br/>Option 3: Create a U.S.-Based Consortium</p><p>The USG could seek to create business conditions through a combination of procurement, investment, and financing to bring together the robust, diverse capabilities of existing U.S. private sector capabilities and patent rights that foreign integrated telecommunications equipment manufacturers already depend on under an integrated corporate management. Private equity could supplement USG funds, leading over time to an eventual reduction in the share of government investment while maintaining U.S. financial guarantees and trade support in the background.</p><p>Over time, this \"consortium\" could be led by a \"prime\" company comparable to the big integration companies that dominate U.S. defense contracting. Such an entity could add or even subtract \"sub-prime\" capabilities as needed in accordance with changes in technology, fluctuating demand, and maturation of national infrastructures. Again, the USG could use combinations of past strategies to drive the formation of this consortium, with the ultimate goal of leaving the private sector in control.</p><p>Rather than be treated as direct competitors, Nokia and Ericsson could contribute subsystems (particularly for radio access networks)\u2014as might other companies from trusted international partners, notably the Five Eyes, Germany, France, Japan, and South Korea.Such an approach could in effect create a single, trusted U.S.-based, international consortium with the financial backing of the USG for use by U.S. allies and any nation that would trust such an alliance more than Chinese providers.Success would depend on a competitive pricing strategy in combination with U.S. and allied incentives to participate. Such a consortium also would benefit from strong relationships with the U.S. and allied defense departments and ministries.<br/>A Bottom Line Comparison of Options</p><p>Each option involves positive and negative tradeoffs. All of them face potential resistance from overseas, including the Nordic countries, the EU (especially France), and possibly China. The resistance could be regulatory or through the WTO.</p><p>Support to an existing foreign firmwould involve the least commitment from either the USG or private sector; however, this option offers the least influence or certainty of a useful result.Buying one of the two Nordic firmswould be easier than creating a new corporate entity and the fastest way back into the telecommunications equipment integration business but would require greater investment than simply supporting a firm with its current ownership. The United States would not have as much leverage on the outcome as would occur with the purchase of both firms.Creating a new consortiumwould be the hardest to implement in terms of creating product lines, gaining market share, and licensing patents but would offer the greatest control of the outcome and thus the best opportunity to invest for longer-term technologies. As a result, this option potentially would require the greatest investment but also has the potential for the greatest return in terms of U.S. jobs and stimulating the U.S. high-technology sector.</p><p>Economic success of the strategy would depend on international trust of the equipment provider. In some parts of the world, U.S. ownership would provide comfort; however, in other parts of the world even some friendly countries might prefer \"neutral\" European products, a potentially useful outcome if the U.S. policy goals include not undermining a viable European competitor. In any case, western entities will need to persuade potential customers that the reliability and quality of products combined with transparent security policies is an attractive feature in comparison to what is offered by Chinese alternatives.</p><p>The final implementation of 5G will represent more than an upgrade to 4G technology components; the new systems over many years will evolve to a fundamentally different architecture and drive massive changes in the infrastructures and businesses that will benefit from 5G.101With this longer perspective in mind, the best U.S. strategy might involve a combination of the options. In the near-term, the United States needs to \"get in the game,\" perhaps through options 1 or 2, to avoid surrendering future incumbent advantages to China and to gain experience in working with the new systems. For the long run, however, the United States as a second step might need to focus on the broader U.S. high-technology industry with Option 3 to drive innovation and to be in the best position for future generations.</p><p>The deployment of 5G technology across all of the infrastructure will take at least 10 years; however, discussion of 6G technology has already begun. In November 2018 a Chinese official claimed that the Ministry of Information and Industry Technology had already begun work on 6G with a view toward initial commercial deployments as early as 2030.102Finland's Oulu University's 6Genesis Project seeks to develop communication networks with bandwidths over 1 terabit per second with a grant of more than $250 million.103As the Finnish researchers note, 6G will build on 5G infrastructure and applications, and thus any investment in 6G will need to build on a prior investment in 5G.</p><p>Find a USG Champion</p><p>Justification for the amount of resources needed to reboot the nation's supply chain for integrated telecommunications systems would need to be framed in terms of ongoing U.S. strategies for resilient global command and control systems for national security and for maintaining control of critical infrastructure functions under the most stressful circumstances of a war with a peer adversary, such as Russia or China. This level of demand is a unique national-level governmental requirement and thus must be met at least in part by the USG. The measure of success would be determined by whether U.S. defense and critical infrastructure planners could demonstrate greater resilience against the full spectrum of threats. The U.S. military already is seeking to improve the resilience of critical systems, including for nuclear command, control and communications (NC3).104</p><p>The biggest player within the USG, and the most likely center point for a successful effort, would have to be Department of Defense. This is the only department with the global reach and mission requirements, technical depth, procurement and large-scale integration experience, budgetary capacity, and existing authorities to handle such a large project. The Office of the Secretary of Defense would need to work with the Joint Chiefs of Staff to incorporate military strategic requirements and with the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies that work with private sector critical infrastructure.</p><p>Conclusion: Resiliency Strategy Must Determine the Way Forward</p><p>As noted by West Point authors Borghard and Lonergan, the United States needs to examine its policies toward the next generation of telecommunications in the context of strategic requirements for resilient global command and control of U.S. military forces and other U.S. interests, to include how the U.S. military depends on commercial communications.105This discussion must consider the worst possible day, not the routine day. The challenge is primarily one of availability on that worst day, not espionage. These requirements abroad and for critical infrastructure at home are uniquely the purview of government, and thus the government must step up and make the strategic investment in what is essentially the central nervous system of the nation. An effort of this magnitude will require a unified approach across the Executive Branch and broad bipartisan support from the U.S. Congress.</p><p>Trade policy alone, particularly one given to broader compromise, will not allow the United States to define how other nations choose to implement infrastructure that U.S. national security communications may need to pass through. The United States needs a unified vision of how to compete in terms of technology and close deals for U.S. advantage. As with the defense industrial base, the USG in the long run should seek to have the private sector operate any new manufacturing capability and thus would need to work in partnership with the industries that best understand the technology and customer needs. The USG would need to stand behind industry efforts to gain deals with other nations\u2014just as it has for other vital industries with national security implications, notably aviation.</p><p>The USG, as it has with most national security efforts abroad, would need assistance from traditional national security allies and countries located at what already are or should be key communications junctures.106For example, new pathways might be needed that are less vulnerable to disruption as compared to the ones now passing where they are vulnerable to adversary disruption, through areas of dense commercial activities, or in regions of longstanding conflicts.107As has been done for some military systems, the United States would need to work with trusted nations that can provide useful technology and manufacturing capacity, in part to gain their support for a new player in the integrated telecommunications market place.</p><p>It will not be enough for the private sector with government support just to create a company to manufacture and integrate telecommunications systems. The USG, in partnership with the private sector, will need to consider how it will remain competitive over the long term.</p><p>This may require financial support to help industry get through demand lulls, including if demand lags expectations, as occurred from 2000 to 2010, because of slower than expected implementation of applications elsewhere in U.S. infrastructure and businesses.In addition, a long-term strategy would require reinvigoration of investment in the hardware elements all across the U.S. high-technology sector that have either moved to Asia or been too long dependent on investments made years ago.108A telecommunications equipment integrator based in the United States would provide an anchor for investment in all of the component technologies and their associated supply chains, including future generations of semiconductors. The success of innovation in the U.S. high technology sector will depend on preserving homeland-based manufacturing and supply chain ecosystems.</p><p>Key challenges going forward include mobilizing the USG to act and then drawing in the right elements of the private sector as investors or participants in product development. Then the real work would begin with developing a product line that can compete in terms of the best combination of technology, pricing, and financing. Additional incentives from U.S. and allied governments might be needed to overcome incumbent advantages or to walk back some past infrastructure decisions in key, strategic locations.109</p><p>This will be a \"long march\" (as China's President Xi would say).

Systrom and early Instagram investor Matt Cohler discussed what to tell Zuckerberg about the photo app's future plans.In the text exchange, Systrom expresses concern about sending Zuckerberg into \"destroy mode\" if he turned down an acquisition offer, and being unable to \"escape the wrath of Mark.\"Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[3]. Never-before-seen text messages from 2012 show just how careful Instagram cofounders felt they needed to be in dealing with the \"wrath\" of Mark Zuckerberg in the months before Facebook acquired the photo-sharing app for $1 billion.A text exchange between Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom and early investor Matt Cohler, then a partner at Benchmark, show the two strategizing how much to disclose to Zuckerberg about the photo-sharing app's future plans, and the cofounders' decision whether to get acquired or continue on independently. In the text conversation, Systrom voices his concerns to Cohler about possibly sending Zuckerberg into \"destroy mode\" or encountering \"the wrath of Mark\" if the Instagram cofounders were to rebuff Facebook's interest in buying the app.The text messages were made public Wednesday as Zuckerberg \u2014 as well as the CEOs of Apple, Google, and Amazon \u2014 appeared in front of the House Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee to answer lawmakers' questions about any potential violations of antitrust regulations. </p><p>The exchange between Systrom and Cohler was just one of a trove of documents the House subcommittee made public[4] during Wednesday's hearing to demonstrate possible anticompetitive practices by the four big US tech companies.Although Facebook's purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 weren't challenged at the time, lawmakers at Wednesday's hearing heavily scrutinized the acquisitions. Some representatives argued that Facebook's app acquisitions and clones of other platforms' features \u2014 like Snapchat's Stories and, most recently, TikTok \u2014 were evidence of monopolistic or anticompetitive behavior.The committee also published several email threads and online chat logs showing conversations that took place among Zuckerberg and various Facebook executives and employees to demonstrate the company's mindset during Instagram's $1 billion acquisition.By the start of 2012, Facebook was touting that[5] its company comprised 95% of the social media market. However, Instagram was rapidly threatening that lead: In March 2012, Instagram's average daily users was growing at a rate of more than 1,700% week-over-week and 9.2 million percent month-over-month, according to documents published Wednesday[6].In emails Zuckerberg sent in 2012, the CEO calls Instagram[7] a \"threat,\" and reasons that[8] buying Instagram would be a way to successfully \"neutralize\" its success. Zuckerberg told colleagues that Instagram \"can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business,\" and that acquiring Instagram would be \"buying\" time for the company.But Zuckerberg's plans to take on Instagram didn't come as a surprise to the app's cofounders, as is apparent by the text exchange between Systrom and Cohler. Systrom said he feared[9] turning down an acquisition offer from Facebook would send Zuckerberg into \"destroy mode\" \u2014 a concern that Cohler affirmed.\"Mark doesn't react emotionally, he reacts based on competition,\" Systrom later writes to Cohler. \"Bottom line I don't think we'll ever escape the wrath of [M]ark. It just depends how long we avoid it.\"Just two months after this conversation took place, Facebook acquired Instagram[10] for $1 billion in April 2012.In response to questions from[11] Rep. Jerry Nadler at Wednesday's hearing, Zuckerberg acknowledged the company viewed Instagram \"as a competitor and a complement to our services\" in 2012. The chair of the big tech hearing, Rep. David Cicilline, later told Axios that Zuckerberg's testimony proved Facebook displayed \"classic monopoly behavior\" and should be broke up.However, Zuckerberg also reasoned that Facebook had simply \"adapted features\"[12] from competitors in response to lawmakers' grilling about whether it cloned competitors' products in order to maintain its social media dominance. Zuckerberg also argued that Facebook still faces competition from platforms like YouTube and TikTok.The Facebook CEO also disagreed[13] with lawmakers' characterization that his conversations with Facebook executives regarding acquisition targets were viewed as a threat \"in any way.\" Read the original article on Business Insider[14] [ 1]: <url

A handful of these deal with longly contested topics, such as affirmative action and rent control. In order for a proposition to have made the ballot this year, voter signature-based propositions required 623,212 votes for initiative statutes and 997,139 for initiative constitutional amendments. Voter signatures pushed eight propositions forward, while the California State Legislature is seeking to modify the California Constitution with the other four proposed propositions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Xpress California Ballot Measure Voting Guide was created as a comprehensive resource to clarify what each proposition entails, as well as who supports and opposes each proposition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Proposition 14, the Stem Cell Research Institute Bond Initiative:</p><p>If passed, Proposition 14 would provide the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine $5.5 billion through general obligation bonds, bonds backed by the state's ability to tax residents to pay bondholders.</p><p>The bonds would add up to about $7.8 billion, given a projected $2.3 billion in interest and broken down into estimated annual payments of $310 million for 25 years. This total is subject to change based on interest rates and the time in which the bonds are paid.</p><p>CIRM was created after the passing of Proposition 71 in 2004, granting the institute $3 billion. Of that funding, $132 million remained as of October 2019. CIRM halted project applications in July of last year as a result of the available funds; without additional funding, CIRM is expected to end by 2023.</p><p>Proposition 14 would outline how CIRM spends its money. Funds would be used for the sole purpose of stem cell research and facility start-up costs, with 7.5% allocated for operational costs. Neurological disorder therapies and treatment methods would be allotted $1.5 billion; human clinical trials, treatments and cure facilities 1.5%; state-funded facilities under the Shared Labs Program 0.5%.\u00a0</p><p>CIRM would also change the way it operates if the proposition is passed. The number of members governing CIRM under the Independent Citizens' Oversight Committee would increase to 35 from its current 29. A fourth advising group to the ICOC, specific toward treatments and cures, would be added to the already-existing groups on medical research funding, research standards and facilities grants. CIRM would also establish a cap on full-time employees and training programs for undergraduate and graduate students interested in stem cell research.</p><p>Proponents of Proposition 14 include: UC Board of Regents</p><p>Opponents of Proposition 14 include: Center for Genetics and Society</p><p>Proposition 15, Tax on Commercial and Industrial Properties for Education and Local Government Funding Initiative:</p><p>If passed, Proposition 15 would tax all commercial and industrial properties -- with an exception for commercial agriculture -- based on their current market values, rather than their initial purchase prices. The shift would largely begin in the fiscal year 2022-23.</p><p>Properties are currently taxed at their purchase prices and experience annual increases of 2% or increases equal to the rate of inflation- whichever is lower.</p><p>Residential properties, agricultural properties and owners of commercial and industrial properties with combined value of $3 million or less would remain exempt from Proposition 15.\u00a0</p><p>The money gathered from Proposition 15 would first cover county costs of implementation and go to the state to supplement decreases in revenue resulting from increased tax deductions. The remaining revenue would then be split, as opposed to going into the General Fund- 60% to local governments and special districts and 40% to school districts and community colleges in a newly created Local School and Community College Property Tax Fund.</p><p>The further breakdown of money toward education would look like this: 89% for public and charter schools and county education offices; 11% for community colleges; and an additional minimum of $100 for all schools per full-time student (adjusted annually).</p><p>Proponents of Proposition 15 include: Democratic Party VP nominee Kamala Harris; Sen. Bernie Sanders; California State Sen. Scott Wiener; San Francisco Mayor London Breed; Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf; and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Both Los Angeles and San Francisco school districts support the proposition as well.\u00a0</p><p>Opponents to Proposition 15 include: California Black Chamber of Commerce; California Small Business Association; CaliforniaNAACP State Conference; California Hispanic Chambers of Commerce</p><p>Proposition 16, Repeal Proposition 209 Affirmative Action Amendment:</p><p>If passed, Proposition 16 would repeal Proposition 209, established in 1996, allowing public employment, public education and public contracting to take race, sex, color, ethnicity and national origin into account when selecting applicants for hirings and admissions.</p><p>To clarify, affirmative action in the form of racial quotas was deemed unconstitutional in 1978, under the landmark Supreme Court case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. The Supreme Court also stated that any forms of affirmative action must be reviewed under strict scrutiny.</p><p>The calls for affirmative action largely grow out of proponents' desire for more diverse college campuses. Following the implementation of Proposition 209 in 1998, the California State University saw two-thirds of the drop in minority enrollment across the state, and the University of California system witnessed a decline in underrepresented groups - Black, Latino, Pacific Islander and AmericanIndian - from 20% in 1995 to 15%.</p><p>Opponents of Proposition 16 argue that it would discriminate against more deserving students and applicants and judge individuals based on their ancestry rather than merit. Former California 12th Congressional District Rep. Tom Campbell mentioned that Asian Americans make up 15.3% of the California population, yet are 39.72% of UC enrollees. He added that this proposition would create tension between Asian-American and Black and Latino communities, as \"[t]he politics are inescapably racial.\"</p><p>Proponents of Proposition 16 include: Democratic Party VP nominee Kamala Harris; UC Board of Regents; CSU Chancellor Timothy P. White; and the Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus.</p><p>Opponents to Proposition 16 include: San Diego Asian Americans for Equality; Asian American Coalition for Education; and the Pacific Legal Foundation</p><p>Proposition 17, Voting Rights Restoration for Persons on Parole Amendment:</p><p>If passed, Proposition 17 would restore the right to vote for over 57,000 Californians on parole for felony convictions.</p><p>Currently, those on parole for felonies are ineligible to vote until their time on parole is completed. This would make California the 20th state to allow parolees to vote if passed. As of now, California is one of three states that requires people convicted of felonies to complete parole in order to have their voting status restored. In California, individuals are ineligible for voting if they are serving prison time at state or federal prisons, serving a state prison felony sentence, awaiting transfer for a felony conviction or have violated parole.</p><p>Proposition 17 would also address the mass incarceration of Blacks and Latinos. The Public Policy Institute of California found in a 2016 study that African-Americans, which comprise 6% of the state's adult population, made up 26% of those on parole. Similarly, Latinos comprise 35% of the adult population and make up 40% of those on parole. White individuals make up 26% of the adult population and make up 7% of those on parole.\u00a0</p><p>Opponents of Proposition 17 argue the right to vote is a privilege that shouldn't be restored until those who have committed felons have fully completed their sentencing.\u00a0</p><p>Proponents of Proposition 17 include: Democratic Party VP nominee Kamala Harris; state Sen. Scott Wiener; ACLU of California; and League of Women Voters of California</p><p>Opponents of Proposition 17 include: The Election Integrity Project California</p><p>Proposition 18, Primary Voting for 17-Year-Olds Amendment:</p><p>If passed, Proposition 18 would allow individuals to vote in the primary election at the age of 17 if they turn 18 before the general election.</p><p>Proposition 18 would make California the 19th state, in tandem with Washington D.C., that allows this demographic to vote in primary elections.</p><p>While there is no exact count for how many 17 year olds would become eligible voters, the Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health estimates there are over 2 million people in the state of California between the ages of 14 and 17.</p><p>The bill was first introduced by South San Francisco Assemblyman Gene Mullin in 2004. Last year, Mullin's son, San Mateo Assemblyman Kevin Mullin, reintroduced the bill. This was his sixth attempt, but it was the first time it had ever reached the Senate floor. It passed with a bipartisan vote of 29-2, with two Republican senators voting for the bill.</p><p>The California Association of Student Councils argues that the proposition would correct the \"disadvantage\" these young people face, as they are not permitted to have a say in who will be on the general election ballot. \"Without full exposure to the election process they are unable to submit their most educated vote in the general election,\" a statement from the association read.</p><p>The Election Integrity Project California, Inc. argues that because 17 year olds are still legally considered minors, they are heavily influenced by their parents and \"immediate superiors.\" \"This again makes it less likely that they would be expressing their own, independently thought-out choices were they to be allowed to vote,\" the group said.</p><p>Proponents of Proposition 18 include: The California Association of Student Councils</p><p>Opponents of Proposition 18 include: The Election Integrity Project California</p><p>Proposition 19, Property Tax Transfers, Exemptions, and Revenue for Wildfire Agencies and Counties Amendment:</p><p>If passed, Proposition 19 would allow eligible homeowners to transfer their property tax to a more expensive home anywhere in the state with an upward adjusted tax rate, rather than a new rate altogether. This would protect eligible homeowners from having to pay additional taxes for a property that is better suited for their needs. Older homeowners and those with disabilities can also move to a new property up to three times, rather than the current limit of once. Wildfire and natural disaster victims would not be eligible to move more than once.\u00a0</p><p>Currently, homeowners that are disabled, over the age of 55 or victims of natural disasters are eligible to transfer their property tax rates from their original property if they move into a new home of the same or lower value within the same county. For inherited properties, a lower property tax rate would only be possible when moved-into properties are used as primary residences and used only on the first $1 million between original purchase price and its market value.\u00a0</p><p>Inherited properties, such as family vacation homes and business properties, would be subject to reassessment if they were to exceed $1 million purchase price and market value difference. Any additional tax revenue would go toward the California Fire Response Fund and County Revenue Protection Fund. The CFRF would reimburse counties for revenue-related losses resulting from the proposition, and the CRPF would fund fire-suppression staffing and full-time station personnel.</p><p>Because of the proposition's proposed tax increases for inherited properties, the fiscal impact statement claims it would bring in tens of millions of dollars to local- and state-level governments, including school and fire protection funding.</p><p>Proponents argue that this measure will help victims of natural disasters find homes easier in an expensive market and also open up more family homes after older homeowners move to a smaller property. They also argue that this would close a loophole that allows wealthy, non-California residents to avoid paying a \"fair share of property taxes on vacation homes, income properties, and beachfront rentals they own in California.\"</p><p>Opponents argue that this measure is a revised version of a previous, failed proposition which was largely voted against, such as 2018's Proposition 5.</p><p>Proponents of Proposition 19 include: Gov. Gavin Newson; California Professional Firefighters; Californians for Disability Rights\u00a0</p><p>Opponents of Proposition 19 include: Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association</p><p>Proposition 20, Criminal Sentencing, Parole and DNA Collection Initiative:</p><p>If passed, Proposition 20 would add restrictions on parole eligibility for incarcerated people charged with non-violent offenses. In order to be granted parole, the parole review board would have to consider additional factors such as the person's family ties, age, mental wellbeing and attitude about the crime, along with the conditions of the crime.\u00a0</p><p>The proposition would also classify 51 offenses as violent crimes or offenses otherwise not eligible for parole. Crimes such as firearm theft, credit card fraud and organized retail crime would be defined as wobblers - crimes that could either be charged as a misdemeanor or a felony based on the circumstances. Certain wobblers or felonies -- shoplifting, prostituition with a minor, drug possession -- would require offenders to submit a DNA sample for state databases.\u00a0</p><p>The Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance estimate that this proposition would cost state and local correctional facilities tens of millions of dollars due to greater penalties for theft-related crimes. It would also cost state and local courts a few million dollars annually because of stricter probation qualifications and felony filings.</p><p>The state currently has a list of crimes permitted to shorter sentences under the 2016 Proposition 57, an effort to encourage incarcerated people to participate in rehabilitation programs. Among the offenses on the list are: spousal abuse; human traficking of a child; and rape.\u00a0</p><p>Proponents of Proposition 20 include: Orange County Board of Supervisors; Los Angeles Police Protective League; and Peace Officers Research Association of California</p><p>Opponents of Proposition 20 include: former Gov. Jerry Brown; ACLU of Northern California; and SEIU California State Council</p><p>Proposition 21, Local Rent Control Initiative:</p><p>If passed, Proposition 21 would permit local governments to create rent control for houses over 15 years old that are owned by landlords with more than two properties. These specifics modify the now-rejected Proposition 10 from 2018.</p><p>Proposition 21 would also allow properties under rent control to increase their monthly fees only \"up to 15% over three years from previous tenant's rent above any increase allowed by local ordinance,\" according to the proposition's ballot summary. The proposition would also\u00a0 supersede current local rent control rules.</p><p>The Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance estimates that this could reduce local and state revenues by tens of millions of dollars per year, contingent on local government action.\u00a0</p><p>Rent control in California has been a widely contested subject of interest - 56 of 58 California counties rejected rent control in 2018. However, 2018 polling revealed Californians were mostly in favor of rent control, but rejected the specifics of the former proposition.</p><p>Proponents believe that rent control will protect lower income and middle class citizens from being displaced from their homes, especially in high population cities with limited housing, like San Francisco.\u00a0</p><p>Opponents of the proposition argue that it would discourage the private sector from creating affordable housing units to the market. Lax regulations on permitting processes and zoning could make this possible.</p><p>Proponents of Proposition 21 include: Sen. Bernie Sanders; Rep. Barbara Lee; Rep. Maxine Waters; the AIDS Healthcare Foundation; Urban League of Los Angeles; and the Eviction Defense Network</p><p>Opponents of Proposition 21 include: President Sid Larkey of the California Rental Housing Association; Californians for Responsible Housing; State Building and Construction Trades Council of California; and the CaliforniaNAACP State Conference\u00a0</p><p>Proposition 22, App-Based Drivers as Contractors and Labor Policies Initiative:</p><p>If passed, Proposition 22 would define app-based rideshare and delivery drivers as independent contractors. Instead of following the state-wide benefits and protections employees receive, these companies would be required to provide alternative benefits that meet the specificities of their gig-workers, including \"minimum compensation and healthcare subsidies based on engaged driving time, vehicle insurance, safety training and sexual harassment policies,\" according to the state's official proposition summary.\u00a0</p><p>Proposition 22 would override California Assembly Bill 5 in regards to only app-based drivers. AB 5 is a response to the 2018 Supreme Court case Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court, in classifying gig-workers in the state as employees rather than independent contractors if the employer cannot prove each part of a three part test.</p><p>Under AB 5, if employers fail to prove these three components of the test, their employees are entitled to standard benefits such as minimum wage, health insurance and sick leave. Under Proposition 22, employers must classify app-based drivers as independent contractors unless the company sets drivers' hours, requires acceptance of specific ride or delivery requests, or restricts working for other companies.</p><p>App-based delivery services and ride-share programs such as Uber, Lyft and Doordash are asking for an exception, as their business structure depends on digitally based gig-workers who have the freedom to work as much or as little as they want.</p><p>This proposition may slightly increase state personal income tax revenue for rideshare and delivery company drivers and investors, according to a report by the Legislative Analyst. If these companies no longer have to pay for state employee benefits, lower delivery and rideshare rates could follow. Cheaper rates may appeal to more customers and generate more revenue for drivers.</p><p>Proponents of Proposition 22 include: CaliforniaNAACP State Conference; California Black Chamber of Commerce; California Hispanic Chambers of Commerce; CalAsian Chamber of Commerce; and the California Small Business Association</p><p>Opponents of Proposition 22 include: Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden; Democratic Party VP nominee Kamala Harris; Sen. Elizabeth Warren; California Labor Federation; and California State Council of Laborers</p><p>Proposition 23, Dialysis Clinic Requirements Initiative:</p><p>If passed, Proposition 23 would require Chronic Dialysis Clinics to have a doctor on-site during all hours of operation, though a nurse practitioner or physician's assistant can suffice if there is a proven shortage of doctors in the area.\u00a0</p><p>Additionally, clinics must: report dialysis-related infections to the California Department of Public Health and National Healthcare Safety Network every three months or face penalties up to $100,000; seek state approval before closing or reducing clinic hours; receive approval from the clinic's principal officer under penalty of perjury; and serve every patient regardless of their source of payment for care.</p><p>In California there are approximately 600 centers treating the state's almost 80,000 patients each month, according to the Legislative Analyst's Office. The office also found that roughly 75% of these centers are owned by two for-profit, private companies: Davita, Inc. and Fresenius Medical Care.</p><p>Proposition 23 builds off 2018's Proposition 8. The proposition, which was rejected by a margin of 2.4 million votes, intended to maximize center profits. According to Calmatters, a nonpartisan media organization that covers California policy, this proposition battle was the most expensive ballot campaign ever, with Davita, Inc. and Fresenius Medical Care spending a combined $111 million to go against the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers union in 2018.\u00a0</p><p>This proposition would likely increase the costs of state and local spending by tens of millions of dollars, as well as the cost of dialysis service due to staff demands, according to the Legislative Analyst's Office.</p><p>Proponents of Proposition 23 include: California Democratic Party; California Labor Federation</p><p>Opponents of Proposition 23 include: California Medical Association; Dialysis Patient Citizens; CaliforniaNAACP State Conference</p><p>Proposition 24, Consumer Personal Information Law and Agency Initiative:</p><p>If passed, Proposition 24 would expand upon the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, creating a new government agency - the Privacy Protection Agency, designed to regulate data privacy. Consumers would also be permitted to change incorrect information, prohibit data sharing and protect \"sensitive personal information.\" Business violation penalties would triple for data violations of minors 16 and under.\u00a0</p><p>The California Consumer Privacy Act initially gave California consumers a say in how much personal information businesses can collect from them. Since then, businesses must now disclose how personal data is used and stored, allow consumers to delete information, opt-out of their data being sold and cannot discriminate customers for doing so. Proposition 24 is seeking to further heighten these privacy measures.</p><p>Organizations such as Common Sense and Consumer Watchdog say this proposition would make California the example for privacy protection laws, especially as a state run by major tech companies.</p><p>\"Especially post-COVID, people are going to be more sensitive to privacy concerns,\" San Francisco-based real estate developer and chair of Californians for Consumer Privacy Alastair Mactaggar said in June. Mactaggar also heavily pushed for the 2018 privacy act as well.</p><p>Opponents argue that there simply hasn't been enough time to determine how effective the existing privacy act is yet, as it's taken effect this July.\u00a0</p><p>\"We fear Prop 24 would undermine existing California privacy regulations by making it more burdensome for consumers to prohibit Big Tech companies from selling their confidential data,\" Linda Sherry, Director of National Priorities at Consumer Action, said in a statement.</p><p>Proponents of Proposition 24 include: Common Sense; Consumer Watchdog</p><p>Opponents of Proposition 24 include: ACLU of California; Council on Islamic American Relations - California; Consumer Federation of California; Media Alliance\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Proposition 25, Replace Cash Bail with Risk Assessments Referendum:</p><p>If passed, Proposition 25 would replace the current cash bail system for detained criminal suspects with a risk assessment to determine the conditions of potential pretrial release.</p><p>Currently, criminal suspects are eligible for release before trial if cash bail is posted and promise to return to court for their trial and hearings. Bail, which is refunded to accommodating suspects regardless of trial outcomes, can be posted using personal funding or commercial bail bond agents that charge non-refundable premiums. There is no limit to how much premiums can cost, although the average is typically at 10%, according to the California Department of Insurance.</p><p>If passed, Proposition 25 would make California the first state to end cash bail, which will be replaced with assessments using \"tools [that] shall be demonstrated by scientific research to be accurate and reliable,\" according to the bill. In the assessments, suspected criminals would be categorized into one of three categories: low, medium and high risk. High-risk individuals would be refused pretrial release, low-risk would be allowed release given specific circumstances and medium-risk could be subject to either option depending on the court's rules. Those denied pretrial release would be allowed to argue the assessment before a judge.</p><p>Opponents to the bill argue that the potential tools to make assessments carry the risk of racial bias. \"While we all agree that bail reform is necessary, this costly, reckless plan will use racially-biased computer algorithms to decide who gets stuck in jail and who goes free. That's not right,\" Californians Against the Reckless Bail Scheme spokesman Jeff Clayton said.</p><p>Proponents of Proposition 25 include: Rep. Karen Bass; state Sen. Scott Wiener; California Democratic Party; and the League of Women Voters of California</p><p>Opponents of Proposition 25 include: CaliforniaNAACP State Conference; California Hispanic Chambers of Commerce; Crime Victims United of California; and the California Black Chamber of Commerce</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4773356</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610C-FRX1-DY7P-T0DV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4117\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Golden Gate Xpress: San Francisco State University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 3, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>San Francisco</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"78\"><className>Voting</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QThCQ0Y0MzY3RTkzNEVGNUFDOTVDQjdGQTEzNTI5MkY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTM3NjVDMkYzMzkwNDJFNDg3M0EyRTZERDBDRkFCNDY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Gavin Newsom warned the tech industry of impending federal regulation in a recent interview with Axios[1]. \"The current regulatory framework for these social media companies is going to pale compared to what it will be in a decade,\" he said in the interview. Newsom warned against inaction by social media companies like Facebook[2], Twitter[3], and YouTube[4]. \"By the current pace of change, they're gonna get steamrolled,\" he said.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[5] The calls for regulation of major tech companies \u2014 from Facebook to Google to Twitter \u2014 have grown louder than ever in recent months.Breaking up the big tech companies is even a core policy of Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren[6]. The latest voice to join in that outcry is California Gov. </p><p>Gavin Newsom. \"The current regulatory framework for these social media companies is going to pale compared to what it will be in a decade,\" Newsom told Axios in an interview for \"Axios on HBO\" published on Sunday[7]. \"The question for them is are they going to lead in that conversation and engage in it, or are they going to get completely steamrolled?\" Newsom said. \"By current pace in change, they're gonna get steamrolled.\"Newsom didn't echo Elizabeth Warren's call for breaking up the big tech companies, but he did say that we're \"walking down that path\" in regard to stronger government regulation. He also flatly criticized Facebook's decision not to remove a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \"I didn't understand. It's just fake \u2014 it's made up,\" he said. \"It's done for political purposes.\" Pelosi had more pointed criticism for Facebook back in May[8], in a speech at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. \"When something like Facebook says, 'I know this is false ... it's a lie \u2014 but we're showing it anyway,' well to me it says two things,\" Pelosi said. \"I was giving them the benefit of the doubt on Russia ... I thought it was unwittingly, but clearly they wittingly were accomplices and enablers of false information to go across Facebook.\" The full interview with Newsom is from the latest episode of

And we're going to admit and make the mistakes we make,\" Dorsey wrote on Twitter. \"This does not make us a 'arbiter of the truth'. Our intention is to connect the points of the contradictory statements and show the disputed information so that people can judge for themselves.\"<br/>The public dispute between the founders of Facebook and Twitter comes as the two companies prepare for the Trump administration's executive order that could eliminate the current protections of social media companies under the Communications Decency Act, which largely allows internet companies to set their own rules for content moderation.<br/>Section 230 of the 1996 Act states that digital service providers should not be treated as editorials of information published by others, has been the subject of years of debate between the technology industry and legislators. In January, Joe Biden, a Democratic candidate vying against Trump, said Section 230 should be abolished.<br/>According to a draft order, which may face legal challenges, Trump tries to strip social media of Section 230 protections if they remove user content or access without giving users adequate notice or opportunity to respond, or that is done in a way that is \"Inconsistent\" with their terms of service.<br/>It will also give the Federal Trade Commission more powers to respond to online bias allegations and will aim to restrict federal advertising on the platforms in accordance with its \"free speech principles\" approach.<br/>\"Big tech groups are doing everything in their enormous power to CENSURE before the 2020 election,\" Trump wrote on a Twitter post Wednesday night. \"If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I'll never let it happen!\"<br/>Facing increasing pressure to more monitor the content Trump posts, Twitter added Tuesday a fact-checking warning on two posts, suggesting users \"have all the information\" about their claims that voting throughmailing would increase voter fraud.<br/>Ellen Weintraub, commissioner of the US Federal Election Commission, presented a series of posts on Twitter wednesday showing ample evidence that \"there is simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud.\"<br/>Trump reacted angrily to Twitter's move, accused her of interfering in the election, and launching the threat of \"vigorously regulating\" social media companies, or even \"closing\" them, so he described it as censorship for conservative publications.<br/>Shares on Twitter recorded a 2 percent drop Thursday morning after falling 3-6 percent after Trump's threat on Wednesday.<br/>Twitter performs better than the us's more general stock market in recent months, with a 0.9 percent gain since the start of the year, while Wall Street's main index, the S&amp;P; 500, has already lost 5.6 percent.<br/>So far, Facebook has not tried to place any warnings on Trump's posts, despite years of controversy over the accuracy of the president's statements online.<br/>Zuckerberg said on Fox News that Facebook has \"a different policy\" and suggested that the president reconsider his executive order, before signing what may happen Thursday.<br/>AND BESIDES<br/>WALL STREET LOSES AFTER AMAGO<br/>Wall Street lost ground yesterday after a change in trend at the end of the session, with Facebook weighing on the market after Donald Trump announced that he would sign the social media decree and that on Friday he will hold a press conference on China. Twitter shares closed with a 4.4% drop and Facebook fell 1.6% following the news of the decree. The White House, after the market closes, said Trump had signed the order.<br/>CONCERNS BEIJING-WASHINGTON RELATIONSHIP<br/>Concerns about China-US relations may also have led to a downward shutdown. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow commented in an interview with CNBC that it may be necessary to treat Hong Kong as China in terms of trade and other matters. At the close of the market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 147.63 points, or 0.58%, at 25 thousand 400.64 units, the S&amp;P; 500 lost 6.4 points, or 0.21%, to 3 thousand 29.73 points and the Nasdaq fell 43.37 points, or 0.46%, to 9 thousand 368.99 units.<br/>With information from: Hannah Murphy, Kiran Stacey and Anna Gross.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-12488018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6018-5NJ1-JBJN-M4HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"911\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And I'll win again,' he added.</p><p>Conservatives have accused Google, Facebook and Twitter of discrimination against them while the companies argue they are cracking down on hate speech and misinformation.</p><p>Trump suggested the European Union had the right idea with its fines against Google - $5.1 billion in 2018 and $1.7 billion last year. And Apple paid $15 billion in back taxes to the Republic of Ireland in 2018. Facebook received a $122 million fine in 2017 from the EU's antitrust regulators.</p><p>'Every week you see them going after Facebook, and Apple, and all of these companies that are, you know, great companies,' Trump said.

'But we should be doing what they're doing.' </p><p>'They just think it's easy money,' he complained of the EU's actions. </p><p>He hinted he may have Attorney General Bill Barr look into it.</p><p>'We're maybe going to look at it differently. We have a great attorney general,' he said. 'We're going to look at it differently.' </p><p>He also charged the companies with holding a monopoly. </p><p>'They think there's a monopoly but I'm not sure that they think that, they just figure this is easy money,' Trump added. 'We'll sue Apple for $7 billion and we'll make a settlement or win the case.

But the legality of the fintech charter   a key issue for companies looking to get into banking   is still up in the air, and U.S. regulators are expected to provide more clarity on bank-fintech partnerships.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As 2020 approaches, the industry is watching three major areas in fintech: continued consolidation, legal and regulatory developments, and fintechs launching into banking.</p><p>Consolidation</p><p>The year began with three massive deals in the payments sector, and deal sizes remained elevated throughout the year.</p><p>First up, Fiserv Inc. announced its $21.79 billion purchase of First Data Corp., which closed in July. That consolidation preceded the industry's largest-ever deal when Fidelity National Information Services Inc. announced it would buy Worldpay Inc. for $35.36 billion. Many saw that deal, which also closed in July, as a defensive play. With scale increasingly crucial to success, Global Payments Inc. and Total System Services Inc. joined forces in a $22.15 billion deal that closed in September.</p><p>While strategic tie-ups commanded the year's largest deals, private equity continued to deploy large amounts of dry powder.</p><p>The sector's fourth-largest deal saw London Stock Exchange Group PLC agree to acquire Refinitiv US Holdings Inc. for $16.55 billion. Refinitiv is a data analytics platform jointly owned by Thomson Reuters Corp. and The Blackstone Group Inc.</p><p>Fintech deal values have soared in recent years. Nearly half of the largest fintech deals on record were struck within the past two years, according to an S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence analysis earlier this year. Industry participants do not expect deal sizes to taper off in the near future.</p><p>Read more: Analysts see largest fintech merger of all time as 'defensive' play</p><p>Courts and regulation</p><p>In 2019, the Federal Reserve proposed a major overhaul of the U.S. payments infrastructure for the first time in decades. The system, called FedNow, will move funds in real time instead of delaying their availability.</p><p>When launched, FedNow will challenge a competing service already offered by The Clearing House, a private company owned by many of the country's largest banks. But it seems the Fed will have to work with The Clearing House for its real-time payments network to succeed, and FedNow is not expected to launch until 2023 or 2024.</p><p>Also this year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. jointly proposed a Madden fix, one of the biggest legal overhangs for digital lenders since 2015.</p><p>Uncertainty came from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Madden v. Midland, which said that fintech company Midland Funding LLC did not benefit from the national banking law that preempts state interest rate laws, even though the loans in question were originally issued by a national bank. Many marketplace lenders depend on nationally chartered banks to fund loans, making the \"valid-when-made\" doctrine crucial to their business.</p><p>The OCC and FDIC's proposed rule would clarify that when a national bank or savings association sells, assigns, or otherwise transfers a loan, the interest rate allowed prior to the transfer continues to be permissible after the loan changes hands. The proposal would provide greater assurance to nonbanks about the regulatory protections those loans would enjoy from state usury laws.</p><p>While digital lenders caught a glimpse of regulatory clarity this year, the OCC's fintech charter, which was announced in July 2018, remains under legal scrutiny.</p><p>In October, a federal judge in New York ruled that the OCC cannot issue bank charters to companies that do not take deposits. The regulator has challenged the lower court ruling, and the case is now making its way through the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p>Until a final decision is made, no fintech can legally apply for the charter. That final ruling might ultimately come from the Supreme Court.</p><p>Read more: Fate of controversial US fintech charter could lie with Supreme Court</p><p>Fintechs jump into banking</p><p>The lack of a fintech charter has not stopped companies from pursuing full-service national bank charters or industrial loan company charters to enter the banking realm.</p><p>That fintechs are looking to become banks is not a new phenomenon, but the recent wave of fintechs have had difficulty securing a charter. This year saw Robinhood Markets Inc.'s already-withdrawn full-service bank charter application with the OCC and Tokyo-based Rakuten Inc.'s and Interactive Brokers Group Inc.'s applications for industrial bank charters with the FDIC. Executives from at least three additional fintech companies indicated they might pursue bank charters.</p><p>In 2018, digital banks found themselves paying top dollar in a race to attract customers. Although high-yield savings account rates declined along with the Fed lowering interest rates, the fight for deposits continued.</p><p>Joining that fight are a number of fintechs that launched cash management or digital high-yield savings accounts in 2019. Some of these companies include Betterment LLC, Green Dot Corp., Robinhood and Brex Inc. Several fintechs, like PayPal Holdings Inc. and Stripe Inc., also launched debit or credit cards.</p><p>Next year might be the year a fintech is approved for a bank charter, a move that could open the floodgates to more applications. The industry could also see the rise of big tech in the banking space, as the likes of Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google LLC inked partnerships with financial companies, and Facebook Inc. launched Libra and Facebook Pay in 2019.</p><p>Read more: Fintechs venture further into bank territory</p><p>From Jan. 1 to Dec. 27, the SNL U.S. Financial Technology index rose 41.66%.</p><p>A recent report from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence explores why fintechs are increasingly offering products outside their traditional bailiwicks and, in many cases, becoming more bank-like. The report provides a comprehensive overview of important trends developing across several fintech sectors, including insurtech, digital lending and digital banking, among others.

But the legality of the fintech charter   a key issue for companies looking to get into banking   is still up in the air, and U.S. regulators are expected to provide more clarity on bank-fintech partnerships.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As 2020 approaches, the industry is watching three major areas in fintech: continued consolidation, legal and regulatory developments, and fintechs launching into banking.</p><p>Consolidation</p><p>The year began with three massive deals in the payments sector, and deal sizes remained elevated throughout the year.</p><p>First up, Fiserv Inc. announced its $21.79 billion purchase of First Data Corp., which closed in July. That consolidation preceded the industry's largest-ever deal when Fidelity National Information Services Inc. announced it would buy Worldpay Inc. for $35.36 billion. Many saw that deal, which also closed in July, as a defensive play. With scale increasingly crucial to success, Global Payments Inc. and Total System Services Inc. joined forces in a $22.15 billion deal that closed in September.</p><p>While strategic tie-ups commanded the year's largest deals, private equity continued to deploy large amounts of dry powder.</p><p>The sector's fourth-largest deal saw London Stock Exchange Group PLC agree to acquire Refinitiv US Holdings Inc. for $16.55 billion. Refinitiv is a data analytics platform jointly owned by Thomson Reuters Corp. and The Blackstone Group Inc.</p><p>Fintech deal values have soared in recent years. Nearly half of the largest fintech deals on record were struck within the past two years, according to an S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence analysis earlier this year. Industry participants do not expect deal sizes to taper off in the near future.</p><p>Read more: Analysts see largest fintech merger of all time as 'defensive' play</p><p>Courts and regulation</p><p>In 2019, the Federal Reserve proposed a major overhaul of the U.S. payments infrastructure for the first time in decades. The system, called FedNow, will move funds in real time instead of delaying their availability.</p><p>When launched, FedNow will challenge a competing service already offered by The Clearing House, a private company owned by many of the country's largest banks. But it seems the Fed will have to work with The Clearing House for its real-time payments network to succeed, and FedNow is not expected to launch until 2023 or 2024.</p><p>Also this year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. jointly proposed a Madden fix, one of the biggest legal overhangs for digital lenders since 2015.</p><p>Uncertainty came from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Madden v. Midland, which said that fintech company Midland Funding LLC did not benefit from the national banking law that preempts state interest rate laws, even though the loans in question were originally issued by a national bank. Many marketplace lenders depend on nationally chartered banks to fund loans, making the \"valid-when-made\" doctrine crucial to their business.</p><p>The OCC and FDIC's proposed rule would clarify that when a national bank or savings association sells, assigns, or otherwise transfers a loan, the interest rate allowed prior to the transfer continues to be permissible after the loan changes hands. The proposal would provide greater assurance to nonbanks about the regulatory protections those loans would enjoy from state usury laws.</p><p>While digital lenders caught a glimpse of regulatory clarity this year, the OCC's fintech charter, which was announced in July 2018, remains under legal scrutiny.</p><p>In October, a federal judge in New York ruled that the OCC cannot issue bank charters to companies that do not take deposits. The regulator has challenged the lower court ruling, and the case is now making its way through the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p>Until a final decision is made, no fintech can legally apply for the charter. That final ruling might ultimately come from the Supreme Court.</p><p>Read more: Fate of controversial US fintech charter could lie with Supreme Court</p><p>Fintechs jump into banking</p><p>The lack of a fintech charter has not stopped companies from pursuing full-service national bank charters or industrial loan company charters to enter the banking realm.</p><p>That fintechs are looking to become banks is not a new phenomenon, but the recent wave of fintechs have had difficulty securing a charter. This year saw Robinhood Markets Inc.'s already-withdrawn full-service bank charter application with the OCC and Tokyo-based Rakuten Inc.'s and Interactive Brokers Group Inc.'s applications for industrial bank charters with the FDIC. Executives from at least three additional fintech companies indicated they might pursue bank charters.</p><p>In 2018, digital banks found themselves paying top dollar in a race to attract customers. Although high-yield savings account rates declined along with the Fed lowering interest rates, the fight for deposits continued.</p><p>Joining that fight are a number of fintechs that launched cash management or digital high-yield savings accounts in 2019. Some of these companies include Betterment LLC, Green Dot Corp., Robinhood and Brex Inc. Several fintechs, like PayPal Holdings Inc. and Stripe Inc., also launched debit or credit cards.</p><p>Next year might be the year a fintech is approved for a bank charter, a move that could open the floodgates to more applications. The industry could also see the rise of big tech in the banking space, as the likes of Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google LLC inked partnerships with financial companies, and Facebook Inc. launched Libra and Facebook Pay in 2019.</p><p>Read more: Fintechs venture further into bank territory</p><p>From Jan. 1 to Dec. 27, the SNL U.S. Financial Technology index rose 41.66%.</p><p>A recent report from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence explores why fintechs are increasingly offering products outside their traditional bailiwicks and, in many cases, becoming more bank-like. The report provides a comprehensive overview of important trends developing across several fintech sectors, including insurtech, digital lending and digital banking, among others.

But the legality of the fintech charter   a key issue for companies looking to get into banking   is still up in the air, and U.S. regulators are expected to provide more clarity on bank-fintech partnerships.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As 2020 approaches, the industry is watching three major areas in fintech: continued consolidation, legal and regulatory developments, and fintechs launching into banking.</p><p>Consolidation</p><p>The year began with three massive deals in the payments sector, and deal sizes remained elevated throughout the year.</p><p>First up, Fiserv Inc. announced its $21.79 billion purchase of First Data Corp., which closed in July. That consolidation preceded the industry's largest-ever deal when Fidelity National Information Services Inc. announced it would buy Worldpay Inc. for $35.36 billion. Many saw that deal, which also closed in July, as a defensive play. With scale increasingly crucial to success, Global Payments Inc. and Total System Services Inc. joined forces in a $22.15 billion deal that closed in September.</p><p>While strategic tie-ups commanded the year's largest deals, private equity continued to deploy large amounts of dry powder.</p><p>The sector's fourth-largest deal saw London Stock Exchange Group PLC agree to acquire Refinitiv US Holdings Inc. for $16.55 billion. Refinitiv is a data analytics platform jointly owned by Thomson Reuters Corp. and The Blackstone Group Inc.</p><p>Fintech deal values have soared in recent years. Nearly half of the largest fintech deals on record were struck within the past two years, according to an S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence analysis earlier this year. Industry participants do not expect deal sizes to taper off in the near future.</p><p>Read more: Analysts see largest fintech merger of all time as 'defensive' play</p><p>Courts and regulation</p><p>In 2019, the Federal Reserve proposed a major overhaul of the U.S. payments infrastructure for the first time in decades. The system, called FedNow, will move funds in real time instead of delaying their availability.</p><p>When launched, FedNow will challenge a competing service already offered by The Clearing House, a private company owned by many of the country's largest banks. But it seems the Fed will have to work with The Clearing House for its real-time payments network to succeed, and FedNow is not expected to launch until 2023 or 2024.</p><p>Also this year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. jointly proposed a Madden fix, one of the biggest legal overhangs for digital lenders since 2015.</p><p>Uncertainty came from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Madden v. Midland, which said that fintech company Midland Funding LLC did not benefit from the national banking law that preempts state interest rate laws, even though the loans in question were originally issued by a national bank. Many marketplace lenders depend on nationally chartered banks to fund loans, making the \"valid-when-made\" doctrine crucial to their business.</p><p>The OCC and FDIC's proposed rule would clarify that when a national bank or savings association sells, assigns, or otherwise transfers a loan, the interest rate allowed prior to the transfer continues to be permissible after the loan changes hands. The proposal would provide greater assurance to nonbanks about the regulatory protections those loans would enjoy from state usury laws.</p><p>While digital lenders caught a glimpse of regulatory clarity this year, the OCC's fintech charter, which was announced in July 2018, remains under legal scrutiny.</p><p>In October, a federal judge in New York ruled that the OCC cannot issue bank charters to companies that do not take deposits. The regulator has challenged the lower court ruling, and the case is now making its way through the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p>Until a final decision is made, no fintech can legally apply for the charter. That final ruling might ultimately come from the Supreme Court.</p><p>Read more: Fate of controversial US fintech charter could lie with Supreme Court</p><p>Fintechs jump into banking</p><p>The lack of a fintech charter has not stopped companies from pursuing full-service national bank charters or industrial loan company charters to enter the banking realm.</p><p>That fintechs are looking to become banks is not a new phenomenon, but the recent wave of fintechs have had difficulty securing a charter. This year saw Robinhood Markets Inc.'s already-withdrawn full-service bank charter application with the OCC and Tokyo-based Rakuten Inc.'s and Interactive Brokers Group Inc.'s applications for industrial bank charters with the FDIC. Executives from at least three additional fintech companies indicated they might pursue bank charters.</p><p>In 2018, digital banks found themselves paying top dollar in a race to attract customers. Although high-yield savings account rates declined along with the Fed lowering interest rates, the fight for deposits continued.</p><p>Joining that fight are a number of fintechs that launched cash management or digital high-yield savings accounts in 2019. Some of these companies include Betterment LLC, Green Dot Corp., Robinhood and Brex Inc. Several fintechs, like PayPal Holdings Inc. and Stripe Inc., also launched debit or credit cards.</p><p>Next year might be the year a fintech is approved for a bank charter, a move that could open the floodgates to more applications.

That consolidation preceded the industry's largest-ever deal when Fidelity National Information Services Inc. announced it would buy Worldpay Inc. for $35.36 billion. Many saw that deal, which also closed in July, as a defensive play. With scale increasingly crucial to success, Global Payments Inc. and Total System Services Inc. joined forces in a $22.15 billion deal that closed in September.</p><p>While strategic tie-ups commanded the year's largest deals, private equity continued to deploy large amounts of dry powder.</p><p>The sector's fourth-largest deal saw London Stock Exchange Group PLC agree to acquire Refinitiv US Holdings Inc. for $16.55 billion. Refinitiv is a data analytics platform jointly owned by Thomson Reuters Corp. and The Blackstone Group Inc.</p><p>Fintech deal values have soared in recent years. Nearly half of the largest fintech deals on record were struck within the past two years, according to an S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence analysis earlier this year. Industry participants do not expect deal sizes to taper off in the near future.</p><p>Read more: Analysts see largest fintech merger of all time as 'defensive' play</p><p>Courts and regulation</p><p>In 2019, the Federal Reserve proposed a major overhaul of the U.S. payments infrastructure for the first time in decades. The system, called FedNow, will move funds in real time instead of delaying their availability.</p><p>When launched, FedNow will challenge a competing service already offered by The Clearing House, a private company owned by many of the country's largest banks. But it seems the Fed will have to work with The Clearing House for its real-time payments network to succeed, and FedNow is not expected to launch until 2023 or 2024.</p><p>Also this year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. jointly proposed a Madden fix, one of the biggest legal overhangs for digital lenders since 2015.</p><p>Uncertainty came from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Madden v. Midland, which said that fintech company Midland Funding LLC did not benefit from the national banking law that preempts state interest rate laws, even though the loans in question were originally issued by a national bank. Many marketplace lenders depend on nationally chartered banks to fund loans, making the \"valid-when-made\" doctrine crucial to their business.</p><p>The OCC and FDIC's proposed rule would clarify that when a national bank or savings association sells, assigns, or otherwise transfers a loan, the interest rate allowed prior to the transfer continues to be permissible after the loan changes hands. The proposal would provide greater assurance to nonbanks about the regulatory protections those loans would enjoy from state usury laws.</p><p>While digital lenders caught a glimpse of regulatory clarity this year, the OCC's fintech charter, which was announced in July 2018, remains under legal scrutiny.</p><p>In October, a federal judge in New York ruled that the OCC cannot issue bank charters to companies that do not take deposits. The regulator has challenged the lower court ruling, and the case is now making its way through the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p>Until a final decision is made, no fintech can legally apply for the charter. That final ruling might ultimately come from the Supreme Court.</p><p>Read more: Fate of controversial US fintech charter could lie with Supreme Court</p><p>Fintechs jump into banking</p><p>The lack of a fintech charter has not stopped companies from pursuing full-service national bank charters or industrial loan company charters to enter the banking realm.</p><p>That fintechs are looking to become banks is not a new phenomenon, but the recent wave of fintechs have had difficulty securing a charter. This year saw Robinhood Markets Inc.'s already-withdrawn full-service bank charter application with the OCC and Tokyo-based Rakuten Inc.'s and Interactive Brokers Group Inc.'s applications for industrial bank charters with the FDIC. Executives from at least three additional fintech companies indicated they might pursue bank charters.</p><p>In 2018, digital banks found themselves paying top dollar in a race to attract customers. Although high-yield savings account rates declined along with the Fed lowering interest rates, the fight for deposits continued.</p><p>Joining that fight are a number of fintechs that launched cash management or digital high-yield savings accounts in 2019. Some of these companies include Betterment LLC, Green Dot Corp., Robinhood and Brex Inc. Several fintechs, like PayPal Holdings Inc. and Stripe Inc., also launched debit or credit cards.</p><p>Next year might be the year a fintech is approved for a bank charter, a move that could open the floodgates to more applications. The industry could also see the rise of big tech in the banking space, as the likes of Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google LLC inked partnerships with financial companies, and Facebook Inc. launched Libra and Facebook Pay in 2019.</p><p>Read more: Fintechs venture further into bank territory</p><p>From Jan. 1 to Dec. 27, the SNL U.S. Financial Technology index rose 41.66%.</p><p>A recent report from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence explores why fintechs are increasingly offering products outside their traditional bailiwicks and, in many cases, becoming more bank-like. The report provides a comprehensive overview of important trends developing across several fintech sectors, including insurtech, digital lending and digital banking, among others.

It was a draining year if you were plugged into social media, with conflicts at home and overseas juxtaposed against the soaring wealth of the San Francisco Bay Area, home to an industry that has become one of the dominant forces in the world. As we inch closer to what will likely be the top of the Third Tech Boom-Bust Cycle since the web changed the world, technology has never been more present in our day-to-day lives, for better or worse.</p><p><br/> But for all the conflict that marked the year in tech \u2014 a blatant power grab by the company that was actually voted 'Worst Company in America,' the uneasiness that FCC Commissioner Tom Wheeler might finally reward his old buddies in the cable industry with favorable internet regulation[1], and a series of public-relations disasters[2] by Uber that left a black mark on the next dominant tech company \u2014 there were plenty of bright spots, especially among the areas that Gigaom follows closely.<br/> Big Data has turned into big money[3] and the rise of deep learning and artificial intelligence could transform computing. The cloud is the norm[4], and the largest companies in tech are going all-in on cloud computing as new startups promise to make complex app development even simpler. The internet of things, a concept we have evangelized for years, went from buzzword-just-around-the-corner to the cornerstone of planning[5] from tech companies big and small heading into 2015.<br/> The king of the hill \u2014 Apple \u2014 unveiled what could be its next-generation product category breakthrough[6] amid the growing popularity of wearable computers. Microsoft showed that it is at last ready to enter the mobile computing era with the refreshing emergence of Satya Nadella[7] as its third-ever CEO.

A popular backlash, egged on by the likes of comedian John Oliver and fanned by four million internet comments[13], caused the political winds to shift. All of a sudden, President Barack Obama called to implement real 'Title II' net neutrality[14], and the FCC abruptly cooled on both the fast lanes and the Comcast merger. Going into 2015, consumers face an unexpectedly positive outlook for faster internet and real broadband competition. - Jeff John Roberts, Senior Writer<br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-privacy-eye.png\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-privacy-eye.png</url><br/>Surveillance fight ramps up<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaompaidcontent.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/google-surveillance-2-o.jpg\">https://gigaompaidcontent.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/google-surveillance-2-o.jpg</url><br/>When it comes to online surveillance, the most significant developments of the year were probably the striking-down by Europe's top court of the E.U. Data Retention Directive, and the aftermath of that decision. The court said[15] the directive, which forced telecom providers to store metadata about their users' communications for surveillance purposes, was incompatible with the rights to privacy and the protection of personal data. The U.K. responded with a barely debated 'emergency law' (months after the court's decision) that not only made it possible for the British surveillance regime to continue, but expanded it[16] to take in communication over social networks and more. Sweden, too, doubled down on data retention, leading one ISP there to offer free VPN access[17] to its customers. Australia is now also introducing data retention[18]. Meanwhile, the United Nations has begun condemning[19] the practice on human rights grounds. - David Meyer, Senior Writer<br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-deep-mobile.png\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-deep-mobile.png</url><br/>The resurgence of T-Mobile<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/photo-5.jpg\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/photo-5.jpg</url> The Paramount Theater in Seattle played host to T-Mobile's Uncarrier 5.0 event in June.<br/><br/>If there were a telecom horoscope, 2014 would be the year of T-Mobile[20]. The carrier was the object of other carriers' desires \u2014 with Sprint and Softbank[21] as well as French ISP Iliad[22] angling to buy the company \u2014 and it became a symbol for competition[23] in the U.S., with regulators making it clear that they don't want to see fewer than four nationwide operators.<br/>T-Mobile, however, didn't just sit idly while the industry fought over its future. It became a competitive force in its own right, as well a thorn in the sides of ATT[24] and Verizon[25]. It launched several unique initiatives, such as an iPhone loaner program[26]. T-Mo even killed \u2014 or at least maimed \u2014 one of the mobile industry's sacred cows, announcing that in January 2015 it will start allowing customers to hold onto their unused data each month[27].<br/> Those moves helped T-Mobile bring in 6.2 million new connections in the first nine months of the year, giving it a total of 52.9 million subscribers and putting it within spitting distance of overtaking Sprint. But most significantly, T-Mobile is changing the mobile industry as a whole. Two years ago, there was no difference between a two-year contract and a postpaid smartphone plan. But thanks to T-Mobile[28], all four major carriers are retreating from contracts and subsidies[29] and charging customers lower rates because of it. - Kevin Fitchard, Senior Writer       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-deep-apple.png\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-deep-apple.png</url><br/>Apple's wild year<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/455044594_10.jpg\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/455044594_10.jpg</url>Apple CEO Tim Cook announces the Apple Watch during an Apple special event.<br/><br/>Apple[30] is still the world's most valuable company by market cap, and although it doesn't sell the most smartphones[31], it makes the most money.

But the biggest Apple story this year is actually next year's story: In September, Apple revealed its vision of wearable computing in the form of the Apple Watch[34].

A peek at the Google Play Store shows that the required Android Wear app for these watches has between 500,000 and a million downloads[36].

Yup, it took Microsoft's board six months to find the next CEO right on its own Redmond, Washington campus. Satya Nadella was named the company's third-ever CEO[41] in February 2014.<br/> Nadella didn't take long to make his presence felt. In March, he hosted the public debut of Microsoft's Office for iPad[42], stressing the company's plan to support its applications on all devices, even those that don't run Windows, in effect\u00a0decoupling Office from Windows.[43]<br/> Nadella also pushed the Azure cloud hard. In a nod to changing realities, the company even deleted 'Windows' from its cloud branding so Windows Azure became Microsoft Azure. If anyone doubted that Microsoft Azure[44] would compete head-on with Amazon Web Services in public cloud, they should be sure of it after Nadella's first year at the helm. - Barb Darrow, Senior Writer       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-deep-learning.png\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-deep-learning.png</url><br/>The deep learning explosion<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/8079013134_ae07b6e6d2_o.jpg\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/8079013134_ae07b6e6d2_o.jpg</url>Google acquired the Jetpac team in August.<br/><br/>The groundwork was laid in 2013, but 2014 was the year of deep learning.

Both are probably somewhat true, but what's undeniable is the pace of change in the field now that some of the world's largest companies are funding it \u2014 last year's advances were quickly overshadowed[54], and breakthroughs came from all over the place, sometimes simultaneously[55]. - Derrick Harris, Senior Writer       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-cloud.png\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-cloud.png</url><br/>The year of the container<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/photo_ben-golub_aws-3.jpg\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/photo_ben-golub_aws-3.jpg</url> Ben Golub, CEO of Docker<br/><br/>If you're an avid follower of cloud computing, you've probably heard about the container[56] and how it can help developers craft applications more easily as well as simplify IT operations. San Francisco-based Docker has been at the forefront of popularizing[57] the container, which is a type of virtualization technology that lets a single Linux operating system kernel run multiple applications without them impacting one another. What made Docker so popular (it landed $40 million[58] in the fall and is supposedly valued at $400 million[59]) is that it makes it simpler to move these virtual shells \u2014 each containing parts of an application \u2014 across multiple environments like different clouds or even bare-metal servers. While Docker got a lot of attention this year from big tech companies \u2014\u00a0Google[60], VMware[61] and IBM[62] are all supporters \u2014 one of its partners, CoreOS, recently decided to launch its own take on container technology, dubbed Rocket[63].

The very next day, CBS[67] actually went ahead and launched[68] its own online subscription service. And hours later, Univision revealed[69] that it wants to launch such an online service as well. That week may well be the beginning of the great unbundling, or at the least the week during which TV execs admitted that they can't keep doing business as usual in the face of a seismic shift in viewing patterns: Just weeks before HBO, Univision and CBS revealed their plans, Netflix[70] disclosed that its average subscriber already streams 90 minutes every single day[71]. - Janko Roettgers, Senior Writer       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-uber.png\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-uber.png</url><br/>Uber comes of age<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/457199178.jpg\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/457199178.jpg</url> In this photo illustration the new smart phone taxi app 'Uber' shows how to select a pick up location next to a taxi lane on October 14 in Madrid.

It continued its international expansion and picked up the pace, moving into China and India, and expanding its footprint in Europe. It hired Obama's former campaign manager[72], David Plouffe, to manage its own public image. Not all was hunky dory, though. Uber's elaborate scheme to steal drivers from Lyft[73]\u00a0became public, along with its threats to dig into journalists' personal lives.

But I think one of the biggest stories of the year has been the launch and subsequent stumbles of First Look Media, the new venture funded by eBay[78] billionaire Pierre Omidyar.<br/> Although the launch of First Look was announced in late 2013, after the news was leaked to BuzzFeed[79], the site didn't even have a name, and didn't actually launch until well into 2014, with the introduction of a 'magazine'[80] called The Intercept, run by investigative blogger Glenn Greenwald.<br/> At the time, Omidyar said The Intercept would be the first of a series[81] of similar magazines run by different journalists, including one driven by former Rolling Stone political writer Matt Taibbi, called The Racket. Those plans soon hit a speed bump, however, as stories emerged[82] of micromanagement by Omidyar's executives, and Taibbi eventually left \u2014 followed by Intercept editor John Cook, who returned to Gawker after co-writing a piece about the issues[83] at First Look.<br/> The upheaval has led some to wonder whether the company will ever achieve the goals that Omidyar outlined when he announced that he was committing $250 million to it, and whether newer ventures such as former NPR editor Andy Carvin's social-journalism project[84] \u2014 called Reportedly \u2014 will be able to rely on the organization for continued support. But at least they are a sign that there is still life in Omidyar's vision, even if it has been a bumpy ride so far. - Mathew Ingram, Senior Writer       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-tablet.png\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-tablet.png</url><br/>Ebook subscriptions take off<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/m526346.jpeg\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/m526346.jpeg</url><br/>'Netflix for ebooks' actually started to look like a viable concept in 2014: Amazon[85]\u00a0unveiled[86] its ebook subscription service Kindle Unlimited in July. Meanwhile, startups Scribd and Oyster, which had both launched in 2013, expanded their collections in 2014, nabbing a\u00a0couple big-5 publishers (HarperCollins, Simon Schuster[87]) that Amazon hasn't been able to get. And Macmillan CEO John Sargent praised ebook subscription services[88] as a potential way that publishers can challenge Amazon's dominance in the ebook market. That means that when you use these services, you'll actually be able to find some big books you want to read (or, in Scribd's case, listen to \u2014 the service added audiobooks[89] in November). It's unlikely that all three of these services will survive, but for now they are competing against each other with various holiday deals, so it's a good time to give one of them a try. - Laura Owen, News Editor       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-nest.png\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/year-in-review-nest.png</url><br/>Google acquires Nest and Dropcam<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/462992803.jpg\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/462992803.jpg</url><br/> I wanted to call Apple's debut of HomeKit[90] the most important news for the internet of things this year, but since its debut in June we haven't seen products launch, and won't until CES in 2015. Instead, I think the biggest news item was Google's announced acquisition of Nest[91] for $3.2 billion in January and subsequent acquisition of Dropcam[92] for $550 million in June. The Nest deal put a spotlight on the market and convinced entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and big-name consumer brands that there was a there there in the smart home.

Yes: Tesla's 'gigafactory,' which will produce batteries for its third car as well as for the power grid, could more than double[94] the entire world's lithium ion battery production.<br/> At the start of the year Tesla raised $2 billion to help fund the factory. Later in the year, it secured Panasonic as a crucial partner. During the summer, Tesla CEO Elon Musk started playing up the search for a site \u2014 squeezing cities and states for as many incentives as he could get \u2014 and in the fall finally settled on Nevada[95], at a site just outside of Reno, which we scoped out[96].

In the first, Silicon Valley firms make all the running as they create new markets and eviscerate weak firms in sleepy industries. This has been the story until now. Tech firms have captured 42 per cent of the rise in the value of America's stockmarket since 2014 as investors forecast they will win an ever-bigger share of corporate profits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new, terrifying phrase has entered the lexicon of business jargon: being \"Amazoned\".</p><p>The second phase favours the incumbents, Ms Rometty believes, and is starting about now. They summon the will to adapt, innovate to create new, digital products and increase efficiency. The schema is plainly self-serving. IBM is itself fighting for survival against cloud-based tech rivals and most of its clients are conventional firms. Yet she is correct that incumbents in many industries are at last getting their acts together on technology.</p><p>Enough time has elapsed for even the dopiest to see the threat. It is 11 years since Netflix began streaming video and five since Tesla unveiled the Model S. The evisceration by tech firms of some mid-sized businesses, such as department-store retail, has concentrated minds. Lagging share prices have helped. In 2017, Ford fired its boss, Mark Fields, despite near -record profits. Its board concluded he was complacent about technological change.</p><p>Taking a sample of America's 20 most valuable non-tech firms, 14 now have a digital dimension to their strategies. Some blue-chip firms are mixing fashionable cocktails of e-commerce, big data and artificial-intelligence (AI) initiatives. But others are making comprehensive, multi-billion-dollar bets.</p><p>General Motors is developing a suite of electric and autonomous vehicles. Wal-Mart is in the midst of a massive online shopping push. Investors view such initiatives as central to these firms' prospects.</p><p>A round of mergers and acquisitions has kicked off as firms respond to the threat from Silicon Valley. On December 14, Walt Disney said it would spend $US66 billion ($84.3bn) buying most of 21st Century Fox. One motivation for the deal is to counter the menace of streaming video services, most notably those of Netflix and Amazon. In 2019, Disney will stop distributing new films through Netflix and launch its own streaming services.</p><p>On December 12, Westfield and Unibail, a pair of huge operators of shopping malls, joined -forces with two main aims: to bulk up in response to e-commerce and to build a global brand with a digital presence.</p><p>Incumbents have lots going for them. They own 80 per cent of the commercial world's data, as Ms Rometty has noted. If AI is set to change civilisation by using data to make better decisions, most of the historical datasets about, say, jet-engine performance or clothing supply chains belong to established firms, beyond the reach of Amazon and Facebook. Incumbents have vast resources: among S&amp;P 500 firms, their total cash flow is four times that of tech firms' and 18 times what venture capitalists invest each year.</p><p>Established giants also enjoy barriers to entry such as strong brands and lobbying skills, the latter being especially crucial in America's money-driven political system. Also on December 14, American regulators abolished \"net neutrality\" rules requiring telecoms carriers to treat all internet traffic equally - a victory for conventional telecoms and cable firms. Silicon Valley faces a global regulatory \"techlash\" over issues such as privacy and tax.</p><p>A typical approach by conventional firms is a blend of bolt-on acquisitions of start-ups and organic investment in new technologies. GM has invested in Lyft, a ride-sharing firm, and developed electric engines. On December 13, Target, which operates discount stores, bought Shipt, an online--delivery platform. Wal-Mart has bought Jet.com, an e-commerce firm. Western banks have been busy buying fintech firms, although the cleverest incumbents in finance are Asian. Ping An, a Chinese insurance firm, has 265 million users for its app. DBS, Southeast Asia's biggest lender, has set up online banks in India and Indonesia.</p><p>A few firms are opting for huge deals. On December 3, CVS, a pharmacy and healthcare benefits manager, said it would pay $US77bn for Aetna, a health-insurance company. The idea is to bulk up and lock in customers before Amazon enters the business of selling medicines. Within the tech industry, IBM is not the only mature firm trying to adapt. In March, Intel bought -Mobileye, which specialises in chips and software for driverless cars, for $US15bn.</p><p>Conventional wisdom says incumbent firms are timid about technological change, scared to cannibalise profits and trapped in an unimaginative mindset.</p><p>In 1997, Clayton Christensen laid out this view in The Innovator's Dilemma. Kodak, which folded after failing to see that camera film would become obsolete, is the classic example. Yet for every Kodak there is a Marconi, which goes too far, too fast. Formerly called GEC, it was Britain's largest industrial firm in the 1990s but collapsed after wrecking its balance sheet with acquisitions of fashionable but flaky tech firms in 1999.</p><p>The stakes get higher A few firms have already been indisciplined. John Flannery, General Electric's new boss, has axed some digital projects after judging them extravagant. But no one is yet making existential wagers.</p><p>Taking a sample of eight incumbents, on average their digital initiatives are worth 14 per cent of the size of the firm (using a range of metrics, including sales, investment and market value). So for example, e-commerce eats up only a fifth of Wal-Mart's investment budget. Even Disney-Fox's existing initiatives are small. Hulu, a streaming service that it will control, makes losses equivalent to less than a tenth of its parents' annual spending on content.Conventional firms' digital bets will only grow larger, as more bosses note the rising share prices of pioneers such as Wal-Mart and GM. This makes sense, even if plenty of companies make an utter hash of things. For large incumbents, digital strategy this year will start being a matter of life and death.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20180105Australian19000356420771</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RB9-43G1-F0JP-W1BW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1036\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 5, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

But over the last year, the world confronted a new dark side to social media: its ability to tear at the very fabric of society.</p><p>Throughout 2017, there's been a steady drumbeat of damaging headlines about fake news, polarizing filter bubbles and Russian propaganda campaigns spreading across Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, threatening to sow division among voters.</p><p>The tech industry, once a darling of Washington during the Obama administration, now faces strong criticisms from both sides of the aisle over their inability to police massive platforms that can number in the billions.</p><p>Last month, executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google were grilled by Congress over their role in the 2016 election. In one memorable exchange, Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said he was \"very proud\" of the three \"American companies,\" but added: \"your power sometimes scares me.\"</p><p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from the companies' home state of California, echoed Kennedy in one of the Congressional hearings. \"You've created these platforms, and now they are being misused,\" she said. \"And you have to be the ones to do something about it, or we will.\"</p><p>Franklin Foer, author of World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech, describes 2017 as a \"turning point\" for questioning the growing \"concentrations of power\" in the technology industry.</p><p/><p>\"When these guys were on the rise for a decade, they held enormous cultural prestige and they were generally beloved,\" Foer told CNNMoney. Now, he says, \"you do have the sense that these companies are on the defensive.\"</p><p>For years, these tech companies have touted themselves as tools to make the world a better place. Facebook pitches itself as a way to \"bring the world closer together.\" Twitter has frequently said it's a \"global town square.\" And YouTube's mission statement is to \"give everyone a voice and show them the world.\"</p><p>But time and again this year, those idealistic ambitions have crashed into a darker reality -- both at home and abroad.</p><p>Facebook has been described as enabling ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. Facebook's WhatsApp was cited as a cause of beatings in India after a fake news story went viral on the messaging service. Google has come under fire for child exploitation videos on YouTube. Twitter was panned for not removing a controversial tweet from President Trump that North Korea deemed a declaration of war.</p><p>The damaging headlines extend beyond social media. Apple has been criticized for aiding censorship in China. Amazon, too, has come under some scrutiny as a possible monopoly as it bulldozes into new industries.</p><p>There is a growing awareness of the tech industry's potential to be a force for bad as well as good. And it happens to come at a time when Silicon Valley is a facing a broader crisis of confidence for how it treats employees, customers and the law.</p><p>Uber, the world's most valuable startup, has been accused of dodging regulators and engaging in espionage, hacking and bribery. Google has come under scrutiny for how it pays women. Tech executives and venture capitalists are facing sexual harassment allegations. Yahoo users learned that every single account -- all three billion of them -- was hacked.</p><p>So far, these concerns have yet to hurt stock prices in the tech industry, nor has it shifted public perception much. YouGov, a market research firm that conducts surveys, says there has been \"no significant change\" in the brand health of companies like Facebook and Google this year.</p><p>But legislators have become more critical of these companies, and to some extent, company insiders have become more openly critical of themselves and their work.</p><p/><p>Former Facebook exec Chamath Palihapitiya recently made headlines for sharp criticisms of social media in a speech. \"We have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works,\" he said.</p><p>Palihapitiya and other tech employees also opened up to CNNMoney last month about feeling guilty for the damage caused by the products they built. Indeed, the sense of atonement goes all the way to the top. In a remarkably candid post for Yom Kippur, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized for \"the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together.\"</p><p>In Silicon Valley, the solution to technology problems is often more technology, such as better algorithms and new artificial intelligence. But this year, tech companies have begun to devote more real people (and real money) to solve their credibility crisis.</p><p>Facebook said last month it would double the number of people working on safety and security to 20,000, though it's unclear how many are contractors.

But over the last year, the world confronted a new dark side to social media: its ability to tear at the very fabric of society.</p><p>Throughout 2017, there's been a steady drumbeat of damaging headlines about fake news, polarizing filter bubbles and Russian propaganda campaigns spreading across Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, threatening to sow division among voters.</p><p>The tech industry, once a darling of Washington during the Obama administration, now faces strong criticisms from both sides of the aisle over their inability to police massive platforms that can number in the billions. </p><p>Last month, executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google were grilled by Congress over their role in the 2016 election. In one memorable exchange, Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said he was \"very proud\" of the three \"American companies,\" but added: \"your power sometimes scares me.\"</p><p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from the companies' home state of California, echoed Kennedy in one of the Congressional hearings. \"You've created these platforms, and now they are being misused,\" she said. \"And you have to be the ones to do something about it, or we will.\"</p><p>Franklin Foer, author of World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech, describes 2017 as a \"turning point\" for questioning the growing \"concentrations of power\" in the technology industry.</p><p>\"When these guys were on the rise for a decade, they held enormous cultural prestige and they were generally beloved,\" Foer told CNNMoney. Now, he says, \"you do have the sense that these companies are on the defensive.\" </p><p>For years, these tech companies have touted themselves as tools to make the world a better place. Facebook pitches itself as a way to \"bring the world closer together.\" Twitter has frequently said it's a \"global town square.\" And YouTube's mission statement is to \"give everyone a voice and show them the world.\" </p><p>But time and again this year, those idealistic ambitions have crashed into a darker reality -- both at home and abroad.</p><p>Facebook has been described as enabling ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. Facebook's WhatsApp was cited as a cause of beatings in India after a fake news story went viral on the messaging service. Google has come under fire for child exploitation videos on YouTube. Twitter was panned for not removing a controversial tweet from President Trump that North Korea deemed a declaration of war. </p><p>The damaging headlines extend beyond social media. Apple has been criticized for aiding censorship in China. Amazon, too, has come under some scrutiny as a possible monopoly as it bulldozes into new industries. </p><p>There is a growing awareness of the tech industry's potential to be a force for bad as well as good. And it happens to come at a time when Silicon Valley is a facing a broader crisis of confidence for how it treats employees, customers and the law.</p><p>Uber, the world's most valuable startup, has been accused of dodging regulators and engaging in espionage, hacking and bribery. Google has come under scrutiny for how it pays women. Tech executives and venture capitalists are facing sexual harassment allegations. Yahoo users learned that every single account -- all three billion of them -- was hacked.</p><p>So far, these concerns have yet to hurt stock prices in the tech industry, nor has it shifted public perception much. YouGov, a market research firm that conducts surveys, says there has been \"no significant change\" in the brand health of companies like Facebook and Google this year. </p><p>But legislators have become more critical of these companies, and to some extent, company insiders have become more openly critical of themselves and their work.</p><p>Former Facebook exec Chamath Palihapitiya recently made headlines for sharp criticisms of social media in a speech. \"We have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works,\" he said. </p><p>Palihapitiya and other tech employees also opened up to CNNMoney last month about feeling guilty for the damage caused by the products they built. Indeed, the sense of atonement goes all the way to the top. In a remarkably candid post for Yom Kippur, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized for \"the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together.\"</p><p>In Silicon Valley, the solution to technology problems is often more technology, such as better algorithms and new artificial intelligence. But this year, tech companies have begun to devote more real people (and real money) to solve their credibility crisis.</p><p>Facebook said last month it would double the number of people working on safety and security to 20,000, though it's unclear how many are contractors. Google is also planning to hire 10,000 people to clean up YouTube. </p><p>These proactive moves may help reduce the odds of additional regulatory scrutiny, according to James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt.

There were links to 12 current or former heads of state and government and more than 60 relatives and associates of heads of state and other politicians.

Several factors like runaway hyperinflation (predicted to reach 1,500% by 2017), multiple years of low and negative economic growth, a 40% drop in imports in 2016, a 40% drop in oil-export income in 2015, exacerbated by high levels of corruption and a mounting political crisis have manifested in the streets through chronic scarcities of food, basic goods, and medicines as the citizens grow increasingly anxious about meeting daily survival needs as well as the future of the country.</p><p>JUN 13</p><p>THE BUSINESS OF BUSINESS</p><p>The big tech deal of 2016 was Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion.

The government had dropped a huge bombshell announcing that the largest currency notes - 500 and 1000 - would be made illegal and new notes created in their stead over the course of two months.

WELCOME BACK: Congress starts winding back into action today. And if you\u2019re wondering whether a few weeks away from Washington helped to get talks over a next coronavirus relief package to a better spot \u2014 well, the answer seems to be no.   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have found common ground on government funding, but there hasn\u2019t been much progress on meeting in the middle on a coronavirus response.   \u201cWhere we're really stuck is both on certain policy issues but more about more importantly on the top line,\u201d Mnuchin said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Senate Republicans are expected to move ahead this week with a more narrow approach, now below even the $1 trillion range, while Democrats think $2 trillion should be the very minimum amount discussed.   It\u2019s hard to find anyone in the D.C. tax world \u2014 congressional aides or lobbyist types \u2014 who has any optimism at all that some of the tax ideas in the mix for a next pandemic measure will get done this month. (In fact, Morning Tax found none.)   That would kick a lot of potential tax proposals into the lame-duck session after the election. But that\u2019s basically put tax policymaking in D.C. into a hurry-up-and-wait situation: It\u2019s tough to do too much preparation or lay too much groundwork for November without knowing the composition of the government in January.   THIS IS YOUR EIGHTH edition of Weekly Tax, and we hope at least most of you had a restful long weekend. For our part, we might never look at a Walgreens sign the same again.   Talk about escalating quickly: Today marks 154 years since the birth of the first documented set of sextuplets to be born in America \u2014 to the Bushnells of Chicago.

ALSO ON TAP FOR SEPTEMBER: Senate Democrats will be pushing to use the Congressional Review Act to roll back President Donald Trump\u2019s order to defer payroll tax collections for the rest of the year \u2014 an effort that has really no shot to be successful, but it would put a further spotlight on the situation. (Worth noting \u2014 House Democrats, through Rep. John Larson of Connecticut, are targeting the deferral as well.)   GAO will have to bless that Trump\u2019s payroll tax action is eligible for that kind of review, as your Morning Tax author noted recently. At least one Democratic aide thought the chances were better than not that GAO would rule in their favor, based on some of the Obama-era executive actions that Republicans successfully targeted with the review act early in the Trump administration.   Bridget Dooling, a research professor at George Washington University and former lawyer with the White House\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, didn\u2019t want to hazard a guess as to what judgment GAO might reach. But she did say that analysts there would be more concerned with the substance of the executive action, rather than the manner in which it was delivered \u2014 in this case, a presidential memorandum that was followed up by further (if limited) agency guidance.   How\u2019s that deferral going? Here\u2019s who we know for sure will stop getting payroll taxes taken out of their paychecks \u2014 federal employees, including those on active duty with the military and staffers at the IRS (who can face some steep repercussions if they get in trouble on their taxes).   Beyond that, there hasn\u2019t really even been a trickle of private-sector companies saying they would go along with the president\u2019s memorandum.   ICYMI: Pro Tax\u2019s Brian Faler examined this issue last week, and found that there are good reasons why companies aren\u2019t taking the plunge. (Not only that: They're basically the same issues that experts predicted from the start.) And keep in mind: If few employers do actually decide to defer payroll tax collections, that could easily influence lawmakers\u2019 decision on whether to excuse those payments.   BACK AT THIS ONE: It\u2019s not exactly a new debate within tax circles \u2014 how much do tax policies influence people moving between states?   It\u2019s also a debate that\u2019s still happening and doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere.   The latest: Carl Davis of the progressive Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy wrote a piece last week using new IRS data that specifically focused on the $10,000 cap on state and local deductions put into place by the 2017 tax law and whether it caused a migration away from high-tax blue states. The short answer, according to Davis, is no.   Davis added in an email to Morning Tax that the SALT findings merely reinforced his broader stance: There\u2019s no major outflow of people to lower-tax red states from higher-tax blue states.   \u201cThe main takeaway is that a very small share of the population moves between states in any given year,\u201d Davis wrote, referring to IRS data on that topic. \u201cWe hear all the time about how the tax systems in California and New York allegedly make those states inhospitable places for the rich, and yet those two states added more millionaires to their tax rolls than any other in 2018.\u201d   The flip side: Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute has been taking the opposing view of that argument for awhile now.   It\u2019s important to note that liberals don\u2019t seem to be arguing that no one is moving because of taxes, and that conservatives aren\u2019t saying that taxes are the only factor at play. (Yes, people do move from Massachusetts or New York to Florida for the weather, too.)   But as Edwards has noted, it\u2019s also undeniable that traffic is more going away from high-tax states and toward low-tax ones, and his point is that there\u2019s plenty of circumstantial evidence to suggest that taxes play a substantial role in some of those moving decisions. (For instance: South Dakota has more people coming to it on net than higher-tax neighbors like Minnesota and Nebraska.)   On some level, this delves into perhaps more semantic questions like: What amounts to a big migration between the states? Edwards noted in 2018 that around 600,000 people (with a combined income of $33 billion) moved from the 25 highest-taxed states to the 25 lowest-taxed states in 2016.   Is that a lot for a country of more than 300 million people? That\u2019s somewhat in the eye of the beholder, Edwards acknowledged, before noting in an email: \u201cA very small number of very rich people moving has a big impact on the state budget. In California, the top 1% of the highest earners pays 50% of the state\u2019s income and capital gains taxes. What if Silicon Valley started moving to Texas?\u201d   Around the World   DOESN\u2019T COMPUTE? Denmark prides itself on its green policies, so it maybe sounds a bit dissonant that it\u2019s also among the most expensive places in the world to buy an electric car. But as Bloomberg notes, that might not be for much longer. A new government-sanctioned panel is proposing that Denmark slash registration taxes for electric cars (and increase road taxes for conventional vehicles) \u2014 policies that would cut the cost of cars like the Tesla model 3 Long Range, for which taxes make up more than 20 percent of the almost $100,000 list price. Currently, Copenhagen collects around 50 billion kroner each year, or some $8 billion, in taxes from car sales, and Danish policymakers are suggesting they\u2019d be willing to accept less if it leads to the purchase of more electric vehicles.

Around the Nation   CIRCLING BACK: Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York is shying away from tax-the-rich proposals pushed by his fellow Democrats in the state legislature, The New York Times reports. Cuomo basically says that the wealthy are already bearing their fair share of the state\u2019s tax burden, and that the federal government should be stepping in to help New York fill a $14.5 billion budget gap. (In fact, Cuomo has asked Washington for some $59 billion to cover two years\u2019 worth of costs.) Top Democrats in both chambers of the state legislature are now on board with higher taxes on the rich, arguing that education and other key programs will be hurt without an infusion of new revenue from the top.

HuffPost did a deep-dive into how House Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.) beat back a progressive primary challenge.

Washington's latest round of sanctions on Huawei has been carefully crafted to cripple the Chinese telecom giant's smartphone business. While the company has reportedly stockpiled up to 2 years of inventories for its telecom equipment business - a sign that it is probably already too late to stop the company from playing a critical role in the global rollout of 5G technology - the new restrictions announced on Aug. 17 have essentially barred Huawei from buying and using any and all microchips without a license from the US.  Since US technology and equipment is so critical to the global microchip supply chain (which is currently centered around Taiwan, China and the US), Huawei is scrambling to stockpile as many chips as it can before midnight on Sept. </p><p>14, which is when the new sanctions take effect.    Yesterday, we reported[3] on how these sanctions aren't just harming Huawei, they're harming Huawei's suppliers, including companies like MediaTek, which has seen its stock plunge since Washington announced the latest restrictions, dealing a major blow to Taiwan's \"Bandit Phone King\".  Now, Nikkei Asian Review reports[4] that Huawei is in \"survival mode,\" trying to import as many handset chips as possible, even buying up unfinished \"wafers\" in the hopes that it can finish the chips in-house later.  Huawei Technologies and its suppliers are working around the clock to beat a U.S. government deadline for shipping crucial mobile chips to the Chinese smartphone maker, part of a Washington crackdown that industry insiders say has the company fighting for survival.  The leading Chinese smartphone maker is stockpiling 5G mobile processors, Wifi, radio frequency and display driver chips and other components from key chip developers including MediaTek, Realtek, Novatek, RichWave and others, sources told the Nikkei Asian Review.  While the Commerce Department has in the past moved to block shipments of chips to Huawei,[5] suppliers are allowed to ship orders that were already in the pipeline when the restriction was announced. However, the orders must be delivered by midnight on Sept. 14, which is less than three weeks away.  Huawei last year managed to unseat Samsung as the world's biggest smartphone maker. But analysts have warned that the company's smartphone shipments could fall 75% next year. Above all, Huawei covets chips used in 5G smartphones, which are required for the company's latest generation of phones, which are 5G compatible, a fact that was supposed to drive an ambitious upgrade cycle.  Even if the US manages to unseat Huawei from the smartphone league tables, other Chinese companies like Xiaomi would probably be the biggest beneficiaries, since Apple's products are too costly for most consumers in the developing world.  But the boldness of the ban is a lobbyists nightmare, as Nikkei explained, and it even risks shaking the global tech industry to its core, just like Trump's restrictions on WeChat almost did. [6]  The scope and suddenness of the ban, Washington's harshest yet against the company, has shaken the global tech industry.  \"The new ban is so wide-reaching and the new rule came very abruptly with such short notice when Huawei and all the suppliers were still working to mitigate Washington's previous expansion of restrictions in May.  \"It's quite shocking and unexpected to Huawei and many of its suppliers due to the short notice of the ban,\" said another Huawei supplier executive familiar with the situation. \"The whole supply chain is still bracing for collateral damage as many forecast orders will fall to zero after Sept. 15, and not every component can be sold to someone else. We are still digesting how big the downside could be for overall demand.\"  The problem, the source added, is that there is\"limited room to push forward too many advanced chips given the short notice of the deadline. Only minor adjustments are possible now.\"  The restriction is such a serious threat to Huawei because American technology and intellectual property - from software to equipment and materials \u2014 is afundamental partof the global chip supply chain. Unless Washington revises this ban, the clock is ticking for suppliers to ship their final round of products without a license.  \"What they want to secure most desperately are 5G smartphone processor chips and chips related to high-end smartphones now,\" another source familiar with the matter said. \"But if the U.S. does not lift the ban later, even if it secures some chips now, Huawei's smartphone business will hit huge setbacks. It's very difficult to design new products with inventories.\"  Soon, the White House will have Huawei in an extremely difficult position  \"It's almost impossible for Huawei and its key suppliers to get rid of U.S. tech any time soon,\" Jeff Pu, a tech analyst with GF Securities, told Nikkei. \"Huawei could still ship some 195 million units of smartphones this year thanks to the inventories it built up previously, but the company's handset shipments for next year would be reduced to around 50 million units due to the Washington clampdown if the U.S. does not change or ease the rules later, according to our estimate.\"  MediaTek told Nikkei that it will \"fully and strictly\" comply with global trade-related regulations and said it will not ship half-finished products, or chips that have not been tested and packaged to its customers.  Novatek likewise said it will follow the export control rules and is working closely with outside counsel for guidance. The display driver IC chip developer added that it is maintaining its previous financial guidance for the July-September period.  Largan said it \"cannot comment on any specific client's situation,\" but added that any component shortage in the supply chain would affect its own shipments. \"We continue to monitor the supply chain dynamics and relevant regulations.\"  No matter where they're domiciled, Huawei's suppliers will need to obtain a special license from the Commerce Department if they want to continue supplying Huawei. Right now, it's unclear when - or even if - the administration will grant these waivers, leaving Huawei's investors facing a deeply uncertain future.    Of course, if Huawei survives, it could set an example for other Chinese firms facing Washington's wrath that it's possible to resist and win.

Even more challenging, they also take on thorny issues that executives elsewhere tend to avoid, like economic disparities and racial discrimination.</p><p>  Think of it as The Establishment 2.0: more diverse than the nearly all-white and male establishment of old, to be sure, but every bit as powerful, and just as invisible when need be.</p><p>  ''Itasca operates behind the scenes,'' said Tim Welsh, a senior partner at the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company, which hosts the weekly breakfasts at its offices in the IDS Center here. ''We all know each other but we are clearly not recognized as the people of Itasca.''</p><p>  Itasca's impact is very real, however. And its consensus-oriented approach offers an alternative path at a time when politics nationally -- and in many state capitols -- seems hopelessly divided along partisan lines.</p><p>  While Itasca would just as soon stay out of the limelight, the levers of power in the Twin Cities are within easy reach. The guest list for the weekly breakfasts downtown includes the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, as well as local legislators, school superintendents and university officials.</p><p>  So when a proposal to raise the gasoline tax in 2008 to help rebuild roads and transit systems was vetoed by the Republican governor at the time, Tim Pawlenty, phone calls from Itasca's business leaders helped persuade enough Republican legislators to cross the aisle and override the veto.</p><p>  More recently, pressure from Itasca helped secure increased funding for the state's college and university system. Itasca also spearheaded the creation of a new regional agency to attract companies looking to move or expand, as well as an effort to encourage procurement chiefs at local giants like Target and Xcel Energy to buy more goods and services locally.</p><p>  Itasca's work is among the reasons that the Twin Cities region has emerged as an economic powerhouse. At 2.9 percent, the metropolitan area's unemployment rate is well below the national level of 5 percent.</p><p>  At the same time, Minnesota has excelled in creating the kinds of higher-paid, knowledge- and skills-based jobs that provide entree into the middle class today. With that in mind, Itasca has drawn interest from leaders in American cities and abroad who would like to emulate its success.</p><p>  That will not be easy. Part of what makes Itasca work is also what has helped Minnesota prosper: a long history of progressive and engaged business leaders, a largely homogeneous population with a low poverty rate and a consensus-driven Midwestern culture where egos are checked at the door, or at least not displayed too openly.</p><p>  ''Sometimes it doesn't serve anybody to take credit,'' said Jennifer Ford Reedy, president of the Bush Foundation, a major philanthropy here, and a former McKinsey consultant who advised the Itasca group. ''The people who need to know what Itasca is doing are the participants. That's it.''</p><p>  In fact, Itasca has no building, budget or full-time staff, other than two McKinsey consultants who coordinate research and logistics for Itasca members.</p><p>  Business establishments, of course, are hardly unique to Minnesota. Most big cities -- and many smaller towns -- have chambers of commerce, not to mention economic development offices and the like.</p><p>  What makes Itasca unique, participants say, is a commitment to hard data and McKinsey-style analysis, as well as a willingness to depart from the script that drives many private sector lobbies.</p><p>  ''We're not just asking for lower taxes and less regulation,'' said David Mortenson, the current chairman of the Itasca Project. ''If we're taking on education or income disparity as a group of business leaders, we want to be able to break some eggs.''</p><p>  That's different from what happens in most other cities, said Mr. Mortenson, who earlier this year took over M. A. Mortenson, a nationwide construction firm founded by his grandfather.</p><p>  In Seattle, where Mr. Mortenson lived for nine years before moving back to Minneapolis in 2012, ''most of the big tech companies viewed the city as a convenient location to house some of its workers,'' he said. ''They didn't engage unless it affected their business.''</p><p>  ''Tech leaders are very philanthropic,'' he added, ''but they disconnect it from their business.''</p><p>  That has never been a problem here: The Pillsbury family and other members of the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce helped pay for the construction of the railroad to move grain and flour in the 1800s. And the current governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton, is a scion of the family that founded the Dayton Dry Goods Company, which grew into a retail giant and more recently morphed into Target Corporation.</p><p>  But by the beginning of the 21st century, that paternalistic, locally minded model of capitalism was fading, said James R. Campbell, a local banker who served in top positions at Norwest Banks and Wells Fargo before retiring in 2002.</p><p>  In 2001, Target rebranded the iconic Dayton's store downtown as Marshall Field's, the Chicago chain it had acquired in 1990. (Marshall Field's was later sold to Macy's.)</p><p>  Also in 2001, 3M, a pillar of the old business establishment based in St. Paul, brought in an outsider as chief executive for the first time in its 100-year history: W. James McNerney Jr. of General Electric. </p><p>  ''We were concerned that this flyover land was not organized,'' said Mr. Campbell, who oversaw the creation of Itasca in 2003 with other local business chiefs along with the leaders of major philanthropies. They took the name from Itasca State Park in northern Minnesota, where business leaders had met annually in the 1950s and 1960s to discuss issues facing the state.</p><p>  Existing groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the Minnesota Business Partnership were focused ''on lower taxes and less regulation,'' he said.</p><p>  ''We were not addressing other issues like income disparities,'' said Mr. Campbell, who served as chairman of Itasca from 2003 to 2008, and helped initiate the Working Team breakfasts on Friday mornings in conjunction with the McKnight Foundation and Mr. Welsh of McKinsey. ''The chamber didn't want to touch that.''</p><p>  Nor was the business community focused on areas that were crucial to long-term economic development, like transportation and infrastructure. ''What were we going to do about job growth?'' Mr. Campbell said he wondered at the time. ''What about marketing ourselves?''</p><p>  The question of self-promotion helped inspire the creation of Greater MSP, an economic development agency that has put the region on the radar of corporate site selectors while overcoming Minnesotans' traditional reluctance to brag about themselves.</p><p>  A bigger test of Itasca's reach -- and of the willingness of the local establishment to go outside their comfort zone -- came in 2008, when Governor Pawlenty vetoed a proposed increase in gas and sales taxes to fund $6.6 billion in transportation improvements.</p><p>  A rush-hour bridge collapse over the Mississippi River in downtown Minneapolis the year before had killed 13 people and galvanized worries about aging infrastructure nationwide. But there was fierce opposition to what would be the first gas tax increase in 20 years.</p><p>  At the same time, Governor Pawlenty was eyeing a White House run and had made a no-new-taxes pledge. None of the governor's previous vetoes had been overridden, but Itasca's members helped move the debate beyond the usual left-right dynamic.</p><p>  Mr. Campbell donned a hard hat and a fluorescent vest and stood with union leaders on the capitol steps to rally support. He and other business executives privately made the case to Republican legislators that traffic jams and long commutes were not good for employees or employers.</p><p>  In the end, six Republican legislators defied the governor, and the veto was overridden by a two-vote margin.</p><p>  ''I can't overstate the importance of the Itasca Project leadership on the transportation issue,'' said Chris Coleman, the mayor of St. Paul. ''There's no question it changed the trajectory of the debate.''</p><p>  While the case for better infrastructure is straightforward, other Itasca initiatives will take much longer to show concrete results. One major focus of the group is income inequality, as well as the high dropout and unemployment rates among minorities.</p><p>  The gap between the refined atmosphere at the McKinsey aerie and the problems in local neighborhoods can be awkward even for people with the best of intentions. In fact, while Itasca leaders talk up the importance of diversity, minorities are conspicuously absent from the Working Team. (They are much better represented within the larger Itasca membership.)</p><p>  Social issues may be less amenable to business-sector solutions than crumbling roads and bridges, but that has not stopped Itasca from pushing for McKinsey-style benchmarks to measure the performance of local public schools.</p><p>  The group is also spearheading a new effort to better equip the state's two- and four-year college systems to produce graduates with the skills that today's employers need.</p><p>  ''The research they've done on education and hiring has really influenced my agenda,'' said Betsy Hodges, the mayor of Minneapolis. ''It puts wind in our sails to know that the business community thinks these issues are important.''</p><p>  As might be expected from boosters whose job it is to promote economic growth and talk up the Twin Cities' appeal, many Itasca participants express confidence that their project could be replicated elsewhere. Mr. Campbell, though, is less sure.</p><p>  ''My answer is maybe,'' he said. ''There's a unique willingness to trust each other here. It's kind of in our blood.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: A meeting in Minneapolis of the so-called Working Team of the Itasca Project, a civic group aimed at increasing development in the region.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Construction of the St. Croix River Crossing bridge.

Bankers are backing Biden anyway.</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline><highlight><bodyText><p>Bankers' preference for the former vice president comes even as the Trump administration has delivered in a significant way for the banks.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Executives and employees at the nation's biggest banks are giving a boost to former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign for the White House, despite economic policies under President Donald Trump that produced record profits for the industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Contributions from individuals affiliated with the six largest lenders total $907,216 for Biden and $293,434 for Trump, according to a POLITICO review of campaign finance data. Biden has a significant fundraising advantage at every one of the banks - JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Their preference for the former vice president comes even as Trump's administration has delivered in a significant way for the banks - making them among the main beneficiaries of his 40 percent cut in the corporate tax rate and easing Obama-era regulations. Biden has pledged to repeal some of those tax cuts and impose new fees on large financial institutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But in an era of growing social and racial unrest, as well as income inequality, many bankers are voting beyond their wallets in the belief that Trump is stoking those divisions, industry experts say. Many in the industry are embracing Biden's approaches to racial equity, foreign affairs and other areas where his tone is more aligned with the leaders of global financial institutions.</p><p>\"These contributions speak to the deep unease Democrats and many independents have with national policy on personal priorities such as equality, civility and constitutionality,\" said Federal Financial Analytics managing partner Karen Petrou, who advises bank executives on policy. The bankers, she said, are \"expressing themselves as well as their company's priorities when they make contributions.\"</p><p>To be sure, Biden is also a known entity to Wall Street and benefits from his longtime closeness to the financial industry. While representing Delaware in the Senate, he supported bankruptcy legislation that made it harder for consumers to escape credit card debt. More recently, he attracted controversy for telling wealthy donors at a 2019 fundraiser that \"no one's standard of living will change, nothing would fundamentally change\" for them.</p><p>And employees at the megabanks also showed a preference for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016 - she outraised him by more than 10 to 1 among these same companies. But they put their money behind Republican Mitt Romney when he ran against President Barack Obama and Biden in 2012.</p><p>The figures, aggregated by the Center for Responsive Politics, cover not only high-profile executives but also other employees at the sprawling, international corporations. They underscore a view in the banking industry that Biden would govern as a moderate despite the influence of Wall Street watchdogs like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).</p><p>The contributions analyzed for this story came from individual donors at the banks and were not directed by the companies themselves, which operate separate political action committees that help fund congressional campaigns.</p><p>The wave of contributions has emerged as Biden, who will accept the Democratic presidential nomination during the party's convention next week, takes the lead over Trump in national and battleground state polls.</p><p>Trump campaign spokesperson Samantha Zager said the president is counting on ordinary voters to win reelection.</p><p>\"President Trump's campaign is powered by everyday Americans who have benefited from his bold leadership,\" she said. \"Joe Biden has Big Tech, Big Pharma, and Big Banks in his pocket, and the Trump campaign still outraised him in July - not to mention we have real voter enthusiasm in our corner. President Trump will continue to prioritize hardworking Americans while Joe Biden looks out for himself.\"</p><p>Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs at FreedomWorks, a conservative group, had another explanation for Biden's popularity with bankers: \"It's no secret that big businesses, including big financial institutions, tend to benefit from big government policies. They're able to insulate themselves from regulation to some degree because they can afford the cost of compliance that leaves smaller institutions out in the cold.\"</p><p>Several senior leaders at the big banks have contributed money to Biden's campaign, including Goldman Sachs CFO Stephen Scherr and JPMorgan general counsel Stacey Friedman. Goldman Sachs Japan Vice Chair Kathy Matsui contributed $54,600 to the Biden Victory Fund, Biden's joint fundraising operation with the Democratic National Committee. Morgan Stanley Vice Chair Thomas Nides and Wells Fargo Vice Chairman of Public Affairs Bill Daley - both former Obama administration officials - have also contributed to Biden's campaign.</p><p>While Biden has shied away from demonizing Wall Street like Warren and some other Democrats, he has pledged to raise taxes on large financial institutions and other corporations after Trump slashed the rate to 21 percent from 35 percent in 2017, helping deliver a 44 percent surge in banking industry profits in 2018. That's the top concern of bank lobbyists who are starting to game out how Washington would approach the industry if Democrats take back power.</p><p>Yet Paul Thornell, former managing director for federal government affairs at Citigroup, said banking executives aren't just focused on things like tax policy when it comes to showing their support for a candidate.</p><p>\"They're looking at character and how these two conduct themselves as leaders,\" said Thornell, now a principal at government relations firm Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen &amp; Thomas. \"They're looking at the issues that Trump has decided to align himself with versus the issues they think Biden would give voice to, which are probably more in line with where they are personally, the brand and reputation of their firms and the issues their employees care about.\"</p><p>Still, any perceived coziness between Biden and bankers is a potential political problem as the former vice president faces pressure from progressives to crack down on big business. One Biden official said teachers are the top profession that donates to his campaign.</p><p>\"Wall Street bankers and hedge fund managers didn't build this country - the American middle class did,\" Biden spokesperson Andrew Bates said. \"Donald Trump has turned his back on families struggling to get by throughout his presidency, passing a multitrillion-dollar tax giveaway to the wealthy and plunging manufacturing into a recession while creating new incentives for outsourcing American jobs - whereas Joe Biden is running to ensure that our economy rewards work, not just wealth, which is why his campaign is powered by small, grassroots donations.\"</p><p>Indeed, a Biden administration will likely pursue stricter banking regulation than has Trump, though it's not expected to be the kind of sea change that occurred under Obama. At that time, the global economy was reeling from a financial crisis created by Wall Street, and Democrats responded by overhauling bank regulation with the landmark 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.</p><p>Now, bank lobbyists say the Biden campaign's recent economic proposals, including those released in partnership with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), haven't been that surprising or threatening.</p><p>Bank representatives see lots of issues where they can have constructive conversations with Democrats. They include responding to climate change, improving corporate diversity and supporting small business.</p><p>Big banks have also joined the fight against Big Tech by lobbying to stop technology companies from obtaining bank charters. Lobbyists expect Democrats to put more pressure on private equity firms than big banks, which were public enemy No. 1 when Biden became vice president in 2009.</p><p>The dynamic was on display last month when Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) - who proposed breaking up the banks after the 2008 crisis - spoke on a Goldman Sachs-hosted Zoom call commemorating the graduation of entrepreneurs from the company's \"10,000 Small Businesses\" program. Brown, who would likely chair the Senate Banking Committee if Democrats won back the Senate, appeared with Goldman CEO David Solomon.</p><p>Brown scolded Solomon for stock buybacks the bank pursued thanks to the Trump tax cuts but he also praised the bank's small business efforts in Ohio.</p><p>\"I hope you'll follow up with a commitment to invest more of your, I would say, immense resources in the real economy and communities that often get overlooked by Wall Street,\" Brown said. \"This is an example of Goldman doing that.\"</p><p>Capital Alpha Partners director Ian Katz said there are competing forces at play when it comes to how the banking industry views Biden. Biden and his regulators would generally favor tighter regulation. But Trump has been harder for banks to predict because of his populist tendencies.</p><p>\"There's also the possibility that while bankers prefer Trump on matters affecting their industry, they may prefer Biden on most other things,\" Katz said. \"If that's the case, they could lean toward Biden because they prefer him on most matters, and while he may be less friendly than Trump is to banks, they don't think he'll be dangerously unfriendly. So when they take everything into account, they may lean toward Biden.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-393594</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K1-BCJ1-F118-90S9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1537\"/><timeReceived>4:46 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

These are some of the technologies that are deployed to help combat the covid-19 pandemic.</p><p><br/>Surveillance capitalism was an unpleasant phrase before the coronavirus arrived. Now it seems to be normal, something that investors take into account for stock valuations, as information technology grew to account for a quarter of the value of the S&amp;P; 500. But while techlash (the negative reaction to tech companies) now seems like a thing of the past, the same success of digital giants and their role in fighting the virus in the end may turn out to be their doom.<br/>Popular belief is that large technology groups are going to emerge much bigger and more powerful than ever after the pandemic is over. Amazon is arguably the world's most essential retailer, hiring 100,000 more employees to manage the increase in quarantine-related demand.<br/>Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, invited former Google CEO Eric Schmidt to help him design the state reopening. Google and Apple partnered to develop a contact tracking system that several governments are embracing. Uber capitalizes on the demand for takeaways that are given by confinement with an offer by rival Grubhub. Big tech groups seem unstoppable, but that's just the reason they're going to be slowed down in the end.<br/>The first regulatory initiative after coronavirus is already developed around privacy. Data is created at the fastest level in history since the virus made our lives largely virtual. A Bank of America report notes that the volume of data creation has risen 50 percent since the pandemic began.<br/>Technology companies help dozens of governments track down their citizens. Many of them hope to preserve the data they are accumulating and, in the end, monetize it, especially in health care areas. Google, Amazon, Facebook and Oracle were already trying to venture into the industry before the arrival of covid-19.<br/>There is a public skepticism in the UK about whether the information technology industry can be trusted to design such products. In the US, a survey shows that only half of Americans would participate in contact tracking, and a third of them would be willing to share their flight information and other biometric information to combat the virus, and even fewer want their wireless location tracked.<br/>Unsurprisingly, Democrats and Republicans introduce bills to ensure that data collected to fight the virus is not used for other purposes. European politicians and regulators, as head of competence for the European Union, Margrethe Vestager, seek strict rules and transparency.<br/>Content moderation is another area ready for regulatory action. Large tech companies are reluctant to monitor online misinformation, in part because of concerns about civil liberties. They also do not want to lose the legal protection that holds them accountable for what online users say or do, but the rapid spread of coronavirus forced them to take steps to erase inaccurate public health information.<br/>As one of the highest-level European regulators recently pointed out to me, this makes it difficult for these companies to argue that they cannot monitor misinformation in other areas.The consequence may be that they are required by law to do so. That poses a threat to the targeted advertising business model, crucial for firms such as Google, Facebook, and even Amazon.<br/>Beyond all this, the different ways in which countries address the balance between public health and economic recovery (as well as surveillance and civil liberties) pose another challenge. We will probably see an increasingly nationalistic technology sector, with different standards emerging for different regions. The change will limit global growth opportunities for some platforms. Last year's techlash may have disappeared, but it certainly doesn't forget.<br/>Monopolies, another rule to comply with<br/>One more regulation that will put pressure on tech companies will be antitrust competition. One example is Amazon, which can deliver most of our essential products, but that makes it easier for activists to argue that it's a monopoly. Critics will seek to divide it, force it to pay higher wages to its workers (some of whom have already contracted the virus), provide them with better benefits or even become a utility.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-12294015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXX-GN21-JBJN-M2RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 18, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: AlphabetGOOGL[1], FacebookFB[2], Amazon AMZN[3], AppleAAPL[4] and TwitterTWTR[5].Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog: 'Big Tech Threatened by Regulation:' What Else Is New?Last week and over the weekend, there've been a number of reports from brokers and media houses saying that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DoJ) have divided responsibility for regulatory oversight on the four big technology companies: Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.So going forward, the FTC will focus on Amazon and Facebook while the DoJ takes up Google and Apple.It was also reported that the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee is independently investigating competition in digital markets and the power wielded by big tech.While both Republicans (particularly Lindsey Graham, Marsha Blackburn and Senator Josh Hawley) and Democrats (mainly Richard Blumenthal and presidential primary candidate and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren) support better regulation and oversight of these technology companies, the exact purpose of the current probe remains unclear.Going by what they have been saying for a while now, they could be looking to break up the companies to curb their monopolistic tendencies, regulate them as utilities, and/or make stringent rules including for data protection, privacy and security of users that they must follow.The president's pet allegation of democrat bias may also be investigated.Analysts also chimed in with their 2 centsEvercore ISI analyst Kevin Rippey cut his price target on Alphabet stock by $50 to $1,200, saying, \"For investors, the investigation comes at a time when the stock's bull case is challenged by concerns of an abrupt revenue slowdown last quarter.'Also, \"While precedent suggests that Google enjoys broad discretion over the direction of search results, the questions arising from an investigation will challenge the possibility of multiple expansion,\" he added.'A DOJ probe would likely take more than 5 years to resolve and, if it were to happen, a breakup would be distracting for management, add [general ...ministrative] expenses, and potentially impact the long-term valuation creation by Alphabet companies that could be operated more cautiously,' surmised analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.On the other hand, they conceded that 'To break up Google... the DOJ would likely have to file a lawsuit and convince judges that Google has undermined competition,' which could take years.It's not an unheard-of thing though - both Ma Bell and Standard Oil had similar fates.So naturally, shares in the four big tech companies plungedBut It Isn't So EasyThere are a number of questions that need to be answered before any action is taken.1. In What Way Are They Dominant?</p><p> Since Facebook is the only social network of its kind, Google the only search engine of its kind, Apple the only consumer tech company of its kind and Amazon the only retailer of its kind, they are definitely dominant players. But if you consider their revenue generating streams, they aren't that dominant.Google, for example, continues to see its digital advertising market share shrink. eMarketer says that it's currently under 40% with Facebook just over 20%. Amazon, in spite of being such a late entrant is rapidly gaining share at just under 10%. This market, in spite of everything doesn't feel like a monopoly. So laws protecting privacy, etc. will impact companies like Twitter as much as they will big tech.The closed ecosystem, captive users, the 'Apple Tax' and competing new Apple services appear to be an abuse of power. At the same time, developers and users do have other options in Android, although they still won't be able to access iOS users. Then again, Amazon may be the leading online retailer, but it won't be able to hold its position if it charges unreasonably. 2. Does the consumer win or lose? In each case, the companies offer a compelling service that customers flock to, so they provide something of considerable value. If breaking up (or other regulatory action) impacts Google's ability to display the most useful information, or affects Facebook's ability to connect people, or prevents Apple from running a secure platform or prevents Amazon from charging an attractive price, it obviously isn't the answer.However, the time has come when the companies must be evaluated to determine whether their activities prevent or make it unduly difficult for a competing player to enter the market, thereby stifling innovation and limiting consumer choice. 3. Is the Action Appropriate? Regulators will also have to determine whether breaking up, fining, converting to utility or other action will be sufficient to deal with the problem. One might think that allowing users to access services from places other than the app store is an easy solution that Apple should be forced to accept.There's really no strong argument against this. But the cure may not always be as straightforward for the other companies, especially on the issue of privacy because companies are automatically the custodians of a lot of data as a part of the service they provide. A GDPR-like solution may be the answer in this regard.4.What Are the Stakes? The big technology companies have a lot of resources. So huge fines are of no effect because they can comfortably swallow even very large fines and continue as before.On the other hand, they can be made to use resources to set up effective control systems as directed by the government. This would be the best way to deal with both security and privacy concerns. Breaking or crippling them in any way would be a waste of resources, so the government is unlikely to move in that direction.There's also the artificial intelligence consideration. The amount of data these companies have accumulated puts them at the forefront of AI development. It would be remiss of lawmakers to set them back in this respect when it is one of the things.Investor ActionRegulatory action takes years and there's nothing to suggest that the outcome will be unfavorable, especially for the big players with their considerable resources and experience in dealing with antitrust situations. Yes, costs may go up, but any laws that come into being to regulate the environment will be tackled by big tech far easier than by small fry.All four are already trading below their median P/E values over the past year, but only Apple is at a discount to the S...00 as well. Given the pros and cons, Facebook is a Buy (Zacks Rank #2) right now.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon AMZN[1], MicrosoftMSFT[2], AppleAAPL[3], AlphabetGOOGL[4] and Advanced Micro DevicesAMD[5].Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:Amazon Roundup: Government, Re:Invent Conference, India ...reAmazon had a big week with government issues, a host of new deals and announcements at its annual conference and developments in India. Here are the details-Government DealingsAfter losing out to Microsoft in the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud contract and suing the pentagon for a politically motivated selection process, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has come out with statements seeking to bridge the gap with the government.\"We are going to support the Department of Defense, this country is important,\" Bezos said at an annual defense forum at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California. </p><p>He also said: \"My view is that if big tech is turning their back on the Department of Defense, this country is in big trouble.\"Actually, the only one of the big tech companies that's on the wrong side of the defense department is Amazon, which was mainly because of the sour relation between President Trump and Jeff Bezos, although he may have been referring to the way the government is investigating Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon on privacy, security and anticompetitive concerns.But since everyone knows that there's a lot of money to be made from the government, technology companies are likely to play ball. Bezos is probably making a point that Amazon's lost deal notwithstanding, it's able and willing to accept other deals the government might offer. The government usually has a broad supplier base.Separately, AWS has partnered with FINRA CAT LLC, a subsidiary of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, in a mega deal spanning 22 stock exchanges and 1,500 broker dealer firms, intended to facilitate government oversight of U.S. securities trading.Amazon's retail business is in a bit of a problem as the U.S. Trade Representative's Office is considering putting some of its international websites on its annual \"Notorious Markets\" list. This was prompted by the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA), which has now, for two straight years, requested the USTR to take such action because of the number of counterfeits on those platforms. Amazon's response has been that it has invested $400 million and acquired 5,000 people in 2018 to fight fraud and counterfeiting.Additionally, it has come to light that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has broadened its scrutiny of Amazon's business practices to include AWS. The FTC is reportedly in conversation with AWS's software partners to determine whether the company is engaged in the anticompetitive practice of discriminating against these providers when they offer their services to rivals or when their products compete directly with one or more of Amazon's own offerings.Democrat candidate Joe Biden is looking to impose a 15% tax on companies like Amazon with over $100 million in annual net income and raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. He proposes to use the increased income to fund initiatives like climate change, infrastructure needs, health care and higher education.Other DealsAt its annual re:Invent conference, Amazon announced a slew of deals:Verizon: The company's deal with AWS allows it to enable cloud services for Verizon Edge customers. Developers using AWS Wavelength and Verizon 5G Edge will deliver transformative, latency-sensitive use cases like machine learning inference at the edge, autonomous industrial equipment, smart cars and cities, Internet of Things (IoT), and augmented and virtual reality.Vodafone: The deal with Vodafone is similar, using Wavelength to deliver compute and storage services at the edge of Vodafone's network. Deployment will begin in the UK and Germany and then expand to other EU countries.Fox: Fox has entered into a multi-year deal to use AWS Media Services to transmit Fox sports, news and entertainment content to its cable TV and streaming customers. Its production facilities in LA, New York, Tempe, Arizona and Charlotte will also use Amazon tools.Specifically, Fox is deploying Amazon's Outpost, a server rack product that was announced last year and went on sale last week, to bring AWS services inside its own data center. It is also using AWS analytics services, including Amazon Kinesis, and machine learning services such as Amazon SageMaker to enhance live video streams and enable a real-time data capabilities.Cerner Corp: This health tech company will migrate its core applications to AWS where it will standardize its AI and ML workloads using AWS ML, analytics and Internet of things (IoT) services with the goal of enhancing patient care experience, improving health of populations and reducing per capita healthcare cost.Novartis: The strategic collaboration with Novartis is designed to reimagine/reinvent pharmaceutical manufacturing, supply chain, and delivery operations using AWS's portfolio of cloud services and analytics.Other Important Takeaways from AWS re:Invent ConferenceAmazon Sagemaker got six new capabilities to help development of machine learning (ML) models: Amazon SageMaker Studio, which is the first integrated development environment for ML to build, train, explain, inspect, monitor, debug, and run ML models from a single interface; elastic notebooks to run or recreate a machine learning workflow; experiment management; debugging and profiling; automatic model building and concept drift detection.Amazon introduced the second-generation of its Graviton chip built on the latest ARM technology. The first generation was only launched last year, so this is a very quick development cadence (though the release date wasn't mentioned). Amazon's focus in the area is intended to replace/reduce its reliance on Advanced Micro Devices server processors. The chip is capable of handling some Amazon processes and also powering some of the services it's offering customers. It comes from the 2015 acquisition of Annapurna Labs.There were three security offerings: AWS IAM Access Analyzer (an identity and access management tool, available today); Amazon Detective (for more efficient and quick investigation of security issues across customer workloads, available in preview today); and AWS Nitro Enclaves (allowing EC2 customers to isolate highly sensitive workloads by separating compute and memory, will be in preview next year).There were many other announcements intended to establish Amazon's leadership and prowess that sets it years ahead of its fast-growing competitors. Independent research estimate that the number two player, Microsoft generates about half of Amazon's revenue and Alphabet generates a quarter. So it may not be incorrect to say that they are playing catchup with independent development, acquisitions and price wars.India DevelopmentsAmazon has launched an India-specific smart speaker called Echo Input. Its only major difference with the Echos as we know them is its portability, which is apparently of great importance in India. So the device comes with a 4800 mAh in-built battery and doesn't need to be plugged in all the time. It can do ten hours of playback on a single charge.Around 70 million Indian shopkeepers are protesting the way online sellers like Amazon and Flipkart are stealing sales. They claim that online sellers clocked huge sales during the Diwali festive season, while they saw declines and that this couldn't have been done using fair means. And since many small businesses (the ones the government tried to protect with recent changes to ecommerce laws) are going out of business, they are demanding an investigation into deep discounting and other practices followed by ecommerce giants.Online sellers like Amazon claim that they are merely marketplaces for smaller third-party sellers and that while they indicate to their sellers what prices will fetch the most sales, the final decision is left to those sellers. Amazon private label products do sell on the platform though, so it isn't clear what mechanism it's using for the workaround.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has announced an investigation and another government official indicated that a dedicated e-commerce regulator may be in the cards.Energy VowAmazon has announced three new renewable energy projects in the U.S. and Spain that will enable it to meet 80% of its needs with renewable energy by 2024 and the 100% target by 2030 on its path to net zero carbon by 2040.'Earlier this year, we announced The Climate Pledge, setting a goal to meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be net zero carbon by 2040,' said Kara Hurst, Director of Sustainability at Amazon. 'We're committed to investing in renewable energy as a critical step toward addressing our carbon footprint globally.'Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases.

Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:Can Tech Majors Survive Trump's Tariffs?The Trump administration has spared a set of high-tech products that include Apple, Inc.Apple Watch and AirPods headphone from the latest round of tariffs, per Bloomberg. On Sep 17, Trump announced tariffs of 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods in a statement that is likely to take effect on Sep 24. However, Apple's shares still plummeted 2.7% on Monday.It's not only Apple but other tech majors too took a hit after the announcement of fresh tariffs. Tech stocks have been reeling under pressure for quite some time, particularly those that have significant exposure to China and generate substantial portion of their revenues from that country. In fact, a few tech players, including Apple, had earlier this month stated that another round of tariffs could hurt them.Will Apple Escape Tariff Troubles?Apparently, yes. Per Bloomberg, Apple's Apple Watch and AirPods headphone have been spared the latest round of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, according to the office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The 10% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods is likely to come into effect on Sep 24. Also, similar smart watches like competitor Fitbit, Inc. are not on the list. However, both Apple and Fitbit's shares plummeted on Monday. Shares of Fitbit declined 1.1%.Moreover, smart watches that use Bluetooth wireless communications, the technology used in Apple Watch and AirPods, too might be exempted from the latest round of tariffs. In fact, the Trump administration had removed proposals on flat-panel television sets from the first round of tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods in June.Earlier this month, Apple had said that some of its products, including Apple Watch, would be affected if another round of tariffs is imposed. This saw shares of Apple declining for most of last week. In response, Trump tweeted that there's an easy way of avoiding tariffs for Apple and that isby shifting its production to the United States. Apple has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7].Per International Data Corp,Apple sold 4.7 billion smart watches in 2017, while Fitbit sold 2.7 billion. Apple does a bulk of its manufacturing in China via contract manufacturers. Hence higher tariffs mean importing its products to the United States at a higher cost. This could make Apple shift production to the United States and other markets.It is now to be seen how China retaliates. China is one of the biggest markets for Apple. The company shipped more than 41 million iPhones to China in 2017, generating around 20% of its total revenues. China could make things difficult for Apple if the trade war escalates via taxes and regulatory measures.What's in Store for Other Tech Companies?Apple isn't the only tech major worried about tariffs. Earlier this month, a number of big tech companies like Dell Technologies and Cisco Systems, Inc. had requested U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to reconsider White House's plan of imposing tariffs of up to 25% on Chinese imports as it would affect their business.On Monday, shares of Cisco Systems, Dell and Hewlett Packard declined 0.6%, 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively. According to a recent report by Morgan Stanley, tit-for-tat tariffs would have an increasingly detrimental effect on the global supply chain. Tech companies with significant exposure to China have been reeling since Trump announced tariffs in early March.This includes a number of chipmakers like Qualcomm, Inc. and Micron Technology, Inc., which generate maximum revenues from China. Shares of Skyworks Solutions, Qualcomm, Broadcom and Micron declined 1.7%, 2.5%, 0.7% and 1.6%, respectively, on Sep 17. Tech companies, particularly chipmakers, will now be waiting to see how China retaliates to these tariffs. 5 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: FacebookFB[1], DropboxDBX[2], YirendaiYRD[3], ANGI HomeservicesANGI[4] and EtsyETSY[5].Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog: How Will the Proposed 'Crypto Bill' Impact Facebook?Based on the limited information currently available from media reports, the new bill proposing to block big tech from finance, may not have the desired impact on Facebook.According to reports, the Democratic majority that leads the House Financial Services Committee, has proposed, in the \"Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act,\" that \"A large platform utility may not establish, maintain, or operate a digital asset that is intended to be widely used as medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or any other similar function, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\"The draft explicitly bans 'large platform utilities from being a financial institution or being affiliated with a person that is a financial institution.'Moreover, this large platform has been defined as a company whose main business is the operation of an online platform service with at least $25 billion in annual revenue. </p><p>There's also a proposed million-dollar daily fine for contravention.So it does appear that the act is intended to stop the launch of or Facebook's direct involvement in Libra immediately and deter big tech from getting into this line of business going forward.The House Financial Services staff are expecting some opposition in the house, where it hasn't officially been presented yet. But it has become a necessary topic for discussion and for deciding a regulatory framework on, given that Libra is slated to launch in 2020.Impact on FacebookEven if Facebook extricates itself from its 'affiliation' to Libra, nothing can be done about the fact that the currency was developed with Facebook's platform in mind. So it will work very well on Facebook. Since a new currency, especially of the crypto variety, needs largescale adoption to be successful, whatever the group responsible for the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the currency, will consider it prudent to leverage Facebook's platform. So in the absence of a personal grudge, they might very well cut a deal with Facebook.Facebook already has a plan of getting 100 interested industry players on board, including banks. Government regulation and oversight might actually facilitate the process.Adoption beyond Facebook was a later goal and if Facebook gives up its affiliation, it may not benefit from this.RecommendationsFacebook shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Worth considering instead for exposure to the space are buy-ranked stocks like Dropbox, Yirendai, ANGI Homeservices and Etsy.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: FacebookFB[1], MicrosoftMSFT[2], AlphabetGOOGL[3], Amazon AMZN[4] and AppleAAPL[5].Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:Will the Campaign to Break Up Big Tech Succeed?Earlier this month, a consensus emerged among Democratic contenders that Big Tech should be broken up. </p><p>Kamala Harris feels that 'we have to seriously take a look' at dismantling the monopolies of the likes of Facebook. Joe Biden pitched in that such a move is 'something we should take a really hard look at.'Even staunch Republicans like Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley are making similar noises about the subject. But leading the pack is Elizabeth Warren, who has promised to oversee a breakup of Big Tech if she wins the presidency. Warren's proposals transcend contemporary antitrust law's focus on pricing.Instead, she argues that breaking up such tech majors would encourage innovation and promote competition by allowing startups to flourish. This goes a step beyond earlier proposals which call for greater scrutiny of mergers in the tech arena. However, it is to be seen whether such a proposal is politically feasible for a likely Democrat successor to President Trump.Greater Scrutiny on the Big FiveThe top five U.S. tech majors are also the five most valuable companies in America. And over the years, the level of antitrust scrutiny has only increased for them. In the late 1990s, Microsoft was scrutinized for the same. More recently, huge fines were slapped on Alphabet by European antitrust regulators.In contrast, U.S. regulators have taken a favorable view of the incredible growth of Big Tech. Better smart phones, free online services and cheap e-commerce are believed to be the favorable outcomes of their growing power and influence. This has led U.S. regulators to believe that the success of tech majors has had a positive effect on competitive markets.However, it is equally true that tech majors have been crushing suppliers as well as nascent competition. In the process, they have employed a range of questionable tactics, as was witnessed during Amazon's ruthless price wars against its competitors.The situation has been quite similar when it comes to Apple's authoritative management of its app stores and Facebook's questionable data security practices, which resulted in numerous public scandals. Of the big five, Microsoft and Facebook carry a Zack Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6].Is Warren's Proposal Mostly Symbolic?In March, Warren proposed that Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet should be broken up. Meanwhile, major restrictions should be imposed on how Apple and Microsoft go about doing business.According to her plan, a company with annual global revenues in excess of $25 billion which 'offers to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties' should be designated as 'platform utility.' This entity would be prevented from owning any participants on such a platform.The core business models of Apple and Microsoft would remain largely unaffected by such regulations. But it would have severe major implications for the three other members of this elite group. At the same time, the present day structure of Microsoft's Xbox Store and Apple's iOS App Store would be rendered invalid.But Warren has cautiously omitted all references to the kind of impact these new regulations would have on Big Tech. This is believed to be proof of the fact that her proposal is mostly symbolic rather than practical.ConclusionWarren's proposal to regulate Big Tech has found favor among other Democratic contenders. However, the strong link between leading Democrats and Silicon Valley giants make such regulations unviable in the real world. Further, her proposals run counter to conventional antitrust laws which focus on pricing and consumer interest.This is why it is unreasonable to expect a future White House to go so far as to attempt to break up big tech. However, a successful Democratic bid for the presidency would bring such companies under considerable regulatory scrutiny. This would have major implications for users, suppliers and competitors.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: JP Morgan JPM[1], UnitedHealth GroupUNH[2], Lockheed MartinLMT[3] and BHP BillitonBHP[4].Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog: New Earnings Season Opens: Global Week AheadThe dominant trader focus inside the Global Week Ahead will surely be the Q2 earnings season -- with the usual early focus upon Financials.Key names are Citigroup, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs,Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, eBay, Netflix, Microsoft,BlackRock,United and Amex.Fifty-seven S...00 firms in total should release Q2 earnings.Do not expect a robust U.S. earnings season. Consensus pegs a -2.0% y/y drop.Any relative individual share performance always lies in terms of what is priced into shares via advance earnings guidance. </p><p>Covering analysts often undercut company earnings estimates before the new quarterly reports hit the tape. In turn, on that count, earnings seasons in the U.S. almost always surprise higher.Next, I show Reuters' five world market themes for the Global Week Ahead. I put them in order of importance to equities.(1) Q2 Earnings Reports Start for U.S. and European FirmsInvestors are anxious to take the pulse of Wall Street and Europe Inc. to check if second-quarter results justify record U.S. stocks and Europe's best first-half share performance in more than two decades.Expectations are already low, as analysts continue to take a red pen to their estimates.With valuations stretched and lingering worries about the economic impact of protracted U.S.-China trade tensions, disappointing results could pour cold water on the rally. U.S. earnings are seen contracting by -0.3% year-on-year \u2014 its weakest performance in three years, according to data compiled by I/B/E/S Refinitiv. That's down from +1.6% growth in Q1. Companies on Europe's benchmark STOXX 600 will report growth of +0.8% for the quarter, data shows, an improvement from the -2% drop in Q1 but down from +1.8% growth expected just a week ago.Full-year expectations are dimming as well: Consensus based on the MSCI index pegs FY earnings growth for Europe at +4.1% - the lowest since 2016 and half the levels forecast at the start of the year. For the United States, it is at +2.7% versus +7.5% in January. Wall Street banks, including JP Morgan, will release results in coming days.(2) China's Economy Shows Signs of Tariff PressureChina's economy and businesses are showing more visible signs of pain from the trade war, as recent data on producer prices and exports revealed. Monday's GDP data, no matter how well-massaged, could show quarterly growth at its weakest in three decades and raise doubts over a government aim to keep 2019 growth in the 6-6.5% range.Beijing's monetary and fiscal stimulus has hitherto been a fraction of what it was during the 2015 downturn. The government is clearly wary of encouraging another property bubble and reckless rise in investment, both of which were targeted during the 2017 campaign to cut leverage.But with worsening economic headlines, falling corporate investment and a looming Fed rate cut, the People's Bank of China cannot merely be operating behind the scenes through local government spending and liquid money markets.Many expect that a bold, symbolic statement about Beijing's policy easing intent is needed \u2014 most certainly if the Fed also cuts at the end of July. Even though that may just involve the customary, token 10 basis-point cut in China's benchmark one-year 4.35% policy rate.(3) Tariff Heat Picks Up on Europe, TooJust when you thought there may be a glimmer of hope on world trade as talks between Beijing and Washington resume \u2014 raising the possibility that the world's top two economies could clinch a deal \u2014 the tariff heat switches to Europe.On Thursday, French lawmakers approved a tax on big tech companies, potentially opening up a new front in a trade row between Washington and the European Union.President Trump has ordered an investigation into the French tech tax plans, a probe that could lead to the U.S. imposing new tariffs or other trade restrictions.And there's already lots of shuttle diplomacy going on: German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, after meetings in Washington on Thursday, predicted a 50-50 chance of averting U.S. auto tariffs and that it will take weeks or months to resolve at least some of the thorny trade disputes clouding U.S.-European relations. Never mind all the differences over issues such as aircraft subsidies, car imports and the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.Meanwhile U.S. Trade Rep Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin are Beijing-bound in the very near future.Markets worried over the impact of trade wars on the health of the global economy will be watching closely for progress and deterioration on all those trade war fronts in days to come.(4) A July 17-18 Meeting of G7 Finance Ministers - Commemorating 75 Years of Bretton WoodsIn July 1944 as World War Two raged, finance chiefs from the world's main trading nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.That agreement, signed July 22, was one of the first global monetary policy and currency agreements \u2014 re-establishing a gold standard for exchange rates, backing away from competitive devaluations and setting up the International Monetary Fund to bridge balance of payments gaps.But as the Bretton Woods pact turns 75, that spirit of cooperation, whether on exchange rates or trade, is waning. Trade protectionism is on the rise, and nationalism and unilateralism is being championed by Trump, who says the rest of the world is stealing from the United States via competitive currency devaluations against the dollar.And so the July 17-18 meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bankers in the French town of Chantilly could well be a fraught one. Taking place at the same time as IMF and World Bank heads join ECB officials in Paris to commemorate Bretton Woods, G7 discussions will focus less on the past and more on how to resolve pressing problems such as the world economy, Sino-U.S. trade tensions, fair exchange rates between the major economies, U.S. anger over France's plan to tax tech firms such as Google, and Trump's threat to slap levies on European autos.Other issues on the table include tax havens, cyber security and Facebook's proposed new coin Libra that has enlivened the debate about regulation of cryptocurrencies.(5) The U.K. Pound Gets Battered and BatteredLosing support from monetary policy expectations, the already battered pound faces a tough week ahead. Key economic data such as earnings growth, inflation and retail sales will be closely watched by markets desperately trying to gauge where interest rates might be in a couple of years from now.Markets have nearly priced in a Bank of England rate cut over the next 12 months after Governor Mark Carney signaled he could be about to join other central banks in cutting rates. Economists expect year-on-year inflation for June to come in at 2% on Wednesday. But if the reading falls below the central bank's 2% target rate, chances of a rate cut may rise.However, other data is expected to come in a touch stronger. Average weekly earnings are expected to rise on Tuesday by 3.2% year-on-year in the three months to May versus a 3.1% increase in April. Retail sales \u2014 due out on Thursday \u2014 are expected have risen by 2.5% year-on-year in June after a 2.3% increase in May.Brexit, of course, remains the elephant in the room and is the main reason why sterling has fallen by 20% since June 2016, with the country gearing up to hear who the country's next prime minister will be on July 23.Top Zacks #1 Rank Stocks(1) UnitedHealth Group:This is the granddaddy of HMO stocks, at $252B in market cap. The fresh Zacks #1 Rank here comes with a B for Zacks Value and a B for Zacks Growth. Now may be a great time to scoop up some shares for the next run higher.(2) Lockheed Martin: This is a big, big defense stock. The market cap of $104B is delivered by a high $370 share price. That gives the stock a C for Zacks Value. Yet defense worries are climbing with Iran. Bet on more upside here.(3) BHP Billiton: This is a $91B market cap mining company based in Australia. Iron ore prices are staying high and covering analysts are, in turn, getting more and more bullish on this stock. The A for Zacks Value and B for Growth are also attractive.Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:9339support@zacks.com[5]\">9339support@zacks.com[5]</email> ;<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.zacks.com\">http://www.zacks.com</url>[6] Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free[5].&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog: &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Technology Stock Roundup&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Most of the big tech companies have already reported so the last week saw increased focus on takeover rumors, regulatory issues and new products.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Earnings Highlights&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Priceline ( PCLN[6] ) : Priceline reported above the Zacks Consensus Estimate [7] on both the top and bottom lines, but investors shrugged off the results, focusing instead on the guidance and the impact of FX on its business. This is not unreasonable because Priceline derives the bulk of its business from international markets particularly in Europe, which has a significant impact on its revenue and profits.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; TripAdvisor ( TRIP[8] ) : The leading review site missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate [9] on both the top and bottom lines with currency negatively impacting results (53% of revenue was generated internationally) and acquisitions contributing positively. Both the Hotels and Other segments grew strongly from the year-ago quarter.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Alibaba ( BABA[10] ) : Alibaba may have missed on the bottom line because of increased investments to boost growth in multiple areas, but its top line sailed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate [11] while growing 44.8% year over year. Active buyers grew strong double-digits and mobile GMV jumped triple-digits. Moreover, mobile GMV was 51% of total GMV, compared to just 27% last year. The lunar new yearfalling within the quarter helped results.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; NVIDIA ( NVDA[12] ) : The chipmaker missed on both the top and bottom lines [13] , so it's not surprising that the shares took a thrashing. The Tegra line was a weak point in the last quarter and the PC market slump had an impact on guidance.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Is Yelp Up for Grabs? &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; It seems like a wild rumor to drive up share prices because the company, which has reasonably strong revenue growth rates continues to make losses and has been more abused than praised in recent times for false reviews and ranking system. Its greatest positive is the user base, which is largely mobile and local, which is why some companies may want to buy it.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; For example, companies like Priceline, Expedia or TripAdvisor could benefit from the review database as well as the number of mobile users. In Priceline's case, there is the added attraction of removing OpenTable's competition in the restaurant reservation business. Both Facebook and Google continue to boost their local capabilities, so both could benefit in that respect.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; And lastly, Amazon could also be interested, since it has an appetite for just about anything. But at the end of the day, everyone would think twice about the disgruntled user base, negative publicity and legal proceedings. And this could have an effect on the price tag.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; What EU's Single Digital Market Means for U.S. Tech Cos &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; The European Union is attempting to remove online trade barriers between the 28 member countries to boost cross-border trade while also bringing increased regulation of the essential digital platforms offered by some U.S. tech firms.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; The EU to deal with language barriers, legal barriers and barriers related to telecom and networking infrastructure. Moreover, there is also a practice of fixing different prices for different regions and even restricting access to some regions called geo-blocking.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; While the first two barriers are technical and may be removed with some effort, the third related to the telecom infrastructure will involve an overhaul of the sector and therefore member states could fall out at any time. Geo-blocking can be removed immediately but enforcement will be difficult because of the level of monitoring it will necessitate.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; And there again will most likely be significant difference of opinion amongst member states. So the promise of more choice and cheaper prices may be hard to bring about.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Qorvo, Inc.(QRVO[1]), Applied Materials, Inc.</p><p>(AMAT[2]), VeriSign, Inc.(VRSN[3]) and Aflac Inc.(AFL[4]). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free[5]. Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog: 4 Stocks to Buy as S...00 Hits 2-Month High The S...00 logged its highest one-day gain in percentage terms since Mar 11 on Tuesday. Technology and financial stocks propelled the S...00 higher as all 10 of the index's sectors ended the day in the green. A strong comeback for sectors which have suffered losses through most of the year was the most notable event of the day. Rising fuel prices, strong economic data and a change in the manner in which investors perceive a possible rate hike seem to be fuelling these gains. This implies that concerns that were weighing on investors for quite some time now have dissipated. Picking technology and financial stocks from the S...00 looks like a prudent move at this time. Rate Hike Fears Fall, Financials Set to Gain Markets were gripped with fear following the release of Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) minutes on May 18. But last Friday, a change in perception among investors was clearly perceptible as benchmarks ended higher despite speculations that a Fed rate hike in June was most likely. This is because a data dependent Fed has shown keenness in making such a move due to encouraging economic data, something which investors have begun to latch on. Tuesday marked the release of record new home sales data, which increased by 1.6% from March to 619,000 in April, settling at its highest level since Jan 2008. This report came on the heels of a number of positive economic indicators. This led investors to react positively with tech and financial stocks leading the markets to close in the green. Financials are a sector which will immediately benefit from a rate hike. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) and the Financial Services Select Sector SPDR (XLFS) have lost 1.2% and 2.5% year to date, respectively. But, on Tuesday, XLFS and XLF increased 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively. Over the last five days the XLF and XLFS have gained 2.9% and 3.4%, respectively. Tech Stocks Stage Strong Rebound Meanwhile, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) increased 1.9% and was the biggest advancer among the S...00 sectors during Tuesday's session. XLK has gained 1.6% up to now in May after a spate of poor earnings numbers from big tech names dragged down the sector last month. Under par results from Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple were among the major disappointments last month on the tech stock front. However, as the earnings season draws to a close, it seems the tech sector's results have outperformed the broader index. Currently, we have Q1 results from 96.3% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S...00 index. Total earnings for these Tech companies are down 5.4% while revenues have gained a slender 0.8%, with 67.3% beating EPS estimates and 56.4% topping revenue estimates. Excluding the Apple drag, total earnings for the rest of the sector would have been up 0.8%. In contrast, 480 S...00 members that have reported results with estimates for the still-to-come 20 members, total Q1 earnings are currently expected to be down 6.6% from the same period last year on 1.1% lower revenues. Additionally, revenues for Facebook increased 52% in the first quarter and its shares have gained more than 6% over the last month. Shares of cloud computing company salesforce.com[6] have gained 8.2% over May up to now after experiencing double-digit revenue growth across all its divisions. A recovery from Apple has also boosted the sector's odds of success. Shares of iPhone maker had declined after it reported its first quarterly decline in revenues in nearly 13 years. However, the company has made a recovery after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported in a regulatory filing that it has acquired 9.8 million shares or a $1 billion stake in Apple during the first quarter. The iPhone maker has gained nearly 8% since May 12. Together, these factors have ensured a gain of 3.8% for XLK during May so far. Our Choices Investors seem to have shrugged off fears of a possible rate hike in June and are choosing to focus on the strong economic data which are fuelling such a move. As a result, sectors which were out of favor till recently are making a comeback. This is why it makes perfect sense to add stocks from the financial and tech sectors of the S...00 to your portfolio. Selecting winning stocks, however, may be a difficult proposition. This is where our VGM score[7] comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score. Qorvo, Inc.(QRVO[8]) is a leading provider of core technologies and radio frequency (RF) solutions for mobile, infrastructure and aerospace/defense applications. Qorvo has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of B. The company has expected earnings growth of 15.2% for the current year.

Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:Big Tech Saves Q2 Earnings Season Despite the coronavirus pandemic and concerted anti-trust scrutiny, big tech companies reported blowout June-quarter earnings on Jul 30, surpassing Wall Street expectations. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook together racked up profits of almost $29 billion on sales of nearly $200 billion in the second quarter.And combined revenues for the four, excluding Alphabet's traffic acquisition cost, or TAC, was $198.11 billion, beating Wall Street's expectations of combined revenues of $181.5 billion, and way more than $165.7 billion in the year-ago quarter.Interestingly, the big four tech companies reported stellar results a day after a five-and-a-half-hour-long grilling of their CEOs by house members in a historic antitrust hearing. Nonetheless, shares of the big tech companies in after-hour trading pushed toward a market cap increase of more than $200 billion. Currently, the big four tech companies' worth is almost $5 trillion.Apple displayed strength across all segments, especially the June quarter has been strong for Macs and iPads. In late trading on Jul 30, the iPhone maker's shares rallied 6%, topping $400 a share for the first time. Notably, the company posted revenues of $59.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.58, beating analysts' expectations of $52.1 billion and $2.09 a share.Similarly, Amazon's $88.9 billion in sales in the quarter ending June 2020 was nearly $8 billion higher than the company's original guidance. Amazon's second-quarter profit of $5.2 billion or $10.30 a share were also five times the consensus estimate. Despite Chief Executive Jeff Bezos spending a huge amount related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon's stunning results were mostly due to an uptick in e-commerce business of 47.8% from last year to $45.9 billion in the second quarter. Amazon's stock rallied 5% in late trading on Jul 30.Search giant Google's parent Alphabet also registered revenues of $38.3 billion and profits of $10.13 a share in the said quarter, ahead of analysts' expectations of $37.3 billion and $7.94 a share. YouTube and Cloud services have been the saving grace for Alphabet. YouTube's ad business increased 6% from a year ago, while Google Cloud's revenues climbed 43%. Alphabet rose 0.5% after hours.The social network giant Facebook also posted revenues of $18.7 billion and profits of $1.80 a share, higher than expectations of $17.3 billion and $1.39, respectively. Facebook's apps, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, witnessed a surge in traffic in the June quarter, helping the company report stunning results. After hours, Facebook's shares were up 6.2% to $249, just short of its intra-day record high of $250.12.Not just these big four, last week, Microsoft saw its Intelligent Cloud division rake in $13.4-billion sales for the fiscal fourth quarter against analysts' estimate of $13.11 billion. Sales also grew 17% year over year. In fact, Microsoft reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $11.2 billion or $1.46 a share on revenues of $38 billion. Analysts expected profit of $1.38 a share on sales of $36.59 billion.What's more, for the tech sector as a whole, second-quarter earnings are expected to decline 10.9% despite 0.3% higher revenues. But that's far better compared to the overall earnings picture. This is because total earnings for the S&amp;#38;P 500 companies are projected to decline 41.1% on 8.9% lower revenues (read more:An Improving Earnings Outlook Despite Covid-19 Concerns[6]). Basically, the broader tech sector has remained reasonably unscathed in the second quarter amid the current economic downturn owing to the pandemic. This is primarily because investors saw that these companies have been gaining immensely from secular trends like cloud computing and robust telecommunications infrastructure \u2014 demand for which skyrocketed amid the health crisis.Further, with the majority of the population trapped at home with an Internet connection, trends like streaming media, video chats with friends and online connections with co-workers have picked up. These trends, in turn, have bolstered the need for newer technologies.Another factor working in favor of tech shares is the receding threat of regulations. Before the pandemic, policymakers worldwide were devising plans to impose regulations on these companies but this has taken a back seat owing to the pandemic.

In fact, tech stocks continue to achieve new highs, propelling the broader stock market.

Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog:  Forget Big Tech, Biotech ETFs are Soaring Higher Biotech stocks have been surging over the past 2-3 weeks,as the high-flying tech stocks take a breather. </p><p>The iShares Biotech Index Fund has risen about 10% over the past month, while the S...00 is almost flat and theSPDR Technology ETF (NYSEARCA: XLK[12] - Free Report [13] ) is down about 3%. One of the main reasons behind this sudden optimism for the industry is the hope for easing of regulations. A draft executive order obtained by the New York Times [14] suggests that the Trump administration plans to focus on easing regulatory hurdles rather than lowering drug prices. According to the NYT report, most of the officials responsible for drug policy have strong ties to the industry and the proposals reflected industry influence. This is an excellent news for the industry which has been in the political crosshairs for quite some time. (Read: Trump Slump to Oil Slide\u2014Top ETF Stories of First Half 2017 [15] ) Investors also expect a favorable environment for innovation and a streamlined drug approval process. The Food and Drug Administration has approved 21 novel drugs in 2017 compared with an average of 15 from 2011 to 2016 through June each year, per WSJ. The recent rebound in biotech stocks is also a result of attractive valuations after almost two years of underperformance. Further, big pharma companies hold a lot of cash abroad and a repatriation tax holiday promised by Trump would help them bring that cash home to spend on acquisitions among others. Rising M...ctivity could propel these stocks higher. Before the election, investors saw Hillary as a bigger risk to the sector. Her tweet on price gouging in the specialty drug market had sent biotech stocks and ETF tumbling. In fact, 2016 was the worst year for biotech stocks in more than a decade, with the broad index down more than 20%. (Read: How Tesla is Driving the Lithium ETF Higher [16] ) The sector had a nice relief rally after the election as Trump's plans to reduce drug regulations and expedite drug approval process boosted the sentiment. However, the rally did not last long as he targeted the drug companies again, with comments like 'they are getting away with murder' and promised a new bidding process that would save billions of dollars. We have highlighted five best performing biotech ETFs of 2017 below: Ark Genomic Revolution Multi-Sector ETF ARKG focuses on companies involved mainly in molecular diagnostics, bioinformatics, beyond DNA, gene therapy, next generation oncology and targeted therapeutics. (Read: Top and Flop Zones of First Half and Their ETFs) [17] The product is actively managed and charges an annual fee of 75 basis points. It has just about $20 million in AUM. ARKG is up more than 36% this year. Bioshares Biotechnology Clinical Trials BBC invests in clinical trials stage biotechnology companies. These are typically younger, smaller companies, which do not have a drug approved, but instead focus on testing their experimental drugs in clinical trials, where chances of success are usually low. The product has a high expense ratio of 85 basis points. It has managed to gather less than $25 million in assets so far. BBC is up more than 34% year-to-date. SPDR S...iotech ETF (NYSEARCA:XBI[18] - Free Report [19] ) XBI, one of the most popular biotech ETFs, follows a modified equal weighted biotech index which provides broad exposure across large, mid and small cap stocks. It charges 35 basis points for expenses and has assets exceeding $3.8 billion. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rated ETF has 99 holdings as of now. It has risen more than 34% this year. First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund (NYSEARCA:FBT[20] - Free Report [21] ) FBT also follows an equal-weighted methodology. It has a more concentrated exposure than other broader biotech ETFs with just 30 holdings focused primarily on recombinant DNA technology, molecular biology, genetic engineering, monoclonal antibody-based technology, lipid/liposome technology, and genomics. The product has an expense ratio of 56 basis points. It is up more than 28% year-to-date. BioShares Biotechnology Products ETF (NASDAQ:BBP[22] - Free Report [23] ) BBP invests in products stage biotechnology companies. These companies have already successfully completed clinical trials and have received FDA approval to sell and market a drug and are now focused on driving sales. The fund is expensive, with an annual fee of 85 basis points. It has $40 million in AUM. BBP has risen about 23% in 2017. The Bottom-Line Investors should remember that biotech is a high-growth, high-risk sector and they should be prepared for higher volatility. Particularly the ETFs that invest in unique, specialized sub-segments of the biotech industry or have a lot of exposure to smaller companies, are more volatile than broader market-cap weighted biotech ETFs like IBB. Ultra-cheap, broad healthcare ETFs likeSPDR Healthcare ETF (NYSEARCA: XLV[24] - Free Report [25] ) are more suitable for investors with lower risk tolerance. At the same time, with the aging global population in need for more advanced medicines and rapidly rising healthcare spending in emerging markets, the longer-term outlook for biotech companies remains positive. Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar. They're virtually unknown to the general public. Yet today's 220 Zacks Rank #1 \"Strong Buys\" were generated by the stock-picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015. Its average gain has been a stellar +26% per year.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include Triumph Bancorp, Inc.TBK[1], Century Aluminum Company CENX[2], Boise Cascade CompanyBCC[3], Arch Coal, Inc.</p><p>ARCH[4] and Oasis Midstream Partners LPOMP[5].Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog: Q1 Earnings to Take Wall Street by Storm: Top 5 PicksRecent weeks have been dominated by escalating trade hostility between the United States and China and regulation of Big Tech. Starting this week, corporate earnings, revenues and management outlook will determine the future course of the stock market. Analysts are looking for a strong Q1 earnings season, mostly in response to the corporate tax cut policy signed into law last December, and robust economic growth both at home and abroad.While the highest year-over-year earnings growth is likely to be notched by energy players, materials, construction, industrial products, technology and financials are also expected to contribute handsomely. Thus, for the next few weeks, let us keep an eye on stocks from these sectors that are likely to make the most of the Q1 earnings season. Here, we should also bear in mind that better-than-expected earnings performances generally lead to a rally in the share price, which eventually enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts.Q1 Earnings to See Double-Digit GainsInvestors are looking forward to the outset of the Q1 earnings season onApr 12 and 13, when majors like BlackRock, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan will be reporting their Q1 numbers, and for the whole of S...00 results are expected to be impressive.Total earnings for the S...00 companies are estimated to improve 16% from the same period last year on 7.4% higher revenues. Such an uptick will follow 13.5% earnings growth on 8.5% revenue improvement last quarter, marking the best quarterly performance in more than six years.The gains are likely to be broad-based, with nearly all the sectors expected to report year-over-year earnings growth, except for autos and conglomerates. Around 11 of these sectors are likely to come up with double-digit growth.What Will Drive Earnings?Earnings are likely to rise mostly on Trump's polices, including tax cuts and solid global economic growth. The latest tax laws gave companies massive tax relief as they will now be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% for bringing back money held overseas.Trump's economy is also in good shape, with the jobless rate remaining at a 17-year low of 4.1% in March, while workers' hourly wages rose 8 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.82 in the month. The United States at the same time added an average of 202,000 jobs a month in Q1, faster than the average gains in the same period of 2017 and 2016. U.S. consumer sentiment in March, by the way, reached its highest level since 2004, courtesy of a healthy job market.The global economy too is estimated to expand at a rate of 3.1% year over year in 2018. This comes on top of a promising 3% growth rate in 2017, per the World Bank.Potential Gainers of Q1The energy sector is poised to report highest earnings growth among all sectors, which is estimated to surge 60.3% from the same period last year on 15.6% higher revenues. Among the sub-sectors, oil and gas exploration and production; oil and gas refining and marketing; oil and gas equipment and services; and oil and gas drilling companies are positioned to report solid growth. A healthy crude pricing scenario and positive free cash flow are primarily backing the optimism.The materials sector has recently been looking up, with Q1 earnings expected to rise 41.4% on 20.2% higher revenues. Construction is likely to report the third-highest year-over-year profit growth, with Q1 earnings poised to be up 36.1% from the same period last year on 15.9% higher revenues.Earnings for the Industrial sector are set to grow 23.9% from the same period last year on 12.3% higher revenues. Firm business investment helped factories expand at a record pace. Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs.Some analysts, in the meantime, are worried that investors will start to rotate out of the crowded tech sector this year and into other sectors that will benefit from the lower taxes. So far though, in spite of such uncertainty, the technology sector outperformed the broader S...00. In fact, Q1 earnings for the tech sector are poised to be up 20.7% from the same period last year on 11.4% higher revenues.High profits are also expected from financial segments as well. Total Q1 earnings for the financial sector are projected to rise 19.1% from the same period last year on 4.5% higher revenues. Banks, insurers and asset managers are all expected to report double-digit growth mostly on heightened volatility and higher interest rates (read more:Banks Set for Blockbuster Q1 Earnings: 5 Top Picks[6]).Buy These 6 Stocks for Stellar Earnings GrowthRepublican tax cut and a very strong economic backdrop looks set to deliver another round of stellar earnings growth in Q1.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.VRTX[1], Biogen, Inc.</p><p>BIIB[2], BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.BMRN[3] and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.ALXN[4].Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:4 Big Drugs Stocks Ripe for a New TakeoverSwiss pharmaceutical company Novartis has announced a deal to buy The Medicines Company for $85.00 per share in cash or for a total value of $9.7 billion. The offer price represented a premium of 24% to Medicines Company's closing price of $68.55 on Friday. The deal, if successfully closed, will add Medicines Company's PCSK9 inhibitor inclisiran, a potential treatment to control cholesterol levels, to Novartis pipeline.The Medicines Company has a partnership with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals for inclisiran, which has demonstrated potent and durable LDL-C (bad cholesterol) reduction with an excellent safety and tolerability profile in clinical studies. Regulatory applications are expected to be filed in the United States later this year and in Europe during first-quarter 2020.There has been a flurry of M...eal announcements this year in the biotech/drug industry. In fact, 2019 witnessed two mega-merger announcements. Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired leading biotech company Celgene for a whopping $74 billion. The deal was announced in January and closed in November. In June, AbbVie announced a definitive deal to buy Allergan for $63 billion. The deal, subject to necessary approvals, is expected to close in early 2020.These will be among the largest acquisitions in the drug/biotech sector in the recent times.Meanwhile, smaller biotech research firms investigating new therapies or interesting pipeline candidates have also garnered attention of bigger players this year. Oncology and gene therapy have mainly been the focus areas for M...ctivities.The deals included Pfizer's purchase of small cancer drugmaker Array BioPharma for $12 billion, Lilly's purchase of small cancer biotech Loxo Oncology for $8 billion and Merck's buyout of Immune Design. In non-oncology deals, Roche is due to acquire Spark Therapeutics for $4.8 billion, per a deal announced in February. Also, Alexion is set to buy clinical-stage biotech Achillion Pharmaceuticals for $930 million, per a deal announced last month.There are several reasons for the flurry of M...nnouncements. Big pharma companies are cash rich, especially after the tax overhaul in 2017, which reduced the tax rate. Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small/mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines.Also, sloppy sales of mature drugs due to pricing pressure and generic/biosimilar competition, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices and emergence of big tech firms like Apple and Google, in the healthcare industry whet the M...ppetite of large drugmakers. Another important factor leading to acquisitions this year is the decline in biotech/pharma valuations toward the end of 2018.In this article, we discuss some mid- and large-cap names that may be logical acquisition targets for big dug/biotech companies like Gilead, Amgen, Pfizer, Merck, Johnson ...hnson and others.The fields that have attracted a lot of industry attention lately are immuno-oncology treatments and drugs to combat rare diseases.Investors should consider the current sales performance of drugs/products, sales prospects and the quality of the pipeline while buying drug/biotech stocks.The four companies discussed here have most of these factors going in their favor and appear to be good investment options. Acquisitions of very small drug/biotech companies are difficult to predict and are quite frequent. Hence, these have been excluded from the discussion.Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Vertex's holds a dominant position in the cystic fibrosis (CF) market. Consistent positive regulatory approvals have led to an increase in the eligible patient population for Vertex's approved CF medicines in the past two-three years. In 2019 alone, the company received nine new regulatory approvals for label expansions for its CF medicines globally. With consistent expansion in patient population and additional ex-U.S. reimbursement arrangements, Vertex's sales drugs have been rising consistently.Importantly, its triple-combo regimen called Trikafta was approved by the FDA, five months ahead of the schedule in October and is expected to be Vertex's key revenue driver in 2020. The regimen is crucial for long-term growth as it has the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients. Meanwhile, its non-CF pipeline is progressing rapidly with data in multiple diseases expected in 2020.Vertex, with a market cap is around $57 billion, could be a potential buyer as well as a good acquisition option for much larger companies like Pfizer. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[5].Biogen, Inc.Biogen, with a market cap is around $55 billion, could also be a potential buyer as well as a possible buyout target. We believe its buyout potential has increased after it announced intention to seek U.S. approval of Alzheimer's treatment, aducanumab, just a few months after halting late-stage studies on the same drug following a futility analysis.Biogen holds a strong position in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market with a wide range of products, including Tecfidera and Tysabri. Its efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer's are also commendable. Its newest drug for spinal muscular atrophy treatment, Spinraza, has multi-billion dollar potential and is generating strong sales. Biogen also regularly in-licenses assets to build its pipeline. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.Companies that have product portfolio/pipeline of rare disease drugs are in great demand as it is a less competitive space and the expensive treatments can bring in huge profits. BioMarin is one such drug developer. Its market cap is $14.4 billion.BioMarin has seven commercially approved rare disease drugs with some more in the pipeline, which makes it worthy of a buyout. Its key orphan disease drugs - Vimizim and Kuvan - are doing well, backed by strong underlying patient demand trends. The newest rare disease drug in its portfolio, Palynziq, is witnessing strong commercial uptake in the United States.BioMarin believes the injection has peak commercial opportunity of roughly $1 billion as it demonstrated dramatic Phe reductions in PKU patients in pivotal studies. Its rare disease pipeline is progressing well. The company targets regulatory filings for valoctocogene roxaparvovec (valrox) by year-end and vosoritide in 2020.Valrox, a gene therapy for hemophilia A, is anticipated to be transformational, if approvedThere has been speculation about BioMarin's takeover for a long time. Companies like Gilead, Amgen and Roche may be interested in buying it. BioMarin has a Zacks Rank #3.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Like BioMarin, Alexion is also focused on the development and commercialization of life-transforming drugs for the treatment of patients with ultra-rare disorders. Its key drug is Soliris, approved for three severe and ultra-rare disorders \u2014 paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) \u2014 has consistently done well.Alexion received a significant boost in December 2018 with the FDA approval of its long-acting C5 complement inhibitor, Ultomiris, for PNH, which has a four times longer dosing interval than Soliris. The approval has strengthened the company's PNH franchise and reduced its dependence on Soliris.Importantly, last month, the FDA granted approval to Ultomirisfor another indication, aHUS.Alexion is working on expanding the label of Soliris and Ultomiris to include additional indications, which if approved, can boost sales growth. It has two other drugs for rare diseases called Strensiq and Kanuma, which are emerging as key growth drivers, benefiting from continued patient additions.Roche, Pfizer, or Novartis may be interested in buying it. The market cap of Alexion is around $25 billion. It has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020.

He warned for years that the big tech companies were arrogant and clueless and less good for mankind than they believed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Comeuppance, the billionaire investor warned, was coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trouble has arrived. Unfortunately for Thiel, the storm is centred on Facebook, whose board he has been a member of practically since its founding. The social network, which billed itself as bringing democracy and enlightenment to the world, was used by the Russians to subvert democracy and sow confusion in the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even people paid to see the future did not see that one coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The board's role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term problems coming around the corner,\" Thiel said. \"We were far from perfect in doing that.\"</p><p>Thiel, 50, is at the centre of nearly every issue that roils Silicon Valley, ranging from the tech elite's fascination with New Zealand hideaways (Thiel obtained New Zealand citizenship) to bitcoin (he is a major investor) to the problems of herd thinking (he is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles to escape it) to the evolving role of content on the internet (he has been exploring the creation of a media company that would outflank Breitbart and Fox for a younger audience).</p><p>Two subjects are overwhelming everything else: President Donald Trump, whom Thiel aggressively backed for president, and Facebook, whose core mission is being called into question in the wake of the Russian revelations. In a typical Thiel move - he tends to run toward controversy even as his Silicon Valley peers try to make themselves inconspicuous - he agreed, in a rare interview, to talk about both.</p><p>\"It's been a crazier two years than I would have thought,\" Thiel said in his new Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally looks down on Trump Tower.</p><p>Despite the proximity, the mutual enthusiasm between Thiel and Trump seems to have cooled. After Thiel spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016, there were unsourced media reports that said Trump wanted to put him on the Supreme Court. But now even photo ops are rare.</p><p>The investor said he had last spoken to the president \"a few months ago.\"</p><p>\"We don't talk that often,\" he said, but added, \"I can get access any time I want.\"</p><p>The Trump whom Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a candidate who would \"end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,\" move us past \"fake culture wars\" and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space program. That does not seem to be the president he got.</p><p>\"There are all these ways that things have fallen short,\" Thiel said. But he said he had no regrets about his endorsement. \"It's still better than Hillary Clinton or the Republican zombies,\" he said, referring to the other candidates.</p><p>Thiel is routinely labelled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as if in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged,\" the bible of the movement. A gift, he said. A lesser-known but possibly deeper influence was French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Girard, who taught at Stanford University when Thiel was an undergraduate there. For 15 years, on and off, Thiel sat in on a study group about Girard's ideas. Girard believed humans were deeply mimetic, which is to say they copy one another.</p><p>\"It's very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,\" Thiel said. \"Our desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the society around us.\"</p><p>It was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook - where people could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to - when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10 per cent of the company for $500,000.</p><p>He sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months ago, with Facebook's market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of what he had left.</p><p>Last summer, there was a flap when a memo by a fellow board member, Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, appeared in The New York Times. In the memo, Hastings wrote to Thiel that he displayed \"catastrophically bad judgment\" in supporting Trump.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, did not ask him to step down from the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Thiel said, noting that among other things he brings \"ideological diversity.\" He declined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was offering Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow to wake up to what the Russians did.</p><p>\"Remember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said that was crazy - 'How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?' That was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,\" he said. \"They did not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable mistake.\" Facebook declined to comment.</p><p>The anger being turned on Facebook, Thiel argued, is less about Russia specifically and more about tech arrogance - its failure to do so much for so many. It is a sentiment that helped put Trump in the White House.</p><p>\"The Trump campaign slogan, 'Make America Great Again,' was perhaps the single most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,\" he said. \"Silicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.\"</p><p>A friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of California this year. Thiel's advice was that he had better have a good answer to this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The answer, he cautioned, couldn't be a banality, such as \"it's making us more connected,\" and it couldn't be utopian, such as \"it's going to cure all diseases.\"</p><p>\"He wasn't able to come up with an answer, and I couldn't come up with one, either,\" Thiel said.</p><p>He declined to identify the friend, but it is well known in tech circles that Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator, the prominent startup accelerator, was thinking about running. Altman confirmed it was him and said he had decided not to run \"for many reasons.\"</p><p>There is a big painting of a cresting wave in Thiel's living room, and it might as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.</p><p>\"Having some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing for a company,\" he said. \"But there is some point where it gets crazy and self-delusional.\" He added that the companies \"are probably in some trouble - maybe it's a little, maybe it's a lot.\" The prospect of government regulation looms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2018031445304471</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RW4-N671-JDH3-G0RR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1105\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Image Credit: NYT </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Washington: For years, antitrust activists have targeted the companies for what they see as abuses of their dominant positions in search, retail commerce, web hosting, mobile apps, operating systems and other parts of our online world. The development now show that those views have penetrated the thinking of antitrust enforcers and policymakers in the United States, who will soon join their international counterparts in investigating the power of the companies and finding ways to fix any possible abuses they find.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Roger McNamee, a prominent Silicon Valley investor who has spent the last two years shuttling to Washington to sound the alarm about the tech industry's problems, says he's celebrating signs that an era of inertia on tech regulation is coming to an end.</p><p>\"This is going to be really hard,\" McNamee said. \"History tells you it's going to be disappointing before it's done. But it's a start.\"</p><p>Jessica Powell, Google's former communications lead, wrote on social media: \"As much as I want to see some regulation of tech, I dread what it's going to look like. The problem with so much regulation is that it comes in late, it comes in hard, and it often looks more backward rather than forward.\"</p><p>But there's also cause for concern during this antitrust moment, Kara Swisher, a longtime Silicon Valley journalist and co-founder of the tech news publication Recode, said.</p><p>\"The very same agencies and legislators now screaming for blood have for decades ignored any sensible regulation of Silicon Valley, afraid of killing the golden geeks,\" Swisher wrote. \"Now, though, they are coming in with guns blazing in a way that looks thoughtless and is likely to prove pointless. They remind me of a legal-pad-carrying Avengers team that's going to take a lot of what's good about tech down with what's bad.\"</p><p>However, McNamee warned that if Washington is serious about changing Big Tech, lawmakers will have to consider an entirely new regulatory regime. The government needs greater enforcement capacity, as well as modernised antitrust laws that could be applied to 21st century business models, he said.</p><p>1) Implement platform curbs: Hal Singer, an economist at Georgetown University, says regulators should apply the same regime to Facebook and Amazon as they do to integrated US cable companies such as Comcast and put rules in place stopping them from using their dominant platforms to promote their adjacent products and services.</p><p>2) Set up an overseeing agency: Other tech experts propose an approach similar to that of Yale professor Fiona Scott Morton, who has, among other things, suggested creating a new agency that would oversee the tech monopolists and, if necessary, force Facebook and others to allow their users to move their data elsewhere.</p><p>3) Enforce structural separation: Even more ardent pro-enforcement folks say structural separation is the only real cure. Force Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon to spin off Amazon Web Services and so on. This, they say would bolster competition and consumer freedom. Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, has said the company must be broken up in order to solve its problems. But most lawmakers and global regulators have stopped short of supporting the break-up of any tech company.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/40/155983686582.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/40/155983686582.jpeg</url></p><p>USA-TECH-ANTITRUST1-(Read-Only)<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-146137267</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8S-KGX1-F11P-X4WH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"588\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

Facebook has been eerily silent on the code. The Australian Financial Review is owned by Nine, which along with News Corp, has been a major proponent of regulating the tech giants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the US search and advertising giant, this isn't just a battle about Australia. Google is using the stoush with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission as a proxy war to send a message to Washington regulators about how it would respond to stronger enforcement of anti-competition or privacy laws from US regulators.</p><p>Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, was grilled via a video conference call in July by Democrats and Republicans in a historic big tech hearing aimed at finding out more about whether the company abused its market power in the digital advertising landscape and beyond. Australia's code may be local, but the debates and broader consequences for big tech are global.</p><p>Expect Google to start urging Australians to write to their MPs to oppose the new code to whip up a frenzy to avoid being regulated. Chances are there will be one-click, pre-filled forms to bombard politicians and industry and a campaign arguing the Australian government, media and competition regulator are out to destroy the internet and kill innovation.</p><p>Google - a $US1.03 trillion ($1.43 trillion) market capitalisation company which had $US38.3 billion in revenue for the three months to June 30 - is trying to paint itself as the little guy against Australia's big bad media.</p><p>It is within its rights to argue against being regulated. The problem is it is not being upfront to users and YouTubers about the purpose and nature of the code and is trying to scare them into action.</p><p>The purpose of the regulation is to deal with the imbalance in bargaining power between digital giants Facebook and Google and the Australia media. It aims to have the platforms pay for the value the journalism - made by Australian media companies - creates for some of their products. The government is concerned with shaping an internet that can sustain well-informed, well-researched information online, not just the burgeoning slew of creator-made content that at best fosters more diverse viewpoints but at worst panders to extremism and plays fast and loose with the truth.</p><p>In a letter, YouTube head of Asia-Pacific Gautam Anand alleged that ACCC's proposed code would \"create an uneven playing field when it comes to who makes money on YouTube\". But the code does not include YouTube, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/google-s-youtube-push-against-accc-code-doesn-t-add-up-20200818-p55mvl\">as reported by the Financial Review last week</url>. Despite this, on Friday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/google-doubles-down-on-youtube-push-against-code-20200821-p55o8l\">Google doubled down on the YouTube campaign </url>and began its social media tagline #AFairCode.</p><p>It's not the first time Google has attempted to rally its YouTube creators and audience into taking its fight up against proposed regulation.</p><p>In 2018, YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki urged the user-generated video community to \"take immediate action\" on social media to #SaveYourInternet when the European Union proposed copyright laws which would make tech platforms, like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, liable for copyright protected content on their platforms.</p><p>In 2011 and 2012 as part of a coordinated campaign by a range of technology companies against two anti-piracy laws which were being considered by US congress - the Stop Online Piract Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA) - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-16574977\">which were aimed at tackling and shutting down pirate websites</url> - Google orchestrated a campaign against the legislation - including pushing a petition, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/googles-brin-calls-sopa-censorship-akin-to-china-iran/2011/12/15/gIQAlV2HwO_blog.html\">with Google co-founder Sergey Brin comparing it to internet censorship seen in China or Iran</url> - and use of a 'censored' homepage logo to push users into its cause.</p><p>Last week, Google Australia managing director Melanie Silva issued an open letter to Australians stating \"the way Aussies search every day on Google is at risk of new regulation\" and the \"big media companies\" making \"enormous and unreasonable demands would put our free services at risk\".</p><p>ACCC boss Rod Sims slammed Silva's letter as \"misinformation\".</p><p>\"Google will not be required to charge Australians for the use of its free services such as Google Search and YouTube, unless it chooses to do so,\" Sims said. \"Google will not be required to share any additional user data with Australian news businesses unless it chooses to do so.\"</p><p>Google returned fire.</p><p>\"We did not say that the proposed law would require us to charge Australians for Search and YouTube - we do not intend to charge users for our free services. What we did say is that Search and YouTube, both of which are free services, are at risk in Australia. That's because the code as it is drafted is unworkable,\" a Google spokesman said.</p><p>\"For example, the code requires us to give all news media businesses advance notice of algorithm changes and explain how they can minimise the effects. If we were to comply with this provision it would seriously damage our products and fundamentally alter the way ranking of search results works across Google Search and YouTube.\"</p><p>The code's question and answer summary states Google and Facebook should give 28 days' notice of a significant algorithm change to allow media companies to adapt to the changes and, importantly, \"without putting an unnecessary burden on digital platforms\".</p><p>\"The code's minimum standards would simply require digital platforms to provide news media businesses with 28 days' advance notice of algorithm changes that are likely to affect their business models. The code does not prevent digital platforms from making these changes,\" the ACCC summary states.</p><p>Google then said the code requires Google to give media companies information about data that users share with Google, which \"goes beyond the current level of data sharing between Google and news publishers\".</p><p>Again, the ACCC's question and answer document states otherwise.</p><p>\"The draft code's minimum standards require digital platforms to provide clear information about the data they currently collect through news content. However, the code does not include any requirements for digital platforms to increase sharing of user data with news media businesses. Accordingly, the code does not have an impact on the privacy protections currently applicable to digital platform users,\" it states.</p><p>Google chose to not address questions regarding discrepancies between its public statements and the contents of the code and explanatory materials, or about changes to the draft legislation it would want.</p><p>Google argues that the way the rules would work in practice will not encourage innovative thinking around maintaining news media. It says it will launch a new news discovery and aggregation service later this year. However, its critique ignores the fact the code itself is an example of innovative thinking to a complex problem.</p><p>Google says \"no options are off the table\".</p><p>Silva has said she expects the company would go to arbitration as mandated by the code if tech firms and news media companies cannot strike an agreement on how to make payments for news.</p><p>'Going dark'</p><p>Google sources have said the company might consider withdrawing services from the Australian market before it complies with the code in its present form.</p><p>It is unclear how switching off search, maps and YouTube locally would work in practice, but threatening to \"go dark\" on its popular and ubiquitous services has precedent.</p><p>A Californian court recently ruled that Uber has to count its drivers as employees rather than gig workers, meaning Uber owes its drivers greater protections and rights as their employer. Uber is threatening to withdraw from California, presumably as a play to help corral passengers and drivers into its political fight in the hopes politicians, courts and regulators will back down.</p><p>In fights such as these, the playbook usually means companies focus their public messaging on how many jobs they provide, or put out some measure of their economic contribution, while obscuring the quality of the conditions that go with those jobs or the value they vacuum up in return.</p><p>Google has launched a local social media campaign and is redirecting Australian users on its search landing page to its so-called \"open letter\". The company argues the code will put user data at risk and force the company to make Google Search and YouTube \"dramatically worse\".</p><p>Will people buy it? Do they even care? That is unclear. But what is clear is that Google's public standing has shifted in the past decade. People can like the products and services while being wary of the tactics it uses to litigate its own interests.</p><p>Sims and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg have both said Google has misrepresented what is in the code. But the code is a world first and no one can say how it will play out.</p><p>There is an ideological clash at play too. One premise of the code is that societal goods - such as an informed, connected public and less corruption - stem from the sustenance of a healthy news media. That is the aspiration, although that is not to say the Australian commercial and government-funded news media has always achieved this aim, and as powerful companies themselves, they too should be scrutinised. Critics claim Google has often shown a thinly veiled contempt for sectors it deems non-techy, and the resistance to the code suggests that perhaps the company does not really buy into the public good aspect of a healthy press.</p><p>Google has said repeatedly it supports the news media, but does not think paying for news beyond the clicks it already provides media outlets is fair. Its open letters to Australians and YouTube content creators suggest it would pass on the costs outside of the company anyway.</p><p>This argument represents an extension of the power clash that will continue to define the rewrite of 21st-century powerbroking, tech versus the state.</p><p>Claims that big tech is the death of society are overblown, but arguments that governments need to retool to steer society in a more positive direction are gaining traction in jurisdictions around the world, including the UK, Europe and US. For Google, and Facebook, the Australian conversation is just the beginning.</p><p>People need factual information about the code itself, its purpose, and what it really entails, so they can draw their own conclusions about what matters to them. A Google scare campaign is not that.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520315244</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P2-H4C1-JBJ7-N07N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1789\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And this week seemed to be as good a time as any to dig into the complexities of one fight.</p><p>This month, The Associated Press reported that a coalition <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">of 25 local governments</url> sued the state\u2019s bureau of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">cannabis</url> control over a rule that allows home delivery even in cities that do not allow storefront sales.</p><p>Mayor John Mirisch of Beverly Hills, one of the cities that filed the lawsuit in Fresno County Superior Court, told me it\u2019s a matter of local control.</p><p>\u201cIt was supposed to be made clear that local jurisdictions would be able to regulate cannabis,\u201d he said. \u201cBut surprise, surprise, Sacramento\u2019s got something else in store for us.\u201d</p><p>Beverly Hills, he said, made the choice not to allow marijuana retail storefronts \u2014 just as it does not have smelting plants.</p><p>And while the city does allow medical <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">cannabis delivery</url>, Mr. Mirisch said Beverly Hills should be able to draw the line where it wants.

Banning delivery \u2014 which ensures that a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">broader range</url> of consumers can get pot \u2014 will just send people back to the illegal market, she said.

Nevertheless, he said, he read the passage of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">Proposition 64</url> as giving clear authority to local governments.</p><p>\u201cI want these other communities to expand access,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I believe it should be done above board.\u201d</p><p>The state\u2019s bureau of cannabis control declined to comment because the lawsuit is pending.</p><p>[<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">Read about weed\u2019s new crop of consumers.</url>]</p><p>Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re following </p><p>(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Many brands and <url normalizedValue=\"http://wwd.com/fashion-news/street-style/they-are-wearing-too-cool-for-pool-10956317/\">fashion</url> designers find stylized slice-of-life selfies and related posts by influencers to be useful methods to reach their target market, and, not surprisingly, have increased digital ad spends in 2017 to drive sales and engage with customers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Given the real-time nature of mobile marketing, it is important for companies - whether an established house or fashion start-up - to make sure outside influencers include proper disclosures in <url normalizedValue=\"http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/creative-playground-banding-production-celebrity-influencers-10955098/\">social media</url> postings and abide by company policies.</p><p/><p>Far more than just snapping a selfie while wearing an outfit, influencers or \"online celebrities\" garner throngs of followers by portraying a certain artful sincerity in sharing their lives to the world (while seamlessly endorsing fashion and products that fit their public image). Brands quickly have learned that such postings draw mobile traffic and drive fans to engage with the sponsored posts. Yet, when a brand retains social media influencers, bloggers, vloggers or other talent to drive awareness and sales through social media, the brand may be inviting unnecessary legal complication unless it has a robust influencer policy.</p><p/><p>To avoid negative publicity and the cost of defending a regulatory enforcement action, companies should require all endorsers to sign an influencer agreement that outlines when an influencer must disclose his or her connection to the company and how it must be done on the various platforms, as well as giving the company the right to terminate endorsers who fail to abide by the policy.</p><p/><p>The Federal Trade Commission's Endorsement Guidelines state that if there is a \"material connection\" between an endorser and the marketer of a product, then such a connection should be clearly and conspicuously disclosed, unless the connection is already clear from the context of the medium containing the product endorsement. A \"material connection\" is anything that might affect the weight or credibility that consumers give the endorsement, such as a monetary payment, business or family relationship, or the provision of free products to the endorser.</p><p/><p>Cash payment is not a requirement of disclosure, and \"payment\" or a \"gift\" in clothes or other product does not allow the company and influencer to circumvent the disclosure rules. Disclosure is most crucial where content is not obviously advertising to the consumer, such as a Facebook post of the influencer wearing the company's clothing. And a company cannot escape the requirements by merely delegating a campaign to its ad agency.</p><p/><p>In short, the FTC requires proper disclosures so that endorsements on social media by a person with a \"material connection\" to the company are not ads in disguise. And the FTC is not shy about enforcement against fashion companies and retailers. For example, last year, a major fashion retailer settled FTC charges that influencers promoting a collection did not disclose they were compensated in exchange for their endorsements and the retailer was required, among other things, to establish a robust compliance program and maintain certain records related to all outside endorsements for the next 20 years in the event of an FTC audit. Moreover, the FTC made a splash earlier this year when it sent more than 90 letters to brands, celebrities and influencers pointing out apparent omissions in their disclosures on Instagram posts and reminding them to \"clearly and conspicuously\" disclose relationships in the future.</p><p/><p>What does \"clearly and conspicuously\" mean in the context of social media marketing? While each platform has its own quirks, influencer disclosures should be:</p><p/><p>Unambiguous to the average reader and located near the corresponding social media post. A hyperlink to a separate page of disclosures is insufficient;Placed \"above the fold\" where users will see it on a mobile screen without clicking ahead. For example, in Instagram, before the More button; in YouTube, before the Show More button;In a readable font and color that makes the disclosure noticeable against the background; andNot buried in a jumbled string of hashtags.</p><p/><p>Disclosure itself is straightforward. There are no magic words, but custom has shown that #Ad, #PaidAd, #Sponsored, #Promotion, or \"This video was sponsored by...\" would likely suffice, but #sp, #partner, \"Thanks [brand]\" or #[brand campaign] would not. Disclosures spoken by the endorser within a video review are best made at the beginning of the video.</p><p/><p>To manage social media campaigns, companies should require influencers to sign an agreement that outlines standards of conduct and required disclosures. While the FTC has taken action against companies for inadequate disclosures in the social space, it has also closed investigations when a company has an established endorsement policy and any omissions were isolated incidents.</p><p/><p>Under the influencer agreement, the company should retain the right to terminate the relationship or withhold payment if the influencer fails to include the required disclosures. Moreover, the agreement should outline the process for obtaining clearance to use company logos and trademarks (and a similar permission process to use marks of partners or third-party entities).</p><p/><p>As for the use of images, which can expose a company to copyright liability, the agreement should require the influencer to obtain clearance before using any images featuring living individuals or third-party trademarks or copyrights or photos taken by third parties (of course, the endorser is on the firmest footing using photos or selfies taken by his or herself depicting the product). Lastly, the company should have a social media policy in place that establishes internal procedures to monitor postings and enforce compliance.</p><p/><p>A final caveat before engaging influencers: All entities involved in a marketing campaign should ensure compliance with the FTC guidelines. For example, one lapse in compliance led to an FTC enforcement action when a big tech company hired an outside ad agency, which in turn engaged an <url normalizedValue=\"http://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/think-tank-alex-porter-10956558/\">online</url> entertainment network that hired influencers who did not adequately disclose their status as endorsers. The lesson: If your company delegates social media campaigns to an outside agency, it should ensure all entities require influencers to make the required disclosures under the law.</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Monica B.

People don't appreciate our corporate titans quite enough.<br/>Come again? This is the unexpected premise of a new book by economist Tyler Cowen called Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero.<br/>Cowen's pro-business manifesto is a clarion call for our time. While big businesses are often used as political punching bags, Cowen will convince you that few other things have contributed so greatly to your overall quality of life. Plus, he adds, there are good reasons that you think you dislike big business more than you do, and even better reason to revisit those biases.</p><p><br/>Here are just a few of the surprising arguments, insights, and myth-bustings that you will find in Big Business.<br/>1) Big Businesses Are More Honest than Most Everyone Else<br/>A common view holds that corporations are crooks, or at least are run by them. The bigger the firm, the bigger the fraud, and the less recourse you will have. Anyone who has had a frustrating experience on hold for hours with a major company's customer service call center can attest to the incredible banality of such \"evil\": big corporations can not only wrong us, they can make it as miserable as possible for wrongs to be righted.<br/>But are you so sure that big businesses are your biggest problem when it comes to fraud and dishonesty?<br/>Cowen argues that you are probably more likely to be ripped off or lied to by people you know personally than by McDonalds or Amazon. People routinely lie on resumes, applications for housing and benefits, and dating profiles. For example, the gap between the amount in taxes that individuals owe and what they actually pay is huge: Cowen reports an IRS estimate of around $264 billion a year. Then there are the day-to-day falsehoods and iniquities that people in our lives regularly commit, with or without our knowledge. Needless to say, legal recourse is often scant in these personal situations.<br/>Compare this to businesses. Despite errors or misdeeds here or there, firms have strong legal and reputational incentives to be honest and fair. Indeed, big businesses spend billions each year on customer service, employee training, and lawyers to make sure they stay on the right side of the law and public opinion. <br/>Cowen marshalls the evidence: For example, the tax gap for businesses is much lower than that for individuals, standing at only $41 billion. Laboratory economics experiments suggest that people in corporate leadership and market economies are more giving and trusting than others. Cowen also compares for-profit ventures to non-profits: the latter is often (sadly) characterized by dishonesty and fraud.<br/>It's not that businesses are always or even mostly honorable. Cowen notes that if he were to visit, say, a boat dealer, he would arrive at the lot \"with the assumption that the sellers are trying to rip me off.\" And those notorious call center wait times that so ruin our days are the result of a cold calculation that dealing with us costs more money than we're worth.<br/>The point is that businesses are usually more honest than everyone else, and that is worth our appreciation.<br/>2) CEOs Are the Philosophers of Our Time<br/>Cowen cites a multitude of studies that suggest CEOs contribute far more to the well-being of their companies-and society-than is commonly understood. <br/>One way that we can measure this effect is by studying what happens when a sudden death robs a firm of corporate leadership. It turns out that, when CEOs die, their firms lose a significant portion of their market value: share price declines by 2.32 percent. If the CEO was a young founder, that loss amounts to almost nine percent. Cowen cites another study that uses these events to estimate that the quality of corporate leadership totals at about five or six percent of the total value of a company.<br/>That contribution can have a massive effect on the overall condition of the economy. Cowen references some of the most high-profile CEOs of the last decade: Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerburg, and Jeff Bezos. The opportunity cost that the world would have incurred had these men not held leadership positions at major firms would have been enormous. <br/>How are CEOs able to contribute so much to the state of the world as we know it? By having intricate knowledge of human motivation, by adequately balancing long-term visions and short-term demands, by understanding the political ramifications of their actions, by knowing the needs and wants of huge swaths of the population, and by reasoning through how those needs and wants can be adequately met. This skill set is so diverse and requires such a comprehension of the human experience that Cowen concludes these men and women practice more philosophy than those in any other position.<br/>3) You Live in a Hedge Fund<br/>Despite the rancor directed at large banking institutions, there can be no doubt that intricate financial systems have been closely tied to the increase in human well-being over the centuries. From ancient Sumer to Renaissance Italy to today, the societies that mastered investment, accounting, and monetary exchange were most able to allocate resources efficiently. The economic status of New York is merely one example of a long lineage of cities that climbed the heights of economic development using large financial institutions.<br/>Americans in particular should be thankful for the existence of the nation's rich and powerful banking sector. The many technological and quality-of-life changes in cities like Silicon Valley, Boston, Brooklyn, and Austin, Texas are thanks to venture capitalists that risked their resources on new and uncertain experiments. The global influence of the US is in no small part due to our financial and monetary heft. Millions of Americans rely on the enrichment that well-performing stocks have provided them during retirement. <br/>These facts and others lead Cowen to remark that Americans benefit daily from the nation's status as perhaps the world's most successful hedge fund. Without the wonderful surpluses generated by an efficient distribution of capital (mediated by complex financial systems and large banks), denizens of the United States and elsewhere would be measurably worse off.<br/>4) Populists, Not Big Businesses, Own Washington<br/>Tyler Cowen tackles another damaging misconception about big business: its relationship to politics. While grossly exaggerated claims about the power of large companies pervade American discourse, he writes that the reality is quite different.<br/>Generally, large corporations want free trade, relatively open immigration, and political predictability. Politics in this nation, as well as in many others, has taken a decisive turn in the opposite direction despite the protests of Wall Street. Rich CEOs were notably disinclined to support President Trump during the 2016 election; not a single CEO of a Fortune 100 company donated to his campaign by September of 2016, despite the fact that nearly a third had done so for Mitt Romney four years earlier. <br/>That isn't to say that crony capitalism isn't a real problem. Subsidies, regulatory capture, and protectionism are threats to economic efficiency and the justice of our economic system. Nevertheless, Cowen catalogs that most government expenditures reflect the will of voters, not the rent-seeking of special interests. In other words, programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, K-12 education, and similar services-not handouts to powerful businesses-dominate government spending on every level.<br/>5) Work Is Good for You<br/>Everyone gets frustrated with their job from time to time. As artistic works like Office Space portray, working for big businesses can seem especially soul-deadening. Sometimes the prospect of full-time leisure seems irresistible. After all, it's not called \"work\" for nothing: as Cowen notes, telling your partner that \"being with you is work\" is not exactly a serenade.<br/>But although companies need to pay you to be there, Cowen suggests that you might enjoy working more than you realize.<br/>First, we should consider the lot of those who cannot find work. There are well-known psychological costs to long-term unemployment. It damages people's self-esteem, health, and happiness. One study found that involuntary unemployment is more traumatic than divorce or separation for one's happiness.<br/>But work is not just merely the better of two bad hands. Much of what is positive in our lives comes from our work. We socialize and make friends, engage in creative activity, and grow as human beings. <br/>Oftentimes, work environments are just pleasant places to be. Employers compete to provide nice office spaces, enjoyable perks, and employee activities to boost morale and attract top talent (especially in today's tight labor market.) In some cases, work is actually a welcome respite from the chaos of home life.<br/>Some of the most important determinants of long-term happiness and satisfaction are actually a drag in the day-to-day. Think of things like child-rearing or attaining a degree. Work too is one of those factors, and we shouldn't let our daily frustrations or occasional boredom cloud the fact that it is one of our greatest sources of pride and lifelong production.<br/>Why It Matters<br/>Cowen's book provides a unique perspective on how big businesses affect our lives and psyches that even dogged corporate critics should find insightful. If we don't take seriously the underlying message Cowen lays out to heart, our societies could pay dearly.<br/>The simple fact is this: big corporations are responsible for the bulk of our growth, technology, and social form. Many of us spend most of our working days at one; let's not forget that \"making payroll is a heroic act.\" Even if we don't, most of the daily necessities that we need to survive, as well as today's little luxuries, come thanks to big businesses. <br/>Perhaps most significantly, they drive innovation and investment; thanks to the logic of compound interest, shaving off a slight percent off either variable means a much different future.<br/>It is fashionable to shake our fists at \"Big Tech,\" \"Big Banks,\" and \"Big Pharma,\" to name a few. Yet we do so using an Apple computer purchased via one of our many large financial institutions. If our blood pressure rises too high in the course of our condemnations, we can be revived with one of the many life-saving drugs on the market. In a way, it is big businesses' very successes that enable us to so efficiently turn the mobs against them.<br/>Why the disconnect between this bounty and our lamentations? Cowen points out that we actually feel like we have a deeply personal relationship with big corporations. We simply don't have a good way to conceptualize a multinational business structure comprised of thousands of employees, so we anthropomorphize them into human beings, even friends. <br/>When something goes wrong, and a package gets lost, or a device prematurely wears down, or a social media post gets wrongly censored, we don't default to the probabilistic explanation that something inadvertently broke down in an impressive global chain. Rather, we feel like we have been personally and intentionally wronged, and our endocrine system kicks in accordingly. Yet in the miracle of the day-to-day when everything works as planned, we carry on without particular note.<br/>We can't help our psychology. But we can seek to understand and even overcome our tendencies to underrate some things and overrate others. It's not that they are perfect, but Cowen thinks that big businesses are far too underrated, perhaps dangerously so. By the end of the book, maybe you will too.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-59588</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0N-22X1-F03R-W0BX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1931\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Mercatus Center At George Mason University</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008X5U</classCode><className>CALL CENTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000601</classCode><className>EMPLOYEE TRAINING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001220</classCode><className>NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001681</classCode><className>TAX LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Tax</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000439</classCode><className>CUSTOMER SERVICE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST0008XMR</classCode><className>LAW &amp; LEGAL SYSTEM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N441222MM</classCode><className>BOAT DEALERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008X5U</classCode><className>CALL CENTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001312</classCode><className>PERSONAL DEBT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX000234</classCode><className>BUSINESS TELEPHONE SERVICE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N441222MM</classCode><className>BOAT DEALERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

It's believed 540 million records relating to Facebook accounts were stored on the servers, including comments, likes, reactions, names and user IDs, obtained when users engaged with applications on the platform - the same methods unearthed during the investigation into Cambridge Analytica. Two apps have been associated with the data hoard so far: Cultura Colectiva, a Mexico-based media company that promotes content to users in Latin America, and 'At the Pool', a service that matched users with other content, which has been out of operation since 2016. At the Pool is said to have held 22,000 passwords for its service in plaintext alongside columns relating to Facebook user IDs - the fear being that many users may have been using the same password for their Facebook accounts. </p><p>Both of the app's datasets were stored inAmazon S3 buckets[1]which were found to be misconfigured to allow public download of the files. Despite being commonly used among businesses, as they allow data to be distributed across servers in a wide geographical area, there have been multiple incidents involving companies failing to adequately safeguard their data. Facebooked condemned the practices of both the apps. \"Facebook's policies prohibit storing Facebook information in a public database,\" said a Facebook spokesperson. \"Once alerted to the issue, we worked with Amazon to take down the databases. We are committed to working with the developers on our platform to protect people's data.\" AWS was made aware of the exposed data on 28 January 2019, following an alert issued by security research firm UpGuard. AWS confirmed it had received the report and was investigating it, but the data was only secured on Wednesday this week. 'AWS customers own and fully control their data,' an AWS spokesperson told IT Pro. 'When we receive an abuse report concerning content that is not clearly illegal or otherwise prohibited, we notify the customer in question and ask that they take appropriate action, which is what happened here.' This statement aligns with UpGuard's in that the researchers alerted Cultura Colectiva before AWS on 10 January 2019 but have still yet to receive a response from the company. Accenture[2], Experian[3], WWE[4], and the NSA[5] have all been found to have stored data on unsecured AWS servers in recent years, with the problem becoming so prevalent that hackers have started creating tools specifically designed to target these buckets[6]. 'While Amazon S3 is secure by default, we offer the flexibility to change our default configurations to suit the many use cases in which broader access is required, such as building a website or hosting publicly downloadable content,' said AWS. 'As is the case on-premises or anywhere else, application builders must ensure that changes they make to access configurations are protecting access as intended.\" The news coincides with an article published in The Washington Postin which Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg called for a 'worldwide GDPR' and greater regulation on the data protection principles of big tech outside the EU, despite the company itself facing 10 major GDPR investigations[7]. The discovery of the data has once again raised the issue of Facebook's data sharing policies, something that facilitated the improper sharing of user data for political purposes by Cambridge Analytica. This prompted Facebook to change its sharing policies to restrict access by third-parties, although the fear is that data troves such as this have already been widely shared.

It's believed 540 million records relating to Facebook accounts were stored on the servers, including comments, likes, reactions, names and user IDs, obtained when users engaged with applications on the platform - the same methods unearthed during the investigation into Cambridge Analytica[1]. Two apps have been associated with the data hoard so far: Cultura Colectiva, a Mexico-based media company that promotes content to users in Latin America, and 'At the Pool', a service that matched users with other content, which has been out of operation since 2016. At the Pool is said to have held 22,000 passwords for its service in plaintext alongside columns relating to Facebook user IDs - the fear being that many users may have been using the same password for their Facebook accounts.Both of the app's datasets were stored inAmazon S3 buckets[2]which were found to be misconfigured to allow public download of the files. Despite being commonly used among businesses, as they allow data to be distributed across servers in a wide geographical area, there have been multiple incidents involving companies failing to adequately safeguard their data. </p><p>Facebooked condemned the practices of both the apps. \"Facebook's policies prohibit storing Facebook information in a public database,\" said a Facebook spokesperson. \"Once alerted to the issue, we worked with Amazon to take down the databases. We are committed to working with the developers on our platform to protect people's data.\" AWS was made aware of the exposed data on 28 January 2019, following an alert issued by security research firm UpGuard. AWS confirmed it had received the report and was investigating it, but the data was only secured on Wednesday this week. 'AWS customers own and fully control their data,' an AWS spokesperson told IT Pro. 'When we receive an abuse report concerning content that is not clearly illegal or otherwise prohibited, we notify the customer in question and ask that they take appropriate action, which is what happened here.' This statement aligns with UpGuard's in that the researchers alerted Cultura Colectiva before AWS on 10 January 2019 but have still yet to receive a response from the company. Accenture[3], Experian[4], WWE[5], and the NSA[6] have all been found to have stored data on unsecured AWS servers in recent years, with the problem becoming so prevalent that hackers have started creating tools specifically designed to target these buckets[7]. 'While Amazon S3 is secure by default, we offer the flexibility to change our default configurations to suit the many use cases in which broader access is required, such as building a website or hosting publicly downloadable content,' said AWS. 'As is the case on-premises or anywhere else, application builders must ensure that changes they make to access configurations are protecting access as intended.\" The news coincides with an article published in The Washington Postin which Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg called for a 'worldwide GDPR' and greater regulation on the data protection principles of big tech outside the EU, despite the company itself facing 10 major GDPR investigations[8]. The discovery of the data has once again raised the issue of Facebook's data sharing policies, something that facilitated the improper sharing of user data for political purposes by Cambridge Analytica. This prompted Facebook to change its sharing policies to restrict access by third-parties, although the fear is that data troves such as this have already been widely shared. 'Cambridge Analytica was the most high profile case that led to some significant changes in how Facebook interacts with third-party developers, but I suspect there are many troves of Facebook data sitting around where they shouldn't be, including this one,\" said privacy advocate Paul Bischoff of Comparitech.com. 'Even though Facebook has limited what information third-party developers can access, there's still nothing Facebook can do about abuse or mishandling until after the fact,\" he said.
