When the CEOs of the nation's four biggest tech firms appear before lawmakers on Wednesday to defend their business practices, the fallout is likely to stretch well beyond Silicon Valley. In fact, it may affect your digital future. Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, and Google's Sundar Pichai will field questions raised by a yearlong federal investigation into the tech industry, testifying under oath about decisions that affect consumer choice. </p><p>The hearing was organized by the antitrust subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. Based on their answers, regulators will determine whether perhaps the companies have stifled innovation and impeded competition in online marketplaces, app stores, social media platforms, and search results. 'We'll learn something by what they tell us or what they refuse to tell us,' says Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. Lawmakers will have access to more than a million pages of documents collected during the investigation, says Michael Kades, director of markets and competition policy for the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a nonprofit organization. 'So they'll have a sense of whether the CEOs' public statements are honest.\" The Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general have launched investigations of their own into Big Tech companies. Consumer Reports contacted the four companies involved in the congressional hearing to request on-the-record interviews, and all four declined or failed to reply. The hearing begins at noon EST on Wednesday. A report with the subcommittee's findings is expected to be delivered this fall. Experts foresee two potential outcomes from these proceedings. The subcommittee's findings could lead to an antitrust enforcement action against one or more of the companies. That might result in demands for changes to their business models or maybe even a forced breakup in which, for example, Google might have to spin off YouTube. 'Antitrust cases are hard to win,' says Kades, adding that the process is likely to play out differently for each of the four companies. The other option is legislation designed to rein in the companies, strengthening antitrust statutes, creating a new agency, or expanding the scope of, say, the FTC to more closely monitor the tech industry. What will legislators\u2014and consumers\u2014want to hear about from each CEO on Wednesday? Here's a platform-by-platform breakdown of the most important antitrust issues facing Big Tech. Amazon Who's testifying: Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. The big issue: With Amazon, the questioning is likely to center around the practice of selling its own products in in the marketplace it created. Amazon collects a wealth of data on not only the products sold by third-party vendors but also the things consumers are searching for. Collectively, that information could help Amazon anticipate trends in a way that benefits its rapidly expanding private label business. In an earlier hearing, an Amazon representative told the committee the company doesn't use data in this way. But a subsequent Wall Street Journal report[1] revealed that Amazon's programming algorithms boost the company's own products, making it much more likely for consumers to see them. Amazon sells more than 7,200 products under 140 private labels. Some, such as AmazonBasics, are easily identifiable; others, like Moon and Back baby clothing, Revly vitamins, and Obsidian sunglasses, are less obvious. According to projections by SunTrust bank, Amazon's private label business could reach $25 billion annually by 2022, potentially making up 10 percent of the company's bottom line. Why you should care: According to Kades of Equitable Growth, Amazon's unique and powerful position in the marketplace does benefit consumers at times, but it may do more harm in the long run. Most of the company's private label clothing and household goods are inexpensive, selling for $50 or less. But over time, Amazon's behavior could suppress competition and innovation, persuading smaller companies not to launch products that Amazon could knock off. Alex Harman, competition policy advocate for the group Public Citizen, says that if the subcommittee takes Amazon to task for creating a platform and then selling its own products on it, it could have ripple effects for the other three tech giants because they engage in similar practices to varying degrees. 'All these companies would have to change their business models,' he says. Apple Who's testifying: Apple CEO Tim Cook. The big issue: Apple's App Store is the central marketplace for consumers to download apps on iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. To sell a product in the store, an app developer must follow provisions that, some experts say, restrict competition. For example, Apple charges a commission of up to 30 percent on third-party apps. The company has also mandated that app developers[2]use in-app purchases as the only way to unlock new features or functionality, which allows Apple to collect fees on the transaction. Why you should care: Some competitors argue that Apple's practices have resulted in higher prices and less choice for consumers. The music streaming platform Spotify has complained[3] to European antitrust regulators that App Store fees constitute a 'tax,' which Spotify had to pass on to users by raising its monthly fee. Spotify added that some companies, like Uber,[4] which don't compete with Apple, don't have to pay a fee to Apple when processing charges through the company's platform. 'When you treat the companies that you compete with worse than those you don't compete with, it rubs people the wrong way,' Kades says. (In advance of the hearings, Apple pointed to a report by economists that contends the App Store's fee structure is similar to that of other platforms, such as the Google Play store.) Facebook Who's testifying: Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The big issue: While Facebook faces a variety of complex antitrust issues, the key issue, and the easiest to understand, is that the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp when they emerged as potential rivals. 'There's a huge focus on whether these acquisitions were anti-competitive,' Kades says. Some antitrust experts have called for unwinding those mergers, but that's not as easy as it sounds, given the way Facebook has integrated the companies in its business model. 'There's a saying in antitrust, 'You can't unscramble the eggs,' says George Slover, antitrust expert and senior policy counsel for Consumer Reports. 'That's why you need to nip these anti-competitive mergers in the bud.' Why you should care: While antitrust cases often focus on price increases in a competition-free market, the issue with Facebook is the way that consumers pay for free use of platform. 'The real cost of Facebook is the data they're collecting from you,' says Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at Public Knowledge, a public interest group focusing on technology and based in Washington, D.C.Facebook uses consumer data from its platform, Instagram, WhatsApp, and outside sources to target ads to customers. The only way to fully opt out of the data collection is to not use Facebook's services, cutting yourself off from access to friends, business associates, and members of your local community. Last month, a high court in Germany ruled that Facebook's collection and use of consumer data violated the country's antitrust laws. Google Who's testifying: Sundar Pichai, recently appointed CEO of Alphabet. The big issue: Under the umbrella of parent company Alphabet, Google is involved in a dizzying array of ventures, but the one that's likely to draw the most questions is Google's dominant position in the advertising business. That one has far-reaching impacts on customer search, smartphone use, and Google's suite of office productivity products. In 2019, 82 percent of Google's $160 billion in revenue came from advertising. And, as Kades says, Google'sad-serving tools\u2014Ad Exchange andAd Manager\u2014give the company a hand in buying and selling ad space across the internet. 'Google is on both sides of the transaction,' he says. 'We have rules on stock exchanges against this type of conduct.' Google also insists that companies use its tools to buy and sell ads on YouTube, which effectively shuts out potential competitors. 'A demand-side platform, which advertisers use to buy ad space, will have difficulty appealing to clients who want to advertise on videoif that rival platform doesn't have access to YouTube,' Kades says. Why you should care: Google rivals such as Yelp argue that anti-competitive practices in the ad business hurt consumers. For example, when you search for hotel rooms in New York City, Kades says, the results page is dominated by paid ads from companies like Booking.com, Priceline, and Tripadvisor.The top organic results (which are not paid for) feature those same companies. That means that out-of-the-way boutique hotels and other alternatives get buried. 'On a mobile deviceI see thesamecontent for pages and pages,' Kades says. 'The prominence of promoted results can reduce the quality of the search engine because it can make it harder for users to find what they want.' Google has cemented the dominance of its search engine on mobile devices by paying Apple more than $7 billion annually to be the default search engine on iOS devices, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi saidin a Barron's interview[5]. It's estimated that Google takes in about $25 billion per year in ad revenue from searches on iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion at CNN.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (CNN) --  Has Silicon Valley gotten too big?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's a running theme these days: That big tech is has become overly powerful, that Facebook and Google regulate speech on their respective platforms, that Apple and Amazon misuse their monopoly power. But what -- exactly -- does all of this mean? Why should we care even if big tech has gotten too big? </p><p>These are the questions that the House Judiciary Committee will have to get to the bottom of when it hosts its Wednesday hearing featuring the CEOs of those four companies -- arguably, the four most powerful business executives in the United States, let alone the tech industry.</p><p>It is a unique opportunity: Never before have we had such a vaunted occasion featuring the tech industry's barons all testifying together -- and this will indeed be Jeff Bezos' first appearance before Congress. </p><p>The stakes are high -- for the industry, yes, but especially for the American consumer.</p><p>But why does a topic as dry as platform dominance, as the House Judiciary Committee puts it, matter so much to ordinary Americans?</p><p>After all, Americans love their tech -- and many of us couldn't live or work without an always steady, high-speed internet connection. We love scrolling our Facebook and Instagram feeds -- and especially appreciate the latter's artistic simplicity. Many of us have relied on Amazon Fresh for grocery deliveries during (and long before) the Covid-19 pandemic. The iPhone is possibly the most beautiful widely available consumer device. And I'll admit -- I'll quite often spend hours on YouTube catching up on politics and sports.</p><p>But as Silicon Valley tightens its stranglehold on the digital media environment every year -- especially so in 2020 as we have relied ever more on technology to help stay connected through the coronavirus outbreak -- the silent danger of the domination over digital media achieved by these four firms looms large.</p><p> It is a complex problem. These companies are each \"monopolies\" in their own respective rights, with Facebook, Google and Amazon possessing shares of at least half of the overall market in social media, internet search and online book sales respectively. Developers have meanwhile accused the App Store, available through Apple's closed iOS, of being a monopoly. Each company is vitally important in today's media environment. </p><p>But it is one thing to possess a monopoly and quite another to cause harm based off of the market power afforded through that monopoly position.</p><p>I see three broad public interest areas in which the big four firms should present serious concern to every American -- and indeed could implicate the national economy in various ways if nothing is done to rein in their market power: Consumer prices, quality of services rendered and innovation in the marketplace.</p><p>Price. According to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, the search engine is famously \"free.\" He is right that we don't have to pay any money to Google to start up an account and search the corpus or start down the YouTube rabbit hole. But what happens when a single company dominates internet searches, and controls access to influence the people who use its monopoly platforms through the bottleneck of Google's advertising regime?</p><p>Put another way: could it be that Google is systematically extracting wealth from us in the form of a novel currency that is the complex combination of our data and attention -- and leasing that exploitatively raked information and attention out to marketers at ever-rising rates? Could something similar be happening with Facebook's monopolization of social media and web-based text messaging, or Amazon's tremendous power in e-commerce, or in the App Store, through which Apple rakes 30% of app revenues? </p><p>Quality. It's no surprise that parts of today's media ecosystem have become completely polarized and replete with offensive content. The Russian disinformation problem, the spread of hateful conduct online, engagement in violence and digital extremism, the prevalence of algorithmic discrimination -- these and other concerns with social media have triggered the #StopHateForProfit campaign among other efforts undertaken by civil rights advocates.</p><p>Part of the problem, regrettably, is a lack of sufficient financial incentive (though the Facebook ad boycott may change that should it gather enough steam) to address the offensive-speech problem. </p><p>Innovation. As some have argued, Apple has a monopoly in the closed-system device market; it controls the consumer value chain, from the physical device technology, to the pre-installed iOS operating system, to the core mobile applications and services that run atop it all -- and there is no other closed-system provider that does it so compellingly. This stranglehold, and the capacity to collect large amounts of personal and proprietary information across it, has meant Apple has consistently been able to give its own products a position of privilege in contexts like the App Store -- allegations similar to those that Amazon has had to deal with. This necessarily diminishes any chance for competition in the iOS app market -- let alone the overall closed-system market. And that leaves aside the fact that Apple (and Android) heavily rake in revenues appreciated out of their respective app stores. </p><p>It's a circumstance that kills the incentive for members of the industry and entrepreneurs to develop new features and web technologies for us to interact and engage with -- and severely diminishes the progress of vibrancy and dynamism across the internet.</p><p>These are the negative impacts that we -- as everyday users of the internet -- are experiencing. And yet, we don't feel them. We don't feel our pockets getting lighter, or the pace of digital innovation slowing gradually, and many users aren't even subjected to the racism, bigotry, hatred and conspiracy-peddling that's become the norm for some of us -- particularly, marginalized communities. But the fact that we don't feel these harms doesn't mean they're not happening -- and the silent nature of the damage they do should be most concerning of all.</p><p>The Judiciary Committee must probe into these issues: It must ask the questions necessary to build evidence that can point to the harms that Big Tech has done in the realms of prices rendered to consumers, market innovation and quality of service.</p><p>And beyond these issues, there is yet another looming danger: Increasingly, these companies are showing features of not only being monopolies, but natural monopolies. We cannot imagine an alternative to them anymore. Barriers to entry are too high given the physical and digital infrastructures these companies have built up to protect their market positions.</p><p>They ride a powerful network effect, whereby as more and more users join their networks they become economically ever more powerful. In time, we cannot imagine societal investment in an alternative; why build a second railroad, or electric network, or telephone line -- or, indeed, social media network -- when you have one that \"works\"?</p><p>These are the issues Congress must break down for Americans -- and if we can successfully do so, we'll finally make headway down the long road of rebalancing power in the media ecosystem from Silicon Valley to the rest of society. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion at CNN.   (CNN)Has Silicon Valley gotten too big?  It's a running theme these days: That big tech is has become overly powerful, that Facebook and Google regulate speech on their respective platforms, that Apple and Amazon misuse their monopoly power. But what -- exactly -- does all of this mean? Why should we care even if big tech has gotten too big? These are the questions that the House Judiciary Committee will have to get to the bottom of when it hosts its Wednesday hearing featuring the CEOs of those four companies -- arguably, the four most powerful business executives in the United States, let alone the tech industry. It is a unique opportunity: Never before have we had such a vaunted occasion featuring the tech industry's barons all testifying together -- and this will indeed be before Congress. The stakes are high -- for the industry, yes, but especially for the American consumer. But why does a topic as dry as platform dominance, as the House Judiciary Committee puts it, matter so much to ordinary Americans? After all, Americans love their tech -- and many of us couldn't live or work without an always steady, high-speed internet connection. We love scrolling our Facebook and Instagram feeds -- and especially appreciate the latter's artistic simplicity. Many of us have relied on Amazon Fresh for grocery deliveries during (and long before) the Covid-19 pandemic. The iPhone is possibly the most beautiful widely available consumer device. And I'll admit -- I'll quite often spend hours on YouTube catching up on politics and sports. But as Silicon Valley tightens its stranglehold on the digital media environment every year -- especially so in 2020 as we have relied ever more on technology to help stay connected through the coronavirus outbreak -- the silent danger of the domination over digital media achieved by these four firms looms large. It is a complex problem. These companies are each \"monopolies\" in their own respective rights, with Facebook, Google and Amazon possessing shares of at least half of the overall market in social media, internet search and online book sales respectively. Developers have meanwhile accused the App Store, available through Apple's closed iOS, of being a monopoly. Each company is vitally important in today's media environment. But it is one thing to possess a monopoly and quite another to cause harm based off of the market power afforded through that monopoly position. I see three broad public interest areas in which the big four firms should present serious concern to every American -- and indeed could implicate the national economy in various ways if nothing is done to rein in their market power: Consumer prices, quality of services rendered and innovation in the marketplace. Price. According to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, the search engine is famously \"free.\" He is right that we don't have to pay any money to Google to start up an account and search the corpus or start down the YouTube rabbit hole. But what happens when a single company dominates internet searches, and controls access to influence the people who use its monopoly platforms through the bottleneck of Google's advertising regime? Put another way: could it be that Google is systematically extracting wealth from us in the form of a novel currency that is the complex combination of our data and attention -- and leasing that exploitatively raked information and attention out to marketers at ever-rising rates? Could something similar be happening with Facebook's monopolization of social media and web-based text messaging, or Amazon's tremendous power in e-commerce, or in the App Store, through which Apple rakes 30% of app revenues? Quality. It's no surprise that parts of today's media ecosystem have become completely polarized and replete with offensive content. The Russian disinformation problem, the spread of hateful conduct online, engagement in violence and digital extremism, the prevalence of algorithmic discrimination -- these and other concerns with social media have triggered the #StopHateForProfit campaign among other efforts undertaken by civil rights advocates. Part of the problem, regrettably, is a lack of sufficient financial incentive (though the Facebook ad boycott may change that should it gather enough steam) to address the offensive-speech problem. Innovation. As some have argued, Apple has a monopoly in the closed-system device market; it controls the consumer value chain, from the physical device technology, to the pre-installed iOS operating system, to the core mobile applications and services that run atop it all -- and there is no other closed-system provider that does it so compellingly. This stranglehold, and the capacity to collect large amounts of personal and proprietary information across it, has meant Apple has consistently been able to give its own products a position of privilege in contexts like the App Store -- allegations similar to those that Amazon has had to deal with. This necessarily diminishes any chance for competition in the iOS app market -- let alone the overall closed-system market. And that leaves aside the fact that Apple (and Android) heavily rake in revenues appreciated out of their respective app stores. It's a circumstance that kills the incentive for members of the industry and entrepreneurs to develop new features and web technologies for us to interact and engage with -- and severely diminishes the progress of vibrancy and dynamism across the internet. These are the negative impacts that we -- as everyday users of the internet -- are experiencing. And yet, we don't feel them. We don't feel our pockets getting lighter, or the pace of digital innovation slowing gradually, and many users aren't even subjected to the racism, bigotry, hatred and conspiracy-peddling that's become the norm for some of us -- particularly, marginalized communities. But the fact that we don't feel these harms doesn't mean they're not happening -- and the silent nature of the damage they do should be most concerning of all. The Judiciary Committee must probe into these issues: It must ask the questions necessary to build evidence that can point to the harms that Big Tech has done in the realms of prices rendered to consumers, market innovation and quality of service. And beyond these issues, there is yet another looming danger: Increasingly, these companies are showing features of not only being monopolies, but natural monopolies. We cannot imagine an alternative to them anymore. Barriers to entry are too high given the physical and digital infrastructures these companies have built up to protect their market positions. They ride a powerful network effect, whereby as more and more users join their networks they become economically ever more powerful. In time, we cannot imagine societal investment in an alternative; why build a second railroad, or electric network, or telephone line -- or, indeed, social media network -- when you have one that \"works\"? These are the issues Congress must break down for Americans -- and if we can successfully do so, we'll finally make headway down the long road of rebalancing power in the media ecosystem from Silicon Valley to the rest of society.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42706297253</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G1-19J1-F07F-8021-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1310\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They wanted to kill landmark privacy regulations that would soon ban Internet providers, such as Comcast and AT&amp;T, from storing and selling customers\u2019 browsing histories without their express consent.  </p><p><br/><br/>So after weeks of closed-door debates on Capitol Hill over who would take up the issue first \u2014 the House or the Senate \u2014 Republican members settled on a secret strategy, according to Hill staff and lobbyists involved in the battle. While the nation was distracted by the House\u2019s pending vote to repeal Obamacare, Senate Republicans would schedule a vote to wipe out the new privacy protections.  <br/><br/>On March 23, the measure passed on a straight party-line vote, 50 to 48. Five days later, a majority of House Republicans voted in favor of it, sending it to the White House, where <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>signed the bill in early April without ceremony or public comment.  <br/><br/>\u201cWhile everyone was focused on the latest headline crisis coming out of the White House, Congress was able to roll back privacy,\u201d said former Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler, who worked for nearly two years to pass the rules.  <br/><br/>The process to eliminate them took only a matter of weeks. The blowback was immediate.  <br/><br/>Constituents heckled several of the lawmakers at town halls. \u201cYou sold my privacy up the river!\u201d one person yelled at <person><nameText>Sen. Jeff Flake </nameText></person>(R-Ariz.) \u2014 lead sponsor of the Senate bill \u2014 at a gathering in April. Several late-night comedians roasted congressional Republicans: \u201cThis is what\u2019s wrong with Washington, D.C. I guarantee you there is not one person, not one voter of any political stripe anywhere in America who asked for this,\u201d Stephen Colbert said.  <br/><br/>The quick undoing of the Internet privacy rules has prompted lawmakers in more than a dozen states to propose local laws to restore privacy protections to their constituents.  <br/><br/>The FCC privacy rules were among the first of more than a hundred regulations and laws being targeted for elimination or massive overhaul by Trump and Republican members of Congress who want to dismantle Obama-era regulations they view as burdensome.  <br/><br/>How the privacy rules came to be undone helps to explain and inform the strategies behind the broader range of Republican initiatives in the works. The rollback of privacy, for example, was the first step by the Republican-led FCC to overhaul Obama-era net neutrality rules .  <br/><br/>The rolling crises within Trump\u2019s administration and Republican infighting has slowed Republican lawmakers\u2019 work on Capitol Hill. But they remain positioned to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on their control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, a power structure that has not existed in more than a decade.  <br/><br/>\u201cTrump and the Republicans are doing so many different things on parallel tracks, the news media and activists can\u2019t follow it all,\u201d said Trump adviser and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \u201cThis is by design.\u201d  <br/><br/>The Internet privacy rules were adopted in October during the last days of the Obama administration after an intense battle that pitted large Internet service providers, the advertising industry and tech giants against consumer advocates and civil rights groups.  <br/><br/>The rules required Internet service providers to get explicit consent before they gather their customers\u2019 data \u2014 their browsing histories, the locations of businesses they physically visit and the mobile applications they use \u2014 and sell it to third parties. Proponents said the rules were necessary because consumers must use a provider to access the Internet.  <br/><br/>The requirements were modeled after a law passed decades ago by Congress that prohibited telephone companies from collecting customers\u2019 calling histories and selling the information to third parties. \u201cThere has been an expectation from the beginning of the telecommunications era that your privacy is not up for sale,\u201d said Sen. Edward J. Markey, (D-Mass.) who fought to preserve the rules.  <br/><br/>The industry, Republican FCC commissioners and lawmakers said the restrictions were too broad and should be limited to highly sensitive data, such as personal medical information, not data gathered from activities like online car shopping. The rules, they said, would cause consumers to miss out on customized promotions. And, opponents said, the threat to privacy was overstated \u2014 a provider might learn that a person visited a website but would not typically know what the person did while there.  <br/><br/>Because the commission\u2019s privacy rules passed on a party-line vote, three Democrats in favor and two Republicans opposed, the rules were viewed as extremely partisan. This made them vulnerable from the start, said Jon Leibowitz, co-chair of the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, a group financed by Internet providers, which led the effort to eliminate the requirements.  <br/><br/>The campaign to kill the FCC rules began just a few weeks after Trump\u2019s November victory.  <br/><br/>Lobbyists from trade groups funded by large broadband companies \u2014 including Leibowitz\u2019s group and the Consumer Technology Association \u2014 made phone calls and held small, private meetings with Republican congressional aides, according to Hill staff, consultants and lobbyists on both sides of the issue. They were shopping for bill sponsors and approached Flake and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who had been vocal opponents of the rules when they were being crafted at the FCC. The two agreed to champion the cause.  <br/><br/>\u201cWe had a broad coalition of groups, and we thought, \u2018We don\u2019t like it; let\u2019s present this to them,\u2019 \u201d said Julie Kearney, vice president of regulatory affairs with the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group for the industry. \u201cThe administration and Congress did not come to us.\u201d  <br/><br/>Flake and Blackburn declined to comment for this article.  <br/><br/>Kearney said trade groups for Internet service providers asked Congress to use a legislative maneuver under the Congressional Review Act that allows Congress to kill recently adopted regulations with a simple majority vote. Before the 2016 elections, the 21-year-old act had been used only once, in 2001. Since November, Congress and Trump have employed it 14 times to kill Obama-era initiatives.  <br/><br/>\u201cThe last administration was very aggressive with regulations,\u201d Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who voted to eliminate the privacy rules. \u201cWe are looking for the quickest ways to do something about it.\u201d  <br/><br/>By January, trade groups for tech companies such as Facebook and Google had joined the fight to undo the privacy rules, according to records and interviews. Those companies are regulated by a different government body, the Federal Trade Commission, but they worried that Congress might someday find a way to expand the reach of the rules so that they apply to all technology companies.  <br/><br/>Trade groups for large advertisers also got involved in the effort to repeal the law, as did the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  <br/><br/>Consumer and civil rights groups were quickly outnumbered by their opponents, by a ratio of at least 50 to 1, according to Hill staff and lobbyists.  <br/><br/>\u201cThis collaboration between Silicon Valley and cable companies has never been done before,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president and chief executive of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit that advocates for an open Internet and affordable technology. \u201cTheir united, massive economic and political power was insurmountable.\u201d  <br/><br/>During the battle, Flake and Blackburn received large campaign donations from eight of the major Internet providers and big tech companies that wanted to see the rules killed, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.  <br/><br/>The groups gave Flake $22,700 in donations, compared with an average $4,510 they gave other senators between January and April. The groups gave Blackburn $20,500, compared with the $2,045 average donated to other House members in the same time. That is about three times the amount of money Flake and Blackburn received from those groups during the first quarter of last year.  <br/><br/>Groups that worked to preserve the FCC rules donated no money to lawmakers during the first quarter of this year, according to the analysis.  <br/><br/>By February, neither the House nor the Senate had introduced a bill. It appeared to some that the issue may have stalled \u2014 which caused several consumer and civil rights groups such as the Color of Change to let down their guard.  <br/><br/>\u201cWe didn\u2019t think they would have the audacity to go after privacy \u2026 We dismissed the low rumblings,\u201d said Brandi Collins, a senior campaign director at Color of Change, who said data-directed advertising often targets minorities.  <br/><br/>By the end of February, the trade groups for large Internet providers, the advertising industry and tech companies were working in tandem with congressional members who had taken up their cause. Howard Waltzman, a lawyer and lobbyist for the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, said this was \u201cthe pivotal moment.\u201d  <br/><br/>An opinion piece under Flake\u2019s byline appeared in the Wall Street Journal on March 1, saying the rules took away \u201cconsumer choice\u201d because people\u2019s browsing histories could not be used to offer them \u201cinnovative and cost-saving product offerings.\u201d The column said the rules would \u201ccreate confusion\u201d among customers because the FCC and FTC would regulate different parts of the \u201cInternet ecosystem.\u201d The same arguments and similar phrasing were used in a letter the industry coalition sent to Congress.  <br/><br/>Hours after Flake\u2019s opinion piece appeared in the Journal, he introduced a Senate bill to kill the rules. A week later, Blackburn did the same in the House.  <br/><br/>For weeks, neither Flake nor Blackburn scheduled a vote because members feared a potential backlash from voters, according to lobbyists and several Hill staff members.  <br/><br/>\u201cThere was a bit of chicken played between the House and Senate,\u201d said Dallas Harris, another lobbyist for Public Knowledge.  <br/><br/>Finally, Flake scheduled the vote for March 22. It was not until then that the campaign against it took off.  <br/><br/>The American Civil Liberties Union, Free Press and other groups delivered a petition with 100,000 signatures to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other congressional leaders hours before the Senate began its debate on the bill.  <br/><br/>When Senate Republicans passed the bill the following day on a narrow party-line vote, the issue finally exploded across the Internet and in mainstream, liberal and conservative media.  <br/><br/>NBC, CNN, FOX and MSNBC carried stories about the vote. And conservative online platforms \u2014 such as Breitbart News and Reddit sites devoted to Trump \u2014 were packed with posts from Trump supporters who were angry about the bill.  <br/><br/>More than 20,000 calls flooded House members\u2019 office phone lines, and more than a dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 a congressional group of conservative and libertarian Republicans \u2014 told Blackburn they would likely not vote for the bill, several Hill staff told The Washington Post.  <br/><br/>Waltzman said the fight intensified: \u201cSuddenly, we were dealing with flat-out lies. Members were saying, \u2018These companies can see literally everything you do online.\u2019 That is simply not true.\u201d  <br/><br/>Fearing more House Republicans could defect, Hill staff said, McConnell and other Republican leaders asked the Trump administration to issue a statement signaling that he would sign the bill. The White House staff did so.  <br/><br/>Within hours, Blackburn introduced the bill on the House floor and called for a vote.  <br/><br/>Rep. Michael E. Capuano (D-Mass.) took to the floor, screaming: \u201cWhat are you thinking? \u2026 Just last week I bought underwear on the Internet. Why should you know what size I take? Or the color?

They wanted to kill landmark privacy regulations that would soon ban Internet providers, such as Comcast and AT&amp;T, from storing and selling customers\u2019 browsing histories without their express consent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So after weeks of closed-door debates on Capitol Hill over who would take up the issue first \u2014 the House or the Senate \u2014 Republican members settled on a secret strategy, according to Hill staff and lobbyists involved in the battle. While the nation was distracted by the House\u2019s pending vote to repeal Obamacare, Senate Republicans would schedule a vote to wipe out the new privacy protections.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>On March 23, the measure passed on a straight party-line vote, 50 to 48. Five days later, a majority of House Republicans voted in favor of it, sending it to the White House, where President Trump signed the bill in early April without ceremony or public comment.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhile everyone was focused on the latest headline crisis coming out of the White House, Congress was able to roll back privacy,\u201d said former Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler, who worked for nearly two years to pass the rules.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The process to eliminate them took only a matter of weeks. The blowback was immediate.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Constituents heckled several of the lawmakers at town halls. \u201cYou sold my privacy up the river!\u201d one person yelled at Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) \u2014 lead sponsor of the Senate bill \u2014 at a gathering in April. Several late-night comedians roasted congressional Republicans: \u201cThis is what\u2019s wrong with Washington, D.C I guarantee you there is not one person, not one voter of any political stripe anywhere in America who asked for this,\u201d Stephen Colbert said.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The quick undoing of the Internet privacy rules has prompted lawmakers in more than a dozen states to propose local laws to restore privacy protections to their constituents.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The FCC privacy rules were among the first of more than a hundred regulations and laws being targeted for elimination or massive overhaul by Trump and Republican members of Congress who want to dismantle Obama-era regulations they view as burdensome.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>How the privacy rules came to be undone helps to explain and inform the strategies behind the broader range of Republican initiatives in the works. The rollback of privacy, for example, was the first step by the Republican-led FCC to overhaul Obama-era net neutrality rules .</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The rolling crises within Trump\u2019s administration and Republican infighting has slowed Republican lawmakers\u2019 work on Capitol Hill. But they remain positioned to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on their control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, a power structure that has not existed in more than a decade.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTrump and the Republicans are doing so many different things on parallel tracks, the news media and activists can\u2019t follow it all,\u201d said Trump adviser and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \u201cThis is by design.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The Internet privacy rules were adopted in October during the last days of the Obama administration after an intense battle that pitted large Internet service providers, the advertising industry and tech giants against consumer advocates and civil rights groups.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The rules required Internet service providers to get explicit consent before they gather their customers\u2019 data \u2014 their browsing histories, the locations of businesses they physically visit and the mobile applications they use \u2014 and sell it to third parties. Proponents said the rules were necessary because consumers must use a provider to access the Internet.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The requirements were modeled after a law passed decades ago by Congress that prohibited telephone companies from collecting customers\u2019 calling histories and selling the information to third parties. \u201cThere has been an expectation from the beginning of the telecommunications era that your privacy is not up for sale,\u201d said Sen. Edward J. Markey, (D-Mass.) who fought to preserve the rules.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The industry, Republican FCC commissioners and lawmakers said the restrictions were too broad and should be limited to highly sensitive data, such as personal medical information, not data gathered from activities like online car shopping. The rules, they said, would cause consumers to miss out on customized promotions. And, opponents said, the threat to privacy was overstated \u2014 a provider might learn that a person visited a website but would not typically know what the person did while there.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Because the commission\u2019s privacy rules passed on a party-line vote, three Democrats in favor and two Republicans opposed, the rules were viewed as extremely partisan. This made them vulnerable from the start, said Jon Leibowitz, co-chair of the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, a group financed by Internet providers, which led the effort to eliminate the requirements.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The campaign to kill the FCC rules began just a few weeks after Trump\u2019s November victory.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Lobbyists from trade groups funded by large broadband companies \u2014 including Leibowitz\u2019s group and the Consumer Technology Association \u2014 made phone calls and held small, private meetings with Republican congressional aides, according to Hill staff, consultants and lobbyists on both sides of the issue. They were shopping for bill sponsors and approached Flake and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who had been vocal opponents of the rules when they were being crafted at the FCC. The two agreed to champion the cause.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe had a broad coalition of groups, and we thought, \u2018We don\u2019t like it; let\u2019s present this to them,\u2019 \u201d said Julie Kearney, vice president of regulatory affairs with the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group for the industry. \u201cThe administration and Congress did not come to us.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Flake and Blackburn declined to comment for this article.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Kearney said trade groups for Internet service providers asked Congress to use a legislative maneuver under the Congressional Review Act that allows Congress to kill recently adopted regulations with a simple majority vote. Before the 2016 elections, the 21-year-old act had been used only once, in 2001. Since November, Congress and Trump have employed it 14 times to kill Obama-era initiatives.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe last administration was very aggressive with regulations,\u201d Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C ), who voted to eliminate the privacy rules. \u201cWe are looking for the quickest ways to do something about it.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>By January, trade groups for tech companies such as Facebook and Google had joined the fight to undo the privacy rules, according to records and interviews. Those companies are regulated by a different government body, the Federal Trade Commission, but they worried that Congress might someday find a way to expand the reach of the rules so that they apply to all technology companies.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Trade groups for large advertisers also got involved in the effort to repeal the law, as did the U.S Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Consumer and civil rights groups were quickly outnumbered by their opponents, by a ratio of at least 50 to 1, according to Hill staff and lobbyists.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis collaboration between Silicon Valley and cable companies has never been done before,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president and chief executive of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit that advocates for an open Internet and affordable technology. \u201cTheir united, massive economic and political power was insurmountable.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>During the battle, Flake and Blackburn received large campaign donations from eight of the major Internet providers and big tech companies that wanted to see the rules killed, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The groups gave Flake $22,700 in donations, compared with an average $4,510 they gave other senators between January and April. The groups gave Blackburn $20,500, compared with the $2,045 average donated to other House members in the same time. That is about three times the amount of money Flake and Blackburn received from those groups during the first quarter of last year.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Groups that worked to preserve the FCC rules donated no money to lawmakers during the first quarter of this year, according to the analysis.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>By February, neither the House nor the Senate had introduced a bill. It appeared to some that the issue may have stalled \u2014 which caused several consumer and civil rights groups such as the Color of Change to let down their guard.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t think they would have the audacity to go after privacy \u2026 We dismissed the low rumblings,\u201d said Brandi Collins, a senior campaign director at Color of Change, who said data-directed advertising often targets minorities.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>By the end of February, the trade groups for large Internet providers, the advertising industry and tech companies were working in tandem with congressional members who had taken up their cause. Howard Waltzman, a lawyer and lobbyist for the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, said this was \u201cthe pivotal moment.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>An opinion piece under Flake\u2019s byline appeared in the Wall Street Journal on March 1, saying the rules took away \u201cconsumer choice\u201d because people\u2019s browsing histories could not be used to offer them \u201cinnovative and cost-saving product offerings.\u201d The column said the rules would \u201ccreate confusion\u201d among customers because the FCC and FTC would regulate different parts of the \u201cInternet ecosystem.\u201d The same arguments and similar phrasing were used in a letter the industry coalition sent to Congress.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Hours after Flake\u2019s opinion piece appeared in the Journal, he introduced a Senate bill to kill the rules. A week later, Blackburn did the same in the House.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>For weeks, neither Flake nor Blackburn scheduled a vote because members feared a potential backlash from voters, according to lobbyists and several Hill staff members.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere was a bit of chicken played between the House and Senate,\u201d said Dallas Harris, another lobbyist for Public Knowledge.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Finally, Flake scheduled the vote for March 22. It was not until then that the campaign against it took off.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union, Free Press and other groups delivered a petition with 100,000 signatures to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other congressional leaders hours before the Senate began its debate on the bill.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>When Senate Republicans passed the bill the following day on a narrow party-line vote, the issue finally exploded across the Internet and in mainstream, liberal and conservative media.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>NBC, CNN, FOX and MSNBC carried stories about the vote. And conservative online platforms \u2014 such as Breitbart News and Reddit sites devoted to Trump \u2014 were packed with posts from Trump supporters who were angry about the bill.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>More than 20,000 calls flooded House members\u2019 office phone lines, and more than a dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 a congressional group of conservative and libertarian Republicans \u2014 told Blackburn they would likely not vote for the bill, several Hill staff told The Washington Post.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Waltzman said the fight intensified: \u201cSuddenly, we were dealing with flat-out lies. Members were saying, \u2018These companies can see literally everything you do online.\u2019 That is simply not true.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Fearing more House Republicans could defect, Hill staff said, McConnell and other Republican leaders asked the Trump administration to issue a statement signaling that he would sign the bill.

They wanted to kill landmark privacy regulations that would soon ban Internet providers, such as Comcast and AT&amp;T, from storing and selling customers' browsing histories without their express consent. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So after weeks of closed-door debates on Capitol Hill over who would take up the issue first - the House or the Senate - Republican members settled on a secret strategy, according to Hill staff and lobbyists involved in the battle. While the nation was distracted by the House's pending vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Senate Republicans would schedule a vote to wipe out the new privacy protections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On March 23, the measure passed on a straight party-line vote, 50 to 48. Five days later, a majority of House Republicans voted in favor of it, sending it to the White House, where <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>signed the bill in early April without ceremony or public comment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"While everyone was focused on the latest headline crisis coming out of the White House, Congress was able to roll back privacy,\" said former Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler, who worked for nearly two years to pass the rules.</p><p>The process to eliminate them took only a matter of weeks. The blowback was immediate.</p><p>Constituents heckled several of the lawmakers at town halls. \"You sold my privacy up the river!\" one person yelled at <person><nameText>Sen. Jeff Flake </nameText></person>(R-Ariz.) - lead sponsor of the Senate bill - at a gathering in April. Several late-night comedians roasted congressional Republicans: \"This is what's wrong with Washington, D.C. I guarantee you there is not one person, not one voter of any political stripe anywhere in America, who asked for this,\" Stephen Colbert said.</p><p>The quick undoing of the Internet privacy rules has prompted lawmakers in more than a dozen states to propose local laws to restore privacy protections to their constituents.</p><p>The FCC privacy rules were among the first of more than 100 regulations and laws being targeted for elimination or massive overhaul by Trump and Republican members of Congress who want to dismantle Obama-era regulations they view as burdensome.</p><p>How the privacy rules came to be undone helps to explain and inform the strategies behind the broader range of Republican initiatives in the works. The rollback of privacy, for example, was the first step by the Republican-led FCC to overhaul Obama-era net neutrality rules .</p><p>The rolling crises within Trump's administration and Republican infighting have slowed Republican lawmakers' work on Capitol Hill. But they remain positioned to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on their control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, a power structure that has not existed in more than a decade.</p><p>\"Trump and the Republicans are doing so many different things on parallel tracks, the news media and activists can't follow it all,\" said Trump adviser and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \"This is by design.\"</p><p>The Internet privacy rules were adopted in October during the last days of the Obama administration after an intense battle that pitted large Internet service providers, the advertising industry and tech giants against consumer advocates and civil rights groups.</p><p>The rules required Internet service providers to get explicit consent before they gather their customers' data - their browsing histories, the locations of businesses they physically visit and the mobile applications they use - and sell it to third parties. Proponents said the rules were necessary because consumers must use a provider to access the Internet.</p><p>The requirements were modeled after a law passed decades ago by Congress that prohibited telephone companies from collecting customers' calling histories and selling the information to third parties. \"There has been an expectation from the beginning of the telecommunications era that your privacy is not up for sale,\" said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who fought to preserve the rules.</p><p>The industry, Republican FCC commissioners and GOP lawmakers said the restrictions were too broad and should be limited to highly sensitive data, such as personal medical information, not data gathered from activities such as online car shopping. The rules, they said, would cause consumers to miss out on customized promotions. And, opponents said, the threat to privacy was overstated - a provider might learn that a person visited a website but would not typically know what the person did while there.</p><p>Because the commission's privacy rules passed on a party-line vote, three Democrats in favor and two Republicans opposed, the rules were viewed as extremely partisan. This made them vulnerable from the start, said Jon Leibowitz, co-chair of the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, a group financed by Internet providers, which led the effort to eliminate the requirements.</p><p>The campaign to kill the FCC rules began just a few weeks after Trump's victory in November.</p><p>Lobbyists from trade groups funded by large broadband companies - including Leibowitz's group and the Consumer Technology Association - made phone calls and held small, private meetings with Republican congressional aides, according to Hill staff, consultants and lobbyists on both sides of the issue. They were shopping for bill sponsors and approached Flake and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who had been vocal opponents of the rules when they were being crafted at the FCC. The two agreed to champion the cause.</p><p>\"We had a broad coalition of groups, and we thought, 'We don't like it; let's present this to them,' \" said Julie Kearney, vice president of regulatory affairs with the Consumer Technology Association. \"The administration and Congress did not come to us.\"</p><p>Flake and Blackburn declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Kearney said trade groups for Internet service providers asked lawmakers to use a legislative maneuver under the Congressional Review Act that allows Congress to kill recently adopted regulations with a simple majority vote. Before the 2016 elections, the 21-year-old act had been used only once, in 2001. Since November, Congress and Trump have employed it 14 times to kill Obama-era initiatives.</p><p>\"The last administration was very aggressive with regulations,\" said Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who voted to eliminate the privacy rules. \"We are looking for the quickest ways to do something about it.\"</p><p>By January, trade groups for tech companies such as Facebook and Google had joined the fight to undo the privacy rules, according to records and interviews. Those companies are regulated by a different government body, the Federal Trade Commission, but they worried that Congress might someday find a way to expand the reach of the rules so that they apply to all technology companies.</p><p>Trade groups for large advertisers also got involved in the effort to repeal the law, as did the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Consumer and civil rights groups were quickly outnumbered by their opponents, by a ratio of at least 50 to 1, according to Hill staff and lobbyists.</p><p>\"This collaboration between Silicon Valley and cable companies has never been done before,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president and chief executive of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit group that advocates for an open Internet and affordable technology. \"Their united, massive economic and political power was insurmountable.\"</p><p>During the battle, Flake and Blackburn received large campaign donations from eight of the major Internet providers and big tech companies that wanted to see the rules killed, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>The groups gave Flake $22,700 in donations, compared with an average $4,510 they gave other senators between January and April. The groups gave Blackburn $20,500, compared with the $2,045 average donated to other House members in the same time. That is about three times the amount of money Flake and Blackburn received from those groups during the first quarter of last year.</p><p>Groups that worked to preserve the FCC rules donated no money to lawmakers during the first quarter of this year, according to the analysis.</p><p>By February, neither the House nor the Senate had introduced a bill. It appeared to some that the issue might have stalled - which caused several consumer and civil rights groups, such as the Color of Change, to let down their guard.</p><p>\"We didn't think they would have the audacity to go after privacy. . . . We dismissed the low rumblings,\" said Brandi Collins, a senior campaign director at Color of Change, who said data-directed advertising often targets minorities.</p><p>By the end of February, the trade groups for large Internet providers, the advertising industry and tech companies were working in tandem with congressional members who had taken up their cause. Howard Waltzman, a lawyer and lobbyist for the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, said this was \"the pivotal moment.\"</p><p>An opinion piece under Flake's byline appeared in the Wall Street Journal on March 1, saying the rules took away \"consumer choice\" because people's browsing histories could not be used to offer them \"innovative and cost-saving product offerings.\" The column said the rules would \"create confusion\" among customers because the FCC and FTC would regulate different parts of the \"Internet ecosystem.\" The same arguments and similar phrasing were used in a letter the industry coalition sent to Congress.</p><p>Hours after Flake's opinion piece appeared in the Journal, he introduced a Senate bill to kill the rules. A week later, Blackburn did the same in the House.</p><p>For weeks, neither Flake nor Blackburn scheduled a vote because members feared a potential backlash from voters, according to lobbyists and several Hill staff members.</p><p>\"There was a bit of chicken played between the House and Senate,\" said Dallas Harris, another lobbyist for Public Knowledge.</p><p>Finally, Flake scheduled the vote for March 22. It was not until then that the campaign against it took off.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union, Free Press and other groups delivered a petition with 100,000 signatures to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other congressional leaders hours before the Senate began its debate on the bill.</p><p>When Senate Republicans passed the bill the following day on a narrow party-line vote, the issue finally exploded across the Internet and in mainstream, liberal and conservative media.</p><p>NBC, CNN, Fox and MSNBC carried stories about the vote. And conservative online platforms - such as Breitbart News and Reddit sites devoted to Trump - were packed with posts from Trump supporters who were angry about the bill.</p><p>More than 20,000 calls flooded House members' office phone lines, and more than a dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus - a congressional group of conservative and libertarian Republicans - told Blackburn they probably would not vote for the bill, several Hill staff told The Washington Post.</p><p>Waltzman said the fight intensified: \"Suddenly, we were dealing with flat-out lies. Members were saying, 'These companies can see literally everything you do online.' That is simply not true.\"</p><p>Fearing more House Republicans could defect, Hill staff said, McConnell and other Republican leaders asked the Trump administration to issue a statement signaling that he would sign the bill. The White House staff did so.</p><p>Within hours, Blackburn introduced the bill on the House floor and called for a vote.</p><p>Rep. Michael E.

They wanted to kill landmark privacy regulations that would soon ban Internet providers, such as Comcast and AT&amp;T, from storing and selling customers' browsing histories without their express consent. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So after weeks of closed-door debates on Capitol Hill over who would take up the issue first - the House or the Senate - Republican members settled on a secret strategy, according to Hill staff and lobbyists involved in the battle. While the nation was distracted by the House's pending vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Senate Republicans would schedule a vote to wipe out the new privacy protections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On March 23, the measure passed on a straight party-line vote, 50 to 48. Five days later, a majority of House Republicans voted in favor of it, sending it to the White House, where <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>signed the bill in early April without ceremony or public comment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"While everyone was focused on the latest headline crisis coming out of the White House, Congress was able to roll back privacy,\" said former Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler, who worked for nearly two years to pass the rules.</p><p>The process to eliminate them took only a matter of weeks. The blowback was immediate.</p><p>Constituents heckled several of the lawmakers at town halls. \"You sold my privacy up the river!\" one person yelled at <person><nameText>Sen. Jeff Flake </nameText></person>(R-Ariz.) - lead sponsor of the Senate bill - at a gathering in April. Several late-night comedians roasted congressional Republicans: \"This is what's wrong with Washington, D.C. I guarantee you there is not one person, not one voter of any political stripe anywhere in America who asked for this,\" Stephen Colbert said.</p><p>The quick undoing of the Internet privacy rules has prompted lawmakers in more than a dozen states to propose local laws to restore privacy protections to their constituents.</p><p>The FCC privacy rules were among the first of more than 100 regulations and laws being targeted for elimination or massive overhaul by Trump and Republican members of Congress who want to dismantle Obama-era regulations they view as burdensome.</p><p>How the privacy rules came to be undone helps to explain and inform the strategies behind the broader range of Republican initiatives in the works. The rollback of privacy, for example, was the first step by the Republican-led FCC to overhaul Obama-era net neutrality rules .</p><p>The rolling crises within Trump's administration and Republican infighting have slowed Republican lawmakers' work on Capitol Hill. But they remain positioned to capitalize on their control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, a power structure that has not existed in more than a decade.</p><p>\"Trump and the Republicans are doing so many different things on parallel tracks, the news media and activists can't follow it all,\" said Trump adviser and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \"This is by design.\"</p><p>The Internet privacy rules were adopted in October during the last days of the Obama administration after an intense battle that pitted large Internet service providers, the advertising industry and tech giants against consumer advocates and civil rights groups.</p><p>The rules required Internet service providers to get explicit consent before they gather their customers' data - their browsing histories, the locations of businesses they physically visit and the mobile applications they use - and sell it to third parties. Proponents said the rules were necessary because consumers must use a provider to access the Internet.</p><p>The requirements were modeled after a law passed decades ago by Congress that prohibited telephone companies from collecting customers' calling histories and selling the information to third parties. \"There has been an expectation from the beginning of the telecommunications era that your privacy is not up for sale,\" said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who fought to preserve the rules.</p><p>The industry, Republican FCC commissioners and GOP lawmakers said the restrictions were too broad and should be limited to highly sensitive data, such as personal medical information, not data gathered from activities such as online car shopping. The rules, they said, would cause consumers to miss out on customized promotions. And, opponents said, the threat to privacy was overstated - a provider might learn that a person visited a website but would not typically know what the person did while there.</p><p>Because the commission's privacy rules passed on a party-line vote, three Democrats in favor and two Republicans opposed, the rules were viewed as extremely partisan. This made them vulnerable from the start, said Jon Leibowitz, co-chair of the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, a group financed by Internet providers, which led the effort to eliminate the requirements.</p><p>The campaign to kill the FCC rules began just a few weeks after Trump's victory in November.</p><p>Lobbyists from trade groups funded by large broadband companies - including Leibowitz's group and the Consumer Technology Association - made phone calls and held small, private meetings with Republican congressional aides, according to Hill staff, consultants and lobbyists on both sides of the issue. They were shopping for bill sponsors and approached Flake and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who had been vocal opponents of the rules when they were being crafted at the FCC. The two agreed to champion the cause.</p><p>\"We had a broad coalition of groups, and we thought, 'We don't like it; let's present this to them,' \" said Julie Kearney, vice president of regulatory affairs with the Consumer Technology Association. \"The administration and Congress did not come to us.\"</p><p>Flake and Blackburn declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Kearney said trade groups for Internet service providers asked lawmakers to use a legislative maneuver under the Congressional Review Act that allows Congress to kill recently adopted regulations with a simple majority vote. Before the 2016 elections, the 21-year-old act had been used only once, in 2001. Since November, Congress and Trump have employed it 14 times to kill Obama-era initiatives.</p><p>\"The last administration was very aggressive with regulations,\" said Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who voted to eliminate the privacy rules. \"We are looking for the quickest ways to do something about it.\"</p><p>By January, trade groups for tech companies such as Facebook and Google had joined the fight to undo the privacy rules, according to records and interviews. Those companies are regulated by a different government body, the Federal Trade Commission, but they worried that Congress might someday find a way to expand the reach of the rules so that they apply to all technology companies.</p><p>Trade groups for large advertisers also got involved in the effort to repeal the law, as did the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Consumer and civil rights groups were quickly outnumbered by their opponents, by a ratio of at least 50 to 1, according to Hill staff and lobbyists.</p><p>\"This collaboration between Silicon Valley and cable companies has never been done before,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president and chief executive of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit group that advocates for an open Internet and affordable technology. \"Their united, massive economic and political power was insurmountable.\"</p><p>During the battle, Flake and Blackburn received large campaign donations from eight of the major Internet providers and big tech companies that wanted to see the rules killed, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>The groups gave Flake $22,700 in donations, compared with an average $4,510 they gave other senators between January and April. The groups gave Blackburn $20,500, compared with the $2,045 average donated to other House members in the same time. That is about three times the amount of money Flake and Blackburn received from those groups during the first quarter of last year.</p><p>Groups that worked to preserve the FCC rules donated no money to lawmakers during the first quarter of this year, according to the analysis.</p><p>By February, neither the House nor the Senate had introduced a bill. It appeared to some that the issue may have stalled - which caused several consumer and civil rights groups such as the Color of Change to let down their guard.</p><p>\"We didn't think they would have the audacity to go after privacy. . . . We dismissed the low rumblings,\" said Brandi Collins, a senior campaign director at Color of Change, who said data-directed advertising often targets minorities.</p><p>By the end of February, the trade groups for large Internet providers, the advertising industry and tech companies were working in tandem with congressional members who had taken up their cause. Howard Waltzman, a lawyer and lobbyist for the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, said this was \"the pivotal moment.\"</p><p>             An opinion piece under Flake's byline appeared in the Wall Street Journal on March 1, saying the rules took away \"consumer choice\" because people's browsing histories could not be used to offer them \"innovative and cost-saving product offerings.\" The column said the rules would \"create confusion\" among customers because the FCC and FTC would regulate different parts of the \"Internet ecosystem.\" The same arguments and similar phrasing were used in a letter the industry coalition sent to Congress.</p><p>Hours after Flake's opinion piece appeared in the Journal, he introduced a Senate bill to kill the rules. A week later, Blackburn did the same in the House.</p><p>For weeks, neither Flake nor Blackburn scheduled a vote because members feared a potential backlash from voters, according to lobbyists and several Hill staff members.</p><p>\"There was a bit of chicken played between the House and Senate,\" said Dallas Harris, another lobbyist for Public Knowledge.</p><p>Finally, Flake scheduled the vote for March 22. It was not until then that the campaign against it took off.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union, Free Press and other groups delivered a petition with 100,000 signatures to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other congressional leaders hours before the Senate began its debate on the bill.</p><p>When Senate Republicans passed the bill the following day on a narrow party-line vote, the issue finally exploded across the Internet and in mainstream, liberal and conservative media.</p><p>NBC, CNN, FOX and MSNBC carried stories about the vote. And conservative online platforms - such as Breitbart News and Reddit sites devoted to Trump - were packed with posts from Trump supporters who were angry about the bill.</p><p>More than 20,000 calls flooded House members' office phone lines, and more than a dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus - a congressional group of conservative and libertarian Republicans - told Blackburn they probably would not vote for the bill, several Hill staff told The Washington Post.</p><p>Waltzman said the fight intensified: \"Suddenly, we were dealing with flat-out lies. Members were saying, 'These companies can see literally everything you do online.' That is simply not true.\"</p><p>Fearing more House Republicans could defect, Hill staff said, McConnell and other Republican leaders asked the Trump administration to issue a statement signaling that he would sign the bill. The White House staff did so.</p><p>Within hours, Blackburn introduced the bill on the House floor and called for a vote.</p><p>Rep. Michael E. Capuano (D-Mass.) took to the floor, screaming: \"What are you thinking? . . . Just last week I bought underwear on the Internet. Why should you know what size I take? Or the color?

They wanted to kill landmark privacy regulations that would soon ban Internet providers, such as Comcast and AT&amp;T, from storing and selling customers' browsing histories without their express consent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So after weeks of closed-door debates on Capitol Hill over who would take up the issue first - the House or the Senate - Republican members settled on a secret strategy, according to Hill staff and lobbyists involved in the battle. While the nation was distracted by the House's pending vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Senate Republicans would schedule a vote to wipe out the new privacy protections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On March 23, the measure passed on a straight party-line vote, 50 to 48. Five days later, a majority of House Republicans voted in favor of it, sending it to the White House, where <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>signed the bill in early April without ceremony or public comment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"While everyone was focused on the latest headline crisis coming out of the White House, Congress was able to roll back privacy,\" said former Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler, who worked for nearly two years to pass the rules.</p><p>The process to eliminate them took only a matter of weeks. The blowback was immediate.</p><p>Constituents heckled several of the lawmakers at town halls. \"You sold my privacy up the river!\" one person yelled at <person><nameText>Sen. Jeff Flake </nameText></person>(R-Ariz.) - lead sponsor of the Senate bill - at a gathering in April. Several late-night comedians roasted congressional Republicans: \"This is what's wrong with Washington, D.C. I guarantee you there is not one person, not one voter of any political stripe anywhere in America who asked for this,\" Stephen Colbert said.</p><p>The quick undoing of the Internet privacy rules has prompted lawmakers in more than a dozen states to propose local laws to restore privacy protections to their constituents.</p><p>The FCC privacy rules were among the first of more than 100 regulations and laws being targeted for elimination or massive overhaul by Trump and Republican members of Congress who want to dismantle Obama-era regulations they view as burdensome.</p><p>How the privacy rules came to be undone helps to explain and inform the strategies behind the broader range of Republican initiatives in the works. The rollback of privacy, for example, was the first step by the Republican-led FCC to overhaul Obama-era net neutrality rules .</p><p>The rolling crises within Trump's administration and Republican infighting have slowed Republican lawmakers' work on Capitol Hill. But they remain positioned to capitalize on their control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, a power structure that has not existed in more than a decade.</p><p>\"Trump and the Republicans are doing so many different things on parallel tracks, the news media and activists can't follow it all,\" said Trump adviser and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \"This is by design.\"</p><p>The Internet privacy rules were adopted in October during the last days of the Obama administration after an intense battle that pitted large Internet service providers, the advertising industry and tech giants against consumer advocates and civil rights groups.</p><p>The rules required Internet service providers to get explicit consent before they gather their customers' data - their browsing histories, the locations of businesses they physically visit and the mobile applications they use - and sell it to third parties. Proponents said the rules were necessary because consumers must use a provider to access the Internet.</p><p>The requirements were modeled after a law passed decades ago by Congress that prohibited telephone companies from collecting customers' calling histories and selling the information to third parties. \"There has been an expectation from the beginning of the telecommunications era that your privacy is not up for sale,\" said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who fought to preserve the rules.</p><p>The industry, Republican FCC commissioners and GOP lawmakers said the restrictions were too broad and should be limited to highly sensitive data, such as personal medical information, not data gathered from activities such as online car shopping. The rules, they said, would cause consumers to miss out on customized promotions. And, opponents said, the threat to privacy was overstated - a provider might learn that a person visited a website but would not typically know what the person did while there.</p><p>Because the commission's privacy rules passed on a party-line vote, three Democrats in favor and two Republicans opposed, the rules were viewed as extremely partisan. This made them vulnerable from the start, said Jon Leibowitz, co-chair of the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, a group financed by Internet providers, which led the effort to eliminate the requirements.</p><p>The campaign to kill the FCC rules began just a few weeks after Trump's victory in November.</p><p>Lobbyists from trade groups funded by large broadband companies - including Leibowitz's group and the Consumer Technology Association - made phone calls and held small, private meetings with Republican congressional aides, according to Hill staff, consultants and lobbyists on both sides of the issue. They were shopping for bill sponsors and approached Flake and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who had been vocal opponents of the rules when they were being crafted at the FCC. The two agreed to champion the cause.</p><p>\"We had a broad coalition of groups, and we thought, 'We don't like it; let's present this to them,' \" said Julie Kearney, vice president of regulatory affairs with the Consumer Technology Association. \"The administration and Congress did not come to us.\"</p><p>Flake and Blackburn declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Kearney said trade groups for Internet service providers asked lawmakers to use a legislative maneuver under the Congressional Review Act that allows Congress to kill recently adopted regulations with a simple majority vote. Before the 2016 elections, the 21-year-old act had been used only once, in 2001. Since November, Congress and Trump have employed it 14 times to kill Obama-era initiatives.</p><p>\"The last administration was very aggressive with regulations,\" said Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who voted to eliminate the privacy rules. \"We are looking for the quickest ways to do something about it.\"</p><p>By January, trade groups for tech companies such as Facebook and Google had joined the fight to undo the privacy rules, according to records and interviews. Those companies are regulated by a different government body, the Federal Trade Commission, but they worried that Congress might someday find a way to expand the reach of the rules so that they apply to all technology companies.</p><p>Trade groups for large advertisers also got involved in the effort to repeal the law, as did the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Consumer and civil rights groups were quickly outnumbered by their opponents, by a ratio of at least 50 to 1, according to Hill staff and lobbyists.</p><p>\"This collaboration between Silicon Valley and cable companies has never been done before,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president and chief executive of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit group that advocates for an open Internet and affordable technology. \"Their united, massive economic and political power was insurmountable.\"</p><p>During the battle, Flake and Blackburn received large campaign donations from eight of the major Internet providers and big tech companies that wanted to see the rules killed, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>The groups gave Flake $22,700 in donations, compared with an average $4,510 they gave other senators between January and April. The groups gave Blackburn $20,500, compared with the $2,045 average donated to other House members in the same time. That is about three times the amount of money Flake and Blackburn received from those groups during the first quarter of last year.</p><p>Groups that worked to preserve the FCC rules donated no money to lawmakers during the first quarter of this year, according to the analysis.</p><p>By February, neither the House nor the Senate had introduced a bill. It appeared to some that the issue may have stalled - which caused several consumer and civil rights groups such as the Color of Change to let down their guard.</p><p>\"We didn't think they would have the audacity to go after privacy. . . . We dismissed the low rumblings,\" said Brandi Collins, a senior campaign director at Color of Change, who said data-directed advertising often targets minorities.</p><p>By the end of February, the trade groups for large Internet providers, the advertising industry and tech companies were working in tandem with congressional members who had taken up their cause. Howard Waltzman, a lawyer and lobbyist for the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, said this was \"the pivotal moment.\"</p><p>An opinion piece under Flake's byline appeared in the Wall Street Journal on March 1, saying the rules took away \"consumer choice\" because people's browsing histories could not be used to offer them \"innovative and cost-saving product offerings.\" The column said the rules would \"create confusion\" among customers because the FCC and FTC would regulate different parts of the \"Internet ecosystem.\" The same arguments and similar phrasing were used in a letter the industry coalition sent to Congress.</p><p>Hours after Flake's opinion piece appeared in the Journal, he introduced a Senate bill to kill the rules. A week later, Blackburn did the same in the House.</p><p>For weeks, neither Flake nor Blackburn scheduled a vote because members feared a potential backlash from voters, according to lobbyists and several Hill staff members.</p><p>\"There was a bit of chicken played between the House and Senate,\" said Dallas Harris, another lobbyist for Public Knowledge.</p><p>Finally, Flake scheduled the vote for March 22. It was not until then that the campaign against it took off.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union, Free Press and other groups delivered a petition with 100,000 signatures to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other congressional leaders hours before the Senate began its debate on the bill.</p><p>When Senate Republicans passed the bill the following day on a narrow party-line vote, the issue finally exploded across the Internet and in mainstream, liberal and conservative media.</p><p>NBC, CNN, FOX and MSNBC carried stories about the vote. And conservative online platforms - such as Breitbart News and Reddit sites devoted to Trump - were packed with posts from Trump supporters who were angry about the bill.</p><p>More than 20,000 calls flooded House members' office phone lines, and more than a dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus - a congressional group of conservative and libertarian Republicans - told Blackburn they probably would not vote for the bill, several Hill staff told The Washington Post.</p><p>Waltzman said the fight intensified: \"Suddenly, we were dealing with flat-out lies. Members were saying, 'These companies can see literally everything you do online.' That is simply not true.\"</p><p>Fearing more House Republicans could defect, Hill staff said, McConnell and other Republican leaders asked the Trump administration to issue a statement signaling that he would sign the bill. The White House staff did so.</p><p>Within hours, Blackburn introduced the bill on the House floor and called for a vote.</p><p>Rep. Michael E. Capuano (D-Mass.) took to the floor, screaming: \"What are you thinking? . . . Just last week I bought underwear on the Internet. Why should you know what size I take? Or the color?

Continue reading How Congress missed another chance to hold big tech accountable</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From time to time the entire technology press corps gets together on Twitter, spends several hours live-tweeting the same event, and then writes a series of blog posts about how nothing important happened. This event is known as a Congressional hearing, and today we witnessed our final one of the year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After months of polite deferrals, Sundar Pichai finally went before Congress on Tuesday, and over the course of three and a half hours, said as little as possible. The hearing before the House Judiciary Committee was defined, as had been the Facebook hearings before it, by the widespread befuddlement of our lawmakers.</p><p>There was, for example, the question from Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) about why a picture of Donald Trump comes up when you Google  idiot.  Adi Robertson has the correct answer, for the record:</p><p>News outlets reported on the Trump  idiot  results earlier this year. If you search the term now, in fact, you ll mostly get pictures from stories explaining why it happened. It appeared to be the result of outside parties gaming Google s search results, a well-known tactic known as  Google bombing. </p><p>Trump isn t the first president to get Google-bombed: in the mid-2000s, searches for  miserable failure  famously returned results about President George W. Bush. It can be a politicized (or just funny) extension of normal search engine optimization tactics. In this case, it s convincing Google that a Trump picture is what most people want when they search for  idiot,  by upvoting or linking to posts with that combination of words and images.</p><p>Then there was the moment that Rep. Steve King (R-IA) asked Pichai   the CEO, we repeat, of Google   to explain why his daughter s iPhone was behaving strangely:</p><p> I have a seven-year-old granddaughter who picked up her phone during the election, and she s playing a little game, the kind of game a kid would play,  King told Pichai.  And up on there pops a picture of her grandfather. And I m not going to say into the record what kind of language was used around that picture of her grandfather, but I d ask you: how does that show up on a seven-year-old s iPhone, who s playing a kid s game? </p><p>Adi Robertson took a crack at that one, too:</p><p>It s not clear what King was referring to, but it s possible his granddaughter s iPhone (or possibly Android phone) was displaying a notification card about a news story. The language around his photo may forever remain a mystery, but during campaign season, there was no shortage of writers with strong feelings about King s numerous racist and anti-immigrant statements, or his endorsement of a Canadian white nationalist mayoral candidate. In any case, during the hearing, King also suggested that Congress should check Google employees  social media profiles to monitor their political leanings   so some confusing troubleshooting requests were probably the least of Pichai s worries.</p><p>But before we write off Congress entirely, it s worth noting that they did attempt to get to the bottom of the Project Dragonfly situation. Is Google building a censored search engine for China   the subject of much internal dissent   or is it not? Here s Ryan Gallagher in The Intercept.</p><p>Pichai repeatedly insisted that Dragonfly was an  internal effort  and the Google currently had  no plans to launch a search service in China.  Asked to confirm that the company would not launch  a tool for surveillance and censorship in China,  Pichai declined to answer, instead saying that he was committed to  providing users with information, and so we always   we think it s ideal to explore possibilities. ... We ll be very thoughtful, and we will engage widely as we make progress. </p><p>Pichai s claim that the company does not have a plan to launch the search engine in China contradicted a leaked transcript from a private meeting inside the company. In the transcript, the company s search chief Ben Gomes discussed an aim to roll out the service between January and April 2019. For Pichai s statement to Congress to be truthful, there is only one possibility: that the company has put the brakes on Dragonfly since The Intercept first exposed the project in August.</p><p>Despite lawmakers  efforts to follow up, they didn t break much new ground. (Though in a follow-up interview with the Washington Post, Pichai seemed to suggest Project Dragonfly might wind up being something other than search:  Can we explore and serve users in China, in areas like education and healthcare?  he said.  We may not end up doing search. We re trying to understand a market. )</p><p>Why did reporters have better luck with Pichai today than Congress did? Shira Ovide, reading my mind, lays the blame with the bizarre structure of these hearings, which gives maximum opportunity for witnesses to wriggle out of questioning:</p><p>Pichai repeatedly fell back to saying that this China project is  exploratory  and that Google will be transparent if it moves ahead. That s not a good enough answer. He needs to say how many employees are working on this project, what Google s criteria are for returning web search to China and whether Google will build tools that will enable the Chinese government to surveil its own citizens without their knowledge.</p><p>To be clear, I don t want to repeat the false idea that members of Congress are old luddites who aren t able or willing to understand how tech companies work. Some members of Congress asked great questions on Tuesday. Some of them did not. This format, however, does not feel like a good way to decide public policy. 1 The thorny topic of the power of big technology companies deserves much better than this from all sides.</p><p>What would help? Lawmakers demonstrating basic platform literacy; anticipating the non-answers that tech CEOs have prepared for them; scripting more penetrating follow-up questions; coordinating avenues of attack with their fellow representatives. Lawmakers might also try to debate their proposed solutions with CEO   bringing real policy questions to the table, instead of simple gotcha-oriented soundbites.</p><p>For their part, tech CEOs could do better answering the spirit of lawmakers  questions, even when those lawmakers get the details wrong. It s usually apparent what a lawmaker is concerned about, even if it s not entirely clear how they have been led to their often bizarre and conspiratorial conclusions. Pichai, for example, could have spent more time talking about why Google has a strong financial incentive to keep search results free of political bias, rather than simply asserting, over and over again, that it does so.</p><p>Maybe next year.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Democracy</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Russia fines Google for not complying with search results law: TASS</emphasis></p><p>Russia has issued what may be the smallest fine ever issued against Google, Reuters reported:</p><p>Russia fined Google 500,000 roubles ($7,530) on Tuesday for failing to comply with a legal requirement to remove certain entries from its search results, Russia s communications watchdog was quoted as saying by TASS news agency.</p><p>Russia said last month that it had opened a civil case against Google as it had not joined a state registry that lists banned websites that Moscow believes contain illegal information and was therefore not compliant with the law.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Leaked Audio Reveals Google s Efforts to Woo Conservatives</emphasis></p><p>Nitasha Tiku gets a hold of leaked audio from March in which Googlers describe their efforts to win over conservatives:</p><p>In February, The New York Times Magazine published a cover story urging regulators to break up Google because the company abuses its dominance in search to crush promising competitors. The next day, representatives from two conservative think tanks published blog posts defending Google and attacking the article s call for antitrust enforcement. Both think tanks have received funding from Google. Both blog posts referenced studies by a professor who has received fundingfrom Google. In one post, the study referenced was published in a quarterly journalowned by third think tank, which has also received funding from Google.</p><p>In a company-wide meeting a couple of weeks later, on March 1, Google s public policy team described the blog posts as the fruit of Google s efforts to build deeper relationships with conservatives, according to an audio recording of the meeting reviewed by WIRED. The recording of a contentious hour-long meeting offers a window into how Google thinks about its relationships in Washington, DC, its sensitivity to claims of political bias, and how executives explain to employees actions that some view as at odds with Google s values.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Political tweets,  infowars  and a Russia: how a fake news row went mainstream</emphasis></p><p>Was a row about an anti-disinformation think tank part of a Russian influence campaign? Labour and the Foreign Office disagree</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LinkedIn co-founder backs $35 million voter data project in  existential threat  to Democratic Party</emphasis></p><p>LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman plans to spend $35 million a definitive voter database for Democrats, raising the possibility that some good will have come from building LinkedIn:</p><p>With tens of millions of dollars at their disposal, the people behind Hoffman-backed project could eventually create their own voter file, making the Democratic Party s file less valuable. That process, however, would likely take several years and would be nearly impossible to complete by the 2020 election.</p><p>As a result, DNC officials say the committee is open to collaborating with Hoffman, or perhaps joining forces with him.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elsewhere</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hateful conspiracies thrive on YouTube, despite pledge to clean up  problematic  videos</emphasis></p><p>Craig Timberg, Elizabeth Dwoskin, Tony Romm, and Andrew Ba Tran have a fresh entry in the genre of content that involves searching YouTube for terrible things and then writing about what you find:</p><p>YouTube is particularly valuable to users of Gab.ai and 4chan, social media sites that are popular among hate groups but have scant video capacity of their own. Users on these sites link to YouTube more than to any other website, thousands of times a day, according to the recent work of Data and Society and the Network Contagion Research Institute, both of which track the spread of hate speech.</p><p>The platform routinely serves videos espousing neo-Nazi propaganda, phony reports portraying dark-skinned people as violent savages and conspiracy theories claiming that large numbers of leading politicians and celebrities molested children. Critics say that even though YouTube removes millions of videos on average each month, it is slow to identify troubling content and, when it does, is too permissive in what it allows to remain.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PewDiePie gives shout out to hateful, anti-Semitic YouTube channel</emphasis></p><p>YouTube s most popular creator, the man known as PewDiePie, has a history of bad behavior. Most recently he promoted a channel known for its hateful content, Julia Alexander reports:</p><p>E;R s videos are disturbing. They often use the guise of film, anime, or cartoon criticism to convey anti-Semitic and hateful thoughts or imagery. This is particularly disturbing when linked to Kjellberg, who dealt with his own controversy after showing men holding up a sign reading  Death to All Jews  in 2017.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook is hiring engineers and researchers for its blockchain team</emphasis></p><p>Does the current bear market in cryptocurrency make it easier or harder for Facebook to hire for its blockchain team? Please reply if you know!</p><p>Facebook wants to add a data scientist, a data engineer, and a couple of software engineers to its growing blockchain team, according to its careers page (viaSludgeFeed).</p><p> The blockchain team is a startup within Facebook, with a vision to make blockchain technology work at Facebook scale,  the ads say.  It s a small, fast-growing, but talented group of people who are passionate about changing the world.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Social media outpaces print newspapers in the U.S. as news source</emphasis></p><p>One in five Americans say they get their news via social media  often,  according to new Pew data, slightly higher than the 16 percent who say they often get their news from newspapers. Elisa Shearer:</p><p>Overall, television is still the most popular platform for news consumption   even though its use has declined since 2016. News websites are the next most common source, followed by radio, and finally social media sites and print newspapers. And when looking at online news use combined   the percentage of Americans who get news often from either news websites or social media   the web has closed in on television as a source for news (43% of adults get news often from news websites or social media, compared with 49% for television).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Launches</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook opening Bryant Park pop-up to teach users about privacy</emphasis></p><p>Part of me wants to fly to New York just to experience the surreal majesty of the Facebook privacy pop-up kiosk in person. It will take place on Thursday in midtown, Nicolas Vega reports:</p><p> It s been a tough year, and people have a lot of questions,  Khaliah Barnes, a privacy and public policy manager at Facebook, told The Post.  We wanted to have the opportunity to connect with people face to face. </p><p>Visitors to the kiosk, to be located next to Bryant Park s Holiday Market, will be able to stop by without an appointment, speak with Facebook employees and drink free hot chocolate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook relaunches search ads to offset slowing revenue</emphasis></p><p>Facebook is bringing back search ads, Josh Constine reports:</p><p>The reintroduction of search ads could open an important new revenue stream at a time when Facebook s revenue growth is quickly decelerating as it runs out of News Feed ad space, the Stories format that advertisers are still adapting is poised to overtake feed sharing on social apps and users shift their time elsewhere. In Q3 2018, revenue grew 33 percent year-over-year, but that s far slower than the 49 percent YOY gain it had a year ago, and the 59 percent from Q3 2016. Opening up new ad inventory for search could reinvigorate the sagging revenue growth rate that, combined with Facebook s privacy and security scandals, has put intense pressure on Facebook s leaders Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Instagram is testing Creator Accounts for high-profile influencers</emphasis></p><p>Instagram is launching  Creator Accounts  to give high-profile users additional controls and analytics.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Takes</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delete All Your Apps</emphasis></p><p>In the aftermath of the New York Times  story on how app developers use and abuse location-history data, Jason Koebler suggests it s time to delete all of our apps. Bold!</p><p>This problem is getting worse, not better: Facebook made WhatsApp, an app that managed to be profitable with a $1 per year subscription fee, into a  free  service because it believed it could make more money <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">with an advertising-based business model</emphasis>.</p><p>What this means is that the dominant business model on our smartphones is one that s predicated on monetizing you, and only through paying obsessive attention to your app permissions and seeking paid alternatives can you hope to minimize these impacts on yourself. If this bothers you, your only options are to get rid of your smartphone altogether or to rethink what apps you want installed on your phone and act accordingly.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook Has Better Uses for Its Cash Than Stock Buybacks</emphasis></p><p>Shira Ovide wishes Facebook wasn t planning to spend $9 billion buying up its own stock:</p><p>If I were making a short list, I would put on it hiring more moderators to do the terrible, laborious work of actively sniffing out hoaxes, election-related tamperingand calls to violence on Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and other Facebook-owned hangouts. It might not hurt to increase investment on cybersecurity to do more to prevent foreign governments from using Facebook as a tool for propaganda or to prevent thieves from taking advantage of Facebook software loopholes to compromise accounts of tens of millions of people. Facebook could spend even more on policy wonks to shape and prepare for more heavy-handed regulation of tech companies. I could go on.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And finally  </emphasis></h><p>Twitter is often the story of a company that can t stop hitting itself, and in the wake of Jack Dorsey s recent public lashing over his Burmese meditation retreat, the CEO has decided to land a few more self-inflicted blows.</p><p>jack</p><p>@jack \u00b7 Dec 9, 2018 Replying to @jack</p><p>Thanks for reading!

Nearly all were based overseas, had financial motives and displayed a clear rightward bent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a world of perfect neutrality, which Facebook espouses as its goal, the political tilt of the pages shouldn't have mattered. But in a videoconference between Facebook's Washington office and its Silicon Valley headquarters in December 2016, the company's most senior Republican, Joel Kaplan, voiced concerns that would become familiar to those within the company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We can't remove all of it because it will disproportionately affect conservatives,\" said Kaplan, a former George W. Bush White House official and now the head of Facebook's Washington office, according to people familiar with the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect professional relationships.</p><p>When another Facebook staff member pushed for the entire list to be taken down on the grounds that the accounts fueled the \"fake news\" that had roiled the election, Kaplan warned of the backlash from conservatives.</p><p>\"They don't believe it to be fake news,\" he said, arguing for time to develop guidelines that could be defended to the company's critics, including on the right.</p><p>The debate over \"Project P,\" which resulted in a few of the worst pages quickly being removed while most others remained on the platform, exemplified the political dynamics that have reigned within Facebook since Trump emerged as the Republican Party's presumptive nominee to the White House in 2016. A company led mainly by Democrats in the liberal bastion of Northern California repeatedly has tilted rightward to deliver policies, hiring decisions and public gestures sought by Republicans, according to current and former employees and others who have worked closely with the company.</p><p>Trump and other party leaders have pressured Facebook by making unproven claims of bias against conservatives amid rising signs of government action on the issue, including investigations by Congress and the Justice Department. Republicans also have leveraged Facebook's fears of alienating conservative Americans to win concessions from a company whose most widely shared news content typically includes stories from Fox News and other right-leaning sources.</p><p>These sensitivities - in conjunction with the company's long-standing resistance to acting as \"an arbiter of truth\" - have affected Facebook's responses to a range of major issues, from how to address fake news and Russian manipulation of American voters on the platform to, more recently, the advertising policies that have set the political ground rules for the 2020 election, say people privy to internal debates.</p><p>Such factors have helped shape a platform that gives politicians license to lie and that remains awash in misinformation, vulnerable to a repeat of many of the problems that marred the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Facebook, unlike Google and Twitter, also has refused calls to restrict politicians' access to powerful ad-targeting tools - which Trump used with particular relish four years ago - that allow messages to be tailored to individual voters, based on characteristics Facebook has gleaned over years of tracking user behavior.</p><p>\"I think Facebook is looking at their political advertising policies in explicitly partisan terms, and they're afraid of angering Republicans,\" said Alex Stamos, head of the Stanford Internet Observatory, a research group, and a former Facebook chief security officer. \"The Republicans in the D.C. office see themselves as a bulwark against the liberals in California.\" </p><p>The company says its decisions are guided not by political calculations but by global policy goals of expanding connections among users and protecting them from government overreach, in line with chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's commitment to allowing speech on the social media platform to remain as unrestricted as possible.</p><p>\"After 2016, we made massive investments in new teams and technology to make our products safer and to secure elections,\" said company spokesman Andy Stone. \"People on both sides of the aisle continue to criticize us, but we remain committed to seeking outside perspectives and building a platform for all ideas.\" </p><p>Kaplan declined to comment for this article.</p><p>But critics - both outside Facebook and within its ranks - see something more akin to corporate realpolitik, a willingness to accede to political demands in an era when Republicans control most levers of power in Washington.</p><p>\"Facebook does not speak Republican,\" said a former employee of Facebook's Integrity Team, which was created to ensure safety and trust on the platform, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about a former employer. \"This is what they know about Republicans: Tell them 'yes' or they will hurt us.\" </p><p>In the 16 years since its birth as a website to connect students at Harvard, Facebook has emerged as perhaps the world's most far-reaching source of news and information, especially since it added the potent subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, creating a stable of globe-spanning communication tools with billions of users. Facebook's technology played a role in fomenting democratic revolutions across the Arab world and helping to rally domestic political movements such as Black Lives Matter. But the platform also was used to help fuel a genocide in Myanmar, a U.N. report concluded, and has been used to live-stream violence, including video of a massacre at a New Zealand mosque.</p><p>Facebook's power is coveted by American politicians, who know that the vast majority of U.S. voters have accounts. Trump already has spent more than $32 million on the platform for his reelection effort, while Democratic candidates, collectively, have spent more than $107 million, according to Facebook's Ad Library, one of its transparency initiatives. Andrew Bosworth, a top corporate executive considered a confidant of Zuckerberg, said in a post in December that Facebook was \"responsible for Donald Trump getting elected\" in 2016 through his effective advertising campaign - a comment that underscored the stakes of the company's policy moves.</p><p>Facebook's quest to quell conservative criticism has infused a range of decisions in recent years, say people familiar with the company's internal debates. These included whether to allow graphic images of premature babies on feeding tubes - a prohibition that had rankled antiabortion groups - or to include the sharply conservative Breitbart News in a list of news sources despite its history of serving, in the words of its former executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon, as the \"platform for the alt-right.\" </p><p>Breitbart spokeswoman Elizabeth Moore, citing the popularity of the news site and what she called a strong track record of accuracy, said, \"It would be an insane oversight to disenfranchise our massive audience that uses Facebook and craves our news content.\" </p><p>But its inclusion has sparked criticism among those who say the move was mainly to address Republican complaints about the company.</p><p>\"I don't think they do this as a conservative company. I think they do this as a scared company,\" said Jeff Jarvis, a journalism professor at the City University of New York who has worked with Facebook on several media projects.</p><p>The price has been high in terms of anger from Democrats, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who has promised to lead efforts to break up Facebook should she win the presidency. Liberal financier George Soros, writing recently in the New York Times, called for stripping control of Facebook from Zuckerberg and accused the company of having \"an informal mutual assistance operation\" with Trump.</p><p>Yet by at least one metric, Facebook's moves have succeeded - in appeasing a disruptive, unpredictable president. Just last month in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said of Zuckerberg on CNBC, \"He's done a hell of a job.\"</p><p>Soon after Facebook's meeting on Project P, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski came to Facebook's Washington headquarters offering to advise the company on how to handle the new White House, according to people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive internal matters.</p><p>The shifting power in Washington was a serious issue for the company. Its employees had donated just $5,171 to Trump, compared with $1.1 million to fundraising committees affiliated with Democrat Hillary Clinton, with nearly half that amount coming from two of Zuckerberg's closest confidantes, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and then-chief product officer Chris Cox, according to the political analytics  firm GovPredict.</p><p>But the meeting with Lewandowski sparked outrage within an office still reeling from the election. Particularly upset were several Democrats, including director of U.S. public policy, Catlin O'Neill, a former chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the granddaughter of a legendary Pelosi predecessor, Thomas P. \"Tip\" O'Neill (D-Mass.), said people familiar with the visit and its aftermath.</p><p>Facebook decided not to retain Lewandowski, who declined to comment on the details of the visit aside from saying by text, \"Please be sure to include the facts that I have never worked for them or been paid by them - they solicited me for a meeting and I attended.\" </p><p>But the encounter left many within the company uneasy about what Trump and his allies might do - or perhaps worse, what he might tweet.</p><p>The company gradually implemented policies to combat false, misleading news reports through new transparency initiatives and a system of third-party fact-checkers, a move that upset some Republicans. It also adopted its first policy against \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" - essentially using bots, fake accounts or other amplification tactics to manipulate the platform, as Russians and others had in 2016 - and bolstered its security team to police violations.</p><p>Complaints eventually grew, however, that conservatives were being unfairly targeted by these moves and by long-standing content policies, such as the prohibition against hate speech. Moves to ban conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and right-wing media stars Milo Yiannopoulos in 2019 for being \"dangerous,\" for example, generated allegations of censorship by \"Big Tech\" among more mainstream conservatives.</p><p>As these and other complaints against Facebook grew among Republicans, Trump often amplified them over rival social media platform Twitter, where his following tops 72 million users.</p><p>\"Facebook was always anti-Trump,\" he tweeted on Sept. 27, 2017, amid the scandal over Russian efforts to use social media to help elect him. The following month, he added, \"Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side, not mine!\"</p><p>Trump leveled similar charges against other technology companies, as he did in December 2018: \"Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous!\" But often Facebook bore the brunt of the president's wrath, as it did after a pair of pro-Trump social media personalities, \"Diamond and Silk,\" accused the company of censoring them after they received a warning about posting \"unsafe\" content. (The company later said it had acted in error.)</p><p>\"The wonderful Diamond and Silk have been treated so horribly by Facebook. They work so hard and what has been done to them is very sad - and we're looking into\" it, Trump tweeted in May 2019. \"It's getting worse and worse for Conservatives on social media!\"</p><p>The role of helping the company maneuver through this treacherous new political landscape became a core responsibility for Kaplan, Facebook's vice president for global public policy, who had joined the company in 2011, after eight years in the Bush White House and a stint as an energy lobbyist.</p><p>The former Marine Corps officer had clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and, despite supporting former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) for president, met with Trump in December 2016 after the White House expressed interest in having him head the Office of Management and Budget. Kaplan later played a key role in organizing support for Trump Supreme Court pick Brett M. Kavanaugh, a longtime Kaplan friend.</p><p>As Trump came to office, Kaplan was a Republican in a company increasingly self-conscious about its oversupply of Democrats in its top ranks. This included Sandberg, who had worked in the Clinton administration and hired numerous friends and former colleagues into Facebook - creating a class of internal allies known informally as \"FOSS,\" for Friends of Sheryl Sandberg.</p><p>Kaplan, who had dated Sandberg when they were students at Harvard, managed to be both a FOSS and one of the only Republicans in the room when major decisions got made. The combination lent him credibility when he warned, as he often did, that a looming decision might inflame perilous relations with conservatives.</p><p>The rising clout among Facebook's Republicans went beyond Kaplan. Katie Harbath, a onetime campaign aide to former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, gained increased prominence. Kaplan also dispensed with the tradition of having members of both major parties share power atop the Washington office by hiring a fellow Republican, former Federal Communications Commission chairman Kevin Martin, as his deputy - strengthening the conservative cast of the office at its highest levels.</p><p>Kaplan proved to be adept at assuaging conservative concerns about Facebook. Even before Trump won the presidency, the company faced a crisis in May 2016 when tech publication Gizmodo published a story claiming that contractors managing Facebook's \"Trending\" module were suppressing conservative stories.</p><p>Kaplan tapped a small team of Republicans, including Harbath, to organize a visit for prominent conservatives, such as political commentators Glenn Beck and Tucker Carlson, to Facebook headquarters. The meeting with Zuckerberg and Sandberg calmed the controversy - at least for a time - but conservatives soon would come back with other complaints.</p><p>\"It's the squeaky wheels who get the grease,\" said another person familiar with the company's effort to mollify conservatives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"They were the squeaky wheels.\"</p><p>As for the \"Trending\" topics feature, Facebook fired the contractors described in the Gizmodo story and gave the job for determining \"Trending\" topics to an algorithm. That allowed the feature to become a vehicle for spreading the false news reports that marred Facebook in the months leading up to the election. One recommended story claimed - falsely - that Fox News host Megyn Kelly had been fired for supporting Clinton.</p><p>Security researchers at Facebook found the first signs that Russians were seeking to influence the U.S. election months before the 2016 vote, discovering accounts apparently under control of foreign military hackers.</p><p>Those initial discoveries, although shared with the FBI, were not made public. But when U.S. intelligence officials announced in January 2017 that they, too, had detected Russian interference on social media, an internal debate developed within Facebook about what to reveal publicly and when.</p><p>The result, after three months of wrangling, was a 13-page white paper in April that did not include the words \"Russia\" or \"Russian.\" Instead, there was this oblique reference: \"Our data does not contradict the attribution provided by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence in the report dated January 6, 2017.\"</p><p>Several issues were at play in these debates, including whether Facebook's researchers had enough clear evidence to name Russia definitively, and company officials pushed to make sure the white paper was rigorous enough to be defended in the face of the expected Republican backlash. But some company employees found the resulting document incomplete, and the caution of company officials fueled complaints that they were acting in part to avoid inflaming tensions with a White House consumed with battling allegations that Russia had helped elect Trump.</p><p>\"If we say Russia, it will center us in this discussion and anger the administration,\" a person familiar with the political dynamics in Facebook's Washington office recalled hearing.</p><p>Stone, the Facebook spokesman, said, \"The goal of the white paper was to share our findings in a straightforward manner, which is why there was broad agreement with the security team's recommendation to refer to the Intelligence Community Assessment and not name any specific nations.\"</p><p>The worry about political fallout grew in subsequent months as Facebook's security researchers discovered the Internet Research Agency, whose owner was a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had used 470 fake accounts and pages to manipulate U.S. voters. When Facebook revealed this Russian interference in September 2017, the fears of angering the White House proved prescient.</p><p>Trump soon began tweeting about the company, and conservatives in Congress used the resulting hearings to accuse Facebook of bias against conservative voices on the platform. Such complaints grew the following year, when the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke regarding the use of sensitive Facebook data to direct campaign messaging.</p><p>Zuckerberg's visit to Capitol Hill in April 2018 to address the Cambridge Analytica scandal featured frequent allegations of bias. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) cited Facebook's warning to Diamond and Silk as exemplifying \"a pervasive pattern of political bias.\" In a House hearing the next day, Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) asked Zuckerberg, \"What is 'unsafe' about two black women supporting Donald J. Trump?\"</p><p>While Zuckerberg attributed the incident to \"an enforcement error,\" the next month the company announced it would conduct an audit of allegations of bias against conservatives at Facebook. Leading this inquiry was not an independent social media researcher but a prominent conservative lawyer, former senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.).</p><p>The resulting interim report, completed in August, catalogued numerous complaints by conservatives but offered no concrete evidence of bias or any systematic, data-based review of the question. Still, it offered two concessions: Facebook would hire more staff \"dedicated to working with right-of-center organizations and leaders.\" And the company would loosen a long-standing advertising policy against graphic medical photos; the result was to allow antiabortion groups to depict premature babies reliant on feeding and other medical tubes in political messaging.</p><p>The audit and its concessions pleased many conservatives but rankled some on the other side of the political spectrum, who had begun to sense that, in their dealings with Facebook, they were on a losing streak to an organized, forceful and consistent campaign of pressure by conservatives. Civil rights leaders, for example, had been asking for an audit of racism on the platform for several years. It finally got announced the same day, in May 2018, as the conservative bias audit.</p><p>\"We've been in conversation with them, in some iteration, for four years, without much success,\" said Malkia Devich Cyril, a senior fellow for the activist group MediaJustice who was part of a Black Lives Matter delegation that visited Facebook in 2016. \"As individuals they might have liberal or progressive leanings, but as a company their interests are being served by conservative economic policy.\" </p><p>The political stakes for Facebook became increasingly clear last summer. A major corporate initiative, a cryptocurrency called Libra, landed in Washington with a discernible thud.</p><p>\"Facebook Libra's 'virtual currency' will have little standing or dependability,\" Trump tweeted in July, making clear his intention to impose federal regulations on such an initiative. \"We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!\"</p><p>About the same time, the Justice Department began a broad antitrust review of major technology companies, including Facebook.</p><p>Zuckerberg - who had lashed out at Warren over her calls to break up Facebook, telling employees in a July meeting that he would \"go to the mat and ... fight\" any such effort - took a more conciliatory tone with Trump.</p><p>As talk of federal investigations grew in September, Zuckerberg visited the White House. Trump tweeted, \"Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of @Facebook in the Oval Office today.\" Included was a picture of the young tech billionaire shaking hands with the president.</p><p>Zuckerberg also hosted a group of conservatives at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., in June. One participant, longtime anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, praised the company for hiring staff specifically to work with conservatives.</p><p>\"There has been what seems to be a serious effort to reach out to us,\" said Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.</p><p>Two important victories for Trump and conservatives came amid this outreach by Zuckerberg.</p><p>The first was when Nick Clegg,Facebook's vice president for global affairs and communications, announced in September that the company's system of third-party fact-checkers would not review claims by politicians. Although Facebook said this was merely the ratification of existing practice, the announcement provoked fury among Democrats weary from thousands of well-chronicled falsehoods, embellishments and misstatements by Trump and worried that he would exploit the loophole in the coming campaign season.</p><p>An immediate test further underscored these fears: A Trump campaign ad made claims against former vice president Joe Biden, at the time leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, that independent fact-checkers called dubious. Biden's campaign demanded the ad be removed, but Facebook refused, reiterating it would not act against false statements from politicians.</p><p>Those defending the decision, inside and outside the company, pointed to the traditional leeway given to political speech in the United States and to Zuckerberg's own reluctance to curb user expression in all but the most extreme circumstances.</p><p>He said in a speech at Georgetown University in October that restricting political speech threatens \"the ability to speak freely [that] has been central in the fight for democracy worldwide.\"</p><p>But critics saw yet another effort by Facebook to steer clear of Republican wrath.</p><p>\"Right now Trump is president, and the company is obviously very attuned to the political winds,\" said Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a Washington-based umbrella group. \"They all know [at Facebook] that the Justice Department and state attorneys general are sniffing around at regulations and litigation.\" </p><p>The second victory for conservatives came soon after, when Facebook rebuffed calls to limit the ability of politicians to use advertising tools that allow the narrow targeting of individuals based on their home address, gender, education level, income, marital status, job or other characteristics. Brad Parscale, a digital adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign and now campaign manager for the reelection effort, had boasted of the power of these targeting tools and made clear his eagerness to use them again.</p><p>Some Democratic political operatives and the Democratic National Committee also expressed concern to Facebook about losing access to such cheap, effective means for reaching voters. But other prominent Democrats, as well as politically independent technology researchers, warned that what they called \"microtargeting\" could threaten the sanctity of elections by undermining the accountability and transparency of political speech.</p><p>These critics warned that voters had no way to know what messages reached their friends or neighbors, giving politicians license to tailor messages based on what people wanted to hear rather than what was best for the public overall. A lie delivered to just 100 carefully targeted people on Facebook, for example, was much less likely to be caught and corrected than one delivered on a billboard or in a television ad.</p><p>Ellen L. Weintraub, a Democrat who then was chair of the Federal Election Commission, warned in a Washington Post opinion piece that such targeting had a history as \"a potent weapon for spreading disinformation and sowing discord.\"</p><p>For these reasons, Google prohibited politicians from using its most powerful targeting tools. Twitter decided to ban political ads altogether. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) urged Facebook to follow the lead of these other companies \"rather than continuing to chase political advertising dollars.\"</p><p>Facebook seriously considered such a move during a months-long internal debate that weighed several types of restrictions, including possibly banning political ads altogether, company officials said, pointing out that such advertising produces a very small percentage of its multibillion-dollar revenue streams while generating a disproportionate amount of headaches.</p><p>But when news leaked that Facebook was considering such changes, Trump made clear his opposition. His campaign tweeted, amid red siren emoji, \"IMPORTANT @facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020. Tools that help us reach more great Americans &amp; lift voices the media &amp; big tech choose to ignore!\"</p><p>Facebook ultimately announced in January that it would increase the transparency of ad targeting ahead of the 2020 election but impose no new limits for politicians.</p><p>In a blog post, Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management, made clear that the company had heard the political clamor on the issue.</p><p>\"Unlike Google, we have chosen not to limit targeting of these ads,\" Leathern wrote. \"We considered doing so, but through extensive outreach and consultations we heard about the importance of these tools for reaching key audiences from a wide range of NGOs, non-profits, political groups and campaigns, including both Republican and Democratic committees in the US.\"</p><p>             Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-626f388200af429c847c683ed63d232f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y81-2511-JB4M-V06H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4390\"/><timeReceived>6:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Nearly all were based overseas, had financial motives and displayed a clear rightward bent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a world of perfect neutrality, which Facebook espouses as its goal, the political tilt of the pages shouldn't have mattered. But in a videoconference between Facebook's Washington office and its Silicon Valley headquarters in December 2016, the company's most senior Republican, Joel Kaplan, voiced concerns that would become familiar to those within the company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'We can't remove all of it because it will disproportionately affect conservatives,' said Kaplan, a former George W. Bush White House official and now the head of Facebook's Washington office, according to people familiar with the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect professional relationships.</p><p>When another Facebook staff member pushed for the entire list to be taken down on the grounds that the accounts fueled the 'fake news' that had roiled the election, Kaplan warned of the backlash from conservatives.</p><p>'They don't believe it to be fake news,' he said, arguing for time to develop guidelines that could be defended to the company's critics, including on the right.</p><p>The debate over 'Project P,' which resulted in a few of the worst pages quickly being removed while most others remained on the platform, exemplified the political dynamics that have reigned within Facebook since Trump emerged as the Republican Party's presumptive nominee to the White House in 2016. A company led mainly by Democrats in the liberal bastion of Northern California repeatedly has tilted rightward to deliver policies, hiring decisions and public gestures sought by Republicans, according to current and former employees and others who have worked closely with the company.</p><p>Trump and other party leaders have pressured Facebook by making unproven claims of bias against conservatives amid rising signs of government action on the issue, including investigations by Congress and the Justice Department. Republicans also have leveraged Facebook's fears of alienating conservative Americans to win concessions from a company whose most widely shared news content typically includes stories from Fox News and other right-leaning sources.</p><p>These sensitivities \" in conjunction with the company's long-standing resistance to acting as 'an arbiter of truth' \" have affected Facebook's responses to a range of major issues, from how to address fake news and Russian manipulation of American voters on the platform to, more recently, the advertising policies that have set the political ground rules for the 2020 election, say people privy to internal debates.</p><p>Such factors have helped shape a platform that gives politicians license to lie and that remains awash in misinformation, vulnerable to a repeat of many of the problems that marred the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Facebook, unlike Google and Twitter, also has refused calls to restrict politicians' access to powerful ad-targeting tools \" which Trump used with particular relish four years ago \" that allow messages to be tailored to individual voters, based on characteristics Facebook has gleaned over years of tracking user behavior.</p><p>'I think Facebook is looking at their political advertising policies in explicitly partisan terms, and they're afraid of angering Republicans,' said Alex Stamos, head of the Stanford Internet Observatory, a research group, and a former Facebook chief security officer. 'The Republicans in the D.C. office see themselves as a bulwark against the liberals in California.' </p><p>The company says its decisions are guided not by political calculations but by global policy goals of expanding connections among users and protecting them from government overreach, in line with chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's commitment to allowing speech on the social media platform to remain as unrestricted as possible.</p><p>'After 2016, we made massive investments in new teams and technology to make our products safer and to secure elections,' said company spokesman Andy Stone. 'People on both sides of the aisle continue to criticize us, but we remain committed to seeking outside perspectives and building a platform for all ideas.' </p><p>Kaplan declined to comment for this article.</p><p>But critics \" both outside Facebook and within its ranks \" see something more akin to corporate realpolitik, a willingness to accede to political demands in an era when Republicans control most levers of power in Washington.</p><p>'Facebook does not speak Republican,' said a former employee of Facebook's Integrity Team, which was created to ensure safety and trust on the platform, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about a former employer. 'This is what they know about Republicans: Tell them 'yes' or they will hurt us.' </p><p>In the 16 years since its birth as a website to connect students at Harvard, Facebook has emerged as perhaps the world's most far-reaching source of news and information, especially since it added the potent subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, creating a stable of globe-spanning communication tools with billions of users. Facebook's technology played a role in fomenting democratic revolutions across the Arab world and helping to rally domestic political movements such as Black Lives Matter. But the platform also was used to help fuel a genocide in Myanmar, a U.N. report concluded, and has been used to live-stream violence, including video of a massacre at a New Zealand mosque.</p><p>Facebook's power is coveted by American politicians, who know that the vast majority of U.S. voters have accounts. Trump already has spent more than $32 million on the platform for his reelection effort, while Democratic candidates, collectively, have spent more than $107 million, according to Facebook's Ad Library, one of its transparency initiatives. Andrew Bosworth, a top corporate executive considered a confidant of Zuckerberg, said in a post in December that Facebook was 'responsible for Donald Trump getting elected' in 2016 through his effective advertising campaign \" a comment that underscored the stakes of the company's policy moves.</p><p>Facebook's quest to quell conservative criticism has infused a range of decisions in recent years, say people familiar with the company's internal debates. These included whether to allow graphic images of premature babies on feeding tubes \" a prohibition that had rankled antiabortion groups \" or to include the sharply conservative Breitbart News in a list of news sources despite its history of serving, in the words of its former executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon, as the 'platform for the alt-right.' </p><p>Breitbart spokeswoman Elizabeth Moore, citing the popularity of the news site and what she called a strong track record of accuracy, said, 'It would be an insane oversight to disenfranchise our massive audience that uses Facebook and craves our news content.' </p><p>But its inclusion has sparked criticism among those who say the move was mainly to address Republican complaints about the company.</p><p>'I don't think they do this as a conservative company. I think they do this as a scared company,' said Jeff Jarvis, a journalism professor at the City University of New York who has worked with Facebook on several media projects.</p><p>The price has been high in terms of anger from Democrats, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who has promised to lead efforts to break up Facebook should she win the presidency. Liberal financier George Soros, writing recently in the New York Times, called for stripping control of Facebook from Zuckerberg and accused the company of having 'an informal mutual assistance operation' with Trump.</p><p>Yet by at least one metric, Facebook's moves have succeeded \" in appeasing a disruptive, unpredictable president. Just last month in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said of Zuckerberg on CNBC, 'He's done a hell of a job.'</p><h>Power shift in Washington</h><p>Soon after Facebook's meeting on Project P, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski came to Facebook's Washington headquarters offering to advise the company on how to handle the new White House, according to people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive internal matters.</p><p>The shifting power in Washington was a serious issue for the company. Its employees had donated just $5,171 to Trump, compared with $1.1 million to fundraising committees affiliated with Democrat Hillary Clinton, with nearly half that amount coming from two of Zuckerberg's closest confidantes, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and then-Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, according to the political analytics  firm GovPredict.</p><p>But the meeting with Lewandowski sparked outrage within an office still reeling from the election. Particularly upset were several Democrats, including the director of U.S. public policy, Catlin O'Neill, a former chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the granddaughter of a legendary Pelosi predecessor, Thomas P. 'Tip' O'Neill (D-Mass.), said people familiar with the visit and its aftermath.</p><p>Facebook decided not to retain Lewandowski, who declined to comment on the details of the visit aside from saying by text, 'Please be sure to include the facts that I have never worked for them or been paid by them \" they solicited me for a meeting and I attended.' </p><p>But the encounter left many within the company uneasy about what Trump and his allies might do \" or perhaps worse, what he might tweet.</p><p>The company gradually implemented policies to combat false, misleading news reports through new transparency initiatives and a system of third-party fact-checkers, a move that upset some Republicans. It also adopted its first policy against 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' \" essentially using bots, fake accounts or other amplification tactics to manipulate the platform, as Russians and others had in 2016 \" and bolstered its security team to police violations.</p><p>Complaints eventually grew, however, that conservatives were being unfairly targeted by these moves and by long-standing content policies, such as the prohibition against hate speech. Moves to ban conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and right-wing media star Milo Yiannopoulos in 2019 for being 'dangerous,' for example, generated allegations of censorship by 'Big Tech' among more mainstream conservatives.</p><p>As these and other complaints against Facebook grew among Republicans, Trump often amplified them over rival social media platform Twitter, where his following tops 72 million users.</p><p>'Facebook was always anti-Trump,' he tweeted on Sept. 27, 2017, amid the scandal over Russian efforts to use social media to help elect him. The following month, he added, 'Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side, not mine!'</p><p>Trump leveled similar charges against other technology companies, as he did in December 2018: 'Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous!' But, often, Facebook bore the brunt of the president's wrath, as it did after a pair of pro-Trump social media personalities, Diamond and Silk, accused the company of censoring them after they received a warning about posting 'unsafe' content. (The company later said it had acted in error.)</p><p>'The wonderful Diamond and Silk have been treated so horribly by Facebook. They work so hard and what has been done to them is very sad -  and we're looking into' it, Trump tweeted in May 2019. 'It's getting worse and worse for Conservatives on social media!'</p><h>Rising internal GOP clout</h><p>The role of helping the company maneuver through this treacherous new political landscape became a core responsibility for Kaplan, Facebook's vice president for global public policy, who had joined the company in 2011, after eight years in the Bush White House and a stint as an energy lobbyist.</p><p>The former Marine Corps officer had clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and, despite supporting former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) for president, met with Trump in December 2016 after the White House expressed interest in having him head the Office of Management and Budget. Kaplan later played a key role in organizing support for Trump Supreme Court pick Brett M.  Kavanaugh, a longtime Kaplan friend.</p><p>As Trump came to office, Kaplan was a Republican in a company increasingly self-conscious about its oversupply of Democrats in its top ranks. This included Sandberg, who had worked in the Clinton administration and hired numerous friends and former colleagues into Facebook \" creating a class of internal allies known informally as 'FOSS,' for Friends of Sheryl Sandberg.</p><p>Kaplan, who had dated Sandberg when they were students at Harvard, managed to be both a FOSS and one of the only Republicans in the room when major decisions got made. The combination lent him credibility when he warned, as he often did, that a looming decision might inflame perilous relations with conservatives.</p><p>The rising clout among Facebook's Republicans went beyond Kaplan. Katie Harbath, a onetime campaign aide to former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, gained increased prominence. Kaplan also dispensed with the tradition of having members of both major parties share power atop the Washington office by hiring a fellow Republican, former Federal Communications Commission chairman Kevin Martin, as his deputy \" strengthening the conservative cast of the office at its highest levels.</p><p>Kaplan proved to be adept at assuaging conservative concerns about Facebook. Even before Trump won the presidency, the company faced a crisis in May 2016 when tech publication Gizmodo published a story asserting that contractors managing Facebook's 'Trending' module were suppressing conservative stories.</p><p>Kaplan tapped a small team of Republicans, including Harbath, to organize a visit for prominent conservatives, such as political commentators Glenn Beck and Tucker Carlson, to Facebook headquarters. The meeting with Zuckerberg and Sandberg calmed the controversy \" at least for a time \" but conservatives soon would come back with other complaints.</p><p>'It's the squeaky wheels who get the grease,' said another person familiar with the company's effort to mollify conservatives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 'They were the squeaky wheels.'</p><p>As for the 'Trending' topics feature, Facebook fired the contractors described in the Gizmodo story and gave the job for determining 'Trending' topics to an algorithm. That allowed the feature to become a vehicle for spreading the false news reports that marred Facebook in the months leading up to the election. One recommended story claimed \" falsely \" that Fox News host Megyn Kelly had been fired for supporting Clinton.</p><h>Russia campaign and fallout</h><p>Security researchers at Facebook found the first signs that Russians were seeking to influence the U.S. election months before the 2016 vote, discovering accounts apparently under control of foreign military hackers.</p><p>Those initial discoveries, although shared with the FBI, were not made public. But when U.S. intelligence officials announced in January 2017 that they, too, had detected Russian interference on social media, an internal debate developed within Facebook about what to reveal publicly and when.</p><p>The result, after three months of wrangling, was a 13-page white paper in April that did not include the words 'Russia' or 'Russian.' Instead, there was this oblique reference: 'Our data does not contradict the attribution provided by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence in the report dated January 6, 2017.'</p><p>Several issues were at play in these debates, including whether Facebook's researchers had enough clear evidence to name Russia definitively, and company officials pushed to make sure the white paper was rigorous enough to be defended in the face of the expected Republican backlash. But some company employees found the resulting document incomplete, and the caution of company officials fueled complaints that they were acting in part to avoid inflaming tensions with a White House consumed with battling allegations that Russia had helped elect Trump.</p><p>'If we say Russia, it will center us in this discussion and anger the administration,' a person familiar with the political dynamics in Face book's Washington office recalled hearing.</p><p>Stone, the Facebook spokesman, said, 'The goal of the white paper was to share our findings in a straightforward manner, which is why there was broad agreement with the security team's recommendation to refer to the Intelligence Community Assessment and not name any specific nations.'</p><p>The worry about political fallout grew in subsequent months as Facebook's security researchers discovered that the Internet Research Agency, whose owner was a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had used 470 fake accounts and pages to manipulate U.S. voters. When Facebook revealed this Russian interference in September 2017, the fears of angering the White House proved prescient.</p><p>Trump soon began tweeting about the company, and conservatives in Congress used the resulting hearings to accuse Facebook of bias against conservative voices on the platform. Such complaints grew the following year, when the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke regarding the use of sensitive Facebook data to direct campaign messaging.</p><p>Zuckerberg's visit to Capitol Hill in April 2018 to address the Cambridge Analytica scandal featured frequent allegations of bias. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) cited Facebook's warning to Diamond and Silk as exemplifying 'a pervasive pattern of political bias.' In a House hearing the next day, Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) asked Zuckerberg, 'What is 'unsafe' about two black women supporting Donald J. Trump?'</p><p>While Zuckerberg attributed the incident to 'an enforcement error,' the next month the company announced it would conduct an audit of allegations of bias against conservatives at Facebook. Leading this inquiry was not an independent social media researcher but a prominent conservative lawyer, former senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.).</p><p>The resulting interim report, completed in August, catalogued numerous complaints by conservatives but offered no concrete evidence of bias or any systematic, data-based review of the question. Still, it offered two concessions: Facebook would hire more staff 'dedicated to working with right-of-center organizations and leaders.' And the company would loosen a long-standing advertising policy against graphic medical photos; the result was to allow antiabortion groups to depict premature babies reliant on feeding and other medical tubes in political messaging.</p><p>The audit and its concessions pleased many conservatives but rankled some on the other side of the political spectrum, who had begun to sense that, in their dealings with Facebook, they were on a losing streak to an organized, forceful and consistent campaign of pressure by conservatives. Civil rights leaders, for example, had been asking for an audit of racism on the platform for several years. It finally got announced the same day, in May 2018, as the conservative bias audit.</p><p>'We've been in conversation with them, in some iteration, for four years, without much success,' said Malkia Devich Cyril, a senior fellow for the activist group MediaJustice who was part of a Black Lives Matter delegation that visited Facebook in 2016. 'As individuals they might have liberal or progressive leanings, but as a company their interests are being served by conservative economic policy.' </p><h>Fact checks and ad tools</h><p>The political stakes for Facebook became increasingly clear last summer. A major corporate initiative, a cryptocurrency called Libra, landed in Washington with a discernible thud.</p><p>'Facebook Libra's 'virtual currency' will have little standing or dependability,' Trump tweeted in July, making clear his intention to impose federal regulations on such an initiative. 'We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!'</p><p>About the same time, the Justice Department began a broad antitrust review of major technology companies, including Facebook.</p><p>Zuckerberg \" who had lashed out at Warren over her calls to break up Facebook, telling employees in a July meeting that he would 'go to the mat and . . . fight' any such effort \" took a more conciliatory tone with Trump.</p><p>As talk of federal investigations grew in September, Zuckerberg visited the White House. Trump tweeted, 'Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of @Facebook in the Oval Office today.' Included was a picture of the young tech billionaire shaking hands with the president.</p><p>Zuckerberg also hosted a group of conservatives at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., in June. One participant, longtime anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, praised the company for hiring staff specifically to work with conservatives.</p><p>'There has been what seems to be a serious effort to reach out to us,' said Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.</p><p>Two important victories for Trump and conservatives came amid this outreach by Zuckerberg.</p><p>The first was when Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president for global affairs and communications, announced in September that the company's system of third-party fact-checkers would not review claims by politicians. Although Facebook said this was merely the ratification of existing practice, the announcement provoked fury among Democrats weary from thousands of well-chronicled falsehoods, embellishments and misstatements by Trump and worried that he would exploit the loophole in the coming campaign season.</p><p>An immediate test further underscored these fears: A Trump campaign ad made claims against former vice president Joe Biden, at the time leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, that independent fact-checkers called dubious. Biden's campaign demanded the ad be removed, but Facebook refused, reiterating it would not act against false statements from politicians.</p><p>Those defending the decision, inside and outside the company, pointed to the traditional leeway given to political speech in the United States and to Zuckerberg's own reluctance to curb user expression in all but the most extreme circumstances.</p><p>He said in a speech at Georgetown University in October that restricting political speech threatens 'the ability to speak freely [that] has been central in the fight for democracy worldwide.'</p><p>But critics saw yet another effort by Facebook to steer clear of Republican wrath.</p><p>'Right now Trump is president, and the company is obviously very attuned to the political winds,' said Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a Washington-based umbrella group. 'They all know [at Facebook] that the Justice Department and state attorneys general are sniffing around at regulations and litigation.' </p><p>The second victory for conservatives came soon after, when Face book rebuffed calls to limit the ability of politicians to use advertising tools that allow the narrow targeting of individuals based on their home address, gender, education level, income, marital status, job or other characteristics. Brad Parscale, a digital adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign and now campaign manager for the reelection effort, had boasted of the power of these targeting tools and made clear his eagerness to use them again.</p><p>Some Democratic political operatives and the Democratic National Committee also expressed concern to Facebook about losing access to such cheap, effective means for reaching voters. But other prominent Democrats, as well as politically independent technology researchers, warned that what they called 'microtargeting' could threaten the sanctity of elections by undermining the accountability and transparency of political speech.</p><p>These critics warned that voters had no way to know what messages reached their friends or neighbors, giving politicians license to tailor messages based on what people wanted to hear rather than what was best for the public overall. A lie delivered to just 100 carefully targeted people on Facebook, for example, was much less likely to be caught and corrected than one delivered on a billboard or in a television ad.</p><p>Ellen L. Weintraub, a Democrat who then was chair of the Federal Election Commission, warned in a Washington Post opinion piece that such targeting had a history as 'a potent weapon for spreading disinformation and sowing discord.'</p><p>For these reasons, Google prohibited politicians from using its most powerful targeting tools. Twitter decided to ban political ads altogether. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) urged Facebook to follow the lead of these other companies 'rather than continuing to chase political advertising dollars.'</p><p>Facebook seriously considered such a move during a months-long internal debate that weighed several types of restrictions, including possibly banning political ads altogether, company officials said, pointing out that such advertising produces a very small percentage of its multibillion-dollar revenue streams while generating a disproportionate amount of headaches.</p><p>But when news leaked that Face book was considering such changes, Trump made clear his-opposition. His campaign tweeted, amid red siren emoji,  'IMPORTANT @facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020. Tools that help us reach more great Americans - lift voices the media - big tech choose to ignore!'</p><p>Facebook ultimately announced in January that it would increase the transparency of ad targeting ahead of the 2020 election but impose no new limits for politicians.</p><p>In a blog post, Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management, made clear that the company had heard the political clamor on the issue.</p><p>'Unlike Google, we have chosen not to limit targeting of these ads,' Leathern wrote. 'We considered doing so, but through extensive outreach and consultations we heard about the importance of these tools for reaching key audiences from a wide range of NGOs, non-profits, political groups and campaigns, including both Republican and Democratic committees in the US.'</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com\">craig.timberg@washpost.com</email></p><p>Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-cbe26598-541d-11ea-929a-64efa7482a77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y84-SRM1-JBFW-C357-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4423\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Suburban Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Nearly all were based overseas, had financial motives and displayed a clear rightward bent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a world of perfect neutrality, which Facebook espouses as its goal, the political tilt of the pages shouldn't have mattered. But in a videoconference between Facebook's Washington office and its Silicon Valley headquarters in December 2016, the company's most senior Republican, Joel Kaplan, voiced concerns that would become familiar to those within the company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'We can't remove all of it because it will disproportionately affect conservatives,' said Kaplan, a former George W. Bush White House official and now the head of Facebook's Washington office, according to people familiar with the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect professional relationships.</p><p>When another Facebook staff member pushed for the entire list to be taken down on the grounds that the accounts fueled the 'fake news' that had roiled the election, Kaplan warned of the backlash from conservatives.</p><p>'They don't believe it to be fake news,' he said, arguing for time to develop guidelines that could be defended to the company's critics, including on the right.</p><p>The debate over 'Project P,' which resulted in a few of the worst pages quickly being removed while most others remained on the platform, exemplified the political dynamics that have reigned within Facebook since Trump emerged as the Republican Party's presumptive nominee to the White House in 2016. A company led mainly by Democrats in the liberal bastion of Northern California repeatedly has tilted rightward to deliver policies, hiring decisions and public gestures sought by Republicans, according to current and former employees and others who have worked closely with the company.</p><p>Trump and other party leaders have pressured Facebook by making unproven claims of bias against conservatives amid rising signs of government action on the issue, including investigations by Congress and the Justice Department. Republicans also have leveraged Facebook's fears of alienating conservative Americans to win concessions from a company whose most widely shared news content typically includes stories from Fox News and other right-leaning sources.</p><p>These sensitivities \" in conjunction with the company's long-standing resistance to acting as 'an arbiter of truth' \" have affected Facebook's responses to a range of major issues, from how to address fake news and Russian manipulation of American voters on the platform to, more recently, the advertising policies that have set the political ground rules for the 2020 election, say people privy to internal debates.</p><p>Such factors have helped shape a platform that gives politicians license to lie and that remains awash in misinformation, vulnerable to a repeat of many of the problems that marred the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Facebook, unlike Google and Twitter, also has refused calls to restrict politicians' access to powerful ad-targeting tools \" which Trump used with particular relish four years ago \" that allow messages to be tailored to individual voters, based on characteristics Facebook has gleaned over years of tracking user behavior.</p><p>'I think Facebook is looking at their political advertising policies in explicitly partisan terms, and they're afraid of angering Republicans,' said Alex Stamos, head of the Stanford Internet Observatory, a research group, and a former Facebook chief security officer. 'The Republicans in the D.C. office see themselves as a bulwark against the liberals in California.' </p><p>The company says its decisions are guided not by political calculations but by global policy goals of expanding connections among users and protecting them from government overreach, in line with chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's commitment to allowing speech on the social media platform to remain as unrestricted as possible.</p><p>'After 2016, we made massive investments in new teams and technology to make our products safer and to secure elections,' said company spokesman Andy Stone. 'People on both sides of the aisle continue to criticize us, but we remain committed to seeking outside perspectives and building a platform for all ideas.' </p><p>Kaplan declined to comment for this article.</p><p>But critics \" both outside Facebook and within its ranks \" see something more akin to corporate realpolitik, a willingness to accede to political demands in an era when Republicans control most levers of power in Washington.</p><p>'Facebook does not speak Republican,' said a former employee of Facebook's Integrity Team, which was created to ensure safety and trust on the platform, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about a former employer. 'This is what they know about Republicans: Tell them 'yes' or they will hurt us.' </p><p>In the 16 years since its birth as a website to connect students at Harvard, Facebook has emerged as perhaps the world's most far-reaching source of news and information, especially since it added the potent subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, creating a stable of globe-spanning communication tools with billions of users. Facebook's technology played a role in fomenting democratic revolutions across the Arab world and helping to rally domestic political movements such as Black Lives Matter. But the platform also was used to help fuel a genocide in Myanmar, a U.N. report concluded, and has been used to live-stream violence, including video of a massacre at a New Zealand mosque.</p><p>Facebook's power is coveted by American politicians, who know that the vast majority of U.S. voters have accounts. Trump already has spent more than $32 million on the platform for his reelection effort, while Democratic candidates, collectively, have spent more than $107 million, according to Facebook's Ad Library, one of its transparency initiatives. Andrew Bosworth, a top corporate executive considered a confidant of Zuckerberg, said in a post in December that Facebook was 'responsible for Donald Trump getting elected' in 2016 through his effective advertising campaign \" a comment that underscored the stakes of the company's policy moves.</p><p>Facebook's quest to quell conservative criticism has infused a range of decisions in recent years, say people familiar with the company's internal debates. These included whether to allow graphic images of premature babies on feeding tubes \" a prohibition that had rankled antiabortion groups \" or to include the sharply conservative Breitbart News in a list of news sources despite its history of serving, in the words of its former executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon, as the 'platform for the alt-right.' </p><p>Breitbart spokeswoman Elizabeth Moore, citing the popularity of the news site and what she called a strong track record of accuracy, said, 'It would be an insane oversight to disenfranchise our massive audience that uses Facebook and craves our news content.' </p><p>But its inclusion has sparked criticism among those who say the move was mainly to address Republican complaints about the company.</p><p>'I don't think they do this as a conservative company. I think they do this as a scared company,' said Jeff Jarvis, a journalism professor at the City University of New York who has worked with Facebook on several media projects.</p><p>The price has been high in terms of anger from Democrats, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who has promised to lead efforts to break up Facebook should she win the presidency. Liberal financier George Soros, writing recently in the New York Times, called for stripping control of Facebook from Zuckerberg and accused the company of having 'an informal mutual assistance operation' with Trump.</p><p>Yet by at least one metric, Facebook's moves have succeeded \" in appeasing a disruptive, unpredictable president. Just last month in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said of Zuckerberg on CNBC, 'He's done a hell of a job.'</p><p>          Power shift in Washington          </p><p>Soon after Facebook's meeting on Project P, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski came to Facebook's Washington headquarters offering to advise the company on how to handle the new White House, according to people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive internal matters.</p><p>The shifting power in Washington was a serious issue for the company. Its employees had donated just $5,171 to Trump, compared with $1.1 million to fundraising committees affiliated with Democrat Hillary Clinton, with nearly half that amount coming from two of Zuckerberg's closest confidantes, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and then-Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, according to the political analytics  firm GovPredict.</p><p>But the meeting with Lewandowski sparked outrage within an office still reeling from the election. Particularly upset were several Democrats, including the director of U.S. public policy, Catlin O'Neill, a former chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the granddaughter of a legendary Pelosi predecessor, Thomas P. 'Tip' O'Neill (D-Mass.), said people familiar with the visit and its aftermath.</p><p>Facebook decided not to retain Lewandowski, who declined to comment on the details of the visit aside from saying by text, 'Please be sure to include the facts that I have never worked for them or been paid by them \" they solicited me for a meeting and I attended.' </p><p>But the encounter left many within the company uneasy about what Trump and his allies might do \" or perhaps worse, what he might tweet.</p><p>The company gradually implemented policies to combat false, misleading news reports through new transparency initiatives and a system of third-party fact-checkers, a move that upset some Republicans. It also adopted its first policy against 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' \" essentially using bots, fake accounts or other amplification tactics to manipulate the platform, as Russians and others had in 2016 \" and bolstered its security team to police violations.</p><p>Complaints eventually grew, however, that conservatives were being unfairly targeted by these moves and by long-standing content policies, such as the prohibition against hate speech. Moves to ban conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and right-wing media star Milo Yiannopoulos in 2019 for being 'dangerous,' for example, generated allegations of censorship by 'Big Tech' among more mainstream conservatives.</p><p>As these and other complaints against Facebook grew among Republicans, Trump often amplified them over rival social media platform Twitter, where his following tops 72 million users.</p><p>'Facebook was always anti-Trump,' he tweeted on Sept. 27, 2017, amid the scandal over Russian efforts to use social media to help elect him. The following month, he added, 'Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side, not mine!'</p><p>Trump leveled similar charges against other technology companies, as he did in December 2018: 'Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous!' But, often, Facebook bore the brunt of the president's wrath, as it did after a pair of pro-Trump social media personalities, Diamond and Silk, accused the company of censoring them after they received a warning about posting 'unsafe' content. (The company later said it had acted in error.)</p><p>'The wonderful Diamond and Silk have been treated so horribly by Facebook. They work so hard and what has been done to them is very sad -  and we're looking into' it, Trump tweeted in May 2019. 'It's getting worse and worse for Conservatives on social media!'</p><p>          Rising internal GOP clout          </p><p>The role of helping the company maneuver through this treacherous new political landscape became a core responsibility for Kaplan, Facebook's vice president for global public policy, who had joined the company in 2011, after eight years in the Bush White House and a stint as an energy lobbyist.</p><p>The former Marine Corps officer had clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and, despite supporting former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) for president, met with Trump in December 2016 after the White House expressed interest in having him head the Office of Management and Budget. Kaplan later played a key role in organizing support for Trump Supreme Court pick Brett M.  Kavanaugh, a longtime Kaplan friend.</p><p>As Trump came to office, Kaplan was a Republican in a company increasingly self-conscious about its oversupply of Democrats in its top ranks. This included Sandberg, who had worked in the Clinton administration and hired numerous friends and former colleagues into Facebook \" creating a class of internal allies known informally as 'FOSS,' for Friends of Sheryl Sandberg.</p><p>Kaplan, who had dated Sandberg when they were students at Harvard, managed to be both a FOSS and one of the only Republicans in the room when major decisions got made. The combination lent him credibility when he warned, as he often did, that a looming decision might inflame perilous relations with conservatives.</p><p>The rising clout among Facebook's Republicans went beyond Kaplan. Katie Harbath, a onetime campaign aide to former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, gained increased prominence. Kaplan also dispensed with the tradition of having members of both major parties share power atop the Washington office by hiring a fellow Republican, former Federal Communications Commission chairman Kevin Martin, as his deputy \" strengthening the conservative cast of the office at its highest levels.</p><p>Kaplan proved to be adept at assuaging conservative concerns about Facebook. Even before Trump won the presidency, the company faced a crisis in May 2016 when tech publication Gizmodo published a story asserting that contractors managing Facebook's 'Trending' module were suppressing conservative stories.</p><p>Kaplan tapped a small team of Republicans, including Harbath, to organize a visit for prominent conservatives, such as political commentators Glenn Beck and Tucker Carlson, to Facebook headquarters. The meeting with Zuckerberg and Sandberg calmed the controversy \" at least for a time \" but conservatives soon would come back with other complaints.</p><p>'It's the squeaky wheels who get the grease,' said another person familiar with the company's effort to mollify conservatives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 'They were the squeaky wheels.'</p><p>As for the 'Trending' topics feature, Facebook fired the contractors described in the Gizmodo story and gave the job for determining 'Trending' topics to an algorithm. That allowed the feature to become a vehicle for spreading the false news reports that marred Facebook in the months leading up to the election. One recommended story claimed \" falsely \" that Fox News host Megyn Kelly had been fired for supporting Clinton.</p><p>          Russia campaign and fallout          </p><p>Security researchers at Facebook found the first signs that Russians were seeking to influence the U.S. election months before the 2016 vote, discovering accounts apparently under control of foreign military hackers.</p><p>Those initial discoveries, although shared with the FBI, were not made public. But when U.S. intelligence officials announced in January 2017 that they, too, had detected Russian interference on social media, an internal debate developed within Facebook about what to reveal publicly and when.</p><p>The result, after three months of wrangling, was a 13-page white paper in April that did not include the words 'Russia' or 'Russian.' Instead, there was this oblique reference: 'Our data does not contradict the attribution provided by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence in the report dated January 6, 2017.'</p><p>Several issues were at play in these debates, including whether Facebook's researchers had enough clear evidence to name Russia definitively, and company officials pushed to make sure the white paper was rigorous enough to be defended in the face of the expected Republican backlash. But some company employees found the resulting document incomplete, and the caution of company officials fueled complaints that they were acting in part to avoid inflaming tensions with a White House consumed with battling allegations that Russia had helped elect Trump.</p><p>'If we say Russia, it will center us in this discussion and anger the administration,' a person familiar with the political dynamics in Face book's Washington office recalled hearing.</p><p>Stone, the Facebook spokesman, said, 'The goal of the white paper was to share our findings in a straightforward manner, which is why there was broad agreement with the security team's recommendation to refer to the Intelligence Community Assessment and not name any specific nations.'</p><p>The worry about political fallout grew in subsequent months as Facebook's security researchers discovered that the Internet Research Agency, whose owner was a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had used 470 fake accounts and pages to manipulate U.S. voters. When Facebook revealed this Russian interference in September 2017, the fears of angering the White House proved prescient.</p><p>Trump soon began tweeting about the company, and conservatives in Congress used the resulting hearings to accuse Facebook of bias against conservative voices on the platform. Such complaints grew the following year, when the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke regarding the use of sensitive Facebook data to direct campaign messaging.</p><p>Zuckerberg's visit to Capitol Hill in April 2018 to address the Cambridge Analytica scandal featured frequent allegations of bias. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) cited Facebook's warning to Diamond and Silk as exemplifying 'a pervasive pattern of political bias.' In a House hearing the next day, Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) asked Zuckerberg, 'What is 'unsafe' about two black women supporting Donald J. Trump?'</p><p>While Zuckerberg attributed the incident to 'an enforcement error,' the next month the company announced it would conduct an audit of allegations of bias against conservatives at Facebook. Leading this inquiry was not an independent social media researcher but a prominent conservative lawyer, former senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.).</p><p>The resulting interim report, completed in August, catalogued numerous complaints by conservatives but offered no concrete evidence of bias or any systematic, data-based review of the question. Still, it offered two concessions: Facebook would hire more staff 'dedicated to working with right-of-center organizations and leaders.' And the company would loosen a long-standing advertising policy against graphic medical photos; the result was to allow antiabortion groups to depict premature babies reliant on feeding and other medical tubes in political messaging.</p><p>The audit and its concessions pleased many conservatives but rankled some on the other side of the political spectrum, who had begun to sense that, in their dealings with Facebook, they were on a losing streak to an organized, forceful and consistent campaign of pressure by conservatives. Civil rights leaders, for example, had been asking for an audit of racism on the platform for several years. It finally got announced the same day, in May 2018, as the conservative bias audit.</p><p>'We've been in conversation with them, in some iteration, for four years, without much success,' said Malkia Devich Cyril, a senior fellow for the activist group MediaJustice who was part of a Black Lives Matter delegation that visited Facebook in 2016. 'As individuals they might have liberal or progressive leanings, but as a company their interests are being served by conservative economic policy.' </p><p>          Fact checks and ad tools          </p><p>The political stakes for Facebook became increasingly clear last summer. A major corporate initiative, a cryptocurrency called Libra, landed in Washington with a discernible thud.</p><p>'Facebook Libra's 'virtual currency' will have little standing or dependability,' Trump tweeted in July, making clear his intention to impose federal regulations on such an initiative. 'We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!'</p><p>About the same time, the Justice Department began a broad antitrust review of major technology companies, including Facebook.</p><p>Zuckerberg \" who had lashed out at Warren over her calls to break up Facebook, telling employees in a July meeting that he would 'go to the mat and . . . fight' any such effort \" took a more conciliatory tone with Trump.</p><p>As talk of federal investigations grew in September, Zuckerberg visited the White House. Trump tweeted, 'Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of @Facebook in the Oval Office today.' Included was a picture of the young tech billionaire shaking hands with the president.</p><p>Zuckerberg also hosted a group of conservatives at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., in June. One participant, longtime anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, praised the company for hiring staff specifically to work with conservatives.</p><p>'There has been what seems to be a serious effort to reach out to us,' said Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.</p><p>Two important victories for Trump and conservatives came amid this outreach by Zuckerberg.</p><p>The first was when Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president for global affairs and communications, announced in September that the company's system of third-party fact-checkers would not review claims by politicians. Although Facebook said this was merely the ratification of existing practice, the announcement provoked fury among Democrats weary from thousands of well-chronicled falsehoods, embellishments and misstatements by Trump and worried that he would exploit the loophole in the coming campaign season.</p><p>An immediate test further underscored these fears: A Trump campaign ad made claims against former vice president Joe Biden, at the time leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, that independent fact-checkers called dubious. Biden's campaign demanded the ad be removed, but Facebook refused, reiterating it would not act against false statements from politicians.</p><p>Those defending the decision, inside and outside the company, pointed to the traditional leeway given to political speech in the United States and to Zuckerberg's own reluctance to curb user expression in all but the most extreme circumstances.</p><p>He said in a speech at Georgetown University in October that restricting political speech threatens 'the ability to speak freely [that] has been central in the fight for democracy worldwide.'</p><p>But critics saw yet another effort by Facebook to steer clear of Republican wrath.</p><p>'Right now Trump is president, and the company is obviously very attuned to the political winds,' said Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a Washington-based umbrella group. 'They all know [at Facebook] that the Justice Department and state attorneys general are sniffing around at regulations and litigation.' </p><p>The second victory for conservatives came soon after, when Face book rebuffed calls to limit the ability of politicians to use advertising tools that allow the narrow targeting of individuals based on their home address, gender, education level, income, marital status, job or other characteristics. Brad Parscale, a digital adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign and now campaign manager for the reelection effort, had boasted of the power of these targeting tools and made clear his eagerness to use them again.</p><p>Some Democratic political operatives and the Democratic National Committee also expressed concern to Facebook about losing access to such cheap, effective means for reaching voters. But other prominent Democrats, as well as politically independent technology researchers, warned that what they called 'microtargeting' could threaten the sanctity of elections by undermining the accountability and transparency of political speech.</p><p>These critics warned that voters had no way to know what messages reached their friends or neighbors, giving politicians license to tailor messages based on what people wanted to hear rather than what was best for the public overall. A lie delivered to just 100 carefully targeted people on Facebook, for example, was much less likely to be caught and corrected than one delivered on a billboard or in a television ad.</p><p>Ellen L. Weintraub, a Democrat who then was chair of the Federal Election Commission, warned in a Washington Post opinion piece that such targeting had a history as 'a potent weapon for spreading disinformation and sowing discord.'</p><p>For these reasons, Google prohibited politicians from using its most powerful targeting tools. Twitter decided to ban political ads altogether. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) urged Facebook to follow the lead of these other companies 'rather than continuing to chase political advertising dollars.'</p><p>Facebook seriously considered such a move during a months-long internal debate that weighed several types of restrictions, including possibly banning political ads altogether, company officials said, pointing out that such advertising produces a very small percentage of its multibillion-dollar revenue streams while generating a disproportionate amount of headaches.</p><p>But when news leaked that Face book was considering such changes, Trump made clear his-opposition. His campaign tweeted, amid red siren emoji,  'IMPORTANT @facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020. Tools that help us reach more great Americans - lift voices the media - big tech choose to ignore!'</p><p>Facebook ultimately announced in January that it would increase the transparency of ad targeting ahead of the 2020 election but impose no new limits for politicians.</p><p>In a blog post, Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management, made clear that the company had heard the political clamor on the issue.</p><p>'Unlike Google, we have chosen not to limit targeting of these ads,' Leathern wrote. 'We considered doing so, but through extensive outreach and consultations we heard about the importance of these tools for reaching key audiences from a wide range of NGOs, non-profits, political groups and campaigns, including both Republican and Democratic committees in the US.'</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com\">craig.timberg@washpost.com</email></p><p>Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-cbe26598541d11ea929a64efa7482a77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y84-MRF1-JCDY-T357-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4436\"/><timeReceived>3:41 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted businesses and the working habits and lives of billions around the world. But it has also shone a spotlight on some of the wider IT challenges already being faced by many governments, businesses and communities.    The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has acknowledged these issues, noting \"the COVID-19 crisis has ... highlighted its own digital divide, where many families, workers, businesses and populations are not able to access or afford the benefits of digital technology\".   SEE: Network security policy (TechRepublic Premium)        In the Middle East and North Africa, these digital discrepancies are especially pronounced given the cultural and financial diversity of the region. Although these issues pre-date the pandemic, it has nonetheless reinforced the need for them to be tackled.   Here are three of the biggest digital-divide issues the region faces:  1.   Access and affordability  \"In the Middle East and North Africa, the proportion of the population not covered by a mobile broadband network fell by more than half between 2014 and 2018 and now stands at 11%,\" the GSMA states .    Yet, as the GSMA observes, \"almost half the population are not connected to the mobile internet even though they are covered by a 3G or 4G network\".      One long-standing reason for this situation  is the relatively high cost of handsets and data packages.    As a result, GSMA data shows that in 2018 smartphone penetration across the typically more affluent Gulf nations stood at 75%, compared with 52% in North Africa and 39% in other Arab states such as Sudan. At a time of growing unemployment and reduced government subsidies , the cost of digital services may become harder still for many households to afford.   Alongside this problem, a further factor behind these, and other, take-up statistics is the pronounced gender gap present across much of the region when it comes to technology access.    And, of course, as Internews' Saoussen Ben Cheikh reminds us, moving your life or business online is not an option in conflict-stricken countries . In places such as \"Libya, Syria and Yemen, strained by conflict and economic chaos, users face low-speed internet and prohibitive costs\".  2. Availability of online services  For those able to work from home, comes another potential issue: many popular video-calling and VoIP services have historically been blocked by state regulators .   These restrictions have been lifted during the pandemic , allowing people to legally use some services like Zoom and Skype, but it's unclear whether these changes will be permanent.    Effective use of services can also be stymied by connection speeds. The region is home to some of the slowest, as well as to some of the fastest, connections in the world.    SEE: Middle East: Web-chat services unblocked but big tech projects take a hit in COVID crisis   Moreover, \"many countries saw meaningful drops in average download speeds for mobile and fixed internet connections between February and March 2020\", Simon Kemp, chief analyst at DataReportal, writes . Average download speeds for mobile internet dropped by 13% in Israel, 12% in Morocco, and 9.7% in Turkey, between February and March 2020.    At the same time, other persistent challenges also exist, including the lack of content and services available in the Arabic language, the large number of smaller businesses without a digital presence  and the slow, although accelerating, growth curve for e-commerce .    Addressing these issues may further help to reduce digital divides, by creating more reasons for widespread digital adoption and engagement.  3. Digital skills and literacy   Historically, efforts to engender digital skills have focused on meeting existing and predicted IT skill gaps . This remains a priority for countries across the region as they continue to pivot towards becoming knowledge-based economies.    That said, digital skill requirements must go beyond conventional technology education and training.    A further important consideration, even in countries with high levels of tech take-up, is the breadth and depth of digital usage.    The coronavirus may have helped to remedy elements of this problem, by creating opportunities for new digital habits, such as online shopping and learning. But, it has also amplified other digital literacy issues.    Dubbed an 'infodemic', by Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), there's a further concern that \"fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous\".   Like other regions, the Middle East and North Africa has been increasingly susceptible to digital disinformation , although this trend is not unique to the current climate . Disinformation can be especially problematic in closed networks \u2013   like WhatsApp groups \u2013   which many netizens have migrated to, due to concerns about online privacy and surveillance .   To counteract the spread of falsehoods, consumers need to become more information literate, and we need to see more fact-checking efforts \u2013 especially during a public-health crisis \u2013 like the one launched last year by AFP, in Arabic .   Bridging the divide  The region's digital divide is readily apparent. Remedying this social injustice is important if the socio-economic benefits afforded by digital technology are to be unlocked across the region.    \"Now, more than ever, governments, industry, international organizations, NGOs, academia and other stakeholders must work together to find mutually beneficial solutions,\" the ITU suggests .    There is precedent for this type of collaboration and innovation. Facebook and Twitter have sought to address affordability issues through the launch of 'lite' versions of their services.   Telcos have explored infrastructure-sharing to improve access , while governments and Silicon Valley giants have supported initiatives focused on skills training and innovation.   To this list, we should add further investment in local tech education and Arabic digital content, cultural shifts towards a greater acceptance of working from home, and the creation of new products and services \u2013   such as mobile wallets \u2013   which meet real consumer needs.    Meanwhile, making some government services online only, coupled with efforts like the Dubai Paperless Strategy , and Egypt's rollout of digital IDs as a means to access services , will further incentivize behavioral change and the necessary adoption of new digital habits.    Closing the digital divide is in the interests of governments, telecom providers and other businesses, all of which stand to benefit from a wider user base.   At the same time, consumers also need to reap the benefits too, with digital improving and enhancing their lives, not adding another layer of complication and cost to it.   Whether COVID-19 provides the impetus for these changes remains to be seen, but the pandemic has demonstrated the need to address these issues sooner rather than later.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Mphasis' Eric Winston explores how companies can accelerate overall GDPR compliance while doing right by their customers.As the European Union completes one year of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), U.S. lawmakers are following suit. Nationwide, there is a growing momentum to enforce strict privacy laws to protect consumers from rampant data breaches that violate their privacy. </p><p>Contrary to what may have been expected, big tech has generally come out in support of the Congressional national privacy law proposal, underscoring the widely held belief that something must be done to protect consumers' personal data rights. However, while tech companies are pushing for a single national federal legislation, several U.S. states, including California, are rushing to reform the lax regulatory landscape by enacting their own, more stringent, data privacy laws. Meanwhile, as American companies await the implementation of a nationwide legislation, such organizations still have the challenge of complying with GDPR. According to recent research[1], only 27 percent of EU-based companies, excluding the U.K., are compliant with the GDPR. Further, just 12 percent of companies in the U.S. have achieved GDPR compliance.GDPR and the AI ConundrumEven as companies rush to ensure GDPR compliance, the vast scope of the law has raised another concern: the complex interaction between artificial intelligence (AI) and GDPR. In particular, Article 22 of the GDPR has been in the fore, as it contains provisions related to automated profiling and decision-making that deals with how personal data is used in its limited applicability. It impacts any industry where AI is used to derive a user's automated profile and where decisions are taken through automated means that could have a legal or significant effect on users. The concern with such decision-making is that the existing AI system logic makes automated decisions without human intervention. Such an approach could potentially victimize individuals. Recognizing this, the GDPR mandates that every decision by AI must have human intervention before any decision that could impact individuals. However, with the drafting of the GDPR around this provision being perceived as ambiguous, organizations must choose wisely how to use AI in automated decision-making. Since data is the key ingredient for AI, it is imperative to understand Article 22 in the context of restrictions on automated decision-making and profiling. Article 22 is a conditional right based on certain exceptions. It prescribes that AI \u2014 including profiling \u2014 cannot be used as the sole decision-maker in choices that have legal or similarly significant effects on users as this is necessary to 'safeguard' the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests. For instance, an AI model cannot be the only step for deciding whether a borrower is eligible to qualify for a loan. The user can also raise an objection to contest the automated decision and obtain human intervention based on exceptions. Yet if one were to play devil's advocate, automated decision-making can sometimes be justified - for instance, when an AI tool rejects a job application if the applicant has not furnished sufficient information. The crucial determiner here: At what stage of the automated decision-making process was the application rejected, and why? But since Article 22 does not require an explanation about the rationale behind any AI-led decision, this highlights a confounding aspect of the interplay between AI and GDPR. If organizations correctly interpret Article 22, they will do right by the customer and accelerate overall GDPR compliance \u2014 while upholding the firm's reputation.GDPR: The U.S. PerspectiveIt has long been established that GDPR applies to all companies that collect EU consumers' personal data or behavioral information \u2014 regardless of the geographical location of the business. Therefore, even U.S. firms that only have a web presence, but not a brick-and-mortar operation, in the EU will need to comply with the GDPR. This is because such businesses market products to the EU and collect EU citizens' personal data. The provision that gives consumers ownership of their data poses a roadblock for U.S. companies that use and sell data. Since organizations may be compelled to destroy data under 'the right to be forgotten,' businesses have struggled with restrictions imposed by the GDPR in the year since it became effective. Further, GDPR has flexed its significant enforcement powers toward U.S. firms as demonstrated when Google was recently fined \u20ac50 million for a 'lack of transparency, inadequate information and lack of valid consent regarding the ads personalization.' Going forward, given the backlog of GDPR data breach notifications and the number of companies that are not yet compliant with the tenets of the law, the fines are expected to touch hundreds of millions of euros in 2019. In terms of how the GDPR would impact the development of AI applications in the U.S., experts believe it could increase labor costs, as human intervention is a necessary component of automated decision-making. Its stringent provisions could also limit the scope of AI's long-term applications.The Journey ForwardEven so, in the years to come, GDPR's impact is expected to resonate across the world in many ways. For starters, it has inspired the U.S. to come up with its own cohesive national data privacy law that will make it easier for consumers to protect their private information. If the U.S. is going to introduce a GDPR-like law, it remains to be seen which of the provisions it will borrow from the EU regulator. A further challenge is how the U.S. would approach AI processes that require transparency to remove bias. The larger question organizations and policymakers should be asking is: What does it mean for the consumer to be 'king?' This alone will determine the trajectory of the country's ambitious national data privacy law.

This could stretch to six to nine months when VCs have doubts about the market opportunity or the startup's business model. Thus, in normal times, deals announced today would have been in the works for at least three months, possibly longer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But these are extraordinary times. Monthly data for calendar 2020 from Venture Intelligence, a research firm, on VC funding to Indian startups shows the presence of both the lag effect of good times and changes forced by the virus. VC investments, both in terms of number of deals and value of investments, have been dropping in calendar 2020. The same set of VC majors is driving the funding, but there is movement in the pecking order of sectors.</p><p>In January and February 2020, VCs invested more in Indian startups compared to the same period last year. On January 30, India registered its first case of coronavirus. But it wasn't till the second half of March that the government started going into overdrive to contain the virus. That's when Indian startups got busy measuring their 'runway'-the number of months they could survive without funding-and updating their pitch decks for more funding. The layoffs followed at Ola, Uber, Swiggy, Zomato, Paytm, Paisa Bazaar...</p><p>March onwards, each month has seen fewer VC deals and smaller amounts, compared to the corresponding month of 2019. Several of these were 'in-rounds', or VCs pumping money into existing portfolio companies. May was especially brutal. The number of deals fell from an average of 50 a month between January and April to 20 in May. And the amount invested in May 2020 was about one-fourth of that invested in May 2019. June, though, has seen a slight pick-up.</p><p>The sector drivers have changed, mirroring changes in habits brought on by the pandemic. Fintech, healthcare, education and food have been the leading sectors in 2020 in terms of investments. In less than six months, for example, education startups have already raised 96% of the amount they raised in all of 2019.</p><p>E-commerce has been the big loser, going from raising more than a billion dollars in each half of 2019 to $202 million in the first half of 2020. E-commerce companies faced restrictions on what they can deliver to their customers during the early phases of the pandemic-induced lockdown, and in general have faced an uncertain regulatory environment in recent times. Venture Intelligence defines venture capital investments as seed to series F investments (by institutional investors) in companies less than 10 years old.</p><p>In 2019, about 60% of startups that were funded were early-stage startups (as opposed to growth-stage or late-stage companies). But in value terms, early-stage received only about 10% of all VC investments. In 2020, this has increased to 16%. Startups in early stages depend almost entirely on VC funding as they tend to have little or no revenues. However, in later stages, once they start earning revenues, they seek VC funding for growth. With uncertainties around Covid, many growth and late-stage startups are scaling down their ambitions and cutting costs to extend their runways.</p><p>Amid these changes in the landscape of VC investing, the cast of leading VCs has mostly remained the same. VC firms with larger portfolios, led by Sequoia and Accel, continue to lead, especially given the demand from funded startups for additional funds. But unless deal activity picks up in the second half, most leading VCs are looking at a sharp drop in number of deals this year. For example, Sequoia, whose portfolio includes Unacademy, Bounce, MoneyTap, Khatabook and MedGenome, did 80 deals in 2019. This year, till June 16, it had closed only 27 deals.</p><p>Since 1998, there have been three occasions when VC investments suffered setbacks of some severity. The first was the dotcom crash of 2000, and it took the Indian industry five years to regain pre-crash investment levels on a calendar year basis. The second was the credit crisis of 2008, and recovery then took two years. The third was 2016, when big tech (companies such as Amazon, Alibaba and Tencent) took to making direct investments in India in a big way.</p><p>Arun Natarajan, founder of Venture Intelligence, feels a clearer picture on funding of new companies and larger rounds is likely to emerge only as businesses and consumers adjust to the post-lockdown return to \"normal work-life\". \"Several experts have predicted a W-shaped recovery, including a potential spike in new cases and further lockdowns, like in Chennai,\" he says.</p><p>At the moment, 2020 is not looking good for VCs. A survey by IT industry association Nasscom of 250 technology startups done in April 2020 has projected a wide range of impact duration for different sectors: 4 months (telecom and health tech) to 9 to 12 months (retail and travel).</p><p>It's been three months since the pandemic-induced lockdown, and startups and VCs wait on tenterhooks.</p><p>howindialives.com is a search engine for public data</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

Used with permission. The following post was co-authored by guest writersSolana Larsen,Internet Health Report Editor at Mozilla[2], and Leil Zahra, a Mozilla Fellow embedded at WITNESS[3]. As people around the world shelter from the COVID-19 pandemic, the internet has become an even more vital resource than before. Millions of us now exclusively connect, commiserate, learn, work, and play online. </p><p>In some ways, the pandemic has revealed the internet's potential as a global public resource. But it is also revealing what's unhealthy about the internet: Those without access[4] are now at an even greater disadvantage. And privacy and security shortcomings[5] in consumer technology are now making exponentially more people vulnerable. One troubling issue the pandemic brings to the fore is the internet's broken content moderation ecosystem. That is, the deeply flawed ways that big tech platforms deal with online hate speech, disinformation, and illegal content. Despite many advancements, Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms often moderate content in ways that are capricious or downright dangerous: harmful content is left to fester, and acceptable content is unfairly removed. These decisions often disproportionately affect people in the Global South and who speak languages that are less supported. Right now, we're at an inflection point. Will content moderation's flaws loom even larger? Or can this crisis be a springboard for positive, lasting change in how we communicate online? One of the thorniest problems with content moderation is who \u2014 or what \u2014 does the moderation. With pandemic-related misinformation overwhelming platforms[6] and many human content moderators unable to work[7], many platforms are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence. The limits of this approach are clear. Automated filtering has failed to prevent COVID-19 misinformation from spreading like wildfire and endangering public health. Platforms are awash in posts suggesting that drinking bleach can cure the virus, or that 5G technology is somehow spreading the disease. In addition to overlooking misinformation, automated moderation can also accidentally censor quality content. Internet users asking earnest questions, or speaking in local vocabularies or contexts, can be incorrectly labeled as problematic. Mid-pandemic, automated moderation on Facebook resulted in the erroneous takedown of a large amount of content, including links to news articles about COVID-19. In March, Facebook claimed[8] a technical 'issue' was behind this, and said they had restored the removed content. But the episode raises serious questions about the efficiency of such systems, and, further, casts doubt on Facebook's transparency. When YouTube announced it had heightened automated filtering due to COVID-19 in March, it wrote[9]: 'As we do this, users and creators may see increased video removals, including some videos that may not violate policies.' Similarly, Twitter explained[10] in the same month that their automated moderation 'can sometimes lack the context that our teams bring, and this may result in us making mistakes.' It doesn't help that when content is unfairly removed or an account is suspended, the appeal process can be opaque. In many cases, users are left without understanding the reasons behind the removal of content or suspension of an account. And even before the pandemic, context has been a major issue in the discussion around content moderation. For instance, whether a U.S.-centric approach to what is accepted language or not should be applied internationally. Flawed technology is one problem with content moderation; inequitable policies are another. In the United States and some European countries, big tech platforms can be fairly vigilant about following local laws and upholding their own internal policy commitments. Elsewhere, this isn't the case. During Nigeria's 2018 election, researcher and Global Voices contributor Rosemary Ajayi[11] and a group of colleagues catalogued[12] hundreds of tweets spreading disinformation and were dismayed at the unpredictable and inconsistent response rates to reports about this activity. 'If you report something serious on election day, and they get back to you a week later, what's the point?' said[13] Ajayi. The thought is equally frightening in today's context: If a platform removes COVID-19 misinformation after millions of people have already seen it, the damage has already been done. These are just two of several long-standing problems in the realm of content moderation. In Mozilla's recent survey[14] of the social media space, we examined several others. We spoke with a Polish nonprofit drug harm reduction group, SIN, that was suspended by Facebook[15] and unable to appeal the decision. And we spoke with the human rights research group Syrian Archive,[16] who say evidence of human rights abuses in war is frequently deleted by platforms. It's not hard to see how instances like these can be especially grave during a pandemic too. What if critical health information disappears, or evidence of lockdown-related human rights abuses is wrongly taken down? There's no panacea for these problems. But greater transparency about what is taken down, when, and why, as well as what portion of takedowns are appealed and reinstated, could help researchers and affected communities advise platforms and policymakers far better. The transparency reports of major platforms have, nevertheless, become more detailed over the years, thanks in part to pressure from civil society, including the signatories of The Santa Clara Principles[17]. This community initiative to outline baselines for transparency and accountability in content moderation was launched in 2018, and several platforms have gone on to endorse them. In March, noting that the principles would benefit from an update, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) initiated a global call for proposals[18] (the deadline is June 30) for how to better meet the needs of marginalized voices that are heavily impacted. So much is unknown about the moderation and appeal patterns in different global contexts, that even anecdotal evidence from affected users would be a precious resource. Silenced.online[19] is one new grassroots tool for crowdsourcing and discussing experiences of unfair takedowns around the world. It aims to create a network of organizations and individuals who have been working on, or want to start working on, content takedown and moderation. Other groups will concur that it's crucial for civil society and researchers to be engaged on questions of content moderation and platform regulation. Scandals and crises tend to provoke new rules and regulations, or calls for further automation, that aren't necessarily based on independent analysis of what works. New approaches to creating accountability and appeal mechanisms, like Facebook's new Oversight Board[20], demand attention from a global public. As outlined above, theCOVID-19 pandemic is bringing content moderation flaws into sharp relief, but the problems are long-standing, not least on matters of health and disinformation. They call for a change in the daily operation of platforms[21] as well as how they are held accountable. Heightened attention and focus on the issue has the potential to catalyze something good. It can spark more transparency, more humane technology, better laws\u2014and a healthier internet.

While that sentiment feels true to the enormity of the crisis, it likely isn\u2019t quite right, as scholars from the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program have been exploring since the pandemic began. Instead, the COVID-19 crisis seems poised to accelerate or intensify many economic and metropolitan trends that were already underway, with huge implications of their own. Below, scholars weigh in on COVID-19\u2019s long-term impact on businesses, workers, and the nation as a whole.</p><p>Two weeks ago, my group noted that while automation in the workplace has been spreading over the last decade, it will likely surge in the coming years. As firms\u2019 revenues rapidly decline, humans become relatively more expensive. COVID-19 won\u2019t so much change the automation trend as it will amplify it. Young people, people of color, and those with less education will be most vulnerable to further dislocation in jobs such as food service or cashiers as they become automated.</p><p>Similarly, reporters wonder whether the trauma of social distancing and the rise of telework will finally empty out the \u201csuperstar\u201d cities and lead to a decentralization of the nation\u2019s hypercentralized urban map. And sure, that might happen. However, our work shows that through crisis after crisis, the big tech hubs have continued to increase their share of the nation\u2019s digital services employment. That\u2019s because intense \u201cagglomeration\u201d economies remain so important in tech.</p><p>And then there is the matter of Big Tech itself. While it seems natural to assume that virtually every industry will be humbled by COVID-19, it sure seems to me that the big tech titans\u2014Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, etc.\u2014will emerge from the crisis stronger than ever. These titans captured dominant market shares in the decade following the last recession. Now, I bet the digital rich will get richer, as stay-at-home workers rely on their remote work tools, video calling, e-commerce, and video streaming. And don\u2019t forget that all of these giants are sitting on huge piles of cash. They will be ready to snap up any choice tech or other properties that stumble.</p><p>I\u2019m betting that the world that emerges from the crisis will be transformed, yes, but also recognizable\u2014for better or worse.</p><p>Fig1</p><p>Back to topInnovation and hybridization in food and retail will expand</p><p>By Tracy Hadden Loh</p><p>Retailers, their landlords, and suppliers were already responding to multiple industry-wide trends before the coronavirus struck, including tariffs, a shift in consumer demand from products to experiences, e-commerce, and the sharing economy. The resulting strains were already motivating these players to innovate or exit. The coronavirus disruption simply accelerates the need to be creative and embrace new models.</p><p>A 10-year commercial lease in a single-use building will no longer be standard. Seasonal retailers were already experimenting outside of the big box, including markets and pop-ups in flexible spaces. Office tenants were doing the same through WeWork and other co-working spaces. In addition to new formats and lease terms, profit-sharing leases will become an increasingly important tool to help new businesses get started, survive slowdowns, and provide a return to landlords who invest in their tenants\u2019 success.</p><p>Convergence and hybridization will accelerate in food retail, which will return to be a \u201crevitalizing force in urban life.\u201d IKEA was already a furniture showroom, warehouse, and restaurant. High-end grocers were encouraging shoppers to have a beer. Restaurants were increasingly not just dine-in, but fast-casual or mobile food trucks. Whether through app-based delivery or prepared foods from wholesalers such as Costco, Americans will return to eating much of their food prepared outside the home. In 2017, jobs in leisure and hospitality (which includes all bars and restaurants) grew to outnumber jobs in retail trade. The pandemic is a setback, but not a reset.</p><p>Fig2</p><p>For commercial real estate and local governments, food retail will only continue to grow in importance. Restaurants, in whatever format, will continue to be a growing share of tenants and sales tax generators as other storefronts are impacted by tariffs and e-commerce oligopolies. And the more Americans eat out, the more proximity to food retail will shape office and residential tenant demand, as well as home sales.</p><p>Back to topLow-wage workers are facing a housing crisis</p><p>By Martha Ross and Jenny Schuetz</p><p>In the best of times\u2014say, when unemployment is below 4%\u2014tens of millions of workers still earn barely enough to live on. In an earlier, pre-pandemic analysis, we calculated that more than 50 million workers ages 18 to 64 earn low wages. More than thirty million work full time year-round, with median hourly earnings of $11.23 and annual earnings about $24,000.</p><p>Basic costs like housing were already a stretch for these and other workers. More than 75% of low-wage workers are \u201chousing-cost burdened,\u201d meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent. The typical low-income renter household spends more than half of their income on rent.</p><p>Chart</p><p>But in the COVID-19 era\u2014with mass layoffs in hospitality, retail, and entertainment\u2014earnings have simply disappeared for millions of workers. Households that previously strained to pay rent will now find it impossible.</p><p>Policymakers have already taken note. State and local governments have instituted temporary halts on evictions. The federal government has taken steps to provide homeowners with extra time to pay their mortgages, and the CARES Act provides an eviction moratorium for renters living in federally financed units (an estimated 28% of all units).</p><p>But temporary eviction halts do not prevent unpaid rent debts from accruing, and the legislation leaves the needs of tens of millions of renters unaddressed.</p><p>We need stronger action\u2014most crucially, more direct financial assistance to households. A one-time payment of $1,200 per adult does not come close to covering housing costs for most families, let alone help them buy food and other supplies. Some households will receive additional assistance through enhanced unemployment insurance benefits or provisions of the Paycheck Protection Program, but those programs have eligibility gaps and time limits that will still leave many short.</p><p>The housing affordability crisis predates the current health crisis, and will worsen in the short run due to the federal government\u2019s slow response. People commonly reduce housing costs by \u201cdoubling-up\u201d with family or moving into lower-quality housing. Given the thin financial reserves held by renter households, many people will be forced into one of these options. A fourth federal relief package with strong housing and financial assistance provisions can help mitigate the crisis. Renters and homeowners need cash soon to prevent massive increases in housing instability and homelessness.</p><p>Back to topWill inequality increase among older Americans?</p><p>By Annelies Goger and Nicole Bateman</p><p>As baby boomers age, how will the pandemic affect older Americans? The Great Recession may offer some lessons. It is likely that older adults will fare better than their younger counterparts overall; however, disparities in income increase with age. Forthcoming work by Martha Ross and Nicole Bateman shows that 40% of workers over age 62 earn low wages, while that number is only 32% for workers in the 50 to 61 age group. There are very different levels of economic security among older adults by race as well.</p><p>Predictions of a dramatic \u201cgrey tsunami\u201d of retirements generally haven\u2019t come true yet. The share of adults age 65 and over in the employed labor force increased from 3.8% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2019. The Great Recession eroded savings, so many older workers stayed in their job out of necessity. It is possible we will see an acceleration of this trend after the pandemic.</p><p>We may see worse labor market outcomes for older workers who lose their jobs. During the peak of the Great Recession, it took unemployed older workers 43 weeks, on average, to find a new job, while workers ages 35 to 44 only took 29 weeks. Those who found a new job received deeper pay cuts than younger workers: Men over age 62 saw an average pay cut of 36%, compared to 1.5% for men ages 25 to 34. Six in 10 older workers also reported experiencing age discrimination in the labor market. These barriers may be particularly acute in metro areas with high shares of older workers (see map).</p><p>The pandemic crisis may also disproportionately impact:</p><p>Low-income older adults who do not own their home outright Older Americans age 50 to 65 with no health insurance Older business owners in industries that were highly impacted in the pandemic Black and Latino or Hispanic older Americans</p><p>The public policy framework for supporting older workers is limited. One of the key programs is the Senior Community Service Employment Program, which has been funded at levels well below the demand for it. We also need to consider other targeted public policy solutions for older workers to address inequities.</p><p>Map</p><p>Back to topGen Z will affect how cities rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic</p><p>By William H. Frey</p><p>One prognostication about the long-term effects of COVID-19 is that cities will not recover from the temporary migration of some urban dwellers to less dense areas to achieve social distancing. The assumption is that as we navigate a recession, such density-driven out-movement will become more permanent, irrespective of the many amenities and agglomeration economies urban centers have to offer.</p><p>Yet from purely demographic standpoint, one of the best recent periods for cities and megalopolises was immediately after the 2007 to 2009 Great Recession. Between 2010 and 2011, the nation\u2019s biggest metro areas\u2014New York and Los Angeles\u2014ranked first and fifth in population gains. For the four years thereafter, major metro areas gained migrants from the rest of the country at the same time many cities grew faster than their suburbs.</p><p>Chart</p><p>Why was this happening in a tepidly recovering economy? A good deal was attributable to young adult millennials. Unable to find jobs and housing in large stretches of the country, they found urban centers attractive. Eventually, the economy rebounded, jobs dispersed and many young adults dispersed with them. But large metro areas still prospered even with slower growth, as Brookings\u2019s Metro Monitor 2020 revealed.</p><p>What does this mean for the post-COVID-19 period? Much will depend on Gen Z, an educated and racially diverse generation with strong urban roots. They will face challenges, to be sure, that will need to be addressed. But if they follow in the footsteps of millennials during a similarly dim period, they could help to invigorate city growth\u2014especially if opportunities dry up elsewhere. Large places will be attractive to them, eventually if not immediately. And they can be an important demographic force in future city renewal.</p><p>Back to topCOVID-19 will accelerate structural declines in microbusiness employment</p><p>By Joseph Parilla and Sifan Liu</p><p>Small business is a tough business. In a 2018 Federal Reserve survey, only a slight majority of small businesses were profitable (57%) and just under one-quarter of them were operating at a loss. The landscape is even more perilous for microbusinesses, small businesses with fewer than 10 employees. According to that same survey, microbusinesses with under four employees were only half as likely to add jobs as larger small businesses.</p><p>These recent statistics demonstrate how microbusinesses have been on the losing end of long-run structural shifts in the U.S economy. In 1977, microbusinesses accounted for 66% of business establishments. By 2016, that number had shrunk to 57%. Meanwhile, businesses with more than 250 employees grew from 12% of establishments in 1977 to 20% of establishments in 2016 (Figure).</p><p>Fig</p><p>These trends accelerated during the Great Recession. Nationally, small businesses accounted for 45% of employment, but as the economy shed about 5 million jobs from 2008 to 2009, they accounted for 62% of the net job loss. Between 2008 and 2009, microbusinesses under five years old lost 22% of their jobs, three times the rate of larger small businesses of that same age.</p><p>Compared to the Great Recession, the early stages of the COVID-19 economic crisis suggest that job losses will fall even more disproportionately within the small business sector. We estimate that about 2.9 million microbusinesses are in industries at immediate or near-term risk from COVID-19.</p><p>How many of those microbusinesses survive will depend on the duration of social distancing measures and the success of countervailing policies. But without a robust policy response to not only mitigate small business damage in the immediate term but also support entrepreneurship more robustly in the recovery, the pandemic will accelerate the structural decline in microbusiness employment.</p><p>Back to topThe country will finally address the digital divide</p><p>By Adie Tomer</p><p>It\u2019s easy to take broadband for granted. Working-age adults earning higher incomes tend to enjoy broadband everywhere they go, from high-speed connections in their homes to wireless plans on the go. All this connectivity has allowed many of us to transform our daily lives\u2014and it\u2019s all been intensified in this period of social distancing.</p><p>While I fully expect offices, restaurants, and schools to fill up again once it\u2019s safe to do so, I\u2019m also confident that society will appreciate the redundancies provided by digital platforms. There\u2019s a sense of security that we can switch on video conferencing, digital blackboards, and on-demand margaritas when we need.</p><p>But for millions of Americans without in-home broadband, the consequences of digital disparity have become more apparent over the past few weeks. Broadband subscription rates are far lower among low-earning and less-educated households, including 18 million with no subscriptions at all. These underconnected households face an even larger set of digital barriers than they did two months ago, whether it\u2019s students who cannot attend school online, an adult who cannot telework, or a family who cannot get groceries delivered.</p><p>Fig</p><p>I expect we\u2019ll look back on COVID-19 as a wake-up call that broadband isn\u2019t a luxury\u2014it\u2019s an essential utility.</p><p>As policymakers respond to that call, they will aim to fill network gaps through public investment or tighter regulation (as in the electricity sector), and through a new suite of programs to boost subscriptions and distribute devices. We\u2019re already seeing this happen, from internet service providers offering discounts to school districts passing out computers and wireless hotspots.</p><p>We can bootstrap interventions for now, but broadband only grows more important as society and the economy continue to digitize. My guess is we\u2019re about to see a great wave of broadband policies\u2014and it can\u2019t come soon enough.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3193091</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YNW-PS21-F0YC-N4HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2503\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 15, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

So, they would send people to the Project Alamo to ensure that all of our needs were being met. Without Facebook, we wouldn't;'t have won. Facebook really and truly put us over the edge. Facebook was the medium that proved most successful for this campaign.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uB3ItzpITlk/Xkwhc97GxvI/AAAAAAABu0k/qPzkYGz-3OwlUFrfTwO2Zf1WB1UPL6ANQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-02-18%2Bat%2B8.57.15%2BAM.pngLast\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uB3ItzpITlk/Xkwhc97GxvI/AAAAAAABu0k/qPzkYGz-3OwlUFrfTwO2Zf1WB1UPL6ANQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-02-18%2Bat%2B8.57.15%2BAM.pngLast</url> month, a Facebook executive, Andrew Bosworth, made a similar claim, namely that Facebook out Trump in the White House[4]. Bosworth, a close friend of the firm's chief Mark Zuckerberg, made the remark in an internal memo last week.Mr Bosworth said Mr Trump was not elected because of \"misinformation,\" but \"because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser. Period.\"...Bosworth's note discussed many of Facebook's high-profile scandals, including alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Mr Bosworth told staff that it was not foreign interference that helped Mr Trump get elected, but his well-planned campaign.\"So was Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected?\" questioned the long-time employee. \"I think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks.\" Political manipulation through Facebook is probably here to stay and by \"here,\" I mean the planet earth. ZDNet[5] Tuesday: \"Facebook has called out the Singapore government for its use of the country's Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act to block access to a page on the social networking platform. The move goes against an earlier pledge that the legislation will not be used to censor voices, says the US internet giant.Singapore's Ministry of Communications and Information on Monday instructed Facebook to block access to the States Times Review page, after the latter repeatedly refused to comply with previous directives issued under POFMA. The 'disabling' order, outlined under Section 34 of the Act, requires Facebook to disable access for local users.The order came two days after the ministry served a directive for the STR page on Facebook to be tagged a 'Declared Online Location.' This required the author of the page, Alex Tan, to publish a notice on the page stating it had 'a history of communicating falsehoods.' The order, which was to take effect from February 16, was not complied with, prompting the directive for Facebook to block access to the page.The page is no longer accessible in Singapore... In defending the decision to issue the disabling order against the STR page, Minister for Communications and Information S. Iswaran said the government needed to 'act swiftly' against falsehoods amidst the coronavirus outbreak. 'Because if we don't, then these falsehoods can cause anxiety, fear, and even panic,' the minister said Tuesday during a media doorstop.\"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QMZ9CxCybBc/XkzER4mpyhI/AAAAAAABu14/V6o2byQicgIPTQUQIf35AhpEuq6YlGddwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/ERFyi9_WsAIV68K.jpeg\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QMZ9CxCybBc/XkzER4mpyhI/AAAAAAABu14/V6o2byQicgIPTQUQIf35AhpEuq6YlGddwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/ERFyi9_WsAIV68K.jpeg</url> Republican oligarch Michael Bloomberg has been spending a million dollars per day on manipulative Facebook ads that seem to be working very well for him.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IR57DJhA_5k/XkwiT-UcqOI/AAAAAAABu04/cgIjil7ErcEB6XhgiMGA8Jim7vBqRWPzwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/george_soros_michael_bloomberg.jpg\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IR57DJhA_5k/XkwiT-UcqOI/AAAAAAABu04/cgIjil7ErcEB6XhgiMGA8Jim7vBqRWPzwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/george_soros_michael_bloomberg.jpg</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88f6875a-519d-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f\">https://www.ft.com/content/88f6875a-519d-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/602ec7ec-4f18-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5\">https://www.ft.com/content/602ec7ec-4f18-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/stephaniefishm4/status/899662239191388164?s=11\">https://twitter.com/stephaniefishm4/status/899662239191388164?s=11</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51034641\">https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51034641</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-deeply-concerned-about-singapore-directive-to-block-access/\">https://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-deeply-concerned-about-singapore-directive-to-block-access/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DOWT109308158216092891225876100127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DOWT-7597</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7X-H731-JCMN-Y53F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"964\"/><timeReceived>1:08 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>DownWithTyranny</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That realization suffused the inaugural Women in Data Science Conference at Stanford. The daylong event brought leading academic researchers together with 400 attendees from 80 companies and 30 academic institutions to survey the promise and problems of this burgeoning field. \"Solutions to the challenges of our future increasingly link back to data and data science,\" said Stanford Engineering Dean Persis Drell in her opening remarks. Finding those solutions, she said, will also require diversity of thought, approaches, and styles, and, ultimately, of teams. \"We can't afford to live in a society that in subtle and not-so-subtle ways actually discourages half the population from careers in this exciting field,\" Drell said.</p><p>Sharing the opening stage with Drell was conference organizer Margot Gerritsen, associate professor of energy resources engineering at Stanford and director of the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering. Gerritsen amplified Drell's remarks, saying: \"Data science is a very rapidly growing field of increasing importance. So much research and business decisions are based on data. If we want to ask all of the right questions and analyze all aspects of a problem, we need diversity and multidisciplinary thinking.\"</p><p>In talks on topics ranging from precision medicine to personalized entertainment, and from data-driven marketplace design to the challenges of cybersecurity, the speakers, all prominent women in the field, demonstrated how, as Intel's Diane Bryant put it, \"data analytics is going to transform all industries.\"</p><p>Here are several insights that emerged from this daylong exploration of our unprecedented ability to harness the power of data.</p><p>The revolution in personalized medicine</p><p>In one of its most promising applications, data science is transforming the way we understand and treat disease, several of the speakers agreed.</p><p>\"Today, cancer patients are treated with a one-size-fits-all standard care approach. In reality, we all have very unique genetic makeup. Diseases have their own unique genetic profiles,\" said Diane Bryant, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group. \"Two people with the exact same advanced cancer will receive the exact same treatment, and one will live and one will die.\"</p><p>Network theory could hold the key to understanding why that is, suggested Jennifer Chayes, Distinguished Scientist and managing director at Microsoft Research. By using data-driven techniques to model gene regulatory networks, computational biologists can home in on proteins that weren't previously known to contribute to dysfunction and identify viable targets for drug therapies.</p><p>\"We know that with cancer, we really want to personalize it. We give tamoxifen to two women it works for one woman with breast cancer; it doesn't work for another woman with breast cancer. It's because these breast cancers are different diseases. They're just showing up in the same tissue.\"</p><p>Indeed, when Chayes' research team applied network modeling and machine-learning techniques to patient data from the Cancer Genome Atlas, a multi-institutional catalog of gene mutations, they uncovered instances of breast cancer that could be treatable with known drugs used for certain kinds of gastrointestinal tumors. \"We're really excited about this kind of personalized treatment in cancer,\" Chayes said, \"and we're starting to look for similar things in a big autism data set.\"</p><p>Data analytics is also providing new insights into Parkinson's disease. In collaboration with the Michael J. Fox Foundation, Intel deployed wearable devices to nearly a thousand people with Parkinson's. These sensors track 300 events per second steps, hand tremors, sleep patterns. This data is being shared on Intel's open-source analytics platform with research institutes across the world, Bryant said. \"We unleash then all the brilliant researchers that have had theories on Parkinson's disease on the treatments and the disease progression but they lacked the data and the insights to prove out those theories.\"</p><p>How data decides what you'll watch and what you'll watch next</p><p>In ways familiar to many, Netflix has helped to raise the bar on personalization. Through deep, granular mining of viewer's tastes and viewing habits, Netflix users have become accustomed to getting hyper-specific recommendation sets such as \"Raunchy Cult Late-Night Comedies\" and \"Binge-Worthy TV Shows Featuring a Strong Female Lead.\" Netflix VP of Science and Algorithms Caitlin Smallwood estimates that members see over 50,000 distinct content groupings in a given month. And it's all thanks to the company's embrace of data-science techniques and commitment to experimentation.</p><p>\"You might think that there's one main Netflix product, and then a little bit of testing on the side. That's totally not how it is,\" Smallwood said, adding that Netflix is not alone among today's Internet products where \"you actually have thousands of versions of your product that are out there at once.\"</p><p>Developing, testing, and refining different recommendation algorithms has been a constant and continuing process since day one, Smallwood said. Each year the company tests around 500 different algorithms, each with multiple variations, weaving data-based experimentation into the core of its business practices.</p><p>Beyond ushering viewers to the next thing in their queues, Netflix also uses a data-driven mindset to inform decisions on which new shows to invest in. When thinking about original content, Smallwood explained, there is little data to consider. But by leveraging the data collected around members' viewing habits, data scientists can build taste-cluster and demand-prediction models to inform the human decision-making process of whether to greenlight a new show. In other words, analyzing House of Cards as if it were West Wing meets Breaking Bad provides a framework to estimate demand for a new show based on the preferences of subscribers who viewed older shows with related characteristics.</p><p>\"It's a fascinating area,\" Smallwood said. \"How do you merge data science with human decision-making? It's one of the harder areas in data science.\"</p><p>How data-driven market design pays off</p><p>The companies that make Silicon Valley hum don't just have proximity in common, said Susan Athey, the Economics of Technology Professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business. At heart, Uber, TaskRabbit, Airbnb, and even Google are all marketplaces that bring together buyers and sellers. And the primary method embraced by many of those companies to improve their platforms and optimize profits, Athey said, is a siren song.</p><p>\"The engines of innovation in all these big tech companies is A/B testing and experimentation,\" she said. To improve fast, Athey explained, these companies run thousands of experiments a year testing one version or algorithm against another, and go with whichever one shows better results. At that speed, there is little time for the type of rigorous analytics that can extract deeper insights and lead to greater long-term growth.</p><p>\"We get so seduced by that certainty, by that clarity,\" she said, \"that suddenly, when we want to start talking about long-term effects and feedback effects and so on, it sounds wishy-washy. It sounds unscientific relative to the beauty of the A/B testing platform. And that makes it very difficult to make any kinds of long-term decisions.\"</p><p>Consider eBay's decision to eliminate seller-listing fees pocket-change amounts that on such a huge platform added up quickly to the tune of hundreds of millions in revenue. \"How do you, as a data scientist, decide I'm going to throw away 200 million dollars' worth of revenue on the theory that I'm going to get it back?\"</p><p>In this case, the change ended up being highly profitable by eliminating the fees, the company attracted more sellers, who in turn bought more when they came to check on their listings. For businesses that run such marketplaces, the key to using data to inform long-term improvements, Athey said, lies in targeting the right balance between experimentation and theory.</p><p>\"If you don't have a good theoretical framework to build on and just ask your data to speak to you, you'll never possibly find what you're looking for,\" she said. \"Your off-the-shelf experimentation techniques, your off-the-shelf prediction techniques do not do the job. You have to really modify the techniques for the economic scenarios that you're in. And that's exciting. That means that if you can figure it out, you have unique value you can bring and you can really make a big impact.\"</p><p>Cybersecurity is moving from an art to a science</p><p>Cybersecurity is a particularly thorny problem because there are no fundamental constraints on the kinds of attacks that people can perpetrate, said Celeste Matarazzo, data scientist and cybersecurity researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. In short, the opportunities for malfeasance are as limitless as a hacker's imagination. What's more, she pointed out, \"It's dynamic. It changes in time. It's not something that once you find an answer, you found the answer for it. You found the answer for that nanosecond and it moves on.\"</p><p>The problem is compounded by the sheer volume of data that moves through online networks every day and must be managed and safeguarded in installations so vast that they're called data farms. \"That's a lot of stuff to look at,\" Matarazzo said.</p><p>This scope and mutability means that cybersecurity is a ripe area for data scientists who bring a new rigor to a field that may have been previously considered more tradecraft than science. In addition to focusing on statistical and probabilistic methods, considering diverse approaches and perspectives from different genders, socioeconomic backgrounds, and disciplines will be key to defending against future cyber threats, Matarazzo said.</p><p>\"Cybersecurity is a naturally diverse topic because there is no usual suspect,\" Matarazzo said. \"If we think of a cyber threat as a cancer, our goal is to detect it and mitigate it as soon as possible. So using automatic data science and data-driven techniques I think is important, along with a collaborative, innovative team approach.\"</p><p>Why have a data science event focused on women?</p><p>A recent study by the American Association of University Women reported that in 2013, only 26 percent of computing professionals and 12 percent of working engineers were women. Greater gender diversity in fields such as data science can bring new perspectives and broader innovation to complex problems. A Harvey Mudd College study showed the important role that women-focused conferences play in increasing the number of women in male-dominated fields by providing networking opportunities. The Women in Data Science Conference aims to do just that providing a venue for learning and connections with leading data science innovators.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1120141826</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J59-6F61-JCBF-S2VM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1882\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"02\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>February 23, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

View original post here[2]. As US stocks have powered to fresh all-time highs, the health-care sector has emerged as a pariah for investors, as burgeoning support for 'Medicare for All' among the Democratic contenders for 2020 - part of an overall shift to the far-left for the party as a whole - has caused panic to set it. All it took was a few formerly moderate candidates like Kamala Harris to follow Sanders' lead and embrace Medicare for All, and holders of managed-care stocks were stuck with a $300 billion loss.  But while the price action in health-care has left thousands of investors frustrated, it's just one harbinger of what could happen to the market depending on the outcome of the Democratic Primary, according to a Bloomberg[3] piece published Sunday.  The increasing hostility to Wall Street and corporate America from candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as what has become a bipartisan[4] push[5] to curb share buybacks (which would threaten corporations' position as a crucial marginal buyer powering the decade-long bull market), threatens to spoil the stock-market party inspired by the Trump Administration, which has established itself as the single most market-friendly administration in recent memory. </p><p>Ultimately, whether any of this legislation passes is irrelevant: A surging tide of support for these 'progressive' policies would likely be more than enough to send equities deep into the red. There has even been some talk of banning buybacks altogether,[6] something that Goldman warned last month could tank the entire market. And it could all happen sooner than many investors believe possible. \"Most people think that they don't have to worry about it today,\" Ryan Primmer, head of investment solutions at UBS Asset Management, said in an interview. \"But we can just look at what's happened with health care as an indication that you don't know when it's going to come.\"  The market's growing unease was evidence in Stephen Schwarzman's comments Monday at the Milken Institute conference in Los Angeles this past week where he warned that the Democratic candidates and their policies threatened to slow the economic expansion, particularly by pushing for a rollback of tax reform. Few presidents have aligned themselves with markets as closely as Trump, who cheers records in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and browbeat Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell for raising rates. His sweeping overhaul of corporate taxes capped a 35 percent rally in the S...00. Not everything has helped, but the image of a Republican-controlled government united in the cause of stocks was one many investors had begun to savor. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/multimedia/api/embed/iframe?id=359e5e03-d827-4439-b956-6abc0c804f0c\">https://www.bloomberg.com/multimedia/api/embed/iframe?id=359e5e03-d827-4439-b956-6abc0c804f0c</url>[7] Another foreboding indication of just how damaging the Democrats' approach can be even without legislation behind it is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's success in driving Amazon out of New York City. One portfolio manager described her approach as 'the exact opposite of what the Trump Administration is doing'. Enter the opposition, its flag borne by the likes of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose condemnation of Amazon.com helped keep it from building a New York headquarters. Stocks may remain near record highs and few candidates frame themselves as the outright enemy of equities. But the episodes are evidence that plenty of Democratic contenders don't view preserving profit margins as a top priority.  \"That really is the polar opposite of what the Trump administration has done,\" said Mark Stoeckle, CEO and senior portfolio manager of Adams Funds, which has about $2.5 billion under management.  If anything, some Democrats view the underperformance of health-care stocks over the past few months as a sign that their approach is working - because it signals that, for the first time, the market is taking the threat of a Bernie Sanders presidency seriously. Not that the candidates are shedding any tears. A campaign aide for Senator Bernie Sanders - who is running for the Democraticnomination - touted the concerns among investors as a victory that signals growing support for his ideas like Medicare for All.  The aide said it shows that investors who didn't consider Sanders a real threat before now believe he can win.  To be sure, health-care isn't the only industry that the Democrats' have in their sights. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie have railed against Wall Street, promised to break up the big banks, raise taxes and strengthen regulations. Warren and Sanders have called for sharply raising taxes on wealthy people and corporations - often calling them out by name - to finance an expansion of the safety net. \"Do you happen to know - anybody here happen to know how much Amazon paid in taxes last year?\"  Sanders said at a CNN town hall last week. \"Zero. All right? Owned by the wealthiest guy in America. That is an absurd tax system, a regressive tax system.\"  Warren recently warned that major technology firms are hurting entrepreneurs. \"The area around these giants are referred to by venture capitalists, investors, as the dead zone because it means you try to start up a business, you just run the risk that Amazon steps in front of you or Google steps in front of you or they buy you out before you have a chance to get started,\" she said last week at the same series of CNN town halls.  Warren has also accused big tech firms of being monopolies that should be broken up (echoing some of the same rhetoric President Trump has used against Amazon). Already, under Trump, the FTC has set up a task force to apply more anti-monopoly scrutiny[8] to big tech. Other election themes bear watching, say bulls. They include stiffer regulation and the breakup of large companies, something Warren is advocating. Herproposalcould see the dissolution of tech megacaps likeAmazon.com Inc.,Alphabet Inc.'s Google andFacebook Inc., which she'scalledmonopolies that harm innovation and small business.  \"Today's big tech companies have too much power \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" Warren wrote in a recent blog post. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\"  Warren's motion hasn't done much to the tech sector. Shares of Facebook barely budged following her announcement \u2014 ditto for Amazon and Alphabet. Butcritics saythe proposal has the potential to be disruptive in a market that these firms all but dominate.  \"You might see Facebook and Google and Amazon try to be broken up. That's always a risk,\" Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, said by phone. \"There's always been this political jargon and fighting and hell raising, so to speak, over the years.\"  Bottom line: When President Trump warned ahead of the midterms that if Americans want to see the market and economy tank, they should vote Democrat, he was - once again - right. What's worse: At this point, progressive Democrats wouldn't even need to win to crash the market. They would only need to poll high enough to give investors a real scare.

And we're only just getting going. In just a century we will go through the equivalent of the journey from cave paintings to nuclear weapons. Technology will transform how we meet our needs for peace, dignity and community. It gives the prospect of the world's population having an instant, global and unfiltered means of communicating, consuming information, forming opinions, preferences and societies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How humans manage this paradigm shift to a connected world is the greatest challenge of our era. Yet we are in danger of being overwhelmed. At a time when we have the tools to react globally, we are failing to use them. We have not begun to truly adapt our institutions to the new realities.</p><p>If we are in the foothills of a truly global, connected civilisation, where can we debate these challenges? The pace of technological change means that the internet has often been something that happens to the global architecture, not a force marshaled fully in support of our collective objectives.</p><p>Denmark has been a first mover in working out how to respond. Casper Klynge was appointed the country's tech ambassador in 2017, the world's first. Already an experienced diplomat, he is now pioneering a new diplomacy between tech and governments. After seven months in the job, I caught up with him at the offices of The National.</p><p>Tom: What exactly does a tech ambassador do?</p><p>Casper: It is about responding to important international trends. Big tech companies are now so powerful: the annual turnover of Apple is the same as Denmark's GDP. That power can be transformed into political influence, a role similar to states. So we need diplomatic representation to deal with them. Technology will define who will be winners and losers in the next decade. We want to help humanity reap the benefits. My day is balanced between dealing with technology companies, countries and international organisations. I travel a lot \u2013 my mandate and my team are global.</p><p>Tom: How does that comparison look in 20 years from now? Is Apple going to be a bigger world power than Denmark?</p><p>Casper: If we don't act, these companies will challenge governance in its traditional sense \u2013 not only Denmark. So this initiative is to exercise influence as a state, and to redefine the relationship between the private and public sector. Governments won't be able to regulate because of the pace of change, but tech can't self-regulate either. We need to work together.</p><p>Tom: Facebook, Cambridge Analytica. This is clearly a moment of self-reflection for tech. An idealistic industry is finding message boards filling with criticisms. Does dialogue go the other way? Will Microsoft send ambassadors to capitals? Will Google have a place on the UN Security Council?</p><p>Casper: Big companies have growing de facto presence in our capitals. But this is about bringing back diplomacy to its roots, and into the headquarters of these companies. Not only in Silicon Valley \u2013 also in Beijing, Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Europe. We press them to assume a responsibility proportional to their influence. How do we create a digital dividend, not a digital divide?</p><p>Tom: Is Silicon Valley a hardship posting compared to Afghanistan? How receptive are they?</p><p>Casper: I have been trying to convince my colleagues in Copenhagen that California is a hard posting. We hope other countries will follow. It is not easy: we have been met with scepticism about what we are trying to achieve. But once we explain the broad agenda, from cyber security to online terrorism, there is more interest.</p><p>Tom: Diplomats speak truth to power. You have tough conversations with the Googles and Facebooks. But what is your message to governments about how to engage global tech?</p><p>Casper: It cannot be monothematic or purely commercial. Advanced machine learning, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, gene-modifying: those are existential issues for countries. You don't need a tech ambassador, but we do need a tech dialogue.</p><p>Tom: For you not to be the last tech ambassador, what does success look like?</p><p>Casper: Creating a coalition of other countries, international organisations, civil society and tech to really dig into these issues. Making the companies more accountable, more responsible. Applying traditional diplomatic tools to this new industry. And trying to talk the talk ourselves: to use new technologies for our humanitarian agenda, blockchain on fighting corruption, big data on migration flows. How do we prepare Danish society for the digital age?</p><p>Tom: Many of the rules to govern global politics were forged after the Second World War: the creation of the UN, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Can these rules keep up or will be need to start again as we balance liberty and security online?</p><p>Casper: That is the million-dollar question. Can we govern as the last 60 years? Can a Geneva Convention apply to a digital age where cyber-attacks are as damaging as conventional warfare? Big tech themselves are proposing new international norms.</p><p>Tom: You have been here meeting future tech ambassadors at the Emirates Diplomatic Academy, the Ministers for Artificial Intelligence and Happiness. What role can the UAE play in this ecosystem?</p><p>Casper: We have been impressed by the UAE's political vision in appointing the world's first AI Minister. At the UN, we hope Denmark and UAE can cooperate on the big challenges. Diplomacy will have to be agile; adapt; think out of the box; build new partnerships.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/84/152535632710.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/84/152535632710.jpg</url></p><p>Casper Klynge, Denmark's tech ambassador, at The National's offices in Abu Dhabi.

By Aug 5, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 3.3 percent and the S&amp;P 500 index had fallen 3.7 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hit on tech stocks was even sharper. Their fall was obviously triggered by the trade war, but also reflects fundamental underlying weaknesses in US tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple's share price fell almost 8 percent from Aug 1 to the market close on Aug 5. In the same period, Facebook fell 6.5 percent, Alphabet (Google's holding company) 5.5 percent, Amazon 5.7 percent, Microsoft 4.2 percent, and Netflix 4.2 percent.</p><p>Since then, it has been a wild ride. The tech stocks have gone up and down following the on-again off-again announcements about tariffs. At the time of writing this on Aug 19, most of the tech stocks had risen slightly so that the net fall from Aug 1 to Aug 19 was roughly 4 to 5 percent. They remain highly volatile.</p><p>Tech companies fell more sharply than the overall economy because of doubts about the continuing sustainability of the high profits they have gained from their monopolistic business models. Over the last five years, the entire rise in value of the US stock markets was caused by stock price rises of the internet-based FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) plus Microsoft. So, the drops in these companies are scary for all investors and for the overall economy.</p><p>These few big tech companies are sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars cash. In 2017, Moody's calculated that US corporations were holding $1.84 trillion in cash, with more than $500 billion of that held by just Apple, Google, Microsoft, Cisco, and Oracle.</p><p>That might seem like a good thing for them, but it's really a sign that they can't think of productive ways to invest all that money.</p><p>This portends a future where the big tech companies are no longer driving innovation.</p><p>The Santa Clara Valley of northern California, better known as Silicon Valley, was known as the prune-growing capital of America as late as the 1950s, but it has dominated the business of electronic and software development for the last 60 years.</p><p>The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America, a new book by Margaret O'Mara, lays out the history of the region and includes some explanations of how it maintained its lead for so long.</p><p>At the end of the book, David Morgenthaler, a leading venture capitalist, is quoted as wondering \"whether the future of tech would be in the Valley at all\". He explained that it had \"reached the outer limit of its S-curve\".</p><p>Why would Silicon Valley lose its leading role?</p><p>First, the most promising future technologies will apply artificial intelligence, robotics and the internet of things to real-world problems in advanced manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare. Any company wanting to master these technologies needs experience in manufacturing as well as in software.</p><p>As its name implies, Silicon Valley was once a manufacturing center. Even into the 1980s, many personal computers were manufactured there. But, for the last 30 years or so, the region has concentrated almost exclusively on software, not hardware.</p><p>Places like Shenzhen, with lots of manufacturing expertise, are likely to take the lead away from companies whose core expertise is creating phone apps.</p><p>Second, Silicon Valley is becoming so monopolistic that it stifles innovation. Until 10-15 years ago, hundreds of small companies there saw opportunities to grow into larger firms. But now Google, Facebook and Apple are so dominant that they either buy potential competitors or devote their overwhelming resources to copying the innovations of the small companies.</p><p>For example, Instagram and Whatsapp, appeared to be a possible social media competitors to Facebook - so Facebook just bought them. Snapchat is a potential competitor, so Facebook has copied many of its most innovative features.</p><p>Instead of aiming to create an ongoing company, most Silicon Valley entrepreneurs now aspire to being bought out by one of the big guys.</p><p>TikTok, called Douyin in China, which is owned by Beijing-based Bytedance, is one of the few possible social media competitors that have survived.</p><p>Except in China, the big US firms have used their market power to prevent the growth of similar firms around the world. You don't find competitive search engines or social media platforms in India or Europe, even though both have great software expertise. One exception is that Russia has used antitrust law to prevent Google's search engine from swamping home-grown Yandex.</p><p>It is sometimes argued that the tech companies provide services free to users, so they must not be hurting consumers. This argument ignores the fact that the Google/Facebook duopoly controls more than 80 percent of online advertising in the US and an even higher portion in Europe. So, they are able to raise advertising rates above those that would be found in a competitive market - thus raising costs throughout the economy. This control of advertising also makes it impossible for a new search engine or social media website to make enough money to get started.</p><p>Amazon's retail business and Netflix have been losing money since they were founded. Their business models are based on relying on investors' capital so they can use low predatory pricing to drive competitors out of business - setting themselves up to take advantage of future monopolistic power.</p><p>And, the big tech companies are using their market power for more than just economics. Tulsi Gabbard, a candidate for the Democrat party nomination for president who has frequently criticized Google, is suing the company, alleging that it cut off her online advertising just after she made a big splash in the recent debates.</p><p>The US Department of Justice recently began an investigation of monopolistic practices by the tech companies, following similar European Union and Australian investigations. Since antitrust enforcement would reduce the monopolistic profits that have been driving the share prices of the tech companies, the recent falls may also reflect these investigations.</p><p>The third reason Silicon Valley's dominance is slipping is that financing used to be more easily available there, but that is changing.</p><p>As O'Mara discusses, the major funding source for Silicon Valley companies was contracts from the US Defense Department or NASA until the late 1980s. Without such government support and government-funded R&amp;D, Silicon Valley would never have developed.</p><p>After the 1980s, favorable changes in tax laws and financial regulations, allowed the development of specialized venture capital firms that became the critical funding sources.</p><p>In the 1990s, more than 90 percent of world venture capital was invested in the US, mostly in Silicon Valley. Throughout 2000-2010, the US still received more than 70 percent of total world VC investments. But the US share fell to less than half starting in 2017.</p><p>Europe, India, Israel and others have created venture capital ecosystems and are also increasing government-supported R&amp;D.</p><p>The biggest tech rise has been in China. A 2018 paper by INSEAD, the French business school, concluded that China's VC market is likely to overtake that of the US in terms of aggregate deal value in 2019 or 2020. Three drivers are behind this growth - government policies to support entrepreneurship, a flourishing private sector, and market demand, according to INSEAD.</p><p>However, Bloomberg reports that Chinese VC has plunged in 2019 as a result of trade uncertainties and high startup valuations.</p><p>The final driver ending the dominance of Silicon Valley is that the developing countries will be the largest purchasers of tech going forward. FAANG products have been designed for high-income markets but have found less traction in developing countries. Instead, Chinese hardware and software are growing in India, Africa, and elsewhere. In Africa, for example, local products are often more useful than those coming from the tech giants.</p><p>The growth of multiple competing tech centers will be a good thing for the world.</p><p>(China Daily 08/26/2019 page15)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/2/156678048712.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/2/156678048712.jpg</url></p><p>a41f726b05111ecd60e40a.jpg<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDLY-152383456</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWY-KRP1-JDJN-644Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411370</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1373\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 China Daily Information.

By Aug 5, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 3.3 percent and the S&amp;P 500 index had fallen 3.7 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hit on tech stocks was even sharper. Their fall was obviously triggered by the trade war, but also reflects fundamental underlying weaknesses in US tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple's share price fell almost 8 percent from Aug 1 to the market close on Aug 5. In the same period, Facebook fell 6.5 percent, Alphabet (Google's holding company) 5.5 percent, Amazon 5.7 percent, Microsoft 4.2 percent, and Netflix 4.2 percent.</p><p>Since then, it has been a wild ride. The tech stocks have gone up and down following the on-again off-again announcements about tariffs. At the time of writing this on Aug 19, most of the tech stocks had risen slightly so that the net fall from Aug 1 to Aug 19 was roughly 4 to 5 percent. They remain highly volatile.</p><p>Tech companies fell more sharply than the overall economy because of doubts about the continuing sustainability of the high profits they have gained from their monopolistic business models. Over the last five years, the entire rise in value of the US stock markets was caused by stock price rises of the internet-based FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) plus Microsoft. So, the drops in these companies are scary for all investors and for the overall economy.</p><p>These few big tech companies are sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars cash. In 2017, Moody's calculated that US corporations were holding $1.84 trillion in cash, with more than $500 billion of that held by just Apple, Google, Microsoft, Cisco, and Oracle.</p><p>That might seem like a good thing for them, but it's really a sign that they can't think of productive ways to invest all that money.</p><p>This portends a future where the big tech companies are no longer driving innovation.</p><p>The Santa Clara Valley of northern California, better known as Silicon Valley, was known as the prune-growing capital of America as late as the 1950s, but it has dominated the business of electronic and software development for the last 60 years.</p><p>The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America, a new book by Margaret O'Mara, lays out the history of the region and includes some explanations of how it maintained its lead for so long.</p><p>At the end of the book, David Morgenthaler, a leading venture capitalist, is quoted as wondering \"whether the future of tech would be in the Valley at all\". He explained that it had \"reached the outer limit of its S-curve\".</p><p>Why would Silicon Valley lose its leading role?</p><p>First, the most promising future technologies will apply artificial intelligence, robotics and the internet of things to real-world problems in advanced manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare. Any company wanting to master these technologies needs experience in manufacturing as well as in software.</p><p>As its name implies, Silicon Valley was once a manufacturing center. Even into the 1980s, many personal computers were manufactured there. But, for the last 30 years or so, the region has concentrated almost exclusively on software, not hardware.</p><p>Places like Shenzhen, with lots of manufacturing expertise, are likely to take the lead away from companies whose core expertise is creating phone apps.</p><p>Second, Silicon Valley is becoming so monopolistic that it stifles innovation. Until 10-15 years ago, hundreds of small companies there saw opportunities to grow into larger firms. But now Google, Facebook and Apple are so dominant that they either buy potential competitors or devote their overwhelming resources to copying the innovations of the small companies.</p><p>For example, Instagram and Whatsapp, appeared to be a possible social media competitors to Facebook - so Facebook just bought them. Snapchat is a potential competitor, so Facebook has copied many of its most innovative features.</p><p>Instead of aiming to create an ongoing company, most Silicon Valley entrepreneurs now aspire to being bought out by one of the big guys.</p><p>TikTok, called Douyin in China, which is owned by Beijing-based Bytedance, is one of the few possible social media competitors that have survived.</p><p>Except in China, the big US firms have used their market power to prevent the growth of similar firms around the world. You don't find competitive search engines or social media platforms in India or Europe, even though both have great software expertise. One exception is that Russia has used antitrust law to prevent Google's search engine from swamping home-grown Yandex.</p><p>It is sometimes argued that the tech companies provide services free to users, so they must not be hurting consumers. This argument ignores the fact that the Google/Facebook duopoly controls more than 80 percent of online advertising in the US and an even higher portion in Europe. So, they are able to raise advertising rates above those that would be found in a competitive market - thus raising costs throughout the economy. This control of advertising also makes it impossible for a new search engine or social media website to make enough money to get started.</p><p>Amazon's retail business and Netflix have been losing money since they were founded. Their business models are based on relying on investors' capital so they can use low predatory pricing to drive competitors out of business - setting themselves up to take advantage of future monopolistic power.</p><p>And, the big tech companies are using their market power for more than just economics. Tulsi Gabbard, a candidate for the Democrat party nomination for president who has frequently criticized Google, is suing the company, alleging that it cut off her online advertising just after she made a big splash in the recent debates.</p><p>The US Department of Justice recently began an investigation of monopolistic practices by the tech companies, following similar European Union and Australian investigations. Since antitrust enforcement would reduce the monopolistic profits that have been driving the share prices of the tech companies, the recent falls may also reflect these investigations.</p><p>The third reason Silicon Valley's dominance is slipping is that financing used to be more easily available there, but that is changing.</p><p>As O'Mara discusses, the major funding source for Silicon Valley companies was contracts from the US Defense Department or NASA until the late 1980s. Without such government support and government-funded R&amp;D, Silicon Valley would never have developed.</p><p>After the 1980s, favorable changes in tax laws and financial regulations, allowed the development of specialized venture capital firms that became the critical funding sources.</p><p>In the 1990s, more than 90 percent of world venture capital was invested in the US, mostly in Silicon Valley. Throughout 2000-2010, the US still received more than 70 percent of total world VC investments. But the US share fell to less than half starting in 2017.</p><p>Europe, India, Israel and others have created venture capital ecosystems and are also increasing government-supported R&amp;D.</p><p>The biggest tech rise has been in China. A 2018 paper by INSEAD, the French business school, concluded that China's VC market is likely to overtake that of the US in terms of aggregate deal value in 2019 or 2020.

Subscribe here[1]. A rapid-fire series of announcements in June foreshadow an increase in antitrust scrutiny of the tech companies that shape our economy. Nancy Pelosisummed it up[2]on Twitter: 'The era of self-regulation is over.' The House Judiciary Committee hasopened an investigation[3]into competition in digital markets, while the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission havedivided authority[4]between themselves over Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, and Facebook. </p><p>TheDOJ will oversee any antitrust investigation of Google and Apple, leaving Facebook and Amazon to theFTC. Google and Facebook are presumed to be the focus. The momentum to do something has been building, and for good reason. Consumers get to search the internet and connect with friends for free. But the cost is surveillance\u2014across the whole web. This surveillance has concentrated the powers of influence and persuasion in the hands of two companies, with the sanctity of our democracy as the price. Congress recently investigated Russia's use of Facebook advertising to influence our 2016 presidential election, and is currently investigating whether Google is partly to blame for the wholesale decline of news publishers in America. Even this is not the whole story. With the companies' revenues a function of sucking up more and more of users' time, their game becomes one of addiction. This may be why, at the World Economic Forum at Davos last year, George Sorosbranded them[5]as a 'menace' to society, and SalesforceCEO Marc Benioff called on countries to regulate them like they do the tobacco companies. But what exactly do we need to regulate or investigate from an antitrust perspective? We know Google and Facebook as 'tech' companies that let consumers connect with their friends, find information, share photos, and get directions. In each of those product markets, Google and Facebook have high, persistent market shares. We should ask why. Have Google and Facebook been keeping competitors out by engaging in exclusionary conduct, as search competitors (like Yelp) have complained of? But Google and Facebook don't only have dominant positions in search and social networking. They make almost all their revenues selling advertising (Google, 86 percent; Facebook, 99 percent), and they have crushed the competition along the way, becoming a veritable duopoly in another critical market\u2014the digital advertising market. Jointly, they control around60 percent[6]of the $129 billion that will be spent on digital advertising in the U.S. in 2019, according to a study by industry publication eMarketer. Even more indicative of their power is the fact that together theycapture the vast majority of new dollars[7]that enter the market. The online ad market as a whole is growing (expected year-over-year growth of 20 percent[8]), but growth is not a market trend. Outside of Google, Facebook, and a few others, the rest of the market, which includes thousands and thousands of independent news publishers (that depend on digital advertising as their primary source of revenue),will shrink by 11 percent[9]. If we are going to start understanding what the competition concerns are in the digital advertising industry\u2014and why these companies invariably cause consumers privacy-related harms\u2014we need to understand how online advertising really works. We need to stretch our fluency with tech language, and better understand how and why, precisely, these companies have such persistently high margins that competition is currently unable to break through. We shouldn't let the complexity of advertising markets blindside us. Understanding the mechanics of these markets is also the key to enforcing existing antitrust laws. How Digital Advertising WorksAdvertising campaigns used to be planned and managed by media buyers\u2014usually 22-year-old, newly graduated communications majors. If that media buyer needed to help a car manufacturer reach men looking to buy a car, she might place an ad inCar and Driver, or in the automotive section of the newspaper. Advertising used to be something you could place, count, then see in the front cover spread of a magazine. But this is not digital advertising today. Digital advertising is automated, data-driven, and opaque in its mechanics. That 22-year-old communications major has had to make way for data scientists, mathematicians, and computer programmers who, behind the scenes, usestatistics, calculus, and linear algebra[10]to optimize advertising campaigns, by micro-targeting users and constantly tweaking algorithms. Does that car manufacturer still want to reach men looking to buy a car? A data scientist may tell them the optimal target is a 39-year-old man, carrying on an extramarital affair, who's on the brink of divorce. They can model this hypothesis (and prove it works), and advertising companies like Google and Facebook can put that into execution, finding ways to home in and target those types of people online. When you go to a website and load a page, in the milliseconds that it takes for that page to load, there are real-time auctions running in the background that determine which ads to load onyourpage. Almost all online ads are delivered in this way, where highly complex auction markets make their money by competing on who can better track users and invade their privacy more thoroughly. The targeting begins the moment you as a reader visit any website. Typically, your IP address, your location, and theURL of the page you are on are swiped from your browser without your explicit knowledge, and shared with advertising companies that run these ad auctions. The goal, of course, is to build as specific a portrait about you as possible\u2014by linking your device with your identity\u2014and cookies are a common tool for doing so. A 'cookie' is a small text file that a site can install on your computer when you visit. The text file fingerprints your device with a unique identifier, or 'cookie ID' (such as 12345qwert). If the website knows your real identity (for example, if you log on to the site with your real name), the company can link it to your cookie (here, 12345qwert) and begin to gain an advantage in determining which ads to load onto your page. For example, if you're on the hypotheticalURL newspaper.com/how-to-fight-melanoma, this probably means you're reading an article about melanoma. Companies might use that information to make a prediction about whether you or someone you love may have cancer. And they most certainly use that info to determine which ads to load onto your page. The prices that any company is able to fetch for its ads depend on two crucial factors: the ability to identifywhois loading the page, and the ability to then connect the user's identity with more information about the user. Imagine a person visits espn.com to read an article about the upcoming Super Bowl. Assume first he doesn't log on to the site, and blocks his browser cookies, so maybe the website he is visiting can't know who he really is. An advertiser can nonetheless bid on the opportunity to display an ad to this anonymous reader. Maybe the slot goes to a beer brand that wants to generally reach people who like football. Perhaps the going price is a $2CPM (cost per thousand) and the ad gets sold at this price (meaning, this is the clearing auction price). But you're not usually anonymous when you're online, even when you think you are. Again, advertising companies might know your identity because you log in, or because you are using a browser that allows tracking. Now it's not simply an anonymous person loading a page about the Super Bowl, it's 'Michael Greenberg,' of Wichita, Kansas. Now, companies can combine Michael's identity with other commercially available datasets in real time. For example, they might stitch Michael's identity with the fact that he makes $1 million-plus per year, which means that they can match Michael with an ad for a private jet service instead of a Bud Lite. The private jet ad might sell at a $200CPM as opposed to the $2CPM beer ad targeted to an anonymous user. 'The exact same ad, on the same website, at the same time, could be worth vastly different amounts to two different buyers depending on how much they know about the consumer being targeted,' explains Ari Paparo, now founder andCEO of advertising company Beeswax and a former Google exec. 'User data is everything.' Advertisers gain an even better advantage when they're able to track what users do as they move from site to site, app to app, site to app, and vice versa, which is exactly how Facebook and Google operate (and exactly the type of information traditional publishers don't have). If a company that sells online ads can know what their readers are reading onothersites, then they can target the users based on that information when the user returns to their own site. For example, say Michael visitsCNBC's website in the mornings and reads about the markets, but visitsThe New York Timesin the evenings and only reads the book review section.CNBCknows Michael is someone who follows the markets, and might monetize his view at a $30CPM. TheTimesknows that Michael is someone who likes to read books so might only monetize Michael at a $10CPM. If theTimescan somehow find out that Michael is readingCNBCin the mornings, then when Michael visits theTimesbook section in the evening, theTimescan target him as someone who follows the markets and monetize him at $30, too. WouldCNBCwant to share with theTimeswhat Michael reads on cnbc.com? Of course not. The two are competitors on the advertising side of the market. IfCNBCis selling its audience of financial readers at a cost of $30, and theTimescan copyCNBC'sreaders and their reading patterns, then theTimescould theoretically undercutCNBCand sell ads targeted toCNBCfinancial readers for, say, $20 instead of $30. But publishers like theTimesandCNBChave no choice but to share this information with Facebook and Google. How, might you ask, does Facebook currently get this data from news publishers that are also advertising competitors? Well, Facebook has a number of derivative products that flow from the social network, including 'Like' buttons and log-in tools. Facebook licenses Like buttons to publishers so that their readers can 'like' and then 'share' news stories across the Facebook social network. But Facebook now conditions these licenses on the ability to track publishers' readers, whether the readers click the Like buttons or not, and Facebook can now use publishers' reader data to sell its own ads. Google, which now tracks users on over 70 percent of the top one million sites, also uses its ability to track usersacross the internet[11]to extract an advantage in advertising markets. Google tracks users via its analytics and ad-serving products, which Google consolidated and rebranded last summer as the Google Marketing Platform. Google was actually thefirst[12]of the two companies to consolidate products under a rubric of privacy. The implication of all this is that the money that Google and Facebook can make selling advertising goes well beyond what other ad sellers can demand in the market. The Big Tech duopoly can track billions of users across millions of sites and mobile apps, creating longitudinal profiles on users. News publishers simply cannot compete with that kind of an informational advantage. But there is another thing going on in these markets that explains the duopoly in the advertising market. When most people think about Google and Facebook, they think the companies make so much money by selling ads on their own properties\u2014Google search, Gmail, the Facebook social network, Instagram, and so on. This is partly true. Google and Facebook also run auctions through which publishers now sell their own advertising. Unlike in finance, there are several auction markets where digital ads trade. Anyone can create one. But Google and Facebook make sure their own advertising inventory (YouTube, Facebook) can only be bought through theirown, proprietaryauctions. Google made almost$20 billion last year[13]from selling other companies' ads. This is why Google today is the largest seller of advertising, globally, period. What Can Be DoneIf we review the history of these markets, and how they evolved, we see how this was not always the case. Think back to 2004, when the social network Facebook entered the market as a privacy-centered alternative to MySpace. 'We do not[14]and will not use cookies to collect private information from any user,'the company's privacy policy of that era proudly assured its fledgling community of college students. For ten years, competition in the social-network market constrained Facebook's ability to surveil users across the sites of other news publishers to juice Facebook's internal ad targeting. For example, when Facebook tried to start tracking users outside of Facebook itself in 2007,consumers pushed back strongly[15], and Facebook retreated. It was competition that held Facebook back and protected the privacy of both users and news publishers. Even in 2007, MySpace still hadtwice as many[16]users as Facebook. And it wasn't just Facebook that was mindful of user privacy in a competitive market. Reflecting on how this dynamic similarly constrained MySpace in 2007, an industry analystcommented[17]toCNNMoney: 'News Corp. and Fox [which purchased MySpace in 2005[18]] recognize the importance of allowing people to be alone with their friends so they do not feel like they are being looked at by Big Brother. They understand how many competitors they have nipping at their heels right now, so they are doing everything they can not to alienate their users.' But after other social networks folded, Facebook's power grew. In June of 2014, Google announced it wouldpull its social network competitor Orkut[19]from the market, and that same month, Facebook announced it would start tracking users on millions of other sites and apps, including news sites. It was at this moment that for Facebook, the monopoly began and consumer privacy took a precipitous decline. This history is why I made thecase[20]in an academic article earlier this year that Facebook's antitrust fact patterns here have everything to do with privacy. And their monopoly power doesn't just hurt consumers from a privacy perspective, it hurts competitors in digital ad markets too. What are publishers to do? They need to access this era's only major social network to distribute their content. There are no competitive social networks of any scale that offer better terms. Google and Facebook are rolling out new initiatives to seem better about privacy, but often these are simply smoke screens using the new language of 'tech' to actively obscure and distract from what they are really doing and how they really make their money. Take Mark Zuckerberg'sannouncement in March[21]that Facebook's new focus would be to build a 'privacy-focused messaging and social networking platform.' The word 'privacy' appears 22 times in Zuckerberg's 3,000-plus word post. We are led to believe Facebook's future is about privacy because it will encrypt more messages that consumers send to each other. But the encryption of conversations is a distraction. Facebook still uses the metadata of those communications (whom you called, when, from what location) to track and target consumers for advertising purposes. If we are concerned about reining in Facebook's power to influence, encrypting messages doesn't do that. The language of distraction can also push through a merger. When Facebook made their case to regulators to approve the Instagram acquisition, they said Instagram was not a competitor, it was a photo-sharing site for smartphones (even though internally Facebook wastalking about acquiring Instagram[22]to eliminate competition). 'It takes years of education to reach a conclusion this absurd; every teenager knew that Instagram was taking users from Facebook,' says Tim Wu, a frequent critic of tech monopolies and author ofThe Curse of Bigness. But the strategy of distracting to gain advantage is working. The advertising industry has gone through a cataclysmic technological metamorphosis, and it is not just older politicians who are struggling to keep up with the change. Some of the biggest players at the brute end of this are the advertising holding companies, the big four publicly traded conglomerates that own advertising agencies globally, and control the marketing budgets of the largest brands in the world. They include my former employer WPP, and Publicis, IPG, and Omnicom, and they control the decisioning and budgets of the likes of the U.S. Army, Ford, Daimler AG, Volkswagen, Mars, and countless others. Internally, these companies have to grapple with finding new relevant talent, and re-educating their workforce. Over the last two years, we've seensignificant declines[23]in their market caps. The upstart companies in Silicon Valley have found their competitive advantage usurping the privacy of a citizenry at large, and the benefits of this usurpation funnel to a small tech elite based on the coasts. While consumers benefit from these 'free' products, there are questions about the structure of these new economies. Facebook and Google are incentivized to make their platform as addictive as possible, so they can gather more data, and sell more ads. The average American now spends almost an hour per day on Facebook properties. But the U.S. economy also struggles with productivity declines and wage stagnation. One way to unhook Facebook and Google's business model over the public at large is through more competition. That's why antitrust has been the focus of conversation in the U.S. and across the globe. Consumers can pay for ad-free video subscription services like Spotify Premium or Hulu\u2014why can't they in search or social networking? Why are these markets stuck? An antitrust investigation or lawsuit could result in a specific order, with Google and Facebook being rendered unable to track consumers across the web without their opt-in consent. Such an antitrust remedy could rein in Google and Facebook's power in digital advertising markets far more quickly and drastically than could breakup alone. Legislation could separately deal with the privacy problem. Senator Josh Hawley hasproposed a 'Do Not Track' list[24]that would prevent companies like Google and Facebook from tracking an individual's online activities, and from creating profiles of those individuals from various datasets. Users who opt in to the Do Not Track list could not be discriminated against with diminished services from the platforms. Once we lift the hood on how Google and Facebook make money, and better understand how digital advertising markets tick, the competition issues that need to be examined under antitrust law become clear. When theFTC cleared Google's acquisition of DoubleClick in 2007, theFTC largely brushed off privacy issues on the grounds that competition policy was not the right place for privacy concerns. But if we understand that user identity and user data are drivers of ad pricing, and that the terms that Google and Facebook are able to extract from independent publishers drive the health of the wider news ecosystem, it is impossible to continue to make this argument today.

With customers\u2019 needs having changed almost overnight to comply with social distancing guidelines, the industry must now shift its sights to innovating for the future. But focusing solely on meeting the short-term needs of customers would be a missed opportunity; banks seeking opportunity in the challenges of today will be using this new, more digital-dependent retail banking landscape as a springboard to reimagine their entire customer journey. Successful initiatives will drive cost savings, a sharper competitive edge, and, importantly, the best possible service for customers.  Existing technologies lay the path ahead  Those who question why banks have been facing competition from challengers and lean fintechs for years need look no further than their existing tech offerings. New disruptors have built their service models with technology at the centre, combining agility and efficiency into their service as standard. High street banks and their legacy tech have lagged behind.  The shape of face-to-face service is shifting as we move out of lockdown, stripping traditional banks of one of their key retail banking USPs. Now, they must look to migrate these services \u2013 seamlessly \u2013 onto digital channels to meet their customers\u2019 needs. But doing this alone is essentially playing catch-up. Getting ahead means looking beyond the horizon.  Consider contactless functionality in payments as an example: it is among the most significant retail finance trends of the last decade. For many card users, contactless payments have become the norm. Yet the potential for contactless functionality extends far beyond payments; contactless technology is that which minimises the need for human interaction and intervention. With this in mind, the technology already exists to make the entire retail banking customer journey contactless. Payments is just a small part of this.  One group which stands to benefit greatly from contactless retail banking services is small business owners. By pre-staging transactions, the need for those making business cash deposits to go to a branch during opening hours \u2013 potentially detracting valuable time away from trading hours \u2013 diminishes. Using an app, business owners can have their deposit pre-authorised, with a code confirming the request that is then used at a deposit-taking ATM (which runs 24/7) to identify and reconcile the deposit. The noted contact for the account receives both an e-receipt and confirmation of the cash drop.  This functionality is both safer under current guidelines and more efficient for the bank. And while these initiatives are not common at the moment, we expect to see them trending upwards in the near and medium term.  Digital and personal  We live in the age of the digitalised and the personalised \u2013 and these are far from coincidental, with data making it possible to tailor services and applications to individual customers. We cannot ignore that the majority of consumers are digital natives and are interacting with sophisticated biometric identification every day through their smartphones. Such advanced facial recognition software in such a casual context would have seemed closer to science fiction than fact just ten years ago.  Mass acceptability of facial recognition function is in no small part driven by big tech firms. But what if the same technology we use to unlock our smartphones could also be incorporated into accessing banking products and services? Technically, it can. The technology is primed for usage \u2013 and drives significant strides towards contactless Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes and on-boarding. At present, adhering to KYC in retail banking can mean that customers have to go into their branches to be physically verified. Of course, customer willingness to accept and use these services is key to achieving critical mass usage and ensuring ROI. But, given how Covid-19 is shifting the needle around the use of digital channels, we may be on fertile ground for introducing new innovations for the longer term.  \u2018Portalisation\u2019   Across the financial services industry, platformication has graduated from being a buzzy concept to a widely accepted noun. I believe that the next frontier for this, in retail banking at least, is portalisation. Thanks to increasingly sophisticated and seamless APIs and favourable regulatory tides \u2013 such as Open Banking \u2013 retail banking has the ability to join together software platforms, dynamic and tailored to the individual user. This kind of agile technology gives rise to the idea of the \u2018customer portal\u2019 \u2013 a streamlined, personalised dashboard for customers\u2019 banking information. For some, this could be leveraging the Account Information Service Provider (AISP) element of the PSD2 Open Banking regulation \u2013 pulling together and displaying a user\u2019s bank account information, such as outgoings and account balances, with explicit permission from the user \u2013 to offer an API-powered oversight of a user\u2019s financial health.  For retail banks in particular, a permissioned user portal could centralise pertinent customer information. Consider this: a customer starts applying for a loan online but they don\u2019t finish the application. There is no human staff-member intervention triggered to troubleshoot why the customer didn\u2019t finish. Perhaps they changed their mind, or perhaps they didn\u2019t fully understand the product, or the information required to apply for it. The unfinished application remains so \u2013 because bank tellers and contact centers have no way of finding out that the customer was interested in taking out a loan, unless they sought out support. The digital infrastructure just isn\u2019t there.  But that digital infrastructure does exist. As an industry, banking tends to be quite siloed, and when the digital channels that retail banks offer their customers were developed and deployed, the technology was still broadly nascent. Integration and interoperability over the longer term was not a consideration. Yet banks cannot be encumbered by their legacy technologies forever: not unless they want to risk being beaten out by agile and digital-forward competitors. Centralising the full customer experience into a single personalised portal by harmonising mobile and contact center technology, along with customer, teller and self-service channels could create a more seamless and efficient way of doing retail banking.  What\u2019s more, incorporating data analytics, AI and IoT into this digital offering could provide even more personalised and meaningful insights, such as the best loan product or banking account to suit their needs. The potential is enormous \u2013 but first requires a solid foundation of agile and integrated technology.  New foundations  Creative and thoughtful application of technology is trending upwards across the banking industry, spearheaded by challengers and fintechs. Yet as it stands, the industry is generally slow-moving. Traditional banking models are not agile, which inhibits the rapid adoption of new technologies \u2013 such as those we have discussed here. How can traditional banks inject and accelerate agility into their models?  At base level, it comes down to what banks consider to be the core elements of their business. Is IT central to their growth strategy yet? From the perspective of consumer trust and security, it should be foundational in any banking organisation and integral to the evolution of their services. What will customers need in future? How can technology be used to meet these needs while also driving efficiency and ease across user channels? How can technology be used to reimagine clunky, siloed processes?  These are all questions which require tech acumen and creativity. What makes the road ahead so exciting is that the trailblazers and leaders are yet to reveal themselves. With an effective strategic partner, there is an opportunity here for banks to really drive the agenda for the future of retail banking \u2013 ultimately showing their customers that they are forward thinkers and doers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42663938294</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DT-NN91-JCSC-J3XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1402\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Global Banking &amp;

As they adapt to changing circumstances, they adjust their responsiveness, effectiveness and efficiency. And that is what is taking place across the world as digital technologies transform business models: they are either adapting or dying. But how is this digital transformation happening? What are the risks? And how is Europe doing?</p><p>So it is that taxi firms install new technology to keep up with Uber. Bricks and mortar retailers develop online businesses to fend off Amazon. There are entirely new entities like JustPark, an app that allows thousands of people to make a little extra cash from renting their driveway and provides reasonably priced convenient parking for drivers close to where they want to go. BlaBlaCar is a popular European app that allows people to share the cost of travelling between cities and has the side benefit of giving the driver a travelling companion.</p><p>Closer to home \u2013 literally in my case \u2013 is the service provided by a local utility company to move a gas meter during works at my home. No surveyor came out to take a look. The move was priced and agreed using Google Earth, a short phone call, and a very rapid email confirmation.</p><p>Every sector sees the opportunities. A recent report from Kantar Media, on the 2019 outlook for the advertising and marketing sectors, claims right up front that, \u201cAnalytics and artificial intelligence will finally bridge the ROI divide\u201d. It goes on to tell its readers that AI is one of the greatest developments of our time. This is quite a claim for a sector that has struggled historically to find hard evidence of the value it claims to deliver. How is Europe doing?</p><p>The European Commission\u2019s Digital Transformation Scoreboard measures Europe\u2019s progress. The 2018 report looks in depth at two of Europe\u2019s important sectors; food and construction. It\u2019s a mixed picture. More than 70% of the companies surveyed have invested in digital technologies to improve their production processes, addressing that basic need to improve efficiency and effectiveness.</p><p>The Scoreboard draws some broader conclusions too. For example, it calculates that the internet of things, used to improve traceability in supply chains, could reduce food loss by up to 35 million tonnes by 2030. But the report concludes that although a first set of digital technologies has been taken up, large scale and coherent adoption of newer technologies is still at an early stage.</p><p>One factor affecting the faster adoption of digital technologies is their sheer number. The Scoreboard examines nine key digital developments and their uptake; social media, mobile services, cloud technologies, internet of things (IoT), cyber-security solutions, robotics and automated machinery, big data and data analytics, 3D printing and artificial intelligence. The Commission\u2019s Digital Intelligence Platform is able to take the European digital pulse and assess the popularity of the different technologies. It reveals that after cybersecurity, the two biggest things on the radar in 2017 were artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. Not to everyone\u2019s taste</p><p>But there are problems too. Take personalised marketing, for example. On the face of it, it seems like a good thing: why wouldn\u2019t we want to hear of things we\u2019re most likely to need? Many people, though, find personalised marketing to be intrusive and are uncomfortable with the use of their data in ways they don\u2019t fully understand. Some find it frankly creepy.</p><p>The scale and reach of digital technologies can amplify issues that may not matter in the analogue world. Having friends performing songs at your party without paying royalties is one thing, featuring them on your new YouTube channel is quite another.</p><p>While today\u2019s digital technologies are, to some extent, simply the latest tools to help organisations improve, they are different in a couple of ways. They enable entirely new ways of doing things rather than just steady improvement: more organisational revolution rather than evolution. And the pace at which these new tools become available is faster than ever before. So fast in fact, that many feel it\u2019s not only beyond their ability to keep up, but also that the risk of being leap-frogged is so much higher. What\u2019s holding us back?</p><p>Getting digital transformation right matters for Europe. We need our companies to remain competitive, thrive and grow, provide jobs and pay taxes. European public service organisations like hospitals, social services and schools need to be as efficient as possible if they are to have any chance of meeting rising demand with fewer resources.</p><p>Of course, it is not just Europe that is benefitting from digital transformation. The developing world has many examples of digital progress too: these include innovations for digital currency and for shortening times to market for small food producers.</p><p>Change creates winners and losers. Some win because they have used digital technology to provide a better product or service or because improved efficiency means they can offer a lower price.</p><p>This is how markets and competition work. The creative sector has a long relationship with technology. The BBC was created by radio manufacturers who realised that no-one would buy a radio just because it looked good. People wanted something to listen to. Today the two sectors \u2013 broadcasting and equipment manufacturing - are often at loggerheads but still need each other badly. This relationship got more difficult the bigger the scale became. Amplifying fault lines</p><p>Digital transformation has turned a couple of the weaknesses of the system into potentially serious problems.</p><p>Firstly, although it\u2019s inevitable that laws and regulations lag behind technological change, policymakers should be watching developments closely. It takes time and careful monitoring and analysis to comprehend the many implications of the digital transformation.</p><p>For example, following the financial crash of 2008, traditional banks are subject to closer scrutiny by supervisory bodies. Digital technologies allow non-bank organisations to offer services that the average user would find hard to distinguish from those they\u2019ve traditionally received from their retail bank. But these non-bank organisations are not burdened by such supervision and regulatory oversight and the associated compliance costs, and so can bring new services to the market much more quickly. A recent study by Bain had the telling sub-title, \u201cAlexa, move my bank account to Amazon\u201d.</p><p>A second concern is market power. In the analogue era companies gained monopolistic advantages slowly. Competition authorities (and the emerging monopoly\u2019s competitors) learned to see it coming and had time to act before the market was seriously damaged.</p><p>Companies using digital technologies and harnessing the network effect can gain at least quasi-monopolistic positions very quickly. They can effectively destroy a market and accumulate disproportionate wealth long before competition authority processes, designed in the analogue age, can stop them. Loyalty \u2013 what\u2019s that?</p><p>Thanks to digital technologies, we can create organisations that are largely virtual. It\u2019s good that such entities can have very small, though rarely zero, environmental footprints - especially compared to, say, resource hungry manufacturing companies.</p><p>But virtual companies can switch geographic allegiance much more easily, leading to tax arbitrage and ultimately less money coming into the public purse. This in turn puts more pressure on public services already stretched by Europe\u2019s changing demographic and its ageing population. A.I : New opportunities, new questions</p><p>The Commission\u2019s Scoreboard says the general perception of artificial intelligence is positive and optimistic. There is a steady growth in discussions with a stable engagement level. As Andrea Renda from CEPS in Brussels put it recently, \u201cthe promise of AI is easy to spot if one considers two fundamental starting points. As AI lands on our planet, it finds a society that progresses in terms of life expectancy and the eradication of poverty and famine. But it is also fraught with contradictions and inequality, with unsustainable production and consumption patterns as well as deteriorating social relationships\u201d.</p><p>AI not only creates new types of opportunity it also raises some specific questions of its own, such as transparency of the algorithms, ethics, bias and discrimination. But perhaps the question asked most often is what does it mean for jobs? The answer to that depends largely on how effectively we can give our current and future workforce new skills.</p><p>AI has only started to be broadly useful thanks to the ready availability of big data, in combination with cheap and plentiful computing power and easy access to often open source AI tools such as Google\u2019s TensorFlow, Microsoft\u2019s Cognitive Toolkit or Theano.</p><p>The Commission\u2019s AI coordination plan was published in early December 2018, designed to encourage, cajole and coordinate member states\u2019 work on the topic. The AI high level expert group will complete its work on ethics in early 2019.</p><p>Burson, Cohn &amp; Wolfe will produce a second BrAInstorm survey report later in 2019 looking at progress with AI in some key European sectors. It will be interesting to see whether the gap in attitudes revealed by the first survey has narrowed. We found policymakers generally thought that more regulation was needed while early adopters of AI were more prepared to monitor how the market developed and how existing legislation copes. Accelerating progress</p><p>Some would like to turn back the clock on digital transformation, call a halt or at least slow down the pace of change. Clearly the first two options are non-starters. The third might be possible but risks undermining Europe\u2019s competitiveness. Our strategy should be thoughtful and considerate adoption and encouragement while in parallel identifying and tackling the issues, and minimising and managing risks.</p><p>We need fit and strong employers in Europe, developing world-class products and services at the best possible price, paying taxes and creating good jobs. We need effective public services able to meet changing, rising demand for healthcare, education and public security. Digital technologies are, like it or not, essential to achieving this.</p><p>Slowing things down, even if possible, simply delays the realisation of these benefits. We need instead to focus our efforts on how to gain the rewards with as little negative impact as possible. The European Commission\u2019s Strategic Policy Forum on digital entrepreneurship brought together a group of people from diverse backgrounds to consider how this might be done. Cities set the pace</p><p>The Forum spotted early that some European cities had a big part to play and that were doing a better job than others in nudging their businesses down the transformation road. The result is that today we have a thriving Digital Cities Challenge.</p><p>The programme already has successful users of the blueprint we developed. The Amsterdam Metropolitan area is a mentor city. In early December 2018 a group of leading mayors signed a Declaration of Cooperation for Digital Transformation and Smart growth. It emphasises the importance of breaking down silos and increasing cooperation among cities for the good of the people who live there.</p><p>Other critical success factors include digitisation of a city\u2019s infrastructure such as transport, energy and water. This often means adding sensors to the infrastructure to collect and send back data. Successful cities make access to both technology and the big data collected this way easy. Many support innovation hubs and fab labs, centres set up specifically to support digital fabrication. New skills please</p><p>The Forum also looked at the perennial skills problem. Not just how to fill the jobs gap but also how to equip the current workforce with the skills they need to play their part in their organisation\u2019s digital success. Since the arrival of the weaving loom and the steam engine, our societies have changed. They have adapted as their Darwinian instincts have kicked in to take advantage of these new wonders.</p><p>Medical practice today is transformed by new technology and this needs new skills, for example in nursing which today is a graduate profession. And we create whole new ways of earning a living: the digital industries themselves employ over 8.5 million people across Europe.</p><p>Research by Empirica for the Commission suggests that by 2020 there will be between half and three-quarters of a million jobs unfilled. The creative sector has grown massively thanks to digital technologies. It\u2019s no bad thing if the jobs of the future are those that require us to hone our unique human attributes such as emotional intelligence, intuition and judgement.</p><p>Yet although there are valuable pan-European networks like European Schoolnet and initiatives such as French President Emmanuel Macron-inspired networks of European universities, the EU institutions themselves have limited influence over Europe\u2019s creaking education systems.</p><p>Member states continue to guard education jealously as one of their national competencies and even, in many parts of Europe, devolve it to the regional level. A number of education ministers have told me first-hand that education systems are notoriously resistant to change. There is much truth in the assertion that schools teach children about the past and not their future. Take people with us on the digital journey</p><p>A key conclusion from the Forum was the vital importance of taking broader society with us on the transformation journey. A positive workforce \u2013 with some who can act as ambassadors to their family and friends - will only develop if people feel an investment in their personal development.</p><p>Another tangible outcome of the Forum\u2019s work is that sector-specific training and development toolboxes are being built to make it easier for organisations to teach their staff new skills they will need for the digital workplace of a transformed company. We\u2019ll be launching the results at a conference in Brussels in June 2019.</p><p>A third conclusion was the importance of data and especially what\u2019s known as big data. Big data\u2019s characteristics are typically volume, velocity, variability and veracity. Getting value from large amounts of fast-changing sets of data of mixed types and uncertain accuracy is an altogether different proposition from analysing the simple, consistent data many of us have dealt with previously.</p><p>Much of the European political and popular focus on data has been on how to keep data secure and, for personal data, how to ensure it\u2019s only used in the way its owner wants. But big data is a sort of rocket fuel for much digital progress. The forum proposed gathering big data expertise at both a member state and pan-European level.</p><p>The focus should be on how to spread knowledge of the potential of big data for SMEs, public bodies and other interested parties. These sectors might be able to use it in ways that both stay within the new data protection laws and within what people feel is acceptable.. Keeping data and networks safe and secure</p><p>Spies, thieves and data abusers are everywhere \u2013 or so you might believe. But public confidence in cybersecurity is essential for successful digital transformation. Travelling by coach and horses suffered from slow take-up while there were lots of highwaymen on the roads.</p><p>Kevin Mitnick is arguably the world\u2019s most famous hacker. He was jailed for five years after he hacked into multiple government computers and more than 40 corporate systems. He has now put his knowledge in the public domain, and the huge popularity of his books and public talks speaks volumes about the seriousness with which most organisations and crime fighting bodies take cybersecurity today.</p><p>The Scoreboard reports that adoption of cybersecurity technologies is highest among large firms with more than 250 employees. Interestingly social engineering, insider weaknesses and confidence tricking remain as big a part of the cybercrime world as they do of the real world.</p><p>Organisations and individuals can increase their protection from cybercrime by following the basics and thinking about cybersecurity in a similar way as do physical security. Fears about cyber safety need not hold up our digital journey. Will the global internet survive?</p><p>Digital technologies can make national boundaries seem less important. But global sentiment is running in the opposite direction. Companies like Huawei have critical technology for the world\u2019s 5G networks that underpin many promising future developments like automated cars \u2013 in fact anything that relies on ultra low latency. Yet it is precisely these companies that are being caught up in the geo-political battleground between the US and China.</p><p>Dame Wendy Hall, former chair of the Chartered Institute for IT and Professor of Computer Science at Southampton University, argues in a recent paper that the internet risks being divided into four \u2013 she calls them the open, bourgeois, commercial and authoritarian internet.\u00a0 In Professor Hall\u2019s analysis, examples of each might be California, Brussels, Donald Trump and Beijing respectively. Wide spread implications</p><p>Europe\u2019s continuing digital transformation has profound implications, not least for the research community. Governments are increasingly focused on the impact of research and seeking clearer demonstrations of its value, nowhere more so than in the field of digital technologies.</p><p>This transformation will require continuing improvements between researchers, research programmes, industry and wider society. International collaboration must be ready to weather the pressures on it. In turn research funders in the EU and member states need to understand that scale and speed is important if Europe is to match the coordinated and massive investment of China and the US. Allowing our research to remain fragmented across member states makes it even more difficult for us to keep pace with these two giants. Failure to address these points will simply push businesses and public service organisations to buy the tools and expertise from market ready US and increasingly Chinese big tech. Time to grasp the opportunities</p><p>Few things are certain in Europe today. But Darwin\u2019s observations are as true now as they were 150 years ago. Europe\u2019s digital transformation is taking shape and is gathering speed. It offers opportunities for most organisations, developers of new technologies and the research community. We need to be ready to manage the risks and reap the rewards.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1533636I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFX-RJS1-JDG9-Y02J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3135\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We examine the current state of the market, how startups and big tech companies are tackling the space, and the challenges they face.        Over the past 10 years, digital wallets have grown from a niche payment option into a worldwide phenomenon, accounting for 22% of point-of-sale spend globally in 2019.    While the trend is gaining traction around the world, digital wallet adoption in Asia is unrivaled. Digital wallets in APAC countries account for 58% of regional e-commerce payments and have surpassed cash at the point-of-sale, according to Worldpay.    Their ubiquity in Asia now presents a barrier to startup opportunity, as big tech giants and payments incumbents dominate certain countries within the region.    In China, for example, the digital wallets market is essentially a duopoly between Ant Group and Tencent , which are processing trillions of dollars in transactions each year. Meanwhile, in advanced economies like Japan and South Korea, credit cards remain popular.    In this report, we use CB Insights data to provide a snapshot of the state of digital wallets in Asia, the startup outlook, and challenges to widespread adoption.    TABLE OF CONTENTS   What are digital wallets?   Digital wallets \u2014 sometimes called e-wallets or mobile wallets \u2014 are consumer-focused apps to facilitate payments. Unlike their counterparts in mobile banking apps, digital wallets typically don\u2019t accrue fees or recycle money into loans.    Commercial versions first took off in the late \u201890s, with PayPal as an early leader. But the technology truly reached the mainstream with the advent of smartphones.     In the US, names like Zelle , Venmo , and Square \u2019s Cash App (recently valued at $40B as a standalone business) have gained significant traction by enabling peer-to-peer mobile payments. More recently, big tech companies are doubling down on their digital wallet efforts with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and WhatsApp Pay.      Despite the many wallet offerings from US-based companies, adoption in developed countries lags far behind Asia.     Plastic cards continue to dominate in the US because they are accessible and familiar \u2014 potential disruptors are up against a well-functioning ecosystem. Merchants have a fairly seamless checkout and consumers are generally kept happy with sticky rewards from their cards. Even new solutions from big tech players work on top of incumbent card networks.    QR codes have also been a significant lever for mobile wallets in Asia, and the trend is even starting to take hold in the US  with popular retailers like Starbucks and Walmart adding the option at checkout.   Where the opportunity lies   Today, Asia is arguably the center for digital wallet innovation. In China, digital wallets account for a massive 48% of payment volume and 71% of e-commerce spend. But adoption is increasing across the globe. Digital wallets account for 32% of e-commerce spend in India, 25% in Germany, and 24% in the US, according to data from Worldpay.    It\u2019s worth noting that digital wallet players remain fairly regionalized due to regulations. For example, Apple Pay is a significant player in the US, but has no presence in India. Similarly, Facebook\u2019s much-anticipated WhatsApp Pay roll out in India has been held up by regulatory issues.     Mobile wallets have flourished in Asia because they \u201cmerely had to provide a solution that was better than cash,\u201d as Lazard notes. Innovation in Asia has coincided with the rise of smartphones and powerful local super apps, which helped Asia leap ahead over the rest of the world.    However, the winners may have already been picked in China. Ant Group\u2019s Alipay along with rival Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay is effectively a mobile payments duopoly. Alipay and WeChat Pay account for 54% and 39% of the country\u2019s mobile payments market by value, according to The Economist . Already, there\u2019s talk of anti-competitive behavior.    Elsewhere, regions like South Asia and Southeast Asia appear to offer more room for startup growth. India is home to 34% of digital wallet deals, followed by Singapore at 19%. This is significantly more than China, which is home to just 12% of deals.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43185833019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60Y8-G331-JCSC-J54J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CB Insights</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 28, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001SJ8</classCode><className>WORLDPAY US INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS541513 COMPUTER FACILITIES MANAGEMENT SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC7376 COMPUTER FACILITIES MANAGEMENT SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And why?\u201d </p><p>No matter how you look at it, the answer is bleak. California has a staggering number of homeless people compared with the rest of the country. </p><p>California\u2019s homeless population last year was almost 130,000, nearly a quarter of the national total, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">federal data showed</url>. Homelessness is also a more visible part of life in California. A vast majority of its homeless people       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">are unsheltered</url>, living under freeways, in parks and on the street.</p><p>[What is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">middle class in California</url>?]</p><p>However, if you look at the rate of homelessness in the United States, taking into account the population of the state or region, Washington, D.C., ranks first, followed by New York, Hawaii and California.</p><p>So what is one thing these regions have in common? Sky high housing costs. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">William Yu</url>, an economist at U.C.L.A., underscored that connection.</p><p>In a 2018 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">study</url>, he examined median home values and rents in each state and found a direct correlation between the cost of housing and homelessness.</p><p>[Read more about how the housing crisis has led to surging <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">homeless populations</url> in California.]</p><p>By contrast, West Virginia has one of the lowest homeless rates in the country, at .04 percent.

And many of those come into play regardless of geography.</p><p>A recent report found that homelessness across the United States is in large part a byproduct of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">systemic, institutionalized racism</url>.

If controlling the flow of data is now the primarymeans of production, then who owns control of data flows? As we all know, the answer is Big Tech platforms: Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Twitter, Netflix et al.As Mark, Jesse and I discuss in our latest salon,The Rise and Fall of the Neo-Feudal Network State[1], these platforms have become defactosovereign stateswith global hegemony over surveillance, censorship, data collection and behavioral influence--what Jesse callsnetwork states.Since the leadership of these private-sectorsovereign entitiesis effectively monarchical, it is also effectively neofeudal:these platforms are private, closed source systems, managed by black-box algorithms hidden from users and regulators. </p><p>This is the acme of neofeudalism:there is no democratic control at all by users or citizens.Source:'Too big to fail': why even a historic ad boycott won't change Facebook[2].Whether Facebook will ever hit upon a more coherent approach to protecting the free expression of the powerless as well as the powerful depends on whether it ever comes to grip with its own role asthe largest censor in the history of the world.(emphasis added by CHS)\"Facebook is governing human expression more than any government does or ever has,\" said Susan Benesch, a faculty associate at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp;#38; Society. \"They have taken on the task of defining hate speech and other unacceptable speech,which is a quasi-sovereign power... and we the public have no opportunity to contribute to the decision-making, as would be the case if the decisions were being made by a government.\"Indeed, despite company executives' paying lip service to the concept of democracy from time to time, Facebook is structurally monarchical.To the University of Virginia media studies professor Siva Vaidhyanathan, campaigners against Facebook need to come to grips with the global nature of its threat.\"The US got off easy in 2016-- the same year that Rodrigo Duterte took over the Philippines by riding Facebook to victory, and two years after Narendra Modi took over India by riding Facebook to victory. Much of the world suffers from all of the Facebook maladies much worse than the US.\"Vaidhyanathan argued that solutions to Facebook's ills cannot be achieved with oversight from above but will require a more fundamental shift from below. \"The root of Facebook is the fact that it is a global intrusive surveillance system that leverages all that behavioral data to target both ads and non-ad content at us.\"Source:'Too big to fail': why even a historic ad boycott won\u20ac\u2122t change Facebook[3].In other words, the lords of Big Tech control the digitalmeans of production, and the peasants and serfs are powerless.That is the perfection of neofeudalism. As Mark and Jesse posit, this has effectively flipped the central states (governments) into the junior partners of theprivately owned network state/central stateglobal hegemony.In response, governments now view the quasi-sovereign Big Tech platforms domiciled in their borders as key allies in the struggle for global hegemony.Hence we are witnessing pushback against Chinese social-media giant TikTok, which as Jesse points out, is indeed a global platform for propaganda just like Facebook, Google, et al.Recall that propaganda isn't just what you're allowed to see, it's also what you're not allowed to seeand also what's being promoted on Page One in your feed and what's been buried on Page 23 (to use an old-media analogy).Meanwhile, these privately owned quasi-sovereign networks are immensely profitable, as they sell the data they collect to advertisers and marketers, including political campaigns. Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook etc. wield more political power and influence than traditional political advocacy groups because their cash hoards are so stupendous.The feedback loop is ominous:as government regulators are throttled or marginalized by political pressure bought by privately owned quasi-sovereign Big Tech platforms, the platforms are in effect protected from any democratic control exerted by the citizenry in their nominal \"home nation,\" not to mention the citizenry they influence in other nations.Unlike the old monopolies like Standard Oil, the quasi-sovereign Big Tech platformsare the media, so there's nothing left to balance their skyrocketing power.As we discuss in the podcast, their control is (in Jesse's term)molecular, so they've effectively dismantled the legacy social-political structures such as working class, middle class, etc.With mass media replaced by Big Tech's data-flow / behavioral-controlmolecular media, political coherence has been lost, and sodivide-and conquercontrol mechanisms are now essentially infinite:any group, no matter how coherent, can be splintered into warring fragments by the Big Tech Neofeudal Nobility.After all, they have the data and they can use it however they want, with no limits or controls by users, citizens or nominally democratic governments.How do we change the leadership of our Neofeudal Nobility, the privately owned, quasi-sovereign Big Tech platforms?The short answer is: we don't. There is no mechanism left for influencing anything in the monarchies of Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, etc al.Meet the new boss, worse than the old boss.You better bow low and pay up, peasant, or your voice in the digital world will disappear just as quickly as your democracy's control over Big Tech.Recent Podcasts:AxisOfEasy Salon #12: The Rise and Fall of the Neo-Feudal Network State[4](1:06 hours)My COVID-19 Pandemic Posts[5] My recent books:Audiobook edition now available: Will You Be Richer or Poorer?: Profit, Power, and AI in a Traumatized World[6]($13) (Kindle $6.95, print $11.95)[7]Read the first section for free (PDF)[8].Pathfinding our Destiny: Preventing the Final Fall of Our Democratic Republic[9]($6.95 (Kindle), $12 (print), $13.08 (audiobook[10]):Read the first section for free (PDF)[11].The Adventures of the Consulting Philosopher: The Disappearance of Drake[12]$1.29 (Kindle), $8.95 (print);read the first chapters for free (PDF)[13]Money and Work Unchained[14]$6.95 (Kindle), $15 (print)Read the first section for free (PDF).[15] If you found value in this content, please join me in seeking solutions bybecoming a $1/month patron of my work via patreon.com[16].NOTE: Contributions/subscriptions are acknowledged in the order received.

Who's the junior partner in global hegemony, Big Tech or the U.S. government? The question would have been laughable just a few years ago, but now it's a viable debate when we ask questions like: which one plays a larger role in your daily life, Big Tech platforms or the government? If controlling the flow of data is now the primary means of production, then who owns control of data flows? As we all know, the answer is Big Tech platforms: Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Twitter, Netflix et al. As Mark, Jesse and I discuss in our latest salon, The Rise and Fall of the Neo-Feudal Network State, these platforms have become defacto sovereign states with global hegemony over surveillance, censorship, data collection and behavioral influence--what Jesse calls network states. Since the leadership of these private-sector sovereign entities is effectively monarchical, it is also effectively neofeudal: these platforms are private, closed source systems, managed by black-box algorithms hidden from users and regulators. This is the acme of neofeudalism: there is no democratic control at all by users or citizens. Source: 'Too big to fail': why even a historic ad boycott won't change Facebook. Whether Facebook will ever hit upon a more coherent approach to protecting the free expression of the powerless as well as the powerful depends on whether it ever comes to grip with its own role as the largest censor in the history of the world. (emphasis added by CHS) \"Facebook is governing human expression more than any government does or ever has,\" said Susan Benesch, a faculty associate at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society. \"They have taken on the task of defining hate speech and other unacceptable speech, which is a quasi-sovereign power... and we the public have no opportunity to contribute to the decision-making, as would be the case if the decisions were being made by a government.\" Indeed, despite company executives' paying lip service to the concept of democracy from time to time, Facebook is structurally monarchical. To the University of Virginia media studies professor Siva Vaidhyanathan, campaigners against Facebook need to come to grips with the global nature of its threat. \"The US got off easy in 2016-- the same year that Rodrigo Duterte took over the Philippines by riding Facebook to victory, and two years after Narendra Modi took over India by riding Facebook to victory. Much of the world suffers from all of the Facebook maladies much worse than the US.\" Vaidhyanathan argued that solutions to Facebook's ills cannot be achieved with oversight from above but will require a more fundamental shift from below. \"The root of Facebook is the fact that it is a global intrusive surveillance system that leverages all that behavioral data to target both ads and non-ad content at us.\" Source: 'Too big to fail': why even a historic ad boycott won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change Facebook. In other words, the lords of Big Tech control the digital means of production, and the peasants and serfs are powerless. That is the perfection of neofeudalism. As Mark and Jesse posit, this has effectively flipped the central states (governments) into the junior partners of the privately owned network state/central state global hegemony. In response, governments now view the quasi-sovereign Big Tech platforms domiciled in their borders as key allies in the struggle for global hegemony. Hence we are witnessing pushback against Chinese social-media giant TikTok, which as Jesse points out, is indeed a global platform for propaganda just like Facebook, Google, et al. Recall that propaganda isn't just what you're allowed to see, it's also what you're not allowed to see and also what's being promoted on Page One in your feed and what's been buried on Page 23 (to use an old-media analogy). Meanwhile, these privately owned quasi-sovereign networks are immensely profitable, as they sell the data they collect to advertisers and marketers, including political campaigns. Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook etc. wield more political power and influence than traditional political advocacy groups because their cash hoards are so stupendous. The feedback loop is ominous: as government regulators are throttled or marginalized by political pressure bought by privately owned quasi-sovereign Big Tech platforms, the platforms are in effect protected from any democratic control exerted by the citizenry in their nominal \"home nation,\" not to mention the citizenry they influence in other nations. Unlike the old monopolies like Standard Oil, the quasi-sovereign Big Tech platforms are the media, so there's nothing left to balance their skyrocketing power. As we discuss in the podcast, their control is (in Jesse's term) molecular, so they've effectively dismantled the legacy social-political structures such as working class, middle class, etc. With mass media replaced by Big Tech's data-flow / behavioral-control molecular media, political coherence has been lost, and so divide-and conquer control mechanisms are now essentially infinite: any group, no matter how coherent, can be splintered into warring fragments by the Big Tech Neofeudal Nobility. After all, they have the data and they can use it however they want, with no limits or controls by users, citizens or nominally democratic governments. How do we change the leadership of our Neofeudal Nobility, the privately owned, quasi-sovereign Big Tech platforms? The short answer is: we don't. There is no mechanism left for influencing anything in the monarchies of Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, etc al. Meet the new boss, worse than the old boss. You better bow low and pay up, peasant, or your voice in the digital world will disappear just as quickly as your democracy's control over Big Tech.

By Dani Rodrik. Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press. 2018. Pp.xiii, 274. $29.95.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INTRODUCTION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How do we get along? International lawyers still mostly focus on international law and institutions in splendid isolation of national law and policy, as if they were a separate ring. Yet the two are inextricably, gravitationally enmeshed. International law and institutions affect domestic politics and law, and domestic politics recursively affects international relations and thus international law. The 2008 financial crisis, the ensuing rise of Donald Trump and the populist right, the decline of the European Union (EU), and the threat of escalating trade wars illustrate the links. </p><p>Dani Rodrik (1) was the first leading economist to highlight this basic point regarding the implications of economic globalization and international economic law for the nation-state and the social contract. (2) In 1997, Rodrik wrote a seminal book with a question mark: Has Globalization Gone Too Far? He warned that it had. (3) Now, in his newest book, Straight Talk on Trade: Ideas for a Sane World Economy, he addresses trade and economic integration in light of the political fallout of Trump's election and the resurgence of nativism in Europe. (4) The book calls for striking a different, better balance--a reweighing of the scales--between economic globalization and the nation-state. It castigates the economics profession for too frequently expressing unabashed support in the media for globalization and trade agreements without necessary caveats, constituting bad economics.</p><p>The book interweaves theory, empirics, and proposals in the tradition of economic pragmatism. It is an important read not only for international trade and international law scholars, but also for those interested in international law theory and method, as well as legal theory generally. It is written in an empirical, pragmatist vein. Its focus on institutions, social context, and the importance of innovative, adaptive practice reflects new legal realism in legal scholarship. (5)</p><p>The book's twelve chapters can be broken down into three parts, respectively addressing the relation of globalization and the nation-state, the role of theory and method, and prescriptions for change in the current crisis. Chapters One to Four introduce the relation of national sovereignty, democracy, and economic globalization, highlighting the institutional choices at stake. Those chapters stress the critical role of the nation-state for social solidarity, economic prosperity, and democratic governance, as well as the risks posed when economic globalization and domestic governance fall out of balance. Chapters Five to Eight address the role of economic theory and methods to build empirical understanding and make policy recommendations. They hold critical lessons for legal theory and legal scholarship. Chapters Nine to Twelve propose what should be done and avoided in response to current crises. Decrying the risks to the \"liberal international order\" is not enough. We must also address the mistakes made so as to enhance policy space for nation-states. Otherwise economic integration could catalyze further social disintegration.</p><p>This Review addresses and responds to these arguments in relation to international economic law and legal theory. Part I assesses the book's first part in light of transnational legal theory, which analyzes the recursive relation of international and domestic law in an interconnected world. Part II examines the second part of the book in terms of its lessons for legal theory from a new legal realist perspective. Part III calls for the combining of economic and legal analysis to address current challenges in international economic law and policy. In particular, it maintains that international economic law should become less of a substitute for domestic law and more of a complement to support domestic institutions in building the rule of law and assuring economic prosperity and social inclusion. The message is clear. We need to bolster healthier democratic polities if we are to ensure better international cooperation through law.</p><p>I. TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL ORDERING AND THE NATION-STATE</p><p>International law and institutions are transnationally linked with law, governance, and social relations within states. (6) Actors and institutions upload, download, import, and export legal norms, and they develop them in one domain to contest and shape those in another. (7) They engage in diagnostic struggles and paper over differences, giving rise to contradictions and indeterminacies in legal texts. Over time, transnational processes can lead to normative settlement at the international and national levels, comprising new working equilibria regarding the appropriate legal norms and institutions to order particular issues. But these processes also spur contestation and resistance in light of competing diagnostics, legitimacy challenges, internal contradictions, inflexibility, distributive bias, competition, and ineffectiveness. (8) Over time, normative consensus can erode so that a transnational legal order declines.</p><p>The term \"transnational\" does not imply the withdrawal, decline, or disappearance of states as major actors in law and governance. Rather, states participate in their own transformations. (9) To understand transnational legal ordering, one must assess the interaction of lawmaking and practice across different levels of social organization, from the international to the local. These processes involve both state and nonstate actors, including transnational capital and international organizations. As states delegate greater public powers and informal norm making to international organizations and transgovernmental networks, they often implement rules of extrastate origin. (10) These processes are particularly pronounced regionally in the EU but are also developing elsewhere, including through trade and economic integration agreements. (11)</p><p>Rodrik's core argument is that international trade and economic integration agreements in support of globalization have excessively constrained national policy space (pp. 13-14). They have done so through a web of multilateral, regional, plurilateral, and bilateral trade, investment, and economic integration agreements. (12) The World Trade Organization (WTO) lies at the pinnacle of trade governance, but it is just the big meatball in a spaghetti bowl of agreements. (13) Economists generally agree that trade liberalization is in a nation-state's self-interest because it raises aggregate national welfare. (1) 4 Yet \"trade\" and economic integration agreements have expanded in scope far beyond the reduction of tariffs and elimination of quotas. They regulate intellectual property rights, health and safety, the establishment and operation of services such as finance, and the administrative process more generally. (15) In some cases, they require the removal of all capital controls. (16) At times, they grant businesses direct rights to sue states, such as through investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), which can chill regulation. (17) Increasingly, empirics show that these agreements contribute to adverse distributive impacts on the working and middle classes in the United States and Europe. (18) In short, these international agreements transnationally and recursively link with law, governance, and social relations within states.</p><p>The problem with unqualified support of these agreements is twofold. First, advocates tend to view economic integration as a one-way endeavor, rather than a question of balance in light of the agreements' impacts within nation-states. This stance is captured in the famous \"bicycle theory\" of trade liberalization, which contends that an open trading system will be maintained only if forward momentum for trade liberalization continues; otherwise the bicycle will fall over. (19) Second, while this approach recognizes that trade creates losers as well as winners, (20) and while many trade liberals support compensating social policies at the national level (although often not with the same vociferousness and urgency), (21) it fails to address how economic globalization implicates domestic politics and social relations, affecting states' ability and willingness to do so. Economic globalization supported by international economic law creates bargaining leverage for capital over labor while constraining states' ability to tax mobile capital. (22) Unlike national law, moreover, international trade treaties lock in requirements that are difficult to undo because they require all parties' agreement, even though preferences within countries change in light of politics, experience, and changing conditions. In contrast, redistributive policies at the national level (including but not limited to trade adjustment assistance) are more easily undone. (23) Technology and changes in corporate culture may be more important factors for stagnant wages, job insecurity, and growing inequality, but these factors are not isolated from economic globalization and trade; they are linked. (24)</p><p>This loss of balance between the unidirectional nature of liberalized trade policy and the lack of compensating domestic policy became salient following the 2008 financial crisis. The financial crisis resulted more from the free flow of capital than trade, and liberal trade economists long warned that their theories did not apply to capital. (25) Yet trade was not wholly innocent. Empirical studies show that it has increased risks to many communities in the United States and Europe. (26) The political fallout invigorated populist politics, playing off nativist, racialized fears and the loss of a sense of superior status in relation to others, such as foreigners, migrants, and citizens of color. (27)</p><p>Any policy is subject to tradeoffs, and Rodrik captures these tradeoffs with his theory of a trilemma forcing policymakers to choose among national sovereignty, economic globalization, and democracy (p. 66). He contends that we can have any two of them, but not all three. (28) We can have economic integration and democracy at the global level, but then we give up sovereignty. That is what Europe has tried, leading to forces pulling the EU apart-most saliently with Brexit but also with the rise of nativist politics across EU countries (p. 76). We can have economic integration and sovereignty, he maintains, but then we must give up on democracy. That was the case under the gold standard in the nineteenth century, when countries adjusted economically through reduced wages, to the detriment of the working classes, who had no right to vote. It is likewise the case of Greece under the euro to day (pp. 68-70). Or, he argues, we can have sovereignty and democracy, but then we must limit economic integration.</p><p>The trilemma model should not be viewed in terms of either/or choices but rather in terms of which balance to choose among them, taking account of the interactive effects between economic globalization and domestic law and politics. (29) It foregrounds the question of how much of each we desire given their tradeoffs. (30) What Rodrik argues is that \"we need to place the requirements of liberal democracy ahead of those of international trade and investment\" (p. 12). If, despite the gains from trade, economic globalization puts liberal democracy at risk, then we need to readjust the balance in favor of more domestic policy space and less economic integration facilitated by international economic law.</p><p>Markets require rules to facilitate economic exchange, create stability, and provide a sense of legitimacy. Rodrik makes the case for the nation-state as \"the only game in town when it comes to providing the regulatory and legitimizing arrangements on which markets rely.\" (31) Economically, the state enables the mobility of resources, enhancing efficiency and increasing productivity essential for economic growth and social welfare. Politically, the state fosters the spread of participatory, representative institutions, giving rise to liberal democracy. And legally, the state creates public order through laws and institutions that reduce violence and uphold the social contract (p. 24). The nation-state is central for financial stability (put at risk by capital liberalization), social solidarity (threatened by growing inequality abetted by economic globalization), and economic prosperity (put in jeopardy by the prospect of trade wars and constraints on experimental development strategies). Through the early 2000s, liberal democracies were on the increase, but they are now under challenge and in retreat. (32) The rise of nationalism promises to bring back the nation-state with a vengeance, but not in a liberal democratic form.</p><p>When it comes to market regulation, global governance is no substitute for the state but is best viewed as a complement. State institutions more likely reflect preferences of national stakeholders and are thus more attentive to national and local contexts. Moreover, national diversity creates benefits in terms of experimentation (from which learning occurs) and resilience for the global economy (when things go wrong in any one jurisdiction). This is a basic point of federalist theory, which--in the words of Justice Louis Brandeis--sees the benefit of decentralized governance where states serve as laboratories of democracy. (33) It is particularly important at the international level because international institutions are even less attuned to local context, given their distance from local stakeholders (pp. 42-44). Global and regional economic integration can lead to increases in efficiency; however, those gains may be marginal in contrast to the risks to social inclusion and democracy.</p><p>A. The Challenge for the European Union</p><p>The EU has gone furthest with economic integration, most notably with a single currency--the euro. (34) In the 1990s and early 2000s there was triumphalism in the EU with its expanding membership and increasing scope and depth of policy coverage, thus combining widening with deepening of EU law. In retrospect, the EU went too far, especially with the euro.</p><p>Rodrik starts his chapter on Europe by discussing the gold standard at the start of the twentieth century (p. 48). Under the gold standard, the values of countries' currencies were linked to the price of gold, so the only way to adjust to a financial crisis was to lower the cost of production, namely through laying off workers and reducing wages. This worked fine when workers had no right to vote, but once democracy spread through Europe, it was no longer tenable. John Maynard Keynes recognized the need to liberate states from this straightjacket (p. 49). The parallel in Europe today is the euro. What has been sacrificed is national autonomy, with Greece in particular having to follow EU dictates for \"structural reforms\" in return for financial bailouts (pp. 60-61). What Greece requires is either massive financial transfers from northern Europe (which are not forthcoming) or freedom from the shackles of the euro. By adopting the euro, Greece can no longer devalue its currency to work itself out of its economic crisis. Greece and other EU members have had to adopt austerity policies as part of EU requirements (p. 269), limiting their ability to apply Keynesian policies to stimulate their economies (p. 62). The results have been draconian. Greece's GDP declined 25 percent between 2009 and 2015. (35) Backlash against the European Union ensued.</p><p>The challenge for the EU is not to see economic integration as a one-way street, requiring ever more regulation at the European level. Rather, the EU needs to find complementary ways of leaving policy to diverse EU members in light of their citizen demands, contexts, and experience. With the expansion of EU membership, the EU needs to provide more, not less, space for national economic and regulatory governance. (36)</p><p>The political cost of the economic crisis hit not only Europe but also the United States, in turn giving rise to U.S. populism that creates new challenges for the EU. As Adam Tooze writes, Obama Administration officials like Treasury Secretary Timothy Geitner may have been technocratically astute in responding to the 2008 great recession by rescuing banks, saving the United States from a great depression. (37) But by propping up capital instead of the poor and middle classes who lost their homes, the Obama Administration opened the way for Trumpian populism and its risks of authoritarianism. In turn, Trump's populism, economic nationalism, and isolationism have called into question the transatlantic alliance of liberal democracies such that the U.S. president now views the EU as a \"foe,\" and members of his administration have openly supported anti-EU parties, creating further challenges for EU institutions. (38)</p><p>B. The Challenge for Developing Countries</p><p>In Chapter Four (entitled \"Work, Industrialization, and Democracy\"), Rodrik addresses economic development. He contends that there is no one way to spur economic development, so diagnostics and experimentation need to be attuned to local contexts (pp. 89-93). There are lessons here for international lawyers regarding law's role in development. International law and legal scholarship frequently do not take account of the experiences and contexts of developing countries, as third world approaches to international law have critiqued. (39) Law needs local buy-in and must respond to local contexts. Transnational transplants of law and policy that do not engage with bottom-up processes attentive to local situations will be resisted, whether the transplants come directly from former colonizing countries or through international institutions. (40) The problem, in part, is that transplants such as intellectual property rights reflect the interests of Northern capital more than local stakeholders. (41)</p><p>The key challenge for economic growth is to facilitate structural change in nation-states. Traditionally, this change has spurred individuals to move from agriculture to manufacturing and societies to build democratic institutions to channel capitalism and ensure that the benefits of economic growth are distributed more broadly (pp. 83-85). Today, however, because of globalization and technology, this path of economic development may no longer be available, pressing developing countries to skip the manufacturing stage and become service economies (pp. 89-90). Services, however, may not catalyze productivity growth as manufacturing did in countries that made structural transformations, such as Japan, Korea, and China. This creates new challenges for policymakers and requires experimentation involving trial and error (p. 92).</p><p>Rodrik stresses that economic development is not just about creating property rights, but fundamentally about institutions (pp. 93-94). Focusing on property rights is not enough, as exemplified when elites profit from state privatization programs, embedding crony capitalism. Economic transformation, rather, depends on institutions and experimentation in light of economic context. China provides an example with its gradual transition toward a market economy, starting in agriculture in the 1980s with the creation of township and village enterprises. (42) China developed new institutions in light of local context, rather than simply taking forms from advanced economies in the Global North. (43)</p><p>A second challenge for economic development is institutionalizing democracy and with it civil, political, and social rights. The advantage of democracy is that it provides input to elites regarding preferences. The historical pattern is that democracy and labor rights come after industrialization, although there are exceptions. (44) Statistically, there is evidence that democracies perform better economically, likely because of the effects of participation. (45) The test case will be China, which experimented with new democratic forms at the local level but where there has been retrenchment under President Xi's regime. (46) This authoritarian turn could impede needed input and create backlash, affecting social stability and economic growth.</p><p>Ultimately, spurring economic growth is an empirical and pragmatic question that starts with diagnostics, followed by trial and error. Rodrik and his colleague Ricardo Hausmann have developed a decision tree that begins with diagnostics of a growth problem, such as whether the key problem lies on the supply or demand side, and then further breaks down possibilities branch by branch (pp. 57-59). This enables policymakers to identify specific problems and adopt tools to overcome them. If the diagnostics or tools turn out to be wrong, then new programs can be started, building from prior experience. There is no guarantee of success. Rather, there is learning by doing in light of recursive processes of diagnostics, policy initiatives, and empirical appraisals. It is an approach that resonates with the experimentalist democratic theory of John Dewey, which is foundational for legal realist theory. (47)</p><p>II. ECONOMIC PRAGMATISM AND THE NEED FOR A NEW LEGAL REALISM</p><p>We need theories and models that simplify complexities so that we can better understand patterns, problems, and opportunities for change. Rodrik builds economic theory in a manner that has parallels to what in the legal academy is called the new legal realism. (48) The new legal realism has two core aspects--empiricism and pragmatism. (49) It builds theory empirically from studying the world in its varied contexts. (50) From these contexts, it builds conditional theory. It then uses methods from which new analytics can emerge and innovations be tried.</p><p>As does the new legal realism, Rodrik calls for a methodology that builds conditional theory from context. (51) Applying the famous trope of Isaiah Berlin, he distinguishes foxes from hedgehogs in economics (p. 157). Hedgehogs search for a single economic model that explains everything. Foxes develop and choose among a plurality of models applicable to differing contexts. The analogue to a hedgehog in law is a single norm (such as freedom of contract) and a single theory (such as a simple rational actor model). An example is the idea that contract law norms should apply equally regardless of context, such as among commercial actors, businesses and consumers, and companies and workers. Legal realists, such as Karl Llewellyn, stressed the importance of breaking down legal categories as a function of context. (52)</p><p>In economics, more foxes are needed, just as they are in international economic law. Rodrik stresses that useful economic analysis requires choices among models that involve both science and craft. The science entails the creation and application of models based on differing assumptions. The craft lies in choosing among the models given the suitability of the assumptions and the question and context at issue (pp. 118, 144). The simple deductive model used by Richard Posner in early law and economics will always come out with the same answer in favor of markets and against government intervention. (53) But as Ronald Coase warned, the world of frictionless markets is a myth. (54) The assumption of perfectly competitive markets is always inaccurate, because of, among other things, asymmetric information costs, other transaction costs, and bargaining power. Much of the digital economy, for example, is controlled by a few monopolists, such as Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft in the United States and Alibaba and Tencent in China. (55) We live in a world that \"is always second-best at best,\" (56) involving highly imperfect institutions. (57)</p><p>The global financial crisis of 2008 illustrated a loss of craft among economists. It is not as if models predicting the financial crisis did not exist (p. 118). It is that the vast majority of economists stuck with one model--the efficient-market hypothesis (p. 118). Problems occur when economists confuse a model with being \"the\" model (p. 142). Models help policymakers assess the world and make choices within it, but the models are based on assumptions. The assumptions need to be adjusted or the models replaced in light of underlying empirics that call into question their justifiability. (58) If they are not adjusted or replaced, they can lead to errors not only of omission but also of commission--where the profession becomes complicit in advancing bad policy that potentially can be catastrophic, as the financial crisis illustrated (p. 142). The economics profession needed a bit more sociological awareness, as does the legal profession. (59)</p><p>For legal realists, a combination of science and craft is also central. (60) Legal craft builds from legal tradition, involving choices among different legal categories, rules, exceptions, and canons of statutory interpretation. Yet legal decisionmakers also must be aware of underlying facts to which they apply legal categories. Just as there are multiple models that must be compared for economic decisionmaking, so too are there multiple legal frames, rules, exceptions, and interpretive canons for legal decisionmaking that require legal craft when applied to contextual situations.</p><p>Rodrik complains about the loss of nuance when economists talk to the public about trade economics, where all the complications hashed out in economic seminars get lost (pp. 122-23), just as legal realists complain about formalist depictions of law as if jurisprudence is \"mechanical.\" (61) Recall the mystification of law when Chief Justice Roberts used the baseball metaphor of calling balls and strikes, as if judges have no control over defining the strike zone through legal categories. (62) In economics, the choice of models can reflect ideological dispositions, and not purely reason (p. 118). Thus, it is essential to pay close attention to the empirics behind assumptions to check for biases in the economic models used (p. 165). The models themselves will not check for bias. So also for law. Legal decisionmakers need to heed underlying factual contexts in relation to legal doctrine before choosing among legal categories, rules, and exceptions in issuing legal decisions.</p><p>Economists theorizing the political economy of trade often focus on interests. (63) Their counterparts in international law are rational choice theorists, including international relations realists such as Jack Goldsmith and Eric Posner. (64) Their work is of great value for calling into question formal and ideal theories of law. But ideas are also central since perceptions of interests change through social interaction. (65) Economics and law cannot be reduced solely to interests, as Keynes famously quipped regarding the impact of the ideas of defunct economists. (66) It is because ideas matter as well as interests that there is no one model that provides \"the\" model; differences in economic and legal models reflect differences in ideas. (67) Legal reasoning, whether of the rational choice or legal formalist variety, becomes circular when a category determines the outcome irrespective of the factual situation. (68)</p><p>At one point, Rodrik himself confuses \"legal realists\" with international relations realists. (69) It is an understandable error given the impact of international relations realists' work critiquing legal liberalism. (70) But legal realism differs from international relations realism in a way important to Rodrik's analytics. International relations realists are hedgehogs using a single model as \"the\" model to understand international relations. In contrast, legal realists are foxes that focus on context and on how pragmatic experimental ideas and action can respond to and, in turn, shape the context. Legal realism is not ideal theory as in the caricature of legal liberalism. (71) Rather, it attends closely to the role of actors, interest, and power in relation to legal processes. Yet, it does not reduce law to power so that law becomes epiphenomenal. Rather, it stresses the parallel role of norms and reason. It views law in terms of the interaction of internal and external, and legal and extralegal factors such as reason and power, legal craft and empirics, and legal tradition and the demand for progress. (72) Law consists of the tensions between these internal and external factors. Legal realists thus reject both \"purist alternatives\" of law as power and law as reason. (73)</p><p>For legal realists, there is thus an important role for reason and ideas in policymaking through engaging law. Legal realists stress the need for imagination and emergent analytics grounded in empirics. (74) Just as pragmatic economists engage with the world to improve it, help stabilize economies, and help policymakers identify means to break through structural barriers impeding development, so too do legal realists. As Justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote, law is subject to an \"endless process of testing and retesting.\" (75) Law develops through engaging with precedent (the analogue to models) while developing and adapting it in light of changing conditions and contexts (the analogue to pragmatic innovation). As new governance-experimentalist legal scholars highlight, problems are solved through iterative processes encouraging learning and thereby allowing new emergent analytics to arise. (76)</p><p>III. LEGAL PRESCRIPTION FROM PROBLEM-CENTERED ANALYSIS</p><p>The empirics today are stark. Inequality is rising and with it a new populism that threatens the international legal order that long provided stability and enhanced the prospects for peace. Europe is in crisis as the eurozone cripples the promise of Europe as a progressive model of economic integration, combining economic growth with liberal, egalitarian societies. (77) International trade law is in crisis as the United States frontally ignores WTO rules, raising tariffs at an irascible president's discretion through authority delegated from Congress a half century ago. (78) Affected countries then retaliate without waiting for WTO authorization. (79) These dynamics could have long-term implications, undermining trust grounded in respect for international economic law and institutions. The trend represents a historic pivot toward increased conflict that could lead to war. (80)</p><p>What is to be done? How do we get out of this mess? (81) A response requires social scientists and lawyers to work together to develop ideas to reform and retool the international economic legal order in ways that win broad public support. First, we need diagnostics to determine how we got here. Then we need to address legal reform of international economic law regarding capital, trade, and investment. This calls for a law and economics that takes account of social and political context and thus the relation of international law and institutions to the nation-state. One then can adopt pragmatic policies to spur economic growth while maintaining economic stability and cooperative trade relations supported by law, all of which requires a balance of national and international rules and authority.</p><p>Rodrik's diagnosis is that the relation of domestic law and politics, on the one hand, and economic globalization or \"hyperglobalization,\" on the other, has become imbalanced. (82) While economies globalize, politics remain local. International economic law, Rodrik argues, needs to empower, and not disempower, nation-states to regulate the economy (pp. 222-26). The risks are real. Although Rodrik at times writes on a more optimistic note-\"[f]ortunately, fascism, communism, and other forms of dictatorships are passe today\" (p. 6)--there is reason for concern. Trump's \"America First\" slogan has a checkered legacy (having been used by isolationist, anti-Semitic, and white supremacist groups). (83) Elsewhere authoritarian leaders have found ways to work within the formal framework of liberal democratic constitutions while systematically undermining the spirit of constitutional democracy and entrenching their power. (84)</p><p>One reaction to President Trump's policies is to highlight the good that the American-created liberal international economic order brought. (85) But one also needs to address its flaws in privileging capital in relation to the rest of us, or the order could collapse. (86) Revolutions in information and communication technology, complemented by trade, investment, and economic partnership agreements, facilitate offshoring of production tasks. As more tasks in the production chain become outsourced abroad, more jobs are at risk. In response, trade liberals have argued for the two-step model where support for those harmed is left to the national level. (87) But in practice the support is not forthcoming, and the backlash continues. One alternative is to increase regulation at the global level. Cross-border regulatory cooperation is required to address common challenges, and it can be developed in a pragmatist vein that complements national regulatory initiatives. (88) Yet, when rules are negotiated behind closed doors, powerful interests, such as transnational commercial interests, are more likely to have input than most citizens and thus can enroll and socialize state officials to act on their behalf. (89) As a result, regulation in the form of global rules, as in the case of intellectual property, tends to reflect the interests of powerful actors and not local preferences. It thus is often inappropriate for local contexts. The opposite approach is to focus on the domestic economy through crass protectionism, as illustrated in Trumpism, which is currently unchallenged by some liberals (90) but could lead to increased conflict undermining international cooperation and risking war.</p><p>The question becomes how to save the international legal order from its excesses. To do so, economists and lawyers will need to join forces in redesigning the rules, just as they did when they created the liberal international economic order at Bretton Woods after World War II. (91) Rodrik notes the case for trade agreements that have been successful in reducing tariffs and instituting the principle of nondiscrimination, but he shows how they have gone much further in granting special protections for large multinational businesses, such as in the areas of intellectual property rights and investment law (pp. 211-12). In the process, because of the great unbundling of production facilitated by revolutions in information and communication technologies, (92) trade agreements have helped shift bargaining leverage in favor of capital in relation to labor, contributing to job insecurity and stagnant wages in the United States and Europe. In just over forty years between 1974 and 2015, the real median income of Americans without high school diplomas fell by around 20 percent and those with high school diplomas by 24 percent, while the incomes of the super-rich soared. (93) Not surprisingly, the political backlash against elites threatens to tear societies apart. (94)</p><p>Prudence dictates a more modest approach, one in which international law does not aim to restructure states but rather to complement and support their policies under the long-standing guiding principle of nondiscrimination (p. 250). Trade agreements should be retooled to provide policy space for countries to ensure social inclusion, such as by integrating policies to combat harmful tax avoidance and deter social dumping. (95) Investment treaties should be modified so that the fundamental guiding principle is enhancing the rule of law for foreign and domestic stakeholders alike (rather than privileging foreign investors), which will depend on strengthening domestic institutions and should be tailored to different national contexts. (96) In the area of capital regulation, states should be granted significant discretion to take prudential measures involving capital controls. (97) In each case, lawyers are needed to help design international and domestic rules.</p><p>Because states adopt policies that can have adverse effects on each other, there remains an important role for international institutions and international law to manage the interface. (98) International economic law can require domestic procedural rules that provide for due process for foreigners and domestic stakeholders, as the WTO Appellate Body held in the famous U.S.--Shrimp-Turtle case. (99) International institutions can adopt transparency mechanisms to cast sunlight on national measures. (100) In doing so, they can provide assurance to foreign trading partners and domestic stakeholders. Overall, the role of trade agreements must be to support domestic democracy and social bargains, while creating mechanisms to manage adverse effects of domestic policy on outsiders.</p><p>With the economic rise of the Global South, there will be growing tensions about how to manage the interface of domestic policies. (101) The key challenge is managing the relationship between the United States and China. Here, Rodrik suggests a different response than many defenders of the current international economic legal order. (102) A common response has been that for the WTO to work, China must become \"more like us.\" (103) The problem with this analysis is that there is no one way to structure economies to enhance their development. The proper relation of the state and the market for development will always be uncertain and contentious. Traditionally, U.S. policymakers trumpeted a U.S. model in which the state plays a minimal role. China, in contrast, adopted a developmental-state model in which capitalism thrives but the state remains prominent. (104) China does not need to become \"like us\" in terms of its regulatory model, nor us like them. What is needed is a diversity of models in competition with each other, with variation occurring in relation to different preferences, development contexts, and experimental strategies. (105) There is no one development model. And a plurality of models will make for a more resilient global economy. As a counterfactual, just think if China had been \"just like us\" at the time of the 2008 global financial crisis, rather than providing a market of last resort when U.S.-style capitalism imploded.</p><p>The key question thus becomes how to manage the interface between different economic systems to protect domestic social bargains. The WTO already contains rules that permit the United States to apply tariffs on Chinese goods when they give rise to injury to U.S. industries--namely safeguard rules, (106) antidumping rules, (107) and countervailing duty rules against subsidies. (108) More can be added, such as specific rules to protect against social dumping. (109) In parallel, as China develops economically, the United States will demand reciprocal market access, bring claims, and retaliate against China where it takes U.S. intellectual property or otherwise pressures U.S. high-tech companies to release it. Yet, the United States also will need to increase public investment in science and technology, as well as in policies for social inclusion. (110) Indeed, while Rodrik stresses the role for public investment in developing countries, more is needed in the United States as well (pp. 250, 254-55).</p><p>Following the great recession's chagrining of the U.S. economic model, the United States should not view itself only as a purveyor of advice to others; it must also be open to learning. To protect against climate change, for example, the government should support the development of clean energy alternatives. China has done so with solar energy. (111) The United States, in response, has raised tariffs on Chinese solar panels, increasing the cost of clean energy in the United States and thus contributing to global warming. (112) In a world of second best where both governments and markets are highly imperfect, the role of the state will vary over time and in context, but it will remain important for economic development, social and environmental policy, and social solidarity.</p><p>International economic law and institutions are essential for states and their citizens to get along. They can enhance consciousness of our shared fates and the plight of others. But international law and institutions will more likely do so if they support broad-based social inclusion at home, rather than facilitate its unraveling. In this way, global markets will be legitimated. Otherwise, populist anger against elites and center-left parties, which became too close to financial capital in the 1990s and 2000s, will continue. (113) If international rules do not accommodate and support greater national policy space, international order could erode. It has done so before. The erosion may come in a different guise, but it will not be pretty.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>Rodrik's Straight Talk on Trade is a model of how to combine theory, empirics, and pragmatic, innovative proposals in a sophisticated but accessible way. Intelligent policymaking, in law as in economics, should be grounded in empirics and pragmatic responses to them. It demands modesty, in which one does not purport to have the model but rather uses judgment in selecting among models. It requires understanding that the national and international are linked with each other and that we need to assess their reciprocal and recursive relationship. It calls for understanding tradeoffs and assuming responsibility for pragmatic action in light of them.</p><p>Such economic pragmatism finds reflection in the new legal realism in law. Both call for empirical study of context, combined with pragmatic experimentalism. (114) In this way, a more resilient international economic order can be sustained, one grounded in diversity rather than a single model. Oliver Wendell Holmes's The Path of the Law, among the most cited articles in law, was a forerunner to legal realism. In it, Holmes maintained that law's future must harness social science and empirics, (115) grounded in experience, history, and struggle. (116) We must learn from our experience, retooling trade agreements so we can better ensure social inclusion. It is by enhancing social integration within states that we facilitate international cooperation among them.</p><p>Gregory Shaffer, Chancellor's Professor of Law, University of California, Irvine School of Law.

I think WTO rules generally can be, and have been, interpreted (in ways that continue GATT practice) to focus on \"nondiscrimination\" as the organizing principle, such that states retain policy space to pursue legitimate regulatory objectives. I also think there are important reasons to address nontariff barriers to trade in order to uphold commitments made through tariff reductions and that the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and WTO Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures can be, and are largely being, interpreted in that way. Cf. pp. 34-35. Overall, however, I agree with Rodrik's general approach and the need to retool trade law to ensure social inclusion.

Trade liberals traditionally lambast mercantilism because of the role of the state, leading to losses in consumer welfare. Today China is labeled the arch-mercantilist. But in reality, there are many different variations in the relation of the state and the market. Nowhere does a pure market alternative exist, and the market needs the state to function. What is frequently called mercantilism, Rodrik argues, can be viewed in terms of different relations of the state and the market. From this perspective, trade liberals focus on the demand/consumer side, arguing that a country's standard of living depends on what consumers may consume. China, in contrast, has focused on the production/supply side through tax incentives, low-cost loans, and input subsidies, together with management of its currency. In the process, it has not done well for Chinese citizens and has reduced prices in the United States for U.S. consumers. But it also has helped catalyze growing inequality in the United States, as U.S. capital has taken advantage of lower Chinese wages and production costs. The interface of the Chinese and American models, in the process, has led to increased political tensions, which need to be managed carefully or both economies and their citizens will suffer.

With irony, Rodrik notes Milton Friedman's characterization of the government as \"the enemy\" when proclaiming the magic of the market, pointing to what goes into the making of a pencil. Pp. 131-32.

It has been seven years since the Austrian lawyer started his fight against Facebook to protect user data. Today, at 30, he is one of the most public faces in the global fight for privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As he sits across from me in a cafe in Vienna, spiky-haired and wearing a black T-shirt, he could have just come from work at a tech company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead, he spent his 20s pursuing Facebook - and the regulator meant to watch over it - in a case that went all the way to the European Court of Justice. His victory caused an international crisis and brought down Safe Harbour, a data-transfer mechanism between the EU and the US used by thousands of companies.</p><p>The recent public backlash against Big Tech has been just that: a lashing out, strong words in editorials coupled with abstract talk of regulation.</p><p>Schrems believes in action instead. He has now launched None of Your Business (NOYB), a nonprofit that will challenge more companies with privacy lawsuits, empowered by the threat of new, fatter fines under legislation that comes into force in Europe in May, underpinning the tougher stance European regulators have taken against tech companies.</p><p>\"Can you use lawsuits to give Silicon Valley morals?\" I ask. \"I don't think so,\" he says with a laugh. But Schrems believes courts can curtail companies' ability to poke around our private lives and wean them off their idea that \"we're Silicon Valley, we know what's right for everybody else\".</p><p>Schrems' journey started when, as a 23-year-old law student, he requested his personal data from Facebook for a college paper. He was shocked to find the social network had amassed 1200 pages everything he'd ever \"liked\" and every private message he'd ever sent. He filed 22 complaints claiming that Facebook was breaking European data protection law, undermining the fundamental right to privacy. Back then, in 2011, Schrems was already arguing that Facebook was a \"monopoly\" that needed special attention from regulators.</p><p>Last month it was revealed that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had obtained the Facebook data of up to 87 million users to employ for political purposes. The firm had been sold the data by a Cambridge professor who had requested consent from 270,000 users to harvest their data for research purposes, and ended up collecting information on all their friends. The professor said he had consent to pass it to Cambridge Analytica, but Facebook believes he did not. Schrems is not surprised by any of this. He had identified the specific flaw that Cambridge Analytica was able to exploit in 2011. \"Now they say it was a hack; back then they said it was a feature,\" he tells me. \"This is exactly what we debated in Ireland seven years ago. If they had followed the law right away, we wouldn't be in this debate now.\" Back then, the Irish regulator - responsible for overseeing Facebook because the company's international headquarters are in Dublin - simply asked it to make the language of the privacy policy clearer, before declaring the arrangement \"satisfactory\".</p><p>In 2015, Facebook made changes to restrict developers' access to data, and since the latest revelations it has pledged more privacy improvements.</p><p>But by far the bigger concern, Schrems says, is how much data Facebook itself holds. \"Cambridge Analytica is the little kids' department compared to what Facebook does,\" he says. \"It shows you these big companies have fundamental privacy issues.\"</p><p>Privacy law in Europe is about to undergo a seismic change. The General Data Protection Regulation will come into force on May 25, weaponising regulators with the ability to impose much larger fines than before. These will rise to a possible $20 million or up to 4 per cent in global revenue, which for Facebook would have been $1.6 billion last year alone. It also allows for lawsuits led by non-profits such as NOYB, helping consumers unite to protect their right to privacy.</p><p>\"If it came up now, it would be the perfect class action,\" Schrems says of the users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica without their knowledge. \"It could ruin Facebook. Under European data protection law, if 50 million people sued for $2000 each, [it could] possibly kill them.</p><p>Even for Facebook, that's an insane amount of money.\" But under the law at the time, it appeared to be compliant. Facebook is now examining more closely what data it collects.</p><p>Part of the problem, Schrems says, is that privacy settings and terms of service are often incomprehensible to the average person. \"How can a user work for 10 hours a day, then go back home and understand how Facebook's algorithm works? I don't understand and I've been doing that for seven years,\" he says. \"The average user is stupid - in the sense that I'm stupid about building codes or how a building holds up. I just walk in and expect that it doesn't fall on my head.\"</p><p>When I meet Schrems, it is only a week since he finished crowdfunding $480,000 in annual membership fees for NOYB from more than 2000 supporters. He is not anti-tech: he still uses Facebook and is prolific with snarky comments and emojis on Twitter. He adopted many online tools for his campaigning, including an app that helps users request their data from Facebook. He is just three years younger than Mark Zuckerberg, the social network's founder, both born in a generation where geeks were recast as disrupters, and disruption was a worthy goal. Both spent their college years on side projects that they believed could make the world a better place. Both harnessed the power of online tools: Zuckerberg to build a network of two billion users, Schrems to raise the money and media attention to challenge it. Schrems thinks it's funny that he has been characterised as the underdog taking on a giant.</p><p>He originally did not even want his name and face connected with his campaign, before realising that for many, he was the story: \"You need some David v Goliath blah blah blah,\" he says.</p><p>When Schrems started the case, he was a classic \"David\" figure, a student with limited cash and little power facing one of the best-funded companies of all time. He first encountered the people behind Facebook when he spent a semester abroad at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley during his law course. In one class, Ed Palmieri, a young Facebook lawyer, gave a speech mentioning European privacy law. \"He was basically saying: 'F..k it, we do whatever we want to and there's no consequence,'\" Schrems says. Facebook contests this, saying that even as a small company it was committed to following data protection law and sought expert advice.</p><p>Shortly afterwards Schrems, needing to write something for an assignment, requested his data from the social network, which is obliged to provide it under European law. He received everything he ever \"liked\" and every person he had ever poked. Even sensitive messages about a friend's health that he had deleted remained on Facebook's servers. He complained to the regulator that Facebook was using Like buttons to track unwitting users as they wandered around the web. He complained about a facial recognition technology that automatically tagged users in photos, giving them no choice about whether they were identified in their friends' pictures. He complained about shadow profiles that mapped the connections of people who had never joined Facebook, leaving them powerless about how their personal data was used.</p><p>Schrems sent the complaints to the Irish data protection commissioner, who is responsible for regulating the tech companies that nominate their Dublin-based subsidiaries as \"data controllers\".</p><p>The commissioner decided to informally resolve Schrems' complaints by handing Facebook a \"to commissioner with a 23rd complaint. The Irish High Court shunted it to the European Court of Justice, which ruled in 2015 that transferring data to the US under Safe Harbour was now illegal.</p><p>Schrems is pleased the decision that bears his name clarifies a key point: mass surveillance is illegal under articles seven and eight of the charter for fundamental human rights - respect for private and family life and the protection of personal data.</p><p>Years later, politicians appear to be catching up.</p><p>Many have called on Big Tech to do more to police their platforms and protect users from Russian disinformation campaigns, fake news and hate speech. Australian authorities are investigating whether Facebook breached privacy laws. And this month Zuckerberg was grilled before US Congress, admitting the company had made \"lots of mistakes\", and offered qualified support for more privacy regulation.</p><p>The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation is the most comprehensive privacy regulation in the world. It includes rules on how companies obtain consent, delete data and notify users after cyber attacks. GDPR's fines make it particularly potent. Commissioner Vera Jourova says the rules are intended to make people \"masters of their privacy\", leading to a \"totally different balance of power\".</p><p>Schrems believes the fines mean companies will have to pay attention. NOYB aims to push regulators to enforce the laws by bringing strategic litigation against companies. It will start with the \"easy issues\" such as whether a company correctly obtains consent, or allows a user to opt out of data collection. Then it might examine issues of \"legitimate interest\": what does it mean to obtain or keep data for a reasonable purpose?</p><p>How long should CCTV recordings hold video?</p><p>What data are legitimate for a credit-rating agency to collect? The organisation also hopes to build relationships with technologists who will be able to track how data are being used.</p><p>Tech companies often gag employees with non-disclosure agreements but a growing number of former staff want to expose how these companies operate. Schrems hopes to set up a \"privacy bounty\" to encourage whistleblowers such as Christopher Wylie from Cambridge Analytica, who better understand how the systems work and often have the leaked documentation to prove it.</p><p>NOYB will be ready to file the first privacy complaints on May 25, the day GDPR comes into force.</p><p>\"Do you have a taste for drama?\" I ask Schrems.\"Why would you wait for a week?\" he replies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AustralianMagazine20180421Main20000366149414</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S4X-6711-F0JP-W43J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1754\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Magazine</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 21, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The NDP spent $99,846.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's the irony: The very platforms the main political parties hope to regulate are the ones they depend on in getting their message out.</p><p>The digital economy has created unprecedented wealth and promise, allowing consumers and voters access to a dazzling array of information, services and products.</p><p>The world's most valuable technology companies - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google (known collectively as FAANG) - have been the innovators. But progress has not come without cost.</p><p>Governments have been slow to implement regulatory changes to bring their laws into the digital age.</p><p>Issues such as policing fake news and content, avoiding taxes, remunerating artists and publishers, contributing to Canadian culture, creating an unlevel playing field for domestic players and legacy media, including broadcasters and the publishing industry, have been cause for concern. Some say Big Tech is too big and should be broken up. Others say what's needed now is urgency by governments to implement regulations.</p><p>The European Union has been at the forefront, legislating sweeping changes aimed at online platforms in the areas of copyright and creating a more equitable market. Meanwhile, prosecutors for 50 U.S. states have launched an antitrust investigation into Google, and Facebook was fined a record $5 billion this year by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations.</p><p>The increased scrutiny has caused public attitudes to shift. A Ryerson Leadership Lab poll says a majority of Canadians want regulation of social media platforms. But critics say Canada has been slow to respond.</p><p>The Star asked the four main political parties - the Liberal, Conservative, New Democrat and Green parties - for their thoughts on the need for legislative reform in the digital age.</p><p>One thing is for sure: After the October election, what the next government implements will affect future generations of taxpayers and chart the course for Canada in the 21st century.</p><p>1. The European Union has imposed stringent privacy and copyright laws on social networks and digital platforms. Do you think Canadians need to have more control over their personal data? If so, how would you propose to regulate this?</p><p>Liberals: Canadians' trust in the digital world is shaken; they're understandably anxious about how digital technologies and data will affect their lives.</p><p>Our Digital Charter will ensure Canadians have the capacity and tools to know who is using their personal data and for what purposes, with clear penalties when rules are not respected, and that they are ultimately the ones to benefit from it. Social media platforms are already subject to Canada's commercial privacy law, PIPEDA, which we took steps to strengthen in the fall to ensure Canadians are made aware if their data has been placed at risk.</p><p>We know more needs to be done and that's why we unveiled the charter, which was characterized by renowned privacy expert Michael Geist as \"a sea change in Canadian privacy law.\"</p><p>Conservatives: Ensuring that the personal data of Canadians is protected is a priority of Canada's Conservatives. Unfortunately, the Trudeau Liberal government has been particularly careless on this front. It's past-time the federal government did something to protect Canadians' information online.</p><p>A Conservative government would take a three-pronged approach to this issue: sensible regulation; standards and education to ensure that consumers can make informed decisions; and strong oversight at the highest levels of government.</p><p>We will ensure that plain language-use agreements are put in place so that companies collecting electronic data must receive informed consent from Canadians.</p><p>We will apply regulatory standards for the ethical and secure use of artificial intelligence and the internet of things and create the Canada cybersafe brand to ensure that consumers know when products have met rigorous security standards.</p><p>An expert committee with industry leaders will define binding cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure sectors and penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>Additionally, Canada's Conservatives will also establish a cabinet committee on cybersecurity and Data Privacy and conduct periodic cybersecurity penetration testing on all government departments and establish performance benchmarks for senior public servants</p><p>NDP: Recently, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada found Facebook had failed to take basic precautions or have adequate policies in place to protect users' information. More surprisingly, Facebook has refused to implement the Commissioners' recommendations, and the Commissioners warn that there is still a high risk that Canadians' personal information can be used and shared without their knowledge or consent.</p><p>Facebook has been under the spotlight for over a year now for their privacy and business practices, from the Cambridge Analytica breach to the UN accusing the platform of having played a determining role in inciting a genocide in Myanmar. That they are refusing to actually improve their privacy policies at the direction of our regulators shows more cavalier disregard for not just Canadian laws, but for their own users' privacy rights.</p><p>This Liberal government's cosy relationship with the American tech giants and their lobbyists means that they always put Canadians' privacy rights second. We need a government that will be willing to implement the all-party recommendations of the Ethics Committee and stand up to the web giants and their disregard for Canadian law.</p><p>It's wrong that the Liberals and Conservatives always prefer to let private companies self-regulate instead of requiring them to do the right thing by putting the safety and privacy of Canadians before profit. New Democrats will prioritize the safety and privacy of Canadians.</p><p>Green party: The Green party believes that all Canadians have an inherent right to privacy, including online. Successive Canadian governments have failed to adequately modernize privacy protection digitally.</p><p>We support the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Greens plan to modernize the existing Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act to the GPDR Standards. We do not believe that political parties should be exempt from these laws and will apply the same standards to parties' collection and use of Canadians' data. We will regulate all tech companies, including tech Giants like Facebook and Google. We will make the penalties severe enough to get all companies' attention, and convince them to follow the law.</p><p>Maximum fines per violation would be set at a percentage of a company's global turnover.</p><p>We will: Ensure companies that are not located in Canada, but are operating here, pay the same taxes as Canadian companies and have social media companies ensure that racist and other discriminatory pages are not allowed to be posted, consistent with Canadian laws.</p><p>Also, all companies that have experienced a breech of their data must notify the Canadian government and the individual Canadians who have been affected. In addition, companies that sell programs or games must allow the buyer to own a copy of the program or game, in the event the company goes out of business.</p><p>We will apply Canadian laws to all digital companies, including those companies based in other countries. We will force them to change their practices, to allow individuals to confirm what data they are willing to allow a company to collect. Canadian citizens must be able to access and download all the information any company has on them and if they want their information deleted, they can ask the company to delete all their personal data and the company must comply. It is essentially the right to be forgotten.</p><p>2. Quebec and Saskatchewan have required online foreign companies to collect provincial sales taxes since the start of the year. This has not happened at the federal level. So far, Facebook has said it will start to collect the tax. Google and Netflix have said they will collect the tax when required by law to do so. An Auditor General report said in 2017 Ottawa could have collected $169 million in GST alone.</p><p>Would you require digital companies who have no substantial physical presence in Canada to collect the GST and PST on sales of subscriptions to Canadians?</p><p>Liberals: We are committed to ensuring that Canada's tax system is fair and supports an innovative economy. The issue of how to appropriately ensure web giants pay their fair share is not a uniquely Canadian problem - it is a global issue.</p><p>That's why Canada is working with our international partners and the OECD to come up with a consensus-based approach. One that ensures every company pays their fair share, while also continuing to foster innovation and attract investment in the digital sector. With this in mind, we will continue to work with the OECD to develop an approach that is concerted, prudent and fair for the middle class.</p><p>(Note: This answer was given before the Liberals announced as part of their election platform that they would introduce a three per cent tax on the income of large digital companies operating in Canada. The party would ensure \"multinational tech giants pay corporate tax on the revenue they generate in Canada,\" according to a statement released by the party.)</p><p>Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren't subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.</p><p>Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.</p><p>We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.</p><p>NDP: The NDP is proposing a level playing field for all, where large foreign multinationals must pay their fair share. New Democrats will stand up to web giants and make sure they play by the same rules as Canadian companies. By taking this bold action, the government would recoup billions of dollars that could be used to make life more affordable for all Canadians, protect our content and culture, save local media, and create good quality jobs for the future.</p><p>Greens: We will tax online companies federally, not just on subscriptions.</p><p>3. In the European Union, some countries have required on-demand video services contribute investment into local content. Legacy Canadian broadcasters are required to put five per cent of their gross revenue into the Canadian Media Fund to produce Canadian content. (The CMF is a not-for-profit corporation that supports the Canadian television and digital media industries to produce original content.) Should foreign online platforms such as Netflix, Amazon and YouTube be required to put a percentage of their revenue into content?</p><p>Liberals: For 10 years, all the Conservatives did for culture was to cut. They ignored the struggles the industry was going through. The result is that our laws and tools predate the internet. We have committed to modernizing them to protect our culture on the web and that's what we're doing. We created an independent experts panel to help us bring the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Acts into the 21st century. Our end goal is clear: all players that participate in the system must contribute to the system. There will be no free rides.</p><p>Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren't subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.</p><p>Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.</p><p>We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.</p><p>NDP: The Minister of Canadian Heritage has failed to assume his responsibility in establishing a framework regarding the rise of on-demand video services. Rather than fixing this injustice, Justin Trudeau and his team went even further by signing a secret deal with Netflix without any consultation and without any guarantee of creating French content. The NDP think that Netflix and others should play by the same rules as other broadcasters and companies that operate in Canada.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>4. Cable service providers have had shrinking revenue in the digital age as competition from online platforms means fewer subscribers. Those providers place a percentage of their revenue into producing Canadian content, and the pot is shrinking. Would you support a move to have internet service providers, who have benefitted from the increased use of streaming services, also make similar financial contributions?</p><p>Liberals: (Same as answer 2)</p><p>Conservatives: We need to take action to review how innovative market solutions can help address these problems.</p><p>NDP: The main focus of the NDP would be to ensure that foreign multinationals are treated equally with Canadian companies and to make sure that internet services are affordable.</p><p>We are paying some (of) the highest prices for broadband subscriptions in the world. This is wrong. The NDP has a clear vision for Canadian arts and culture including: protecting our heritage, supporting key Canadian institutions and providing an opportunity for our Canadian talent to thrive on digital and traditional platforms. We need more Canadian content. For this reason, we will find innovative ways to increase the funding of the Canada Media Fund.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>5. Under Section 19 of the Income Tax Act, domestic marketers who place advertisements in Canadian publications qualify for a tax deduction. But if they placed that ad in a foreign print publication, they wouldn't qualify. But the new digital reality means that if you advertise in the print edition of the New York Times, you wouldn't get a tax deduction, but if you did so in the online edition, you would. This has created an unlevel playing field for legacy publishers, diverting millions to major platforms like Google and Facebook. Would your party close that loophole?</p><p>Liberals: Canada is working with international partners and the OECD to examine the impacts of digitalization on some key aspects of the existing tax framework and to work toward a consensus-based approach.</p><p>Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not. Justin Trudeau has failed to create good policies. Conservatives will have more to say about our plan for a free, fair and sustainable press as the campaign continues.</p><p>NDP: Yes. There are many things that the federal government could and should do now to help solve this media crisis and closing the loophole at Section 19 of the Income Tax Act is clearly one of them.</p><p>Section 19 was introduced in 1965 to encourage advertising spending in Canadian media - but instead it is now being used to support American multinationals like Facebook and Google that don't need it. Section 19 needs to be updated or reinterpreted to take into account online advertising. That idea was one of many recommendations made to the federal government in two different reports on the future of media, released in December 2016 and in June 2017. Many months of consultation went into those reports, and thousands of people were consulted, but the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Pablo Rodriguez, and the Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, have chosen to ignore the vast majority of those recommendations. This can't continue. The Liberals must act now to protect our medias, our democracy and our communities.</p><p>Greens: Yes.</p><p>6. Would you continue to provide ongoing and stable funding to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, maintaining or increasing current levels?</p><p>Liberals: After 10 years of cuts and partisan games under the Conservatives, we are proud to have reinvested $675 million to better support our public broadcaster, in our first budget. We also put in place the first ever independent appointments process for CBC, and appointed accomplished individuals like Michael Goldbloom, Suzanne Gu\u00e8vremont, and Sandra Singh, rather than Conservative cronies. We firmly believe in the importance of CBC/Radio-Canada and of local news in all communities across the country. Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have openly said that they don't like journalists and could axe the CBC News division because they don't like the media calling them out for their inconsistencies.</p><p>Conservatives: When we look and see how much coverage is devoted on CBC to U.S. politics, the inner workings of U.S. politics, making sure that it's focused on the things that are going on here in Canada - Canada's Conservatives think that's something that many Canadians have said we should ensure that it's focused on the core mandate of being concentrated on Canada.</p><p>NDP: The CBC is an essential public service in a country like ours, where minority-language communities require regional news coverage in their own language. The NDP has a proud history of promoting our public broadcaster. In the last Parliament our MPs fought hard against the Conservatives' $115 million cut to CBC/Radio-Canada. We will release our vision for CBC in the near future.</p><p>Greens: We would continue, and expand funding for Canadian culture and the CBC.</p><p>7. If the CBC were to discontinue advertising, would your party support an advertising-free environment, supported by taxpayers?</p><p>Liberals: The CBC is an autonomous Crown corporation responsible for managing its own operations.</p><p>Conservatives: We have to make sure the CBC's impact in that is not creating an undue hurdle against those private-sector entities that are trying to stay afloat and now have to compete with a government-subsidized entity that is also going out into the market to sell ads to get viewership</p><p>NDP: An advertisement-free CBC is a fantastic idea in principle, but it does require further study. The main impediment is the revenue shortfall that would transpire. Current estimate reveals that this idea would cost $533 million annually.</p><p>Greens: Yes, we would.</p><p>8. Do you support federal aid for newspapers. If so, what measures would you propose?</p><p>Liberals: Canadian newspapers are taking a big hit by the media crisis. They have lost half of their jobs since 2010. We are going to the root of the problem and are creating concrete measures to support Canadian newspapers, big or small. Recently, our government announced the plan to introduce three new tax measures to support Canadian journalism estimated to provide approximately $595 million in support over five years. We must protect journalistic independence and that's why an independent experts panel will assist in implementing our investments. Journalism is at the core of our democracy, but Conservatives aren't one to miss an opportunity to attack its independence. The only type of media they're interested in are ones they control, like the Rebel, 24Seven, and Ontario News Now. They are into conspiracy theories and it's insulting to the intelligence of Canadians and the professionalism of journalists.</p><p>Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not.</p><p>NDP: In the wake of fake news, a strong, healthy and independent media industry is essential to our democracy. Our local newspapers have been put in a difficult financial position because of Liberal and Conservative governments refusal to equal the playing field and take away the tax holiday given to Facebook, Google and other internet giants. Our Quebec MPs, like Pierre Nantel, are the only ones who have been demanding action from the government for months. We believe any support package for the news media needs to be efficient, transparent and fair. The NDP will always fight to save our local medias while Liberals and Conservatives are playing partisan political games. You can expect further details in the near future.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019100255851600</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5W-79N1-JBTY-W0MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3449\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 2, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

According to estimates from Facebook's ad library, the Facebook pages of the Liberal Party of Canada and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spent $454,179 in the last 30 days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Conservative party page and leader Andrew Scheer's page racked up $285,031 in ad spending. The NDP spent $99,846.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's the irony: The very platforms the main political parties hope to regulate are the ones they are dependent on in getting their message out.</p><p>The digital economy has created unprecedented wealth and promise, allowing consumers and voters access to a dazzling array of information, services and products.</p><p>The world's most valuable technology companies - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google ( FAANG) - have been the innovators. But progress has not come without cost.</p><p>Governments have been slow to implement regulatory changes to bring their laws into the digital age. Issues such as policing fake news and content, avoiding taxes, remunerating artists and publishers, contributing to Canadian culture, creating an unlevel playing field for domestic players and legacy media, including broadcasters and the publishing industry, have been cause for concern. Some say Big Tech is too big and should be broken up. Others say what's needed now is urgency by governments to implement regulations.</p><p>The European Union has been at the forefront, legislating sweeping changes aimed at online platforms in the areas of copyright and creating a more equitable market. Meanwhile, prosecutors for 50 American states have launched an antitrust investigation into Google, and Facebook was fined a record $5 billion earlier this year by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations.</p><p>The increased scrutiny has caused public attitudes to shift. A Ryerson Leadership Lab poll says a majority of Canadians want regulation of social media platforms. But critics say Canada has been slow to respond.</p><p>The Star asked the four main political parties - the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP and Green parties - for their thoughts on the need for legislative reform in the digital age.</p><p>One thing is for sure: After the October election, what the next government implements will affect future generations of taxpayers and chart the course for Canada in the 21st century.</p><p>1. The European Union has imposed stringent privacy and copyright laws on social networks and digital platforms. Do you think Canadians need to have more control over their personal data? If so, how would you propose to regulate this?</p><p>Liberals: Canadians' trust in the digital world is shaken; they're understandably anxious about how digital technologies and data will affect their lives. Our Digital Charter will ensure Canadians have the capacity and tools to know who is using their personal data and for what purposes, with clear penalties when rules are not respected, and that they are ultimately the ones to benefit from it. Social media platforms are already subject to Canada's commercial privacy law, PIPEDA, which we took steps to strengthen in the fall to ensure Canadians are made aware if their data has been placed at risk. We know more needs to be done, and that's why we unveiled the Charter, which was characterized by renowned privacy expert Michael Geist as \"a sea change in Canadian privacy law.\"</p><p>Conservatives: Ensuring that the personal data of Canadians is protected is a priority of Canada's Conservatives. Unfortunately, the Trudeau Liberal government has been particularly careless on this front. It's past-time the federal government did something to protect Canadians' information online.</p><p>A Conservative government would take a three-pronged approach to this issue: sensible regulation, standards and education to ensure that consumers can make informed decisions, and strong oversight at the highest levels of government.</p><p>We will ensure that plain language-use agreements are put in place so that companies collecting electronic data must receive informed consent from Canadians.</p><p>We will apply regulatory standards for the ethical and secure use of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things and create the Canada Cyber Safe brand to ensure that consumers know when products have met rigorous security standards.</p><p>An expert committee with industry leaders will define binding cyber security standards for critical infrastructure sectors and penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>Additionally, Canada's Conservatives will also establish a Cabinet Committee on Cyber Security and Data Privacy and conduct periodic cyber security penetration testing on all government departments and establish performance benchmarks for senior public servants</p><p>NDP: Recently, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada found Facebook had failed to take basic precautions or have adequate policies in place to protect users' information. More surprisingly, Facebook has refused to implement the Commissioners' recommendations, and the Commissioners warn that there is still a high risk that Canadians' personal information can be used and shared without their knowledge or consent. Facebook has been under the spotlight for over a year now for their privacy and business practices, from the Cambridge Analytica breach to the UN accusing the platform of having played a determining role in inciting a genocide in Myanmar. That they are refusing to actually improve their privacy policies at the direction of our regulators shows more cavalier disregard for not just Canadian laws, but for their own users' privacy rights. This Liberal government's cosy relationship with the American tech giants and their lobbyists means that they always put Canadians' privacy rights second. We need a government that will be willing to implement the all-party recommendations of the Ethics Committee and stand up to the web giants and their disregard for Canadian law. It's wrong that the Liberals and Conservatives always prefer to let private companies self-regulate instead of requiring them to do the right thing by putting the safety and privacy of Canadians before profits. New Democrats will prioritize the safety and privacy of Canadians.</p><p>Green Party: The Green Party believes that all Canadians have an inherent right to privacy, including online. Successive Canadian governments have failed to adequately modernize privacy protection digitally. We support the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Greens plan to modernize the existing Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act to the GPDR Standards. We do not believe that political parties should be exempt from these laws, and will apply the same standards to parties' collection and use of Canadians' data. We will regulate all tech companies, including tech Giants like Facebook and Google. We will make the penalties severe enough to get all companies' attention, and convince them to follow the law.</p><p>Maximum fines per violation would be set at a percentage of a company's global turnover.</p><p>We will: Ensure companies that are not located in Canada, but are operating here, pay the same taxes as Canadian companies and have social media companies ensure that racist and other discriminatory pages are not allowed to be posted, consistent with Canadian laws.</p><p>Also, all companies that have experienced a breech of their data must notify the Canadian government and the individual Canadians who have been affected. In addition, companies that sell programs or games, must allow the buyer to own a copy of the program or game, in the event the company goes out of business.</p><p>We will apply Canadian laws to all digital companies, including those companies based in other countries. We will force them to change their practices, to allow individuals to confirm what data they are willing to allow a company to collect. Canadian citizens must be able to access and download all the information any company has on them, and if they want their information deleted, they can ask the company to delete all their personal data, and the company must comply. It is essentially the right to be forgotten.</p><p>2. Quebec and Saskatchewan have required online foreign companies to collect provincial sales taxes since the start of the year. This has not happened at the federal level. So far Facebook has said it will start to collect the tax. Google and Netflix have said they will collect the tax when required by law to do so. An Auditor General report said in 2017 Ottawa could have collected $169 million in GST alone.</p><p>Would you require digital companies who have no substantial physical presence in Canada to collect the GST and PST on sales of subscriptions to Canadians?</p><p>Liberals: We are committed to ensuring that Canada's tax system is fair and supports an innovative economy. The issue of how to appropriately ensure web giants pay their fair share is not a uniquely Canadian problem - it is a global issue. That's why Canada is working with our international partners and the OECD to come up with a consensus-based approach. One that ensures every company pays their fair share, while also continuing to foster innovation and attract investment in the digital sector. With this in mind, we will continue to work with the OECD to develop an approach that is concerted, prudent, and fair for the middle class. (Note: This answer was given before the Liberals announced as part of their election platform that they would introduce a 3 per cent tax on the income of large digital companies operating in Canada. The party would ensure \"multinational tech giants pay corporate tax on the revenue they generate in Canada,\" according to a statement released by the party.)</p><p>Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren't subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.</p><p>Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.</p><p>We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.</p><p>NDP: The NDP is proposing a level playing field for all, where large foreign multinationals must pay their fair share. New Democrats will stand up to web giants and make sure they play by the same rules as Canadian companies. By taking this bold action, the government would recoup billions of dollars that could be used to make life more affordable for all Canadians, protect our content and culture, save local media, and create good quality jobs for the future.</p><p>Greens: We will tax online companies federally, not just on subscriptions.</p><p>3. In the European Union, some countries have required on-demand video services contribute investment into local content. Legacy Canadian broadcasters are required to put 5 per cent of their gross revenue into the Canadian Media Fund to produce Canadian content. (The CMF is a not-for-profit corporation that supports the Canadian television and digital media industries to produce original content.) Should foreign online platforms such as Netflix, Amazon and YouTube be required to put a percentage of their revenue into content?</p><p>Liberals: For 10 years, all the Conservatives did for culture was to cut. They ignored the struggles the industry was going through. The result is that our laws and tools predate the internet. We have committed to modernizing them to protect our culture on the web and that's what we're doing. We created an independent experts panel to help us bring the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Acts into the 21st century. Our end goal is clear: all players that participate in the system must contribute to the system. There will be no free rides.</p><p>Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren't subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.</p><p>Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.</p><p>We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.</p><p>NDP: The Minister of Canadian Heritage has failed to assume his responsibility in establishing a framework regarding the rise of on-demand video services. Rather than fixing this injustice, Justin Trudeau and his team went even further by signing a secret deal with Netflix without any consultation and without any guarantee of creating French content. The NDP think that Netflix and others should play by the same rules as other broadcasters and companies that operate in Canada.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>4. Cable service providers have had shrinking revenue in the digital age as competition from online platforms means fewer subscribers. Those providers place a percentage of their revenue into producing Canadian content, and the pot is shrinking. Would you support a move to have internet service providers, who have benefitted from the increased use of streaming services, also make similar financial contributions?</p><p>Liberals: (Same as answer 2)</p><p>Conservatives: We need to take action to review how innovative market solutions can help address these problems.</p><p>NDP: The main focus of the NDP would be to ensure that foreign multinationals are treated equally with Canadian companies and to make sure that internet services are affordable. We are paying some (of) the highest prices for broadband subscriptions in the world. This is wrong. The NDP has a clear vision for Canadian arts and culture including: protecting our heritage, supporting key Canadian institutions and providing an opportunity for our Canadian talent to thrive on digital and traditional platforms. We need more Canadian content. For this reason, we will find innovative ways to increase the funding of the Canada Media Fund.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>5. Under Section 19 of the Income Tax Act, domestic marketers who place advertisements in Canadian publications qualify for a tax deduction. But if they placed that ad in a foreign print publication, they wouldn't qualify. But the new digital reality means that if you advertise in the print edition of The New York Times, you wouldn't get a tax deduction, but if you did so in the online edition, you would. This has created an unlevel playing field for legacy publishers, diverting millions to major platforms like Google and Facebook. Would your party close that loophole?</p><p>Liberals: Canada is working with international partners and the OECD to examine the impacts of digitalization on some key aspects of the existing tax framework and to work toward a consensus-based approach.</p><p>Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not. Justin Trudeau has failed to create good policies. Conservatives will have more to say about our plan for a free, fair and sustainable press as the campaign continues.</p><p>NDP: Yes. There are many things that the federal government could and should do now to help solve this media crisis and closing the loophole at Section 19 of the Income Tax Act is clearly one of them. Section 19 was introduced in 1965 to encourage advertising spending in Canadian media - but instead it is now being used to support American multinationals like Facebook and Google that don't need it. Section 19 needs to be updated or reinterpreted to take into account online advertising. That idea was one of many recommendations made to the federal government in two different reports on the future of media, released in December 2016 and in June 2017. Many months of consultation went into those reports, and thousands of people were consulted, but the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Pablo Rodriguez, and the Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, have chosen to ignore the vast majority of those recommendations. This can't continue. The Liberals must act now to protect our medias, our democracy and our communities.</p><p>Greens: Yes.</p><p>6. Would you continue to provide ongoing and stable funding to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, maintaining or increasing current levels?</p><p>Liberals: After 10 years of cuts and partisan games under the Conservatives, we are proud to have reinvested $675M to better support our public broadcaster, in our first budget. We also put in place the first ever independent appointments process for CBC, and appointed accomplished individuals like Michael Goldbloom, Suzanne Gu&amp;#232;vremont, and Sandra Singh, rather than Conservative cronies. We firmly believe in the importance of CBC/Radio-Canada and of local news in all communities across the country. Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have openly said that they don't like journalists and could axe the CBC News division because they don't like the media calling them out for their inconsistencies.</p><p>Conservatives: When we look and see how much coverage is devoted on CBC to U.S. politics, the inner workings of U.S. politics, making sure that it's focused on the things that are going on here in Canada - Canada's Conservatives think that's something that many Canadians have said we should ensure that it's focused on the core mandate of being concentrated on Canada.</p><p>NDP: The CBC is an essential public service in a country like ours, where minority-language communities require regional news coverage in their own language. The NDP has a proud history of promoting our public broadcaster. In the last Parliament our MPs fought hard against the Conservatives' $115 million cut to CBC/Radio-Canada. We will release our vision for CBC in the near future!</p><p>Greens: We would continue, and expand funding for Canadian culture and the CBC.</p><p>7. If the CBC were to discontinue advertising, would your party support an advertising free environment, supported by taxpayers?</p><p>Liberals: The CBC is an autonomous Crown corporation responsible for managing its own operations.</p><p>Conservatives: We have to make sure the CBC's impact in that is not creating an undue hurdle against those private-sector entities that are trying to stay afloat and now have to compete with a government-subsidized entity that is also going out into the market to sell ads to get viewership</p><p>NDP: An advertisement free CBC is a fantastic idea in principle, but it does require further study. The main impediment is the revenue shortfall that would transpire. Current estimate reveals that this idea would cost $533 million annually.</p><p>Greens: Yes, we would.</p><p>8. Do you support federal aid for newspapers. If so, what measures would you propose?</p><p>Liberals: Canadian newspapers are taking a big hit by the media crisis. They have lost half of their jobs since 2010. We are going to the root of the problem and are creating concrete measures to support Canadian newspapers, big or small. Recently, our government announced the plan to introduce three new tax measures to support Canadian journalism estimated to provide approximately $595 million in support over five years. We must protect journalistic independence and that's why an independent experts panel will assist in implementing our investments. Journalism is at the core of our democracy, but Conservatives aren't one to miss an opportunity to attack its independence. The only type of media they're interested in are ones they control, like the Rebel, 24Seven, and Ontario News Now. They are into conspiracy theories and it's insulting to the intelligence of Canadians and the professionalism of journalists.</p><p>Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not.</p><p>NDP: In the wake of fake news, a strong, healthy and independent media industry is essential to our democracy. Our local newspapers have been put in a difficult financial position because of Liberal and Conservative governments refusal to equal the playing field and take away the tax holiday given to Facebook, Google and other internet giants. Our Quebec MPs like Pierre Nantel are the only ones who have been demanding action from the government for months. We believe any support package for the news media needs to be efficient, transparent and fair. The NDP will always fight to save our local medias while Liberals and Conservatives are playing partisan political games. You can expect further details in the near future.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

According to estimates from Facebook's ad library, the Facebook pages of the Liberal Party of Canada and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spent $454,179 in the last 30 days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Conservative party page and leader Andrew Scheer's page racked up $285,031 in ad spending. The NDP spent $99,846.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's the irony: The very platforms the main political parties hope to regulate are the ones they are dependent on in getting their message out.</p><p>The digital economy has created unprecedented wealth and promise, allowing consumers and voters access to a dazzling array of information, services and products.</p><p>The world's most valuable technology companies - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google ( FAANG) - have been the innovators. But progress has not come without cost.</p><p>Governments have been slow to implement regulatory changes to bring their laws into the digital age. Issues such as policing fake news and content, avoiding taxes, remunerating artists and publishers, contributing to Canadian culture, creating an unlevel playing field for domestic players and legacy media, including broadcasters and the publishing industry, have been cause for concern. Some say Big Tech is too big and should be broken up. Others say what's needed now is urgency by governments to implement regulations.</p><p>The European Union has been at the forefront, legislating sweeping changes aimed at online platforms in the areas of copyright and creating a more equitable market. Meanwhile, prosecutors for 50 American states have launched an antitrust investigation into Google, and Facebook was fined a record $5 billion earlier this year by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations.</p><p>The increased scrutiny has caused public attitudes to shift. A Ryerson Leadership Lab poll says a majority of Canadians want regulation of social media platforms. But critics say Canada has been slow to respond.</p><p>The Star asked the four main political parties - the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP and Green parties - for their thoughts on the need for legislative reform in the digital age.</p><p>One thing is for sure: After the October election, what the next government implements will affect future generations of taxpayers and chart the course for Canada in the 21st century.</p><p>1. The European Union has imposed stringent privacy and copyright laws on social networks and digital platforms. Do you think Canadians need to have more control over their personal data? If so, how would you propose to regulate this?</p><p>Liberals: Canadians' trust in the digital world is shaken; they're understandably anxious about how digital technologies and data will affect their lives. Our Digital Charter will ensure Canadians have the capacity and tools to know who is using their personal data and for what purposes, with clear penalties when rules are not respected, and that they are ultimately the ones to benefit from it. Social media platforms are already subject to Canada's commercial privacy law, PIPEDA, which we took steps to strengthen in the fall to ensure Canadians are made aware if their data has been placed at risk. We know more needs to be done, and that's why we unveiled the Charter, which was characterized by renowned privacy expert Michael Geist as \"a sea change in Canadian privacy law.\"</p><p>Conservatives: Ensuring that the personal data of Canadians is protected is a priority of Canada's Conservatives. Unfortunately, the Trudeau Liberal government has been particularly careless on this front. It's past-time the federal government did something to protect Canadians' information online.</p><p>A Conservative government would take a three-pronged approach to this issue: sensible regulation, standards and education to ensure that consumers can make informed decisions, and strong oversight at the highest levels of government.</p><p>We will ensure that plain language-use agreements are put in place so that companies collecting electronic data must receive informed consent from Canadians.</p><p>We will apply regulatory standards for the ethical and secure use of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things and create the Canada Cyber Safe brand to ensure that consumers know when products have met rigorous security standards.</p><p>An expert committee with industry leaders will define binding cyber security standards for critical infrastructure sectors and penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>Additionally, Canada's Conservatives will also establish a Cabinet Committee on Cyber Security and Data Privacy and conduct periodic cyber security penetration testing on all government departments and establish performance benchmarks for senior public servants</p><p>NDP: Recently, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada found Facebook had failed to take basic precautions or have adequate policies in place to protect users' information. More surprisingly, Facebook has refused to implement the Commissioners' recommendations, and the Commissioners warn that there is still a high risk that Canadians' personal information can be used and shared without their knowledge or consent. Facebook has been under the spotlight for over a year now for their privacy and business practices, from the Cambridge Analytica breach to the UN accusing the platform of having played a determining role in inciting a genocide in Myanmar. That they are refusing to actually improve their privacy policies at the direction of our regulators shows more cavalier disregard for not just Canadian laws, but for their own users' privacy rights. This Liberal government's cosy relationship with the American tech giants and their lobbyists means that they always put Canadians' privacy rights second. We need a government that will be willing to implement the all-party recommendations of the Ethics Committee and stand up to the web giants and their disregard for Canadian law. It's wrong that the Liberals and Conservatives always prefer to let private companies self-regulate instead of requiring them to do the right thing by putting the safety and privacy of Canadians before profits. New Democrats will prioritize the safety and privacy of Canadians.</p><p>Green Party: The Green Party believes that all Canadians have an inherent right to privacy, including online. Successive Canadian governments have failed to adequately modernize privacy protection digitally. We support the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Greens plan to modernize the existing Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act to the GPDR Standards. We do not believe that political parties should be exempt from these laws, and will apply the same standards to parties' collection and use of Canadians' data. We will regulate all tech companies, including tech Giants like Facebook and Google. We will make the penalties severe enough to get all companies' attention, and convince them to follow the law.</p><p>Maximum fines per violation would be set at a percentage of a company's global turnover.</p><p>We will: Ensure companies that are not located in Canada, but are operating here, pay the same taxes as Canadian companies and have social media companies ensure that racist and other discriminatory pages are not allowed to be posted, consistent with Canadian laws.</p><p>Also, all companies that have experienced a breech of their data must notify the Canadian government and the individual Canadians who have been affected. In addition, companies that sell programs or games, must allow the buyer to own a copy of the program or game, in the event the company goes out of business.</p><p>We will apply Canadian laws to all digital companies, including those companies based in other countries. We will force them to change their practices, to allow individuals to confirm what data they are willing to allow a company to collect. Canadian citizens must be able to access and download all the information any company has on them, and if they want their information deleted, they can ask the company to delete all their personal data, and the company must comply. It is essentially the right to be forgotten.</p><p>2. Quebec and Saskatchewan have required online foreign companies to collect provincial sales taxes since the start of the year. This has not happened at the federal level. So far Facebook has said it will start to collect the tax. Google and Netflix have said they will collect the tax when required by law to do so. An Auditor General report said in 2017 Ottawa could have collected $169 million in GST alone.</p><p>Would you require digital companies who have no substantial physical presence in Canada to collect the GST and PST on sales of subscriptions to Canadians?</p><p>Liberals: We are committed to ensuring that Canada's tax system is fair and supports an innovative economy. The issue of how to appropriately ensure web giants pay their fair share is not a uniquely Canadian problem - it is a global issue. That's why Canada is working with our international partners and the OECD to come up with a consensus-based approach. One that ensures every company pays their fair share, while also continuing to foster innovation and attract investment in the digital sector. With this in mind, we will continue to work with the OECD to develop an approach that is concerted, prudent, and fair for the middle class. (Note: This answer was given before the Liberals announced as part of their election platform that they would introduce a 3 per cent tax on the income of large digital companies operating in Canada. The party would ensure \"multinational tech giants pay corporate tax on the revenue they generate in Canada,\" according to a statement released by the party.)</p><p>Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren't subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.</p><p>Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.</p><p>We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.</p><p>NDP: The NDP is proposing a level playing field for all, where large foreign multinationals must pay their fair share. New Democrats will stand up to web giants and make sure they play by the same rules as Canadian companies. By taking this bold action, the government would recoup billions of dollars that could be used to make life more affordable for all Canadians, protect our content and culture, save local media, and create good quality jobs for the future.</p><p>Greens: We will tax online companies federally, not just on subscriptions.</p><p>3. In the European Union, some countries have required on-demand video services contribute investment into local content. Legacy Canadian broadcasters are required to put 5 per cent of their gross revenue into the Canadian Media Fund to produce Canadian content. (The CMF is a not-for-profit corporation that supports the Canadian television and digital media industries to produce original content.) Should foreign online platforms such as Netflix, Amazon and YouTube be required to put a percentage of their revenue into content?</p><p>Liberals: For 10 years, all the Conservatives did for culture was to cut. They ignored the struggles the industry was going through. The result is that our laws and tools predate the internet. We have committed to modernizing them to protect our culture on the web and that's what we're doing. We created an independent experts panel to help us bring the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Acts into the 21st century. Our end goal is clear: all players that participate in the system must contribute to the system. There will be no free rides.</p><p>Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren't subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.</p><p>Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.</p><p>We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.</p><p>NDP: The Minister of Canadian Heritage has failed to assume his responsibility in establishing a framework regarding the rise of on-demand video services. Rather than fixing this injustice, Justin Trudeau and his team went even further by signing a secret deal with Netflix without any consultation and without any guarantee of creating French content. The NDP think that Netflix and others should play by the same rules as other broadcasters and companies that operate in Canada.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>4. Cable service providers have had shrinking revenue in the digital age as competition from online platforms means fewer subscribers. Those providers place a percentage of their revenue into producing Canadian content, and the pot is shrinking. Would you support a move to have internet service providers, who have benefitted from the increased use of streaming services, also make similar financial contributions?</p><p>Liberals: (Same as answer 2)</p><p>Conservatives: We need to take action to review how innovative market solutions can help address these problems.</p><p>NDP: The main focus of the NDP would be to ensure that foreign multinationals are treated equally with Canadian companies and to make sure that internet services are affordable. We are paying some (of) the highest prices for broadband subscriptions in the world. This is wrong. The NDP has a clear vision for Canadian arts and culture including: protecting our heritage, supporting key Canadian institutions and providing an opportunity for our Canadian talent to thrive on digital and traditional platforms. We need more Canadian content. For this reason, we will find innovative ways to increase the funding of the Canada Media Fund.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>5. Under Section 19 of the Income Tax Act, domestic marketers who place advertisements in Canadian publications qualify for a tax deduction. But if they placed that ad in a foreign print publication, they wouldn't qualify. But the new digital reality means that if you advertise in the print edition of The New York Times, you wouldn't get a tax deduction, but if you did so in the online edition, you would. This has created an unlevel playing field for legacy publishers, diverting millions to major platforms like Google and Facebook. Would your party close that loophole?</p><p>Liberals: Canada is working with international partners and the OECD to examine the impacts of digitalization on some key aspects of the existing tax framework and to work toward a consensus-based approach.</p><p>Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not. Justin Trudeau has failed to create good policies. Conservatives will have more to say about our plan for a free, fair and sustainable press as the campaign continues.</p><p>NDP: Yes. There are many things that the federal government could and should do now to help solve this media crisis and closing the loophole at Section 19 of the Income Tax Act is clearly one of them. Section 19 was introduced in 1965 to encourage advertising spending in Canadian media - but instead it is now being used to support American multinationals like Facebook and Google that don't need it. Section 19 needs to be updated or reinterpreted to take into account online advertising. That idea was one of many recommendations made to the federal government in two different reports on the future of media, released in December 2016 and in June 2017. Many months of consultation went into those reports, and thousands of people were consulted, but the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Pablo Rodriguez, and the Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, have chosen to ignore the vast majority of those recommendations. This can't continue. The Liberals must act now to protect our medias, our democracy and our communities.</p><p>Greens: Yes.</p><p>6. Would you continue to provide ongoing and stable funding to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, maintaining or increasing current levels?</p><p>Liberals: After 10 years of cuts and partisan games under the Conservatives, we are proud to have reinvested $675M to better support our public broadcaster, in our first budget. We also put in place the first ever independent appointments process for CBC, and appointed accomplished individuals like Michael Goldbloom, Suzanne Gu&amp;#232;vremont, and Sandra Singh, rather than Conservative cronies. We firmly believe in the importance of CBC/Radio-Canada and of local news in all communities across the country. Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have openly said that they don't like journalists and could axe the CBC News division because they don't like the media calling them out for their inconsistencies.</p><p>Conservatives: When we look and see how much coverage is devoted on CBC to U.S. politics, the inner workings of U.S. politics, making sure that it's focused on the things that are going on here in Canada - Canada's Conservatives think that's something that many Canadians have said we should ensure that it's focused on the core mandate of being concentrated on Canada.</p><p>NDP: The CBC is an essential public service in a country like ours, where minority-language communities require regional news coverage in their own language. The NDP has a proud history of promoting our public broadcaster. In the last Parliament our MPs fought hard against the Conservatives' $115 million cut to CBC/Radio-Canada. We will release our vision for CBC in the near future!</p><p>Greens: We would continue, and expand funding for Canadian culture and the CBC.</p><p>7. If the CBC were to discontinue advertising, would your party support an advertising free environment, supported by taxpayers?</p><p>Liberals: The CBC is an autonomous Crown corporation responsible for managing its own operations.</p><p>Conservatives: We have to make sure the CBC's impact in that is not creating an undue hurdle against those private-sector entities that are trying to stay afloat and now have to compete with a government-subsidized entity that is also going out into the market to sell ads to get viewership</p><p>NDP: An advertisement free CBC is a fantastic idea in principle, but it does require further study. The main impediment is the revenue shortfall that would transpire. Current estimate reveals that this idea would cost $533 million annually.</p><p>Greens: Yes, we would.</p><p>8. Do you support federal aid for newspapers. If so, what measures would you propose?</p><p>Liberals: Canadian newspapers are taking a big hit by the media crisis. They have lost half of their jobs since 2010. We are going to the root of the problem and are creating concrete measures to support Canadian newspapers, big or small. Recently, our government announced the plan to introduce three new tax measures to support Canadian journalism estimated to provide approximately $595 million in support over five years. We must protect journalistic independence and that's why an independent experts panel will assist in implementing our investments. Journalism is at the core of our democracy, but Conservatives aren't one to miss an opportunity to attack its independence. The only type of media they're interested in are ones they control, like the Rebel, 24Seven, and Ontario News Now. They are into conspiracy theories and it's insulting to the intelligence of Canadians and the professionalism of journalists.</p><p>Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not.</p><p>NDP: In the wake of fake news, a strong, healthy and independent media industry is essential to our democracy. Our local newspapers have been put in a difficult financial position because of Liberal and Conservative governments refusal to equal the playing field and take away the tax holiday given to Facebook, Google and other internet giants. Our Quebec MPs like Pierre Nantel are the only ones who have been demanding action from the government for months. We believe any support package for the news media needs to be efficient, transparent and fair. The NDP will always fight to save our local medias while Liberals and Conservatives are playing partisan political games. You can expect further details in the near future.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

According to estimates from Facebook's ad library, the Facebook pages of the Liberal Party of Canada and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spent $454,179 in the last 30 days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Conservative party page and leader Andrew Scheer's page racked up $285,031 in ad spending. The NDP spent $99,846.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's the irony: The very platforms the main political parties hope to regulate are the ones they are dependent on in getting their message out.</p><p>The digital economy has created unprecedented wealth and promise, allowing consumers and voters access to a dazzling array of information, services and products.</p><p>The world's most valuable technology companies - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google ( FAANG) - have been the innovators. But progress has not come without cost.</p><p>Governments have been slow to implement regulatory changes to bring their laws into the digital age. Issues such as policing fake news and content, avoiding taxes, remunerating artists and publishers, contributing to Canadian culture, creating an unlevel playing field for domestic players and legacy media, including broadcasters and the publishing industry, have been cause for concern. Some say Big Tech is too big and should be broken up. Others say what's needed now is urgency by governments to implement regulations.</p><p>The European Union has been at the forefront, legislating sweeping changes aimed at online platforms in the areas of copyright and creating a more equitable market. Meanwhile, prosecutors for 50 American states have launched an antitrust investigation into Google, and Facebook was fined a record $5 billion earlier this year by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations.</p><p>The increased scrutiny has caused public attitudes to shift. A Ryerson Leadership Lab poll says a majority of Canadians want regulation of social media platforms. But critics say Canada has been slow to respond.</p><p>The Star asked the four main political parties - the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP and Green parties - for their thoughts on the need for legislative reform in the digital age.</p><p>One thing is for sure: After the October election, what the next government implements will affect future generations of taxpayers and chart the course for Canada in the 21st century.</p><p>1. The European Union has imposed stringent privacy and copyright laws on social networks and digital platforms. Do you think Canadians need to have more control over their personal data? If so, how would you propose to regulate this?</p><p>Liberals: Canadians' trust in the digital world is shaken; they're understandably anxious about how digital technologies and data will affect their lives. Our Digital Charter will ensure Canadians have the capacity and tools to know who is using their personal data and for what purposes, with clear penalties when rules are not respected, and that they are ultimately the ones to benefit from it. Social media platforms are already subject to Canada's commercial privacy law, PIPEDA, which we took steps to strengthen in the fall to ensure Canadians are made aware if their data has been placed at risk. We know more needs to be done, and that's why we unveiled the Charter, which was characterized by renowned privacy expert Michael Geist as \"a sea change in Canadian privacy law.\"</p><p>Conservatives: Ensuring that the personal data of Canadians is protected is a priority of Canada's Conservatives. Unfortunately, the Trudeau Liberal government has been particularly careless on this front. It's past-time the federal government did something to protect Canadians' information online.</p><p>A Conservative government would take a three-pronged approach to this issue: sensible regulation, standards and education to ensure that consumers can make informed decisions, and strong oversight at the highest levels of government.</p><p>We will ensure that plain language-use agreements are put in place so that companies collecting electronic data must receive informed consent from Canadians.</p><p>We will apply regulatory standards for the ethical and secure use of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things and create the Canada Cyber Safe brand to ensure that consumers know when products have met rigorous security standards.</p><p>An expert committee with industry leaders will define binding cyber security standards for critical infrastructure sectors and penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>Additionally, Canada's Conservatives will also establish a Cabinet Committee on Cyber Security and Data Privacy and conduct periodic cyber security penetration testing on all government departments and establish performance benchmarks for senior public servants</p><p>NDP: Recently, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada found Facebook had failed to take basic precautions or have adequate policies in place to protect users' information. More surprisingly, Facebook has refused to implement the Commissioners' recommendations, and the Commissioners warn that there is still a high risk that Canadians' personal information can be used and shared without their knowledge or consent. Facebook has been under the spotlight for over a year now for their privacy and business practices, from the Cambridge Analytica breach to the UN accusing the platform of having played a determining role in inciting a genocide in Myanmar. That they are refusing to actually improve their privacy policies at the direction of our regulators shows more cavalier disregard for not just Canadian laws, but for their own users' privacy rights. This Liberal government's cosy relationship with the American tech giants and their lobbyists means that they always put Canadians' privacy rights second. We need a government that will be willing to implement the all-party recommendations of the Ethics Committee and stand up to the web giants and their disregard for Canadian law. It's wrong that the Liberals and Conservatives always prefer to let private companies self-regulate instead of requiring them to do the right thing by putting the safety and privacy of Canadians before profits. New Democrats will prioritize the safety and privacy of Canadians.</p><p>Green Party: The Green Party believes that all Canadians have an inherent right to privacy, including online. Successive Canadian governments have failed to adequately modernize privacy protection digitally. We support the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Greens plan to modernize the existing Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act to the GPDR Standards. We do not believe that political parties should be exempt from these laws, and will apply the same standards to parties' collection and use of Canadians' data. We will regulate all tech companies, including tech Giants like Facebook and Google. We will make the penalties severe enough to get all companies' attention, and convince them to follow the law.</p><p>Maximum fines per violation would be set at a percentage of a company's global turnover.</p><p>We will: Ensure companies that are not located in Canada, but are operating here, pay the same taxes as Canadian companies and have social media companies ensure that racist and other discriminatory pages are not allowed to be posted, consistent with Canadian laws.</p><p>Also, all companies that have experienced a breech of their data must notify the Canadian government and the individual Canadians who have been affected. In addition, companies that sell programs or games, must allow the buyer to own a copy of the program or game, in the event the company goes out of business.</p><p>We will apply Canadian laws to all digital companies, including those companies based in other countries. We will force them to change their practices, to allow individuals to confirm what data they are willing to allow a company to collect. Canadian citizens must be able to access and download all the information any company has on them, and if they want their information deleted, they can ask the company to delete all their personal data, and the company must comply. It is essentially the right to be forgotten.</p><p>2. Quebec and Saskatchewan have required online foreign companies to collect provincial sales taxes since the start of the year. This has not happened at the federal level. So far Facebook has said it will start to collect the tax. Google and Netflix have said they will collect the tax when required by law to do so. An Auditor General report said in 2017 Ottawa could have collected $169 million in GST alone.</p><p>Would you require digital companies who have no substantial physical presence in Canada to collect the GST and PST on sales of subscriptions to Canadians?</p><p>Liberals: We are committed to ensuring that Canada's tax system is fair and supports an innovative economy. The issue of how to appropriately ensure web giants pay their fair share is not a uniquely Canadian problem - it is a global issue. That's why Canada is working with our international partners and the OECD to come up with a consensus-based approach. One that ensures every company pays their fair share, while also continuing to foster innovation and attract investment in the digital sector. With this in mind, we will continue to work with the OECD to develop an approach that is concerted, prudent, and fair for the middle class. (Note: This answer was given before the Liberals announced as part of their election platform that they would introduce a 3 per cent tax on the income of large digital companies operating in Canada. The party would ensure \"multinational tech giants pay corporate tax on the revenue they generate in Canada,\" according to a statement released by the party.)</p><p>Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren't subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.</p><p>Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.</p><p>We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.</p><p>NDP: The NDP is proposing a level playing field for all, where large foreign multinationals must pay their fair share. New Democrats will stand up to web giants and make sure they play by the same rules as Canadian companies. By taking this bold action, the government would recoup billions of dollars that could be used to make life more affordable for all Canadians, protect our content and culture, save local media, and create good quality jobs for the future.</p><p>Greens: We will tax online companies federally, not just on subscriptions.</p><p>3. In the European Union, some countries have required on-demand video services contribute investment into local content. Legacy Canadian broadcasters are required to put 5 per cent of their gross revenue into the Canadian Media Fund to produce Canadian content. (The CMF is a not-for-profit corporation that supports the Canadian television and digital media industries to produce original content.) Should foreign online platforms such as Netflix, Amazon and YouTube be required to put a percentage of their revenue into content?</p><p>Liberals: For 10 years, all the Conservatives did for culture was to cut. They ignored the struggles the industry was going through. The result is that our laws and tools predate the internet. We have committed to modernizing them to protect our culture on the web and that's what we're doing. We created an independent experts panel to help us bring the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Acts into the 21st century. Our end goal is clear: all players that participate in the system must contribute to the system. There will be no free rides.</p><p>Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren't subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.</p><p>Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.</p><p>We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.</p><p>NDP: The Minister of Canadian Heritage has failed to assume his responsibility in establishing a framework regarding the rise of on-demand video services. Rather than fixing this injustice, Justin Trudeau and his team went even further by signing a secret deal with Netflix without any consultation and without any guarantee of creating French content. The NDP think that Netflix and others should play by the same rules as other broadcasters and companies that operate in Canada.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>4. Cable service providers have had shrinking revenue in the digital age as competition from online platforms means fewer subscribers. Those providers place a percentage of their revenue into producing Canadian content, and the pot is shrinking. Would you support a move to have internet service providers, who have benefitted from the increased use of streaming services, also make similar financial contributions?</p><p>Liberals: (Same as answer 2)</p><p>Conservatives: We need to take action to review how innovative market solutions can help address these problems.</p><p>NDP: The main focus of the NDP would be to ensure that foreign multinationals are treated equally with Canadian companies and to make sure that internet services are affordable. We are paying some (of) the highest prices for broadband subscriptions in the world. This is wrong. The NDP has a clear vision for Canadian arts and culture including: protecting our heritage, supporting key Canadian institutions and providing an opportunity for our Canadian talent to thrive on digital and traditional platforms. We need more Canadian content. For this reason, we will find innovative ways to increase the funding of the Canada Media Fund.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>5. Under Section 19 of the Income Tax Act, domestic marketers who place advertisements in Canadian publications qualify for a tax deduction. But if they placed that ad in a foreign print publication, they wouldn't qualify. But the new digital reality means that if you advertise in the print edition of The New York Times, you wouldn't get a tax deduction, but if you did so in the online edition, you would. This has created an unlevel playing field for legacy publishers, diverting millions to major platforms like Google and Facebook. Would your party close that loophole?</p><p>Liberals: Canada is working with international partners and the OECD to examine the impacts of digitalization on some key aspects of the existing tax framework and to work toward a consensus-based approach.</p><p>Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not. Justin Trudeau has failed to create good policies. Conservatives will have more to say about our plan for a free, fair and sustainable press as the campaign continues.</p><p>NDP: Yes. There are many things that the federal government could and should do now to help solve this media crisis and closing the loophole at Section 19 of the Income Tax Act is clearly one of them. Section 19 was introduced in 1965 to encourage advertising spending in Canadian media - but instead it is now being used to support American multinationals like Facebook and Google that don't need it. Section 19 needs to be updated or reinterpreted to take into account online advertising. That idea was one of many recommendations made to the federal government in two different reports on the future of media, released in December 2016 and in June 2017. Many months of consultation went into those reports, and thousands of people were consulted, but the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Pablo Rodriguez, and the Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, have chosen to ignore the vast majority of those recommendations. This can't continue. The Liberals must act now to protect our medias, our democracy and our communities.</p><p>Greens: Yes.</p><p>6. Would you continue to provide ongoing and stable funding to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, maintaining or increasing current levels?</p><p>Liberals: After 10 years of cuts and partisan games under the Conservatives, we are proud to have reinvested $675M to better support our public broadcaster, in our first budget. We also put in place the first ever independent appointments process for CBC, and appointed accomplished individuals like Michael Goldbloom, Suzanne Gu&amp;#232;vremont, and Sandra Singh, rather than Conservative cronies. We firmly believe in the importance of CBC/Radio-Canada and of local news in all communities across the country. Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have openly said that they don't like journalists and could axe the CBC News division because they don't like the media calling them out for their inconsistencies.</p><p>Conservatives: When we look and see how much coverage is devoted on CBC to U.S. politics, the inner workings of U.S. politics, making sure that it's focused on the things that are going on here in Canada - Canada's Conservatives think that's something that many Canadians have said we should ensure that it's focused on the core mandate of being concentrated on Canada.</p><p>NDP: The CBC is an essential public service in a country like ours, where minority-language communities require regional news coverage in their own language. The NDP has a proud history of promoting our public broadcaster. In the last Parliament our MPs fought hard against the Conservatives' $115 million cut to CBC/Radio-Canada. We will release our vision for CBC in the near future!</p><p>Greens: We would continue, and expand funding for Canadian culture and the CBC.</p><p>7. If the CBC were to discontinue advertising, would your party support an advertising free environment, supported by taxpayers?</p><p>Liberals: The CBC is an autonomous Crown corporation responsible for managing its own operations.</p><p>Conservatives: We have to make sure the CBC's impact in that is not creating an undue hurdle against those private-sector entities that are trying to stay afloat and now have to compete with a government-subsidized entity that is also going out into the market to sell ads to get viewership</p><p>NDP: An advertisement free CBC is a fantastic idea in principle, but it does require further study. The main impediment is the revenue shortfall that would transpire. Current estimate reveals that this idea would cost $533 million annually.</p><p>Greens: Yes, we would.</p><p>8. Do you support federal aid for newspapers. If so, what measures would you propose?</p><p>Liberals: Canadian newspapers are taking a big hit by the media crisis. They have lost half of their jobs since 2010. We are going to the root of the problem and are creating concrete measures to support Canadian newspapers, big or small. Recently, our government announced the plan to introduce three new tax measures to support Canadian journalism estimated to provide approximately $595 million in support over five years. We must protect journalistic independence and that's why an independent experts panel will assist in implementing our investments. Journalism is at the core of our democracy, but Conservatives aren't one to miss an opportunity to attack its independence. The only type of media they're interested in are ones they control, like the Rebel, 24Seven, and Ontario News Now. They are into conspiracy theories and it's insulting to the intelligence of Canadians and the professionalism of journalists.</p><p>Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not.</p><p>NDP: In the wake of fake news, a strong, healthy and independent media industry is essential to our democracy. Our local newspapers have been put in a difficult financial position because of Liberal and Conservative governments refusal to equal the playing field and take away the tax holiday given to Facebook, Google and other internet giants. Our Quebec MPs like Pierre Nantel are the only ones who have been demanding action from the government for months. We believe any support package for the news media needs to be efficient, transparent and fair. The NDP will always fight to save our local medias while Liberals and Conservatives are playing partisan political games. You can expect further details in the near future.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

According to estimates from Facebook's ad library, the Facebook pages of the Liberal Party of Canada and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spent $454,179 in the last 30 days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Conservative party page and leader Andrew Scheer's page racked up $285,031 in ad spending. The NDP spent $99,846.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's the irony: The very platforms the main political parties hope to regulate are the ones they are dependent on in getting their message out.</p><p>The digital economy has created unprecedented wealth and promise, allowing consumers and voters access to a dazzling array of information, services and products.</p><p>The world's most valuable technology companies - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google ( FAANG) - have been the innovators. But progress has not come without cost.</p><p>Governments have been slow to implement regulatory changes to bring their laws into the digital age. Issues such as policing fake news and content, avoiding taxes, remunerating artists and publishers, contributing to Canadian culture, creating an unlevel playing field for domestic players and legacy media, including broadcasters and the publishing industry, have been cause for concern. Some say Big Tech is too big and should be broken up. Others say what's needed now is urgency by governments to implement regulations.</p><p>The European Union has been at the forefront, legislating sweeping changes aimed at online platforms in the areas of copyright and creating a more equitable market. Meanwhile, prosecutors for 50 American states have launched an antitrust investigation into Google, and Facebook was fined a record $5 billion earlier this year by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations.</p><p>The increased scrutiny has caused public attitudes to shift. A Ryerson Leadership Lab poll says a majority of Canadians want regulation of social media platforms. But critics say Canada has been slow to respond.</p><p>The Star asked the four main political parties - the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP and Green parties - for their thoughts on the need for legislative reform in the digital age.</p><p>One thing is for sure: After the October election, what the next government implements will affect future generations of taxpayers and chart the course for Canada in the 21st century.</p><p>1. The European Union has imposed stringent privacy and copyright laws on social networks and digital platforms. Do you think Canadians need to have more control over their personal data? If so, how would you propose to regulate this?</p><p>Liberals: Canadians' trust in the digital world is shaken; they're understandably anxious about how digital technologies and data will affect their lives. Our Digital Charter will ensure Canadians have the capacity and tools to know who is using their personal data and for what purposes, with clear penalties when rules are not respected, and that they are ultimately the ones to benefit from it. Social media platforms are already subject to Canada's commercial privacy law, PIPEDA, which we took steps to strengthen in the fall to ensure Canadians are made aware if their data has been placed at risk. We know more needs to be done, and that's why we unveiled the Charter, which was characterized by renowned privacy expert Michael Geist as \"a sea change in Canadian privacy law.\"</p><p>Conservatives: Ensuring that the personal data of Canadians is protected is a priority of Canada's Conservatives. Unfortunately, the Trudeau Liberal government has been particularly careless on this front. It's past-time the federal government did something to protect Canadians' information online.</p><p>A Conservative government would take a three-pronged approach to this issue: sensible regulation, standards and education to ensure that consumers can make informed decisions, and strong oversight at the highest levels of government.</p><p>We will ensure that plain language-use agreements are put in place so that companies collecting electronic data must receive informed consent from Canadians.</p><p>We will apply regulatory standards for the ethical and secure use of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things and create the Canada Cyber Safe brand to ensure that consumers know when products have met rigorous security standards.</p><p>An expert committee with industry leaders will define binding cyber security standards for critical infrastructure sectors and penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>Additionally, Canada's Conservatives will also establish a Cabinet Committee on Cyber Security and Data Privacy and conduct periodic cyber security penetration testing on all government departments and establish performance benchmarks for senior public servants</p><p>NDP: Recently, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada found Facebook had failed to take basic precautions or have adequate policies in place to protect users' information. More surprisingly, Facebook has refused to implement the Commissioners' recommendations, and the Commissioners warn that there is still a high risk that Canadians' personal information can be used and shared without their knowledge or consent. Facebook has been under the spotlight for over a year now for their privacy and business practices, from the Cambridge Analytica breach to the UN accusing the platform of having played a determining role in inciting a genocide in Myanmar. That they are refusing to actually improve their privacy policies at the direction of our regulators shows more cavalier disregard for not just Canadian laws, but for their own users' privacy rights. This Liberal government's cosy relationship with the American tech giants and their lobbyists means that they always put Canadians' privacy rights second. We need a government that will be willing to implement the all-party recommendations of the Ethics Committee and stand up to the web giants and their disregard for Canadian law. It's wrong that the Liberals and Conservatives always prefer to let private companies self-regulate instead of requiring them to do the right thing by putting the safety and privacy of Canadians before profits. New Democrats will prioritize the safety and privacy of Canadians.</p><p>Green Party: The Green Party believes that all Canadians have an inherent right to privacy, including online. Successive Canadian governments have failed to adequately modernize privacy protection digitally. We support the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Greens plan to modernize the existing Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act to the GPDR Standards. We do not believe that political parties should be exempt from these laws, and will apply the same standards to parties' collection and use of Canadians' data. We will regulate all tech companies, including tech Giants like Facebook and Google. We will make the penalties severe enough to get all companies' attention, and convince them to follow the law.</p><p>Maximum fines per violation would be set at a percentage of a company's global turnover.</p><p>We will: Ensure companies that are not located in Canada, but are operating here, pay the same taxes as Canadian companies and have social media companies ensure that racist and other discriminatory pages are not allowed to be posted, consistent with Canadian laws.</p><p>Also, all companies that have experienced a breech of their data must notify the Canadian government and the individual Canadians who have been affected. In addition, companies that sell programs or games, must allow the buyer to own a copy of the program or game, in the event the company goes out of business.</p><p>We will apply Canadian laws to all digital companies, including those companies based in other countries. We will force them to change their practices, to allow individuals to confirm what data they are willing to allow a company to collect. Canadian citizens must be able to access and download all the information any company has on them, and if they want their information deleted, they can ask the company to delete all their personal data, and the company must comply. It is essentially the right to be forgotten.</p><p>2. Quebec and Saskatchewan have required online foreign companies to collect provincial sales taxes since the start of the year. This has not happened at the federal level. So far Facebook has said it will start to collect the tax. Google and Netflix have said they will collect the tax when required by law to do so. An Auditor General report said in 2017 Ottawa could have collected $169 million in GST alone.</p><p>Would you require digital companies who have no substantial physical presence in Canada to collect the GST and PST on sales of subscriptions to Canadians?</p><p>Liberals: We are committed to ensuring that Canada's tax system is fair and supports an innovative economy. The issue of how to appropriately ensure web giants pay their fair share is not a uniquely Canadian problem - it is a global issue. That's why Canada is working with our international partners and the OECD to come up with a consensus-based approach. One that ensures every company pays their fair share, while also continuing to foster innovation and attract investment in the digital sector. With this in mind, we will continue to work with the OECD to develop an approach that is concerted, prudent, and fair for the middle class. (Note: This answer was given before the Liberals announced as part of their election platform that they would introduce a 3 per cent tax on the income of large digital companies operating in Canada. The party would ensure \"multinational tech giants pay corporate tax on the revenue they generate in Canada,\" according to a statement released by the party.)</p><p>Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren't subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.</p><p>Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.</p><p>We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.</p><p>NDP: The NDP is proposing a level playing field for all, where large foreign multinationals must pay their fair share. New Democrats will stand up to web giants and make sure they play by the same rules as Canadian companies. By taking this bold action, the government would recoup billions of dollars that could be used to make life more affordable for all Canadians, protect our content and culture, save local media, and create good quality jobs for the future.</p><p>Greens: We will tax online companies federally, not just on subscriptions.</p><p>3. In the European Union, some countries have required on-demand video services contribute investment into local content. Legacy Canadian broadcasters are required to put 5 per cent of their gross revenue into the Canadian Media Fund to produce Canadian content. (The CMF is a not-for-profit corporation that supports the Canadian television and digital media industries to produce original content.) Should foreign online platforms such as Netflix, Amazon and YouTube be required to put a percentage of their revenue into content?</p><p>Liberals: For 10 years, all the Conservatives did for culture was to cut. They ignored the struggles the industry was going through. The result is that our laws and tools predate the internet. We have committed to modernizing them to protect our culture on the web and that's what we're doing. We created an independent experts panel to help us bring the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Acts into the 21st century. Our end goal is clear: all players that participate in the system must contribute to the system. There will be no free rides.</p><p>Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren't subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.</p><p>Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.</p><p>We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.</p><p>NDP: The Minister of Canadian Heritage has failed to assume his responsibility in establishing a framework regarding the rise of on-demand video services. Rather than fixing this injustice, Justin Trudeau and his team went even further by signing a secret deal with Netflix without any consultation and without any guarantee of creating French content. The NDP think that Netflix and others should play by the same rules as other broadcasters and companies that operate in Canada.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>4. Cable service providers have had shrinking revenue in the digital age as competition from online platforms means fewer subscribers. Those providers place a percentage of their revenue into producing Canadian content, and the pot is shrinking. Would you support a move to have internet service providers, who have benefitted from the increased use of streaming services, also make similar financial contributions?</p><p>Liberals: (Same as answer 2)</p><p>Conservatives: We need to take action to review how innovative market solutions can help address these problems.</p><p>NDP: The main focus of the NDP would be to ensure that foreign multinationals are treated equally with Canadian companies and to make sure that internet services are affordable. We are paying some (of) the highest prices for broadband subscriptions in the world. This is wrong. The NDP has a clear vision for Canadian arts and culture including: protecting our heritage, supporting key Canadian institutions and providing an opportunity for our Canadian talent to thrive on digital and traditional platforms. We need more Canadian content. For this reason, we will find innovative ways to increase the funding of the Canada Media Fund.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>5. Under Section 19 of the Income Tax Act, domestic marketers who place advertisements in Canadian publications qualify for a tax deduction. But if they placed that ad in a foreign print publication, they wouldn't qualify. But the new digital reality means that if you advertise in the print edition of The New York Times, you wouldn't get a tax deduction, but if you did so in the online edition, you would. This has created an unlevel playing field for legacy publishers, diverting millions to major platforms like Google and Facebook. Would your party close that loophole?</p><p>Liberals: Canada is working with international partners and the OECD to examine the impacts of digitalization on some key aspects of the existing tax framework and to work toward a consensus-based approach.</p><p>Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not. Justin Trudeau has failed to create good policies. Conservatives will have more to say about our plan for a free, fair and sustainable press as the campaign continues.</p><p>NDP: Yes. There are many things that the federal government could and should do now to help solve this media crisis and closing the loophole at Section 19 of the Income Tax Act is clearly one of them. Section 19 was introduced in 1965 to encourage advertising spending in Canadian media - but instead it is now being used to support American multinationals like Facebook and Google that don't need it. Section 19 needs to be updated or reinterpreted to take into account online advertising. That idea was one of many recommendations made to the federal government in two different reports on the future of media, released in December 2016 and in June 2017. Many months of consultation went into those reports, and thousands of people were consulted, but the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Pablo Rodriguez, and the Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, have chosen to ignore the vast majority of those recommendations. This can't continue. The Liberals must act now to protect our medias, our democracy and our communities.</p><p>Greens: Yes.</p><p>6. Would you continue to provide ongoing and stable funding to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, maintaining or increasing current levels?</p><p>Liberals: After 10 years of cuts and partisan games under the Conservatives, we are proud to have reinvested $675M to better support our public broadcaster, in our first budget. We also put in place the first ever independent appointments process for CBC, and appointed accomplished individuals like Michael Goldbloom, Suzanne Gu&amp;#232;vremont, and Sandra Singh, rather than Conservative cronies. We firmly believe in the importance of CBC/Radio-Canada and of local news in all communities across the country. Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have openly said that they don't like journalists and could axe the CBC News division because they don't like the media calling them out for their inconsistencies.</p><p>Conservatives: When we look and see how much coverage is devoted on CBC to U.S. politics, the inner workings of U.S. politics, making sure that it's focused on the things that are going on here in Canada - Canada's Conservatives think that's something that many Canadians have said we should ensure that it's focused on the core mandate of being concentrated on Canada.</p><p>NDP: The CBC is an essential public service in a country like ours, where minority-language communities require regional news coverage in their own language. The NDP has a proud history of promoting our public broadcaster. In the last Parliament our MPs fought hard against the Conservatives' $115 million cut to CBC/Radio-Canada. We will release our vision for CBC in the near future!</p><p>Greens: We would continue, and expand funding for Canadian culture and the CBC.</p><p>7. If the CBC were to discontinue advertising, would your party support an advertising free environment, supported by taxpayers?</p><p>Liberals: The CBC is an autonomous Crown corporation responsible for managing its own operations.</p><p>Conservatives: We have to make sure the CBC's impact in that is not creating an undue hurdle against those private-sector entities that are trying to stay afloat and now have to compete with a government-subsidized entity that is also going out into the market to sell ads to get viewership</p><p>NDP: An advertisement free CBC is a fantastic idea in principle, but it does require further study. The main impediment is the revenue shortfall that would transpire. Current estimate reveals that this idea would cost $533 million annually.</p><p>Greens: Yes, we would.</p><p>8. Do you support federal aid for newspapers. If so, what measures would you propose?</p><p>Liberals: Canadian newspapers are taking a big hit by the media crisis. They have lost half of their jobs since 2010. We are going to the root of the problem and are creating concrete measures to support Canadian newspapers, big or small. Recently, our government announced the plan to introduce three new tax measures to support Canadian journalism estimated to provide approximately $595 million in support over five years. We must protect journalistic independence and that's why an independent experts panel will assist in implementing our investments. Journalism is at the core of our democracy, but Conservatives aren't one to miss an opportunity to attack its independence. The only type of media they're interested in are ones they control, like the Rebel, 24Seven, and Ontario News Now. They are into conspiracy theories and it's insulting to the intelligence of Canadians and the professionalism of journalists.</p><p>Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not.</p><p>NDP: In the wake of fake news, a strong, healthy and independent media industry is essential to our democracy. Our local newspapers have been put in a difficult financial position because of Liberal and Conservative governments refusal to equal the playing field and take away the tax holiday given to Facebook, Google and other internet giants. Our Quebec MPs like Pierre Nantel are the only ones who have been demanding action from the government for months. We believe any support package for the news media needs to be efficient, transparent and fair. The NDP will always fight to save our local medias while Liberals and Conservatives are playing partisan political games. You can expect further details in the near future.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

According to estimates from Facebook's ad library, the Facebook pages of the Liberal Party of Canada and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spent $454,179 in the last 30 days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Conservative party page and leader Andrew Scheer's page racked up $285,031 in ad spending. The NDP spent $99,846.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's the irony: The very platforms the main political parties hope to regulate are the ones they are dependent on in getting their message out.</p><p>The digital economy has created unprecedented wealth and promise, allowing consumers and voters access to a dazzling array of information, services and products.</p><p>The world's most valuable technology companies - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google (FAANG) - have been the innovators. But progress has not come without cost.</p><p>Governments have been slow to implement regulatory changes to bring their laws into the digital age. Issues such as policing fake news and content, avoiding taxes, remunerating artists and publishers, contributing to Canadian culture, creating an unlevel playing field for domestic players and legacy media, including broadcasters and the publishing industry, have been cause for concern. Some say Big Tech is too big and should be broken up. Others say what's needed now is urgency by governments to implement regulations.</p><p>The European Union has been at the forefront, legislating sweeping changes aimed at online platforms in the areas of copyright and creating a more equitable market. Meanwhile, prosecutors for 50 American states have launched an antitrust investigation into Google, and Facebook was fined a record $5 billion earlier this year by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations.</p><p>The increased scrutiny has caused public attitudes to shift. A Ryerson Leadership Lab poll says a majority of Canadians want regulation of social media platforms. But critics say Canada has been slow to respond.</p><p>The Star asked the four main political parties - the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP and Green parties - for their thoughts on the need for legislative reform in the digital age.</p><p>One thing is for sure: After the October election, what the next government implements will affect future generations of taxpayers and chart the course for Canada in the 21st century.</p><p>1. The European Union has imposed stringent privacy and copyright laws on social networks and digital platforms. Do you think Canadians need to have more control over their personal data? If so, how would you propose to regulate this?</p><p>Liberals: Canadians' trust in the digital world is shaken; they're understandably anxious about how digital technologies and data will affect their lives. Our Digital Charter will ensure Canadians have the capacity and tools to know who is using their personal data and for what purposes, with clear penalties when rules are not respected, and that they are ultimately the ones to benefit from it. Social media platforms are already subject to Canada's commercial privacy law, PIPEDA, which we took steps to strengthen in the fall to ensure Canadians are made aware if their data has been placed at risk. We know more needs to be done, and that's why we unveiled the Charter, which was characterized by renowned privacy expert Michael Geist as \"a sea change in Canadian privacy law.\"</p><p>Conservatives: Ensuring that the personal data of Canadians is protected is a priority of Canada's Conservatives. Unfortunately, the Trudeau Liberal government has been particularly careless on this front. It's past-time the federal government did something to protect Canadians' information online.</p><p>A Conservative government would take a three-pronged approach to this issue: sensible regulation, standards and education to ensure that consumers can make informed decisions, and strong oversight at the highest levels of government.</p><p>We will ensure that plain language-use agreements are put in place so that companies collecting electronic data must receive informed consent from Canadians.</p><p>We will apply regulatory standards for the ethical and secure use of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things and create the Canada Cyber Safe brand to ensure that consumers know when products have met rigorous security standards.</p><p>An expert committee with industry leaders will define binding cyber security standards for critical infrastructure sectors and penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>Additionally, Canada's Conservatives will also establish a Cabinet Committee on Cyber Security and Data Privacy and conduct periodic cyber security penetration testing on all government departments and establish performance benchmarks for senior public servants</p><p>NDP: Recently, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada found Facebook had failed to take basic precautions or have adequate policies in place to protect users' information. More surprisingly, Facebook has refused to implement the Commissioners' recommendations, and the Commissioners warn that there is still a high risk that Canadians' personal information can be used and shared without their knowledge or consent. Facebook has been under the spotlight for over a year now for their privacy and business practices, from the Cambridge Analytica breach to the UN accusing the platform of having played a determining role in inciting a genocide in Myanmar. That they are refusing to actually improve their privacy policies at the direction of our regulators shows more cavalier disregard for not just Canadian laws, but for their own users' privacy rights. This Liberal government's cosy relationship with the American tech giants and their lobbyists means that they always put Canadians' privacy rights second. We need a government that will be willing to implement the all-party recommendations of the Ethics Committee and stand up to the web giants and their disregard for Canadian law. It's wrong that the Liberals and Conservatives always prefer to let private companies self-regulate instead of requiring them to do the right thing by putting the safety and privacy of Canadians before profits. New Democrats will prioritize the safety and privacy of Canadians.</p><p>Green Party: The Green Party believes that all Canadians have an inherent right to privacy, including online. Successive Canadian governments have failed to adequately modernize privacy protection digitally. We support the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Greens plan to modernize the existing Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act to the GPDR Standards. We do not believe that political parties should be exempt from these laws, and will apply the same standards to parties' collection and use of Canadians' data. We will regulate all tech companies, including tech Giants like Facebook and Google. We will make the penalties severe enough to get all companies' attention, and convince them to follow the law.</p><p>Maximum fines per violation would be set at a percentage of a company's global turnover.</p><p>We will: Ensure companies that are not located in Canada, but are operating here, pay the same taxes as Canadian companies and have social media companies ensure that racist and other discriminatory pages are not allowed to be posted, consistent with Canadian laws.</p><p>Also, all companies that have experienced a breech of their data must notify the Canadian government and the individual Canadians who have been affected. In addition, companies that sell programs or games, must allow the buyer to own a copy of the program or game, in the event the company goes out of business.</p><p>We will apply Canadian laws to all digital companies, including those companies based in other countries. We will force them to change their practices, to allow individuals to confirm what data they are willing to allow a company to collect. Canadian citizens must be able to access and download all the information any company has on them, and if they want their information deleted, they can ask the company to delete all their personal data, and the company must comply. It is essentially the right to be forgotten.</p><p>2. Quebec and Saskatchewan have required online foreign companies to collect provincial sales taxes since the start of the year. This has not happened at the federal level. So far Facebook has said it will start to collect the tax. Google and Netflix have said they will collect the tax when required by law to do so. An Auditor General report said in 2017 Ottawa could have collected $169 million in GST alone.</p><p>Would you require digital companies who have no substantial physical presence in Canada to collect the GST and PST on sales of subscriptions to Canadians?</p><p>Liberals: We are committed to ensuring that Canada's tax system is fair and supports an innovative economy. The issue of how to appropriately ensure web giants pay their fair share is not a uniquely Canadian problem - it is a global issue. That's why Canada is working with our international partners and the OECD to come up with a consensus-based approach. One that ensures every company pays their fair share, while also continuing to foster innovation and attract investment in the digital sector. With this in mind, we will continue to work with the OECD to develop an approach that is concerted, prudent, and fair for the middle class. (Note: This answer was given before the Liberals announced as part of their election platform that they would introduce a 3 per cent tax on the income of large digital companies operating in Canada. The party would ensure \"multinational tech giants pay corporate tax on the revenue they generate in Canada,\" according to a statement released by the party.)</p><p>Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren't subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.</p><p>Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.</p><p>We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.</p><p>NDP: The NDP is proposing a level playing field for all, where large foreign multinationals must pay their fair share. New Democrats will stand up to web giants and make sure they play by the same rules as Canadian companies. By taking this bold action, the government would recoup billions of dollars that could be used to make life more affordable for all Canadians, protect our content and culture, save local media, and create good quality jobs for the future.</p><p>Greens: We will tax online companies federally, not just on subscriptions.</p><p>3. In the European Union, some countries have required on-demand video services contribute investment into local content. Legacy Canadian broadcasters are required to put 5 per cent of their gross revenue into the Canadian Media Fund to produce Canadian content. (The CMF is a not-for-profit corporation that supports the Canadian television and digital media industries to produce original content.) Should foreign online platforms such as Netflix, Amazon and YouTube be required to put a percentage of their revenue into content?</p><p>Liberals: For 10 years, all the Conservatives did for culture was to cut. They ignored the struggles the industry was going through. The result is that our laws and tools predate the internet. We have committed to modernizing them to protect our culture on the web and that's what we're doing. We created an independent experts panel to help us bring the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Acts into the 21st century. Our end goal is clear: all players that participate in the system must contribute to the system. There will be no free rides.</p><p>Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren't subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.</p><p>Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.</p><p>We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.</p><p>NDP: The Minister of Canadian Heritage has failed to assume his responsibility in establishing a framework regarding the rise of on-demand video services. Rather than fixing this injustice, Justin Trudeau and his team went even further by signing a secret deal with Netflix without any consultation and without any guarantee of creating French content. The NDP think that Netflix and others should play by the same rules as other broadcasters and companies that operate in Canada.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>4. Cable service providers have had shrinking revenue in the digital age as competition from online platforms means fewer subscribers. Those providers place a percentage of their revenue into producing Canadian content, and the pot is shrinking. Would you support a move to have internet service providers, who have benefitted from the increased use of streaming services, also make similar financial contributions?</p><p>Liberals: (Same as answer 2)</p><p>Conservatives: We need to take action to review how innovative market solutions can help address these problems.</p><p>NDP: The main focus of the NDP would be to ensure that foreign multinationals are treated equally with Canadian companies and to make sure that internet services are affordable. We are paying some (of) the highest prices for broadband subscriptions in the world. This is wrong. The NDP has a clear vision for Canadian arts and culture including: protecting our heritage, supporting key Canadian institutions and providing an opportunity for our Canadian talent to thrive on digital and traditional platforms. We need more Canadian content. For this reason, we will find innovative ways to increase the funding of the Canada Media Fund.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>5. Under Section 19 of the Income Tax Act, domestic marketers who place advertisements in Canadian publications qualify for a tax deduction. But if they placed that ad in a foreign print publication, they wouldn't qualify. But the new digital reality means that if you advertise in the print edition of The New York Times, you wouldn't get a tax deduction, but if you did so in the online edition, you would. This has created an unlevel playing field for legacy publishers, diverting millions to major platforms like Google and Facebook. Would your party close that loophole?</p><p>Liberals: Canada is working with international partners and the OECD to examine the impacts of digitalization on some key aspects of the existing tax framework and to work toward a consensus-based approach.</p><p>Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not. Justin Trudeau has failed to create good policies. Conservatives will have more to say about our plan for a free, fair and sustainable press as the campaign continues.</p><p>NDP: Yes. There are many things that the federal government could and should do now to help solve this media crisis and closing the loophole at Section 19 of the Income Tax Act is clearly one of them. Section 19 was introduced in 1965 to encourage advertising spending in Canadian media - but instead it is now being used to support American multinationals like Facebook and Google that don't need it. Section 19 needs to be updated or reinterpreted to take into account online advertising. That idea was one of many recommendations made to the federal government in two different reports on the future of media, released in December 2016 and in June 2017. Many months of consultation went into those reports, and thousands of people were consulted, but the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Pablo Rodriguez, and the Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, have chosen to ignore the vast majority of those recommendations. This can't continue. The Liberals must act now to protect our medias, our democracy and our communities.</p><p>Greens: Yes.</p><p>6. Would you continue to provide ongoing and stable funding to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, maintaining or increasing current levels?</p><p>Liberals: After 10 years of cuts and partisan games under the Conservatives, we are proud to have reinvested $675M to better support our public broadcaster, in our first budget. We also put in place the first ever independent appointments process for CBC, and appointed accomplished individuals like Michael Goldbloom, Suzanne Gu\u00e8vremont, and Sandra Singh, rather than Conservative cronies. We firmly believe in the importance of CBC/Radio-Canada and of local news in all communities across the country. Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have openly said that they don't like journalists and could axe the CBC News division because they don't like the media calling them out for their inconsistencies.</p><p>Conservatives: When we look and see how much coverage is devoted on CBC to U.S. politics, the inner workings of U.S. politics, making sure that it's focused on the things that are going on here in Canada - Canada's Conservatives think that's something that many Canadians have said we should ensure that it's focused on the core mandate of being concentrated on Canada.</p><p>NDP: The CBC is an essential public service in a country like ours, where minority-language communities require regional news coverage in their own language. The NDP has a proud history of promoting our public broadcaster. In the last Parliament our MPs fought hard against the Conservatives' $115 million cut to CBC/Radio-Canada. We will release our vision for CBC in the near future!</p><p>Greens: We would continue, and expand funding for Canadian culture and the CBC.</p><p>7. If the CBC were to discontinue advertising, would your party support an advertising free environment, supported by taxpayers?</p><p>Liberals: The CBC is an autonomous Crown corporation responsible for managing its own operations.</p><p>Conservatives: We have to make sure the CBC's impact in that is not creating an undue hurdle against those private-sector entities that are trying to stay afloat and now have to compete with a government-subsidized entity that is also going out into the market to sell ads to get viewership</p><p>NDP: An advertisement free CBC is a fantastic idea in principle, but it does require further study. The main impediment is the revenue shortfall that would transpire. Current estimate reveals that this idea would cost $533 million annually.</p><p>Greens: Yes, we would.</p><p>8. Do you support federal aid for newspapers. If so, what measures would you propose?</p><p>Liberals: Canadian newspapers are taking a big hit by the media crisis. They have lost half of their jobs since 2010. We are going to the root of the problem and are creating concrete measures to support Canadian newspapers, big or small. Recently, our government announced the plan to introduce three new tax measures to support Canadian journalism estimated to provide approximately $595 million in support over five years. We must protect journalistic independence and that's why an independent experts panel will assist in implementing our investments. Journalism is at the core of our democracy, but Conservatives aren't one to miss an opportunity to attack its independence. The only type of media they're interested in are ones they control, like the Rebel, 24Seven, and Ontario News Now. They are into conspiracy theories and it's insulting to the intelligence of Canadians and the professionalism of journalists.</p><p>Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not.</p><p>NDP: In the wake of fake news, a strong, healthy and independent media industry is essential to our democracy. Our local newspapers have been put in a difficult financial position because of Liberal and Conservative governments refusal to equal the playing field and take away the tax holiday given to Facebook, Google and other internet giants. Our Quebec MPs like Pierre Nantel are the only ones who have been demanding action from the government for months. We believe any support package for the news media needs to be efficient, transparent and fair. The NDP will always fight to save our local medias while Liberals and Conservatives are playing partisan political games. You can expect further details in the near future.</p><p>Greens: In consideration.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

In Washington, Brussels and beyond, regulators and lawmakers are investigating whether the four technology companies have used their size and wealth to quash competition and expand their dominance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The newest probe hit Google, as leaders of every state except California and Alabama announced an investigation into the Mountain View company's \"potential monopolistic behavior.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Monday announcement closely followed one from a separate group of states Friday that disclosed an investigation into Facebook's market dominance. The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators.</p><p> And in Washington on Thursday, the House antitrust subcommittee is scheduled to hold its third hearing on the impact of competition on data and privacy.</p><p> The four firms are lumped together so often that they have become known as Big Tech. Their business models differ, as do the antitrust arguments against them. But those grievances have one thing in common: fear that too much power is in the hands of too few companies.</p><p> Here is the case against Big Tech \u2014 and what Big Tech has said in response.</p><p>Amazon: Favoring its own products? Over the years, politicians and regulators have floated the idea of breaking up of Amazon. That included spinning off its hugely profitable cloud computing business or rolling back its acquisition of Whole Foods.</p><p> But much of the recent scrutiny of Amazon in Europe and Washington centers on whether the company improperly favors its own products over those of third-party sellers, which depend on sales from the e-commerce giant. Regulators are also looking at whether sellers need to use certain Amazon services, like ads and its fulfillment network.</p><p> When Amazon began, it was mostly structured like a traditional retailer, buying products from brands and manufacturers at a wholesale price and selling the items to consumers.</p><p>Amazon has expanded what's available on its site by having third-party merchants sell products directly to customers. By 2018, 58% of the sales on Amazon were made by these outside sellers.</p><p> One line of antitrust questioning looks at the products that Amazon sells under its own brands, like AmazonBasics for batteries or Mama Bear for diapers and wipes. Amazon has more than 140 private labels, according to TJI Research.</p><p> Lawmakers have asked if Amazon takes advantage of data it collects from sellers to develop its own offerings. They have also questioned whether Amazon's products get preferential promotion on its site.</p><p>Amazon has told Congress that it uses aggregated data, not information \"related specifically to individual sellers,\" and that private-label products make up about 1% of total sales.</p><p>Amazon also faces questions about its growing advertising business, which had more than $10 billion in revenue last year.</p><p> At a House hearing in July, Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., asked a lawyer for Amazon what prevented it \"from using ads as another way to charge a toll for using its platforms.\"</p><p> The lawyer, Nate Sutton, who used to work at the antitrust division of the Justice Department, responded that the ads were \"an optional service\" and that the large majority of products sold on Amazon were not sold through advertisements.</p><p>Apple: App Store power: Apple's critics have homed in on its control of the App Store. The store has become a crucial way for digital businesses to reach customers, and Apple exerts strict control over its content.</p><p>Apple said it has the right to \"curate\" the store to ensure high quality and to rid the store of fraud. As a result, Apple's store generally includes fewer fraudulent apps than Google's.</p><p> But while Apple is the App Store's sole referee, it is also one of the biggest competitors on it. Apple has bet its future on getting customers to spend more on its apps and services, and that relies in part on people opting for them over the apps of rivals.</p><p> Some developers have accused Apple of abusing its control to harm competitors and benefit itself. Spotify has filed such a complaint with European regulators, and makers of parental-control apps have complained to regulators in Europe, Russia and the United States about Apple's restriction of their apps after the release of its own competing service.</p><p>Apple has said that it faces fierce competition and that it doesn't favor its own products; and that it isn't a monopoly because it doesn't have a majority share in most markets.</p><p>Facebook: social media consolidation: For years, venture capitalists and tech strategists have admired Mark Zuckerberg's foresight.</p><p> While many industry experts wondered during Facebook's early years whether it would turn out to be the next MySpace, Zuckerberg was searching for an edge to stave off any threats of digital irrelevance.</p><p> His efforts have worked \u2014 perhaps too well. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating what some have called Facebook's \"program of serial defensive acquisitions,\" a method of maintaining the company's dominance in social networking.</p><p> Regulators could claim the acquisitions were a violation of the Sherman and Clayton antitrust acts \u2014 two laws that have been foundational in the past century of federal antitrust prosecutions.</p><p> That could include some of Facebook's largest acquisitions, like Instagram, which it bought for $1 billion in 2012. Just two years later, Facebook spent $19 billion for WhatsApp, the global messaging application used by more than a billion people.</p><p> Competitors believe that long before Facebook bought either company, Zuckerberg kept a close eye on startups that could pose a threat. Facebook has acquired more than 70 companies over roughly 15 years.</p><p> For investigators, one other eyebrow-raising acquisition was Facebook's purchase of Onavo, a mobile analytics company, in 2013.</p><p>Onavo's apps were marketed as free products that allowed consumers to manage and compress their data and download rates, a cost savings for people who live in countries where unlimited data plans aren't common. But the service also gave Facebook insight into what new competitors were doing.</p><p>Facebook walked away from at least one acquisition late last year, the social video app Houseparty, for fear of attracting antitrust scrutiny in Washington, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p><p> It has also taken steps to improve its user data policies as a result of a previous FTC investigation into Facebook's privacy practices. The social network reached a settlement with the agency in July, paying $5 billion in fines and agreeing to some concessions involving improved oversight of the company.</p><p>Facebook has made the case that it faces stiff competition both at home and abroad, pointing to fast-rising competitors like Apple in the United States and WeChat in China. Further, as it testified before Congress in the summer, the company claims that the barriers to starting a would-be challenger to its business are lower than ever. Startups like Snapchat, TikTok and others have sprung up quickly over the past 10 years, snapping up early adopters and teenagers, a youthful demographic that Facebook \u2014 and its advertisers \u2014 value immensely.</p><p>Google: search results dominance: Google dominates several markets and could face antitrust claims in multiple jurisdictions.</p><p> One battle is likely to be in search. When Google debuted in 1996, its search results were a simple list of 10 blue links to websites it believed could answer the user's query.</p><p> \"We want to get you out of Google and to the right place as fast as possible,\" Larry Page, Google's co-founder, said in an interview with Playboy in 2004.</p><p> Years later, Google has changed from sending users elsewhere to answering their questions itself. It has crowded its search results with its own products and services, such as Google Maps, Google Images and Google Flights. Google has gotten so good at answering users' questions, more than half of Google searches now end on Google, without a click to another site, according to a recent analysis by Rand Fishkin, an online-search analyst.</p><p>Google's new approach has given users quicker answers. But some competitors argue that Google is abusing its dominance in search and inducing internet users to not click beyond Google, which starves those competitors of customers for their products or users to see ads on their sites.</p><p> How Google presents its search results could be subject to antitrust laws because it has an effective monopoly, handling more than 90% of searches worldwide, according to some estimates. Because Google has become the primary way customers find businesses, steering users to its own products could be considered anticompetitive behavior under some laws.</p><p> The FTC investigated Google for such a practice. They settled, and the agency did not conclude there was harm to consumers. In 2017, the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion for favoring its shopping service over rivals in search results.</p><p>Google has said that it faces ample competition and that its search engine is designed to give users the most relevant results, not favor itself.</p><p> While Google is known for search, it makes most of its money on digital ads. It dominates that market, too.</p><p> Over two decades, Google has built a complex web of services that underpin the sale of most ads on the internet. Google is the biggest seller of digital ad space. It is among the biggest providers of digital-ad analytics. And it is, in effect, the broker in most digital-ad transactions.</p><p> Competitors say Google has leveraged that control of the internet's ad ecosystem to push companies to use its advertising technology and buy its ads.</p><p> Brian O'Kelley, former chief executive of the ad-technology firm AppNexus, said Google had undercut his business. He argued that Google forced advertisers to use Google's competing ad technology if they wanted to work with other Google-owned services. And this year, the European Union fined Google $1.7 billion for imposing unfair terms on companies that used its search bar on their websites in Europe.</p><p>Google said in response to the fine that it had made several product changes to increase the visibility of competitors.</p><p> \"We've always agreed on one thing \u2014 that healthy, thriving markets are in everyone's interest,\" the company said.</p><p>Google's Android software backs at least 3 of every 4 of the world's smartphones, according to analysts' estimates. Google has achieved such scale by giving Android away for free \u2014 almost. In return for handset makers' use of its version of Android, Google has required them to place its search engine front and center on their phones and preinstall a series of other Google apps.</p><p> The strategy has helped Google broaden its dominance in online search, reach more than 1 billion monthly users across nine separate services and continue to expand its advertising business.</p><p> Regulators are considering whether Google unfairly leverages Android's dominance. Handset makers are effectively locked into Android because it is the only available smartphone software that hosts the apps that users demand, like Instagram and Uber. (Apple's software also hosts the apps but is exclusively for iPhones.) With that leverage, Google imposes unfair terms on the handset makers, critics have argued.</p><p> The European Union agreed, fining Google $5.1 billion last year.</p><p>Google has argued that Android has increased competition by enabling phone makers to compete with Apple.</p><p> The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p><p> Jack Nicas, Karen Weise and Mike Isaac are New York Times writers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-9cab3123318ef72926e3201a941ab7cd38a6655a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X17-G1C1-JBCN-420K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1959\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

In Washington, Brussels and beyond, regulators and lawmakers are investigating whether the four technology companies have used their size and wealth to quash competition and expand their dominance.</p><p>The four firms are lumped together so often that they have become known as Big Tech. Their business models differ, as do the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">antitrust</url> arguments against them. But those grievances have one thing in common: fear that too much power is in the hands of too few companies.</p><p>The attorney general of New York, Letitia James, said Friday that the attorneys general in eight states \u2014 she and three other Democrats, plus four Republicans \u2014 and the District of Columbia had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">begun an antitrust investigation of Facebook</url>.</p><p>On Monday, a separate bipartisan group led by eight attorneys general is expected to announce an investigation of Google, according to two people familiar with the plan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the official announcement.</p><p>And in Washington on Thursday, the House antitrust subcommittee is scheduled to hold its third hearing on the impact of competition on data and privacy.</p><p>Here is the case against Big Tech \u2014 and what Big Tech has said in response.</p><p>Amazon: Favoring its own products?</p><p>Over the years, politicians and regulators have floated the idea of breaking up of Amazon. That included spinning off its hugely profitable cloud computing business or rolling back its acquisition of Whole Foods.</p><p>But much of the recent scrutiny of Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">in Europe</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">and Washington</url> centers on whether the company improperly favors its own products over those of third-party sellers, which depend on sales from the e-commerce giant. Regulators are also looking at whether sellers need to use certain Amazon services, like ads and its fulfillment network, to sell their products.</p><p>When Amazon began, it was mostly structured like a traditional retailer, buying products from brands and manufacturers at a wholesale price and selling the items to consumers.</p><p>Amazon has expanded what\u2019s available on its site by having third-party merchants sell products directly to customers. By 2015, more than half the sales on Amazon \u2014 51 percent \u2014 were made by these outside sellers. Last year, that grew to 58 percent.</p><p>One line of antitrust questioning looks at the products that Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">sells under its own brands</url>, like AmazonBasics for batteries or Mama Bear for diapers and wipes. Amazon has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">more than 140 private labels</url>, according to TJI Research.</p><p>Lawmakers have asked if Amazon takes advantage of data it collects from sellers to develop its own offerings. They have also questioned whether Amazon\u2019s products get preferential promotion on its site.</p><p>Amazon has told Congress that it uses aggregated data like overall sales, not information \u201crelated specifically to individual sellers,\u201d and that private-label products make up about 1 percent of total sales.</p><p>Italy\u2019s antitrust authority <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">is looking</url> into whether Amazon gives better visibility and search rankings to sellers that ship products through its vast fulfillment network, which sellers pay to use. Lawmakers in Washington have asked similar questions.</p><p>Amazon counters that products sold via its logistics network do well in its algorithms because it provides a better and more reliable shipping experience for customers.</p><p>Amazon also faces questions about its growing advertising business, which had more than $10 billion in revenue this past year. Much of that came from product ads that show up high as sponsored listings in search results.</p><p>At a House hearing in July, Representative Val B. Demings, a Democrat from Florida, asked a lawyer for Amazon what prevented it \u201cfrom using ads as another way to charge a toll for using its platforms.\u201d</p><p>The lawyer, Nate Sutton, who used to work at the antitrust division of the Justice Department, responded that the ads were \u201can optional service\u201d and that the large majority of products sold on Amazon were not sold through advertisements.</p><p>Apple: The power of the App Store</p><p>Apple\u2019s critics have homed in on its control of the App Store, the digital marketplace for apps on iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. The App Store has become a crucial way for digital businesses to reach customers, and Apple exerts strict control over which companies can appear in the store and how.</p><p>Apple says it has the right to \u201ccurate\u201d the App Store to ensure high quality and to rid the store of fraud. As a result, Apple\u2019s store generally includes fewer fraudulent apps than Google\u2019s.</p><p>But while Apple is the App Store\u2019s sole referee, it is also one of the biggest competitors on it. Apple has bet its future on getting customers to spend more on its apps and services, and that relies in part on people opting for them over the apps of rivals.</p><p>Some app developers have accused Apple of abusing its control of the App Store to harm competitors and benefit itself. Spotify<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">has filed such a complaint with European regulators</url>, and makers of parental-control apps <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">have complained</url> to regulators in Europe, Russia and the United States about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">Apple\u2019s restriction of their apps</url> after the release of its own competing service.</p><p>Apple<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">has said that it faces fierce competition</url> and that it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">doesn\u2019t favor its own products</url> in the App Store; and that it isn\u2019t a monopoly because it doesn\u2019t have a majority share in most markets.</p><p>Facebook: Consolidation of social media</p><p>For years, venture capitalists and tech strategists across Silicon Valley have admired Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s foresight.</p><p>While many industry experts wondered during Facebook\u2019s early years whether it would turn out to be the next MySpace, Mr. Zuckerberg was always searching for an edge to stave off any threats of digital irrelevance for his company.</p><p>His efforts have worked \u2014 perhaps too well. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating what some have called Facebook\u2019s \u201cprogram of serial defensive acquisitions,\u201d a method of maintaining the company\u2019s dominance in social networking.</p><p>Regulators could claim the acquisitions were a violation of the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts \u2014 two laws that have been foundational in the past century of federal antitrust prosecutions.</p><p>That could include some of Facebook\u2019s largest acquisitions, like Instagram, the photo-sharing network that it bought for $1 billion in 2012. At the time, it was an enormous sum for a smartphone app. Just two years later, Facebook spent $19 billion for WhatsApp, the global messaging application used by more than a billion people.</p><p>Competitors believe that long before Facebook bought either of those companies, Mr. Zuckerberg kept a close eye on start-ups that could pose a threat to his company. Facebook has acquired more than 70 companies over roughly 15 years.</p><p>For investigators, one other eyebrow-raising acquisition was Facebook\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">purchase of Onavo</url>, a mobile analytics company, in 2013.</p><p>Onavo\u2019s apps were marketed as free products that allowed consumers to manage and compress their data and download rates, a cost savings for people who live in countries where unlimited data plans aren\u2019t common. But the service also gave Facebook insight into what new competitors were doing.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">Facebook walked away</url> from at least one acquisition late last year, the social video app Houseparty, for fear of attracting antitrust scrutiny from regulators in Washington, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p><p>It has also taken steps to improve its user data policies as a result of a previous Federal Trade Commission investigation into Facebook\u2019s privacy practices. The social network reached a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">settlement with the agency in July,</url> paying $5 billion in fines and agreeing to some concessions involving improved oversight of the company.</p><p>Facebook has made the case that it faces stiff competition both at home and abroad, pointing to fast-rising competitors like Apple in the United States and WeChat in China. Further, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">as it testified before Congress</url> in the summer, the company claims that the barriers to starting a would-be challenger to its business are lower than ever. Start-ups like Snapchat, TikTok and others have sprung up quickly over the past 10 years, snapping up early adopters and teenagers, a youthful demographic that Facebook \u2014 and its advertisers \u2014 value immensely.</p><p>Google: What appears in search results</p><p>Google is dominant in several different markets and could face antitrust claims in multiple jurisdictions.</p><p>One battle is likely to be in search. When Google debuted in 1996, its search results were a simple list of 10 blue links to websites it believed could answer the user\u2019s query. \u201cWe want to get you out of Google and to the right place as fast as possible,\u201d Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder, said in an interview with Playboy in 2004.</p><p>Years later, Google has changed from sending users elsewhere to answering their questions itself. It has crowded its search results with its own products and services, such as Google Maps, Google Images and Google Flights. Google has gotten so good at answering users\u2019 questions, more than half of Google searches now end on Google, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">without a click to another site</url>, according to a recent analysis by Rand Fishkin, an online-search analyst.</p><p>Google\u2019s new approach has given users quicker answers. But some competitors argue that Google is abusing its dominance in search and inducing internet users to not click beyond Google, which starves those competitors of customers for their products or users to see ads on their sites.</p><p>How Google presents its search results could be subject to antitrust laws because it has an effective monopoly, handling more than 90 percent of searches worldwide, according to some estimates. Because Google has become the primary way customers find businesses, steering users to its own products could be considered anticompetitive behavior under some laws.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission investigated Google for such a practice. They settled, and the agency did not conclude there was harm to consumers. In 2017, the European Union <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">fined Google $2.7 billion</url> for favoring its shopping service over rivals in search results.</p><p>Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">has said that it faces ample competition</url> and that its search engine is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">designed to give users the most relevant results</url>, not favor itself.</p><p>While Google is predominantly known for search, it makes most of its money on digital ads. It dominates that market, too.</p><p>Over two decades, Google has built a complex web of services that underpin the sale of most ads on the internet. Google is the biggest seller of digital ad space. It is among the biggest providers of digital-ad analytics. And it is, in effect, the broker in most digital-ad transactions.</p><p>Competitors say Google has leveraged that control of the internet\u2019s ad ecosystem to push companies to use its advertising technology and buy its ads.</p><p>Brian O\u2019Kelley, the former chief executive of the ad-technology firm AppNexus, said Google had undercut his business. He argued that Google forced advertisers to use Google\u2019s competing ad technology if they wanted to work with other Google-owed services. And this year, the European Union <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">fined Google $1.7 billion</url> for imposing unfair terms on companies that used its search bar on their websites in Europe.</p><p>Google said in response to the fine that it had made several product changes <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">to increase the visibility of competitors</url>. \u201cWe\u2019ve always agreed on one thing \u4e00 that healthy, thriving markets are in everyone\u2019s interest,\u201d the company said.</p><p>Google\u2019s Android software backs at least three of every four of the world\u2019s smartphones, according to analyst\u2019s estimates. Google has achieved such scale by giving Android away for free \u2014 almost. In return for handset makers\u2019 use of its version of Android, Google has required them to place its search engine front and center on their phones and preinstall a series of other Google apps.</p><p>The strategy has helped Google broaden its dominance in online search, reach more than a billion monthly users across nine separate services and continue to expand its advertising business.</p><p>Regulators are considering whether Google unfairly leverages Android\u2019s dominance. Handset makers are effectively locked into Android because it is the only available smartphone software that hosts the apps that users demand, like Instagram and Uber. (Apple\u2019s software also hosts the apps but is exclusively for iPhones.) With that leverage, Google imposes unfair terms on the handset makers, critics have argued.</p><p>The European Union agreed, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">fining Google $5.1 billion</url> last year.</p><p>Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">has argued</url> that Android has increased competition in the smartphone market by enabling phone makers to compete with Apple.</p><p>PHOTOS: Clockwise from top left: Amazon\u2019s fulfillment network; Apple\u2019s App Store draws criticism; Google\u2019s Android software; and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.

In Washington, Brussels and beyond, regulators and lawmakers are investigating whether the four technology companies have used their size and wealth to quash competition and expand their dominance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The four firms are lumped together so often that they have become known as Big Tech. Their business models differ, as do the antitrust arguments against them. But those grievances have one thing in common: fear that too much power is in the hands of too few companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The attorney general of New York, Letitia James, said Friday that attorneys general in eight states - she and three other Democrats, plus four Republicans - and the District of Columbia had begun an antitrust investigation of Facebook.</p><p>On Monday, a separate bipartisan group led by eight attorneys general is expected to announce an investigation of Google, according to two people familiar with the plan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the official announcement.</p><p>And in Washington on Thursday, the House antitrust subcommittee is scheduled to hold its third hearing on the impact of competition on data and privacy.</p><p>Here is the case against Big Tech - and what Big Tech has said in response.</p><p>Amazon: Favoring Its Own Products?</p><p>Over the years, politicians and regulators have floated the idea of breaking up of Amazon. That included spinning off its hugely profitable cloud computing business or rolling back its acquisition of Whole Foods.</p><p>But much of the recent scrutiny of Amazon in Europe and Washington centers on whether the company improperly favors its own products over those of third-party sellers, which depend on sales from the e-commerce giant. Regulators are also looking at whether sellers need to use certain Amazon services, like ads and its fulfillment network.</p><p>When Amazon began, it was mostly structured like a traditional retailer, buying products from brands and manufacturers at a wholesale price and selling the items to consumers.</p><p>Amazon has expanded what's available on its site by having third-party merchants sell products directly to customers. By 2018, 58% of the sales on Amazon were made by these outside sellers.</p><p>One line of antitrust questioning looks at the products that Amazon sells under its own brands, like AmazonBasics for batteries or Mama Bear for diapers and wipes. Amazon has more than 140 private labels, according to TJI Research.</p><p>Lawmakers have asked if Amazon takes advantage of data it collects from sellers to develop its own offerings. They have also questioned whether Amazon's products get preferential promotion on its site.</p><p>Amazon has told Congress that it uses aggregated data, not information 'related specifically to individual sellers,' and that private-label products make up about 1% of total sales.</p><p>Italy's antitrust authority is looking into whether Amazon gives better visibility and search rankings to sellers that ship products through its vast fulfillment network, which sellers pay to use. Lawmakers in Washington have asked similar questions.</p><p>Amazon also faces questions about its growing advertising business, which had more than $10 billion in revenue last year.</p><p>At a House hearing in July, Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., asked a lawyer for Amazon what prevented it 'from using ads as another way to charge a toll for using its platforms.'</p><p>The lawyer, Nate Sutton, who used to work at the antitrust division of the Justice Department, responded that the ads were 'an optional service' and that the large majority of products sold on Amazon were not sold through advertisements.</p><p>Apple: App Store Power</p><p>Apple's critics have homed in on its control of the App Store, the marketplace for apps on iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. The App Store has become a crucial way for digital businesses to reach customers, and Apple exerts strict control over its content.</p><p>Apple said it has the right to 'curate' the App Store to ensure high quality and to rid the store of fraud. As a result, Apple's store generally includes fewer fraudulent apps than Google's.</p><p>But while Apple is the App Store's sole referee, it is also one of the biggest competitors on it. Apple has bet its future on getting customers to spend more on its apps and services, and that relies in part on people opting for them over the apps of rivals.</p><p>Some app developers have accused Apple of abusing its control of the App Store to harm competitors and benefit itself. Spotify has filed such a complaint with European regulators, and makers of parental-control apps have complained to regulators in Europe, Russia and the United States about Apple's restriction of their apps after the release of its own competing service.</p><p>Apple has said that it faces fierce competition and that it doesn't favor its own products in the App Store; and that it isn't a monopoly because it doesn't have a majority share in most markets.</p><p>Facebook: Social Media Consolidation</p><p>For years, venture capitalists and tech strategists across Silicon Valley have admired Mark Zuckerberg's foresight.</p><p>While many industry experts wondered during Facebook's early years whether it would turn out to be the next MySpace, Zuckerberg was searching for an edge to stave off any threats of digital irrelevance.</p><p>His efforts have worked - perhaps too well. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating what some have called Facebook's 'program of serial defensive acquisitions,' a method of maintaining the company's dominance in social networking.</p><p>Regulators could claim the acquisitions were a violation of the Sherman and Clayton antitrust acts - two laws that have been foundational in the past century of federal antitrust prosecutions.</p><p>That could include some of Facebook's largest acquisitions, like Instagram, the photo-sharing network that it bought for $1 billion in 2012. Just two years later, Facebook spent $19 billion for WhatsApp, the global messaging application used by more than a billion people.</p><p>Competitors believe that long before Facebook bought either of those companies, Zuckerberg kept a close eye on startups that could pose a threat to his company. Facebook has acquired more than 70 companies over roughly 15 years.</p><p>For investigators, one other eyebrow-raising acquisition was Facebook's purchase of Onavo, a mobile analytics company, in 2013.</p><p>Onavo's apps were marketed as free products that allowed consumers to manage and compress their data and download rates, a cost savings for people who live in countries where unlimited data plans aren't common. But the service also gave Facebook insight into what new competitors were doing.</p><p>Facebook walked away from at least one acquisition late last year, the social video app Houseparty, for fear of attracting antitrust scrutiny from regulators in Washington, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p><p>It has also taken steps to improve its user data policies as a result of a previous FTC investigation into Facebook's privacy practices. The social network reached a settlement with the agency in July, paying $5 billion in fines and agreeing to some concessions involving improved oversight of the company.</p><p>Facebook has made the case that it faces stiff competition both at home and abroad, pointing to fast-rising competitors like Apple in the United States and WeChat in China. Further, as it testified before Congress in the summer, the company claims that the barriers to starting a would-be challenger to its business are lower than ever. Startups like Snapchat, TikTok and others have sprung up quickly over the past 10 years, snapping up early adopters and teenagers, a youthful demographic that Facebook - and its advertisers - value immensely.</p><p>Google: Search Results Dominance</p><p>Google is dominant in several different markets and could face antitrust claims in multiple jurisdictions.</p><p>One battle is likely to be in search. When Google debuted in 1996, its search results were a simple list of 10 blue links to websites it believed could answer the user's query. 'We want to get you out of Google and to the right place as fast as possible,' Larry Page, Google's co-founder, said in an interview with Playboy in 2004.</p><p>Years later, Google has changed from sending users elsewhere to answering their questions itself. It has crowded its search results with its own products and services, such as Google Maps, Google Images and Google Flights. Google has gotten so good at answering users' questions, more than half of Google searches now end on Google, without a click to another site, according to a recent analysis by Rand Fishkin, an online-search analyst.</p><p>Google's new approach has given users quicker answers. But some competitors argue that Google is abusing its dominance in search and inducing internet users to not click beyond Google, which starves those competitors of customers for their products or users to see ads on their sites.</p><p>How Google presents its search results could be subject to antitrust laws because it has an effective monopoly, handling more than 90% of searches worldwide, according to some estimates. Because Google has become the primary way customers find businesses, steering users to its own products could be considered anticompetitive behavior under some laws.</p><p>The FTC investigated Google for such a practice. They settled, and the agency did not conclude there was harm to consumers. In 2017, the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion for favoring its shopping service over rivals in search results.</p><p>Google has said that it faces ample competition and that its search engine is designed to give users the most relevant results, not favor itself.</p><p>While Google is predominantly known for search, it makes most of its money on digital ads. It dominates that market, too.</p><p>Over two decades, Google has built a complex web of services that underpin the sale of most ads on the internet. Google is the biggest seller of digital ad space. It is among the biggest providers of digital-ad analytics. And it is, in effect, the broker in most digital-ad transactions.</p><p>Competitors say Google has leveraged that control of the internet's ad ecosystem to push companies to use its advertising technology and buy its ads.</p><p>Brian O'Kelley, former chief executive of the ad-technology firm AppNexus, said Google had undercut his business. He argued that Google forced advertisers to use Google's competing ad technology if they wanted to work with other Google-owned services. And this year, the European Union fined Google $1.7 billion for imposing unfair terms on companies that used its search bar on their websites in Europe.</p><p>Google said in response to the fine that it had made several product changes to increase the visibility of competitors. 'We've always agreed on one thing-that healthy, thriving markets are in everyone's interest,' the company said.</p><p>Google's Android software backs at least 3 of every 4 of the world's smartphones, according to analysts' estimates. Google has achieved such scale by giving Android away for free - almost. In return for handset makers' use of its version of Android, Google has required them to place its search engine front and center on their phones and preinstall a series of other Google apps.</p><p>The strategy has helped Google broaden its dominance in online search, reach more than 1 billion monthly users across nine separate services and continue to expand its advertising business.</p><p>Regulators are considering whether Google unfairly leverages Android's dominance. Handset makers are effectively locked into Android because it is the only available smartphone software that hosts the apps that users demand, like Instagram and Uber. (Apple's software also hosts the apps but is exclusively for iPhones.) With that leverage, Google imposes unfair terms on the handset makers, critics have argued.</p><p>The European Union agreed, fining Google $5.1 billion last year.</p><p>Google has argued that Android has increased competition by enabling phone makers to compete with Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MYABUS-MYBUTOD2009201900013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MYABUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X45-84S1-F00C-636S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423900</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2007\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Myanmar Business Today All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Myanmar Business Today</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 20, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In Washington, Brussels and beyond, regulators and lawmakers are investigating whether the four technology companies have used their size and wealth to quash competition and expand their dominance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The four firms are lumped together so often that they have become known as Big Tech. Their business models differ, as do the antitrust arguments against them. But those grievances have one thing in common: fear that too much power is in the hands of too few companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The attorney general of New York, Letitia James, said Friday that the attorneys general in eight states - she and three other Democrats, plus four Republicans - and the District of Columbia had begun an antitrust investigation of Facebook.</p><p>On Monday, a separate bipartisan group led by eight attorneys general is expected to announce an investigation of Google, according to two people familiar with the plan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the official announcement.</p><p>And in Washington on Thursday, the House antitrust subcommittee is scheduled to hold its third hearing on the impact of competition on data and privacy.</p><p>Here is the case against Big Tech - and what Big Tech has said in response.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon: Favoring its own products?</emphasis></p><p>Over the years, politicians and regulators have floated the idea of breaking up of Amazon. That included spinning off its hugely profitable cloud computing business or rolling back its acquisition of Whole Foods.</p><p>But much of the recent scrutiny of Amazon in Europe and Washington centers on whether the company improperly favors its own products over those of third-party sellers, which depend on sales from the e-commerce giant. Regulators are also looking at whether sellers need to use certain Amazon services, like ads and its fulfillment network, to sell their products.</p><p>When Amazon began, it was mostly structured like a traditional retailer, buying products from brands and manufacturers at a wholesale price and selling the items to consumers.</p><p>Amazon has expanded what's available on its site by having third-party merchants sell products directly to customers. By 2015, more than half the sales on Amazon - 51 percent - were made by these outside sellers. Last year, that grew to 58 percent.</p><p>One line of antitrust questioning looks at the products that Amazon sells under its own brands, like AmazonBasics for batteries or Mama Bear for diapers and wipes. Amazon has more than 140 private labels, according to TJI Research.</p><p>Lawmakers have asked if Amazon takes advantage of data it collects from sellers to develop its own offerings. They have also questioned whether Amazon's products get preferential promotion on its site.</p><p>Amazon has told Congress that it uses aggregated data like overall sales, not information \"related specifically to individual sellers,\" and that private-label products make up about 1 percent of total sales.</p><p>Italy's antitrust authority is looking into whether Amazon gives better visibility and search rankings to sellers that ship products through its vast fulfillment network, which sellers pay to use. Lawmakers in Washington have asked similar questions.</p><p>Amazon counters that products sold via its logistics network do well in its algorithms because it provides a better and more reliable shipping experience for customers.</p><p>Amazon also faces questions about its growing advertising business, which had more than $10 billion in revenue this past year. Much of that came from product ads that show up high as sponsored listings in search results.</p><p>At a House hearing in July, Representative Val B. Demings, a Democrat from Florida, asked a lawyer for Amazon what prevented it \"from using ads as another way to charge a toll for using its platforms.\"</p><p>The lawyer, Nate Sutton, who used to work at the antitrust division of the Justice Department, responded that the ads were \"an optional service\" and that the large majority of products sold on Amazon were not sold through advertisements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple: The power of the App Store</emphasis></p><p>Apple's critics have homed in on its control of the App Store, the digital marketplace for apps on iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. The App Store has become a crucial way for digital businesses to reach customers, and Apple exerts strict control over which companies can appear in the store and how.</p><p>Apple says it has the right to \"curate\" the App Store to ensure high quality and to rid the store of fraud. As a result, Apple's store generally includes fewer fraudulent apps than Google's.</p><p>But while Apple is the App Store's sole referee, it is also one of the biggest competitors on it. Apple has bet its future on getting customers to spend more on its apps and services, and that relies in part on people opting for them over the apps of rivals.</p><p>Some app developers have accused Apple of abusing its control of the App Store to harm competitors and benefit itself. Spotify has filed such a complaint with European regulators, and makers of parental-control apps have complained to regulators in Europe, Russia and the United States about Apple's restriction of their apps after the release of its own competing service.</p><p>Apple has said that it faces fierce competition and that it  doesn't favor its own products in the App Store; and that it isn't a monopoly because it doesn't have a majority share in most markets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook: Consolidation of social media</emphasis></p><p>For years, venture capitalists and tech strategists across Silicon Valley have admired Mark Zuckerberg's foresight.</p><p>While many industry experts wondered during Facebook's early years whether it would turn out to be the next MySpace, Mr. Zuckerberg was always searching for an edge to stave off any threats of digital irrelevance for his company.</p><p>His efforts have worked - perhaps too well. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating what some have called Facebook's \"program of serial defensive acquisitions,\" a method of maintaining the company's dominance in social networking.</p><p>Regulators could claim the acquisitions were a violation of the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts - two laws that have been foundational in the past century of federal antitrust prosecutions.</p><p>That could include some of Facebook's largest acquisitions, like Instagram, the photo-sharing network that it bought for $1 billion in 2012. At the time, it was an enormous sum for a smartphone app. Just two years later, Facebook spent $19 billion for WhatsApp, the global messaging application used by more than a billion people.</p><p>Competitors believe that long before Facebook bought either of those companies, Mr. Zuckerberg kept a close eye on start-ups that could pose a threat to his company. Facebook has acquired more than 70 companies over roughly 15 years.</p><p>For investigators, one other eyebrow-raising acquisition was Facebook's purchase of Onavo, a mobile analytics company, in 2013.</p><p>Onavo's apps were marketed as free products that allowed consumers to manage and compress their data and download rates, a cost savings for people who live in countries where unlimited data plans aren't common. But the service also gave Facebook insight into what new competitors were doing.</p><p>Facebook walked away from at least one acquisition late last year, the social video app Houseparty, for fear of attracting antitrust scrutiny from regulators in Washington, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p><p>It has also taken steps to improve its user data policies as a result of a previous Federal Trade Commission investigation into Facebook's privacy practices. The social network reached a settlement with the agency in July, paying $5 billion in fines and agreeing to some concessions involving improved oversight of the company.</p><p>Facebook has made the case that it faces stiff competition both at home and abroad, pointing to fast-rising competitors like Apple in the United States and WeChat in China. Further, as it testified before Congress in the summer, the company claims that the barriers to starting a would-be challenger to its business are lower than ever. Start-ups like Snapchat, TikTok and others have sprung up quickly over the past 10 years, snapping up early adopters and teenagers, a youthful demographic that Facebook - and its advertisers - value immensely.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google: What appears in search results</emphasis></p><p>Google is dominant in several different markets and could face antitrust claims in multiple jurisdictions.</p><p>One battle is likely to be in search. When Google debuted in 1996, its search results were a simple list of 10 blue links to websites it believed could answer the user's query. \"We want to get you out of Google and to the right place as fast as possible,\" Larry Page, Google's co-founder, said in an interview with Playboy in 2004.</p><p>Years later, Google has changed from sending users elsewhere to answering their questions itself. It has crowded its search results with its own products and services, such as Google Maps, Google Images and Google Flights. Google has gotten so good at answering users' questions, more than half of Google searches now end on Google, without a click to another site, according to a recent analysis by Rand Fishkin, an online-search analyst.</p><p>Google's new approach has given users quicker answers. But some competitors argue that Google is abusing its dominance in search and inducing internet users to not click beyond Google, which starves those competitors of customers for their products or users to see ads on their sites.</p><p>How Google presents its search results could be subject to antitrust laws because it has an effective monopoly, handling more than 90 percent of searches worldwide, according to some estimates. Because Google has become the primary way customers find businesses, steering users to its own products could be considered anticompetitive behavior under some laws.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission investigated Google for such a practice. They settled, and the agency did not conclude there was harm to consumers. In 2017, the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion for favoring its shopping service over rivals in search results.</p><p>Google has said that it faces ample competition and that its search engine is designed to give users the most relevant results, not favor itself.</p><p>While Google is predominantly known for search, it makes most of its money on digital ads. It dominates that market, too.</p><p>Over two decades, Google has built a complex web of services that underpin the sale of most ads on the internet. Google is the biggest seller of digital ad space. It is among the biggest providers of digital-ad analytics. And it is, in effect, the broker in most digital-ad transactions.</p><p>Competitors say Google has leveraged that control of the internet's ad ecosystem to push companies to use its advertising technology and buy its ads.</p><p>Brian O'Kelley, the former chief executive of the ad-technology firm AppNexus, said Google had undercut his business. He argued that Google forced advertisers to use Google's competing ad technology if they wanted to work with other Google-owed services. And this year, the European Union fined Google $1.7 billion for imposing unfair terms on companies that used its search bar on their websites in Europe.</p><p>Google said in response to the fine that it had made several product changes to increase the visibility of competitors. \"We've always agreed on one thing \u4e00 that healthy, thriving markets are in everyone's interest,\" the company said.</p><p>Google's Android software backs at least three of every four of the world's smartphones, according to analyst's estimates. Google has achieved such scale by giving Android away for free - almost. In return for handset makers' use of its version of Android, Google has required them to place its search engine front and center on their phones and preinstall a series of other Google apps.</p><p>The strategy has helped Google broaden its dominance in online search, reach more than a billion monthly users across nine separate services and continue to expand its advertising business.</p><p>Regulators are considering whether Google unfairly leverages Android's dominance. Handset makers are effectively locked into Android because it is the only available smartphone software that hosts the apps that users demand, like Instagram and Uber. (Apple's software also hosts the apps but is exclusively for iPhones.) With that leverage, Google imposes unfair terms on the handset makers, critics have argued.</p><p>The European Union agreed, fining Google $5.1 billion last year.</p><p>Google has argued that Android has increased competition in the smartphone market by enabling phone makers to compete with Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006686033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X11-N8V1-JC85-N10Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2142\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We care about our country and want to work with our government to do good things,\u201d he added. \u201cBut look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Warren has built her campaign around a call for \u201cbig, structural change\u201d and has garnered significant support by releasing a series of detailed policy proposals like the one on how she would break up giant tech companies.</p><p>Shortly after The Verge published Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20756701/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-leak-audio-ftc-antitrust-elizabeth-warren-tiktok-comments\">Ms. Warren responded on Twitter</url>. And she did not mince words.</p><p>\u201cWhat would really \u2018suck,\u2019\u201d she said, mimicking Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s language, \u201cis if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d</p><p>The exchanges didn\u2019t end there. Mr. Zuckerberg commented on the situation later on Tuesday in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20756701/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-leak-audio-ftc-antitrust-elizabeth-warren-tiktok-comments\">Facebook post</url>, and Ms. Warren again took to Twitter, firing off       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20756701/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-leak-audio-ftc-antitrust-elizabeth-warren-tiktok-comments\">a five-tweet thread</url> that began: \u201cLet\u2019s talk a bit about my plan to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20756701/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-leak-audio-ftc-antitrust-elizabeth-warren-tiktok-comments\">#BreakUpBigTech</url> and why it\u2019s got Mark Zuckerberg so worked up.\u201d</p><p>The episode had the effect of publicly pitting one of the leading Democratic presidential candidates against the chief executive of the world\u2019s largest social network.

Kurita sketched out one of the first emojis in 1999 for an early mobile Internet platform.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DUBAI: What started as a Japanese invention has taken the world by storm, including in the Middle East where the use of emojis, a modern picture-based form, often features in online and phone texts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today is World Emoji Day, marking the rapidly evolving system that some suggest is a \"major throwback\" to primitive picture-based communication forms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the use of emojis in the Middle East has shown how these simple images help to cross language barriers \u2014 there's little confusion over the smiley face, although the same cannot be said for some of the other images.</p><p>The culture of emojis has become so significant that a film has been made about them, \"The Emoji Movie,\" which was the first feature to receive a public screening in Saudi Arabia when the ban on cinemas was lifted in 2018.</p><p>The concept was created in 1999 by a Japanese artist, Shigetaka Kurita, to convey information such as the weather and traffic without having to spell out words like \"cloudy\" or \"traffic jam,\" for an early mobile Internet platform.</p><p>Big tech firms such as Apple and Google picked up on the trend, which eventually led to its worldwide use.</p><p>The use of emojis, like any language, is constantly evolving, and the California-based non-profit corporation Unicode Consortium, the international body that regulates the use of text in digital platforms allowing users from all over the world to view web-based text in different languages and scripts, has devised a system that has standardized the process.</p><p>The fad quickly reached Arab and Muslim mobile users, who in 2015 were recognized in a new set of emojis that were culturally relevant to them \u2014 the Kaaba, prayer beads known as masbaha, and the flag of the Palestinian territories. In the Unicode 2017 update, the hijab emoji was added, demonstrating how emojis become relevant for different communities.</p><p>\"Emojis help us express our feelings, in terms of happiness, anger, surprise, shocks and so on. Emojis, right now, are considered a language themselves,\" Omar Sattar, a language professor at Skyline University Collegein Sharjah, UAE, said, adding that emojis \"sometimes convey more than words.\"</p><p>\"Words are not as effective, as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words,\" said Sattar, referring to the human inclination to use symbols and pictures to communicate.</p><p>Some linguists say that emojis are comparable to prehistoric communication systems, when the first humans carved symbols on cave walls, using them to convey and store information.</p><p>Linguist Vyv Evans, writing for the British newspaper The Guardian, suggested emojis were like the Egyptian hieroglyphs, the formal writing system of ancient Egypt.</p><p>Today, in an almost 360-degree turn, humans are using pictures again to talk to each other, especially when in 2007 emojis were officially recognized by the Unicode Consortium.</p><p>Tech giants Apple and Google then created a separate keyboard for emojis, further normalizing their use. Others adopted it, with organizations such as the EU using in official communications.</p><p>\"Emojis have become part of our lives,\" Sattar said. \"We use them on a daily basis. Everybody uses them to express their feelings and emotions. Using them in official communication has become normal, especially when it comes to marketing and customer service. People actually react more when they see pictures.\"</p><p>He said emojis, now at about 3,000 in number, have become a universal language that \"transcends borders,\" given that people \"don't have to learn grammar and or alphabets to be able to use emojis, as opposed to an actual language like Arabic or English.\"</p><p>But Sattar said emojis were not going to replace words. \"We have more and more emojis, and it's going to be very difficult to remember all of these things, what they mean exactly, and how to use them correctly,\" he said.</p><p>\"We also need to remember that different platforms use different pictures \u2014 they are not the same. It's going to be really difficult to remember and memorize all of these different emojis that would sometimes mean the same but would look different.\"</p><p>Culture plays a crucial role in understanding and using emojis, said Sattar, explaining how one emoji can mean different things to people.</p><p>He said although emojis are a modern way of communication, they are still governed by cultural norms and can easily be taken out of context \u2014 in some cases to the point where people are jailed.</p><p>Reports by UAE dailies Khaleej Times and Emarat Al-Youm said a man was accused of defaming his colleague when he commented on a social media post with a fox emoji. The fox emoji signified cunning, deceit and trickery for the receiver, who filed a case against the sender.</p><p>Another problematic emoji in the region is the middle finger, which under UAE law is considered a form of indecent communication and could cause legal trouble for senders or land them in jail.</p><p>However, courts consider the relationship between the two communicating sides before giving a final verdict, ensuring there is a genuine intent to offend, lawyer Hamad Al-Debani told Emarat Al-Youm.</p><p>There are other emojis that could be deemed offensive in the region, including a number of animals, food and gestures.</p><p>Emojis help us express our feelings in terms of happiness, anger, surprise, shocks and so on. Emojis, right now, are considered a language in themself.</p><p>Omar Sattar. Language professor at Skyline University College</p><p>Since Muslims are prohibited from consuming pork and consider the pig as a dirty animal, the emoji should be used with caution. Dogs are another animal that can be used as an insult or a curse against other people in Arabic.</p><p>Emojis of alcoholic drinks could also be seen as offensive, as they go against Islamic traditions. In some Arab regions, the hand gesture where the index finger and thumb form an \"O\" and which means OK in a number of countries, signifies a threat and warning to the receiver.</p><p>In 2015, a virtual keyboard app company, Swiftkey, conducted a study on how speakers of different languages used emojis. They concluded that Arabic speakers use flowers and plants emojis four times more than average, and, are among the least likely to use alcohol-themed emojis.</p><p>They are also likely to use fruit emojis, dancing lady in red and stars. The most-used insect emoji by Arabic speakers is the ant, and among the flowers it is the rose.</p><p>Despite the early popularity of emojis, they did not always have as much variety as they do now. Between 2012 and 2015, a wave of popular demand for emojis to become more inclusive and representative in skin color and other specifications was on the rise, and Unicode adopted a set of new icons.</p><p>The new update made it possible for users to change the skin tone of some emojis, specifically those that represented people and not just emotions.</p><p>There remains a plethora of emojis with cultural significance that are missing from the selection. For instance, although a number of Arabic dishes have an international presence, such as shawarma and falafel, they are still absent from emoji options.</p><p>However, Unicode accepts proposals for characters and fonts to be added if a proposal has not been submitted earlier. This means that with each update, the selection becomes more diverse and inclusive.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/7/9/74/156333429697.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/7/9/74/156333429697.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/7/9/93/156333430177.png\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/7/9/93/156333430177.png</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/7/9/63/156333430793.png\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/7/9/63/156333430793.png</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/7/9/17/156333430895.png\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/7/9/17/156333430895.png</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARBUNW-149355434</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARBUNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKD-SFV1-F11P-X55B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343613</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1259\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Arab News - Saudi Research &amp; Publishing Co.

At a time when the country is not united about much, we watched the executives of Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google face hostility from both sides of the aisle. It turns out that tech monopolies are one foe upon which we all agree.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In venture capital, we know the issues well. Our startups compete in a landscape dominated by these incumbents. In one view, the startup ecosystem benefits from the role these giants play. Startups build off the technologies they spin out. Venture investors reinvest the capital incumbents provide when they acquire successful startups.</p><p> The other view is less rosy. This perspective recognizes that market concentration is a dampener on innovation. Venture capitalists are less likely to fund startups that compete against monopolies' core products. There is a name for this: innovation kill zones.</p><p> Innovation kill zones are real. Try pitching a venture firm on your new search engine. Or how about that ad network you have dreamt up. You get the idea. Big Tech has moats that entrench their market power. These moats drive down the odds of funding a startup that competes against them.</p><p> As a startup investor, I see this often. For example, I will meet yet another founder who wants to disrupt Microsoft's LinkedIn. They will have a clever plan to build a better professional social network. I always pass on the investment. It is nearly impossible to overcome the monopoly LinkedIn enjoys. It is but one example of an innovation kill zone.</p><p> The entrenchment of Big Tech has worsened. The five largest domestic companies by market value are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook. Combined, they represent 18% of the total market value of the U.S. stock market. In a clear signal of their market power, they operate with gross profit margins between four to eight times the S&amp;P 500 average.</p><p> In the 20th century, the United States led on antitrust. We ensured that we had competitive free markets. But we can no longer claim this. Europe adopted the U.S. regulatory model and has kept truer to it than we have. For the past 20 years, Europe has taken the lead in creating competitive markets.</p><p> Competition requires free entry of new competitors. A company competes not only with existing firms but also with upstarts building better products and approaches. You do not have robust free-market competition without this. This innovation drives the American economy. Without free entry into markets, innovation grinds to a halt.</p><p> The solution is to restore the free entry by startups. The Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission must root out kill zones so that startup innovation can thrive. These agencies have both the authority and the support of the country to do so.</p><p> In some cases, this could involve traditional breakups. Breakups, though, are an old frame for thinking about antitrust. With technology companies, breakups risk the double sin of doing too much and not enough \u2014 too much by degrading tech products' integrated consumer experiences; too little when a breakup leaves behind the same problems we seek to fix. Splitting Facebook into parts replaces one entrenched data monopoly with several.</p><p> There is a better remedy. It is to create data portability, open standards and interoperability for their monopoly products. The data pools these companies hold are their most valuable assets. Our government needs to build the pipes into their moats.</p><p> How could that look? Imagine third-party app stores. Apple would certify compliance for security, ethics and privacy. If Apple did not act in good faith, the Federal Trade Commission could oversee certification. The App Store, with its hefty 30% revenue toll on the entire app ecosystem, would have to compete on price and services. Imagine the same approach forcing Facebook to open its social graph. Competitors would interoperate with Facebook the same as Instagram and WhatsApp do today.</p><p> There are efforts under way that deserve support. The Data Transfer Project is a voluntary collaboration by some of these companies to respond to these criticisms. It is laudable, but it is not an industry-wide effort. Nor is it satisfactory in its results so far. Meanwhile in Congress, the bipartisan-sponsored Access Act would force data portability and interoperability.</p><p> These changes would open the gates to true competition. Innovation would thrive as entrepreneurs unleash their creative energies. New experiences and products would emerge in social media, search, app delivery, commerce and so on. The economy and consumers will be the winners.</p><p> Paul Arnold is a venture capitalist in San Francisco and the founder of Switch Ventures. His great-grandfather, Thurman Arnold, led the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice from 1938 to 1943.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-9515d13df3f7968fe2c766e135f394719de713</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KN-DP21-DXVP-V30T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) are seen as almost invincible and at The Times CEO Summit last week most participants argued for regulatory solutions to cut them down to size.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dame Carolyn McCall, ITV's chief executive, called for Googleand Facebook to be regulated as if they were publishers to create a \"level playing field\". Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the RSA, said that Amazon ought to be broken up.</p><p>Only Jan Hammer, a partner of Index Ventures, argued that it was possible to out-compete the Faangs. On the face of it, that sounds impossible. Their prodigious cashflow lets them invest vast sums in blue-sky projects as well as conventional capex, giving them a huge advantage over start-ups. Their big and well-developed regulatory arms are another advantage. They can suck up talent with lavish share option packages to crowd out rivals.</p><p>Yet there are ways in which the Faangs are being out-competed. Here's one example: think about how you look at the weather forecast online. Five years ago you would probably have typed \"weather\" into Google. Today you probably have a weather app on your phone. Googlehas, in this instance, been superseded. It may only be in one small product area and will not hit Google's revenues meaningfully but still it shows how Faangs can be displaced.</p><p>There are other examples. Mr Hammer cited Farfetch, the website based in London that competes with Amazon in luxury fashion, and Criteo in Paris, which is taking on Googlein targeted advertising.</p><p>The dominance of the Faangs was made possible in part by the \"platform' model\", which offers a one-stop shop. It enables the platform to have scale and add services relatively cheaply. Arguably, the likes of Googleand Facebook are now so dominant that the entry barriers to creating a successful new platform are too high. Yet other growth drivers are taking hold, such as cybersecurity, voice recognition, augmented reality, blockchain and artificial intelligence, all of which have the potential to give rise to new tech giants. The Faangs may also find themselves out-competed in sectors where they are relative newcomers.</p><p>Mr Hammer argued: \"There is an opportunity to build businesses that just are better technologically. Entrepreneurs [should] rise to that opportunity, see the world as one global market and go and compete in transport, food, pharmaceuticals and other industries where Googleis investing its profits.\"</p><p>Viable competitors already exist. China has Bat (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent), which dominate search, ecommerce and, increasingly, payments. So far they have preferred to operate mainly at home but they could conceivably go toe-to-toe with some of the Faangs in future. Alibaba, in particular, looks to be an extremely potent threat to Amazon.</p><p>In his book The Four, Scott Galloway, professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, notes that today's tech giants all had to take on dominant businesses such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard. Apple got a toe in the market by targeting individuals rather than the corporate market. Googleand Facebook overcame Yahoo and MySpace respectively by positioning themselves as smaller, safer, humbler players.</p><p>Mr Galloway adds: \"There is no reason to believe that these strategies - insurgency, false humility, security and simplicity plus discounting - won't work again one day against [the giants].</p><p>\"Giant companies face their own challenges: they lose their best talent to more rewarding start-ups; their physical plant grows old; their empires grow so big they can no longer co-ordinate their pieces; they get distracted by investigations from envious or nervous governments.\"</p><p>Gravity will ultimately catch up with some or all of the Faangs.
