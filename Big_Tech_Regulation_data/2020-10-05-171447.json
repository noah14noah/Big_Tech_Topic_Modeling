Apple paid  13.1 billion in back taxes and  1.2 billion in interest after the Commission ruled in 2016 that Ireland had given the firm unlawful state aid via two tax rulings in 1991 and 2007.</p><p>The court's decision could impact other state-aid cases against companies including Amazon.com Inc., Nike Inc. and French energy company Engie SA, lawyers said. While the cases are not directly comparable, the Apple case shows it is \"completely acceptable\" for companies to enjoy tax advantages according to jurisdiction, Olivier Van Ermengem, a tax partner at Linklaters, said. The Amazon and Engie cases involve tax base reductions in Luxembourg, while the Nike case concerns alleged aid from the Netherlands.</p><p>\"All these cases are linked together in the sense that they involve the EC trying to find a way to combat these tax planning techniques,\" Henk Verstraete, a tax partner at Stibbe in Brussels, said, adding that it is \"difficult to predict\" whether any appeals against the EC's other decisions in this area will be impacted by the Apple case.</p><p>Apple's victory does not give companies carte blanche when it comes to arranging advantageous tax deals, lawyers said.</p><p>\"The court's [July 15] judgment confirms what most would have thought: That this ruling was linked to a historic decision,\" Peter Vale, head of international tax at Ireland-based law firm Thornton Vale, said. \"We no longer have the same corporate tax systems legally as we did 10 or 15 years ago and the pursuit of an aggressive tax advantage is generally viewed as immoral.\"</p><p>\"This case showed that the creation of a business-friendly tax environment by a member state is not in itself state aid or something that should be condemned,\" Van Ermengem said. \"But you still need to play by the rules, and it is up to the EC to prove that you did not.\"</p><p>Though the EC can appeal the decision, the tax lawyers believe it may have exhausted the legal route. The regulator's Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager could look for a political solution instead, they said.</p><p>Vestager said in a statement that the EC would study the judgment and consider its next steps, adding that it \"will continue to look at aggressive tax planning measures under EU state aid rules to assess whether they result in illegal state aid.\"</p><p>In recent years, the EU has passed two laws to ensure companies, particularly big tech firms and other multinationals, pay enough tax. Known as the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives, the rules are aimed at closing loopholes to ensure businesses are taxed in the country where the parent company is based, even if they shift profits to offshore tax havens. The law also seeks to stop EU companies from moving new products to lower-tax regions to avoid being taxed.</p><p>The directives restrict firms from reducing the tax they have to pay by paying excessive interest charges to another company, usually one located in a different country.</p><p>These laws, which require the unanimous support of all EU member states in order to be passed, mean that the EU \"has already walked the political path quite heavily,\" Van Ermengem said.</p><p>The Apple ruling arrived on the same day as the EC announced a new tax package to support the region's economic recovery amid the coronavirus pandemic. \"Today's Package seeks to boost tax fairness, by intensifying the fight against tax abuse, curbing unfair tax competition and increasing tax transparency,\" the EU's executive arm said.</p><p>Countries like Ireland and Luxembourg that boast \"business-friendly tax measures\" may not therefore have the appetite for more directives, according to Verstraete. That leaves the EU with few options on the table, he said. \"The Commission has lost its leverage as a result of this ruling,\" Verstraete said.</p><p>As for Apple, the EU ruling marks a huge win for the firm, which has long faced accusations of tax evasion. According to company filings, between 2015 and 2019 Apple paid a total of $16.45 billion in foreign taxes on overseas pretax earnings of $225.7 billion.</p><p>\"Changes in how a multinational company's income tax payments are split between different countries require a global solution, and Apple encourages this work to continue,\" an Apple spokesperson said, adding it is proud to be the \"largest taxpayer in the world.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-59464671</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DJ-C331-JDVW-N1JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

(Emma Howells/The New York Times)     - +   class=\"preParagraphUS Steel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> General Motors. ATandT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Exxon Mobil. Small potatoes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Apple on Thursday reached a milestone that these icons of capitalism never dreamed of: a market value of more than $1 trillion. That landmark is the result of an extraordinary corporate success story.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In a span of just 21 years, a near-bankrupt computer-maker evolved into the most valuable publicly traded company in the United States, one whose innovative products have reshaped swaths of everyday life. But Apple's new 13-figure valuation also highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the US economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s. The effect of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies -- led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google -- has fuelled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade.</p><p> But the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets -- and they are not entirely benign. Economists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lacklustre wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the US.</p><p> The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in. \"It's one of the most important trends that we're experiencing,\" said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva.</p><p> \"It's really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare.\" In the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among US companies.</p><p> In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by just 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M.</p><p> Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Rene M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.</p><p> The difference between how much it costs US companies to make their products and how much they sell those products for -- a metric of the power that companies possess in their markets -- is at its highest level since at least 1950, according to a 2017 paper by two economists, Jan De Loecker of Princeton and Jan Eeckhout of University College London. More than three quarters of all US industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyse proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by MrMichaely, along with Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and Yelena Larkin of York University in Toronto.</p><p> A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration -- in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits -- is real and may be long-lasting. \"The number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,\" said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon.</p><p> The consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the US economy. Apple and Google, for example, provide the software for 99%of all smartphones.</p><p> Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the US. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.</p><p> But the trend is not confined to technology. Today, almost half of all the assets in the US financial system are controlled by five banks.</p><p> In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. During the past decade, six of the largest US airlines merged into three.</p><p> Four companies now control 98%of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge. Consolidation begets profits.</p><p> \"Whoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors, said Ms Larkin, who has studied the effect of corporate consolidation on financial markets. That is great news for the stock markets.</p><p> This year, five tech companies -- Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google's parent, Alphabet -- have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1-trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels.</p><p> It is currently valued at more than $880 billion. Of course, this is only good as long as profits keep pouring in.</p><p> If the tech companies' shares start to sputter, \"it's going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up,\" said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market. And in the labour market, scholars have linked corporate consolidation to rising income inequality and the declining share of the nation's wealth that goes to workers.</p><p> The so-called labour share of the economy has been declining in the US and other rich countries since the 1990s, coinciding with the trend toward corporate concentration. And that decline has been most pronounced in industries undergoing the greatest consolidation.</p><p> Economists disagree about cause and effect. Some say that companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labour.</p><p> Other economists argue that with fewer companies in a given industry, there is simply less competition for workers and therefore little pressure to give raises to workers. That may be especially true in industries where skills are highly specialised, because it is harder for workers to look elsewhere for better pay.</p><p> Recent research has highlighted examples of companies colluding to keep wages low by agreeing not to poach each other's workers and by inserting provisions into workers' contracts that bar them from joining competitors. Some on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionisation, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favour.</p><p> Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers. Although companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible.</p><p> They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right.</p><p> The same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the crosshairs of governments around the world. Google was recently fined a record $5 billion by European antitrust regulators who accused the search giant of abusing its market position by forcing mobile phone companies to install Google apps on their phones.</p><p> Facebook is being forced by angry politicians and regulators to do more to safeguard users' data and to prevent its platform from being used to interfere with US elections. Last week, Facebook reported that its growth was slowing and it was increasing spending on privacy and security.</p><p> Its shares plunged 19%, lopping roughly $120 billion of the company's market value in a single day. And President Donald Trump has repeatedly taken aim at Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive.</p><p> Mr Trump -- who has expressed anger about coverage of his administration in The Washington Post, which Mr Bezos bought in 2013 -- has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes and of taking advantage of the US Postal Service. If Mr Trump's rhetoric translates into policy changes, it could hit Amazon's bottom line.</p><p> Apple this week reported better-than-expected quarterly profit, setting the stage for its market value to top $1 trillion. But executives issued a cautionary note: The trade war with China -- where Apple generates about 18%of its revenue -- threatens the company's ability to keep raking in profits at its current clip.</p><p> \"A year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable,\" said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behaviour. \"Today, they seem not to be.</p><p>\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG03082018018107</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SY7-DBP1-F00C-61DB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 3, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002C1P</classCode><className>EXXON MOBIL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>XOM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N523210MM</classCode><className>STOCK EXCHANGES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI</classCode><className>Stock Exchanges</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000718</classCode><className>FINANCIAL RESULTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000550</classCode><className>ECONOMIC GROWTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00096UR</classCode><className>INCOME DISTRIBUTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000A498</classCode><className>MIDDLE INCOME PERSONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000A4IH</classCode><className>PRODUCT INNOVATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N611310SS</classCode><className>COLLEGES &amp;

General Motors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ATandT. Exxon Mobil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Small potatoes.Apple on Thursday reached a milestone that these icons of capitalism never dreamed of: a market value of more than $1 trillion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That landmark is the result of an extraordinary corporate success story. In a span of just 21 years, a near-bankrupt computer-maker evolved into the most valuable publicly traded company in the United States, pushing the tech industry away from big, bulky machines and producing some of the worlds most popular consumer products, like the iMac, the iPod and the iPhone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Apples products have reshaped swaths of everyday life.But Apples new 13-figure valuation also highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the US economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s.The effect of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies mdash led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google mdash has fuelled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade.</p><p>But the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets mdash and they are not entirely benign.Lacklustre wage growthEconomists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lacklustre wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States.</p><p> The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in.Its one of the most important trends that were experiencing, said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva.</p><p>Its really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare. In the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among US companies.</p><p> In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by just 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M.</p><p> Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Reneacute M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.</p><p>On Tuesday, Apple reported the latest in a string of strong quarterly earnings, with its profit increasing to $11.52 billion, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier. The report helped bolster the companys stock price as of Thursday, Apples shares were trading at $207.39.The difference between how much it costs US companies to make their products and how much they sell those products for mdash a metric of the power that companies possess in their markets mdash is at its highest level since at least 1950, according to a 2017 paper by two economists, Jan De Loecker of Princeton and Jan Eeckhout of University College London.</p><p>More than three quarters of all US industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyse proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by Michaely, along with Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and Yelena Larkin of York University in Toronto.A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration mdash in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits mdash is real and may be long-lasting.</p><p>The number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable, said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon.The consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the US economy.</p><p>When the iPhone was introduced in 2007, it quickly transformed the way society interacts with technology. More than 1.</p><p>4 billion have been sold since.99 per centApple and Google combined now provide the software for 99 per cent of all smartphones.</p><p> Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.</p><p>But the trend is not confined to technology.Today, almost half of all the assets in the US financial system are controlled by five banks.</p><p> In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. During the past decade, six of the largest US airlines merged into three.</p><p> Four companies now control 98 per cent of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge.Consolidation begets profits.</p><p> Whoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors, said Larkin, who has studied the effect of corporate consolidation on financial markets.That is great news for the stock markets.</p><p> This year, five tech companies mdash Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Googles parent, Alphabet mdash have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard andPoors 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1 trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels.</p><p> It is currently valued at more than $880 billion.Of course, this is only good as long as profits keep pouring in.</p><p> If the tech companies shares start to sputter, its going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up, said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market.And in the labour market, scholars have linked corporate consolidation to rising income inequality and the declining share of the nations wealth that goes to workers.</p><p> The so-called labour share of the economy has been declining in the United States and other rich countries since the 1990s, coinciding with the trend toward corporate concentration. And that decline has been most pronounced in industries undergoing the greatest consolidation.</p><p>Dominant marketEconomists disagree about cause and effect. Some say that companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labour.</p><p>Other economists argue that with fewer companies in a given industry, there is simply less competition for workers and therefore little pressure to give raises to workers. That may be especially true in industries where skills are highly specialised, because it is harder for workers to look elsewhere for better pay.</p><p> Recent research has highlighted examples of companies colluding to keep wages low by agreeing not to poach each others workers and by inserting provisions into workers contracts that bar them from joining competitors.Some on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionisation, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favour.</p><p> Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers.Although companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible.</p><p> They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right.</p><p>The same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the cross hairs of governments around the world.$5 billion fineGoogle was recently fined a record $5 billion by European antitrust regulators who accused the search giant of abusing its market position by forcing mobile phone companies to install Google apps on their phones.</p><p>Facebook is being forced by angry politicians and regulators to do more to safeguard users data and to prevent its platform from being used to interfere with US elections. Last week, Facebook reported that its growth was slowing and it was increasing spending on privacy and security.</p><p> Its shares plunged 19 per cent, lopping roughly $120 billion of the companys market value in a single day.And President Donald Trump has repeatedly taken aim at Jeff Bezos, Amazons chief executive.</p><p> Trump mdash who has expressed anger about coverage of his administration in The Washington Post, which Bezos bought in 2013 mdash has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes and of taking advantage of the US Postal Service. If Trumps rhetoric translates into policy changes, it could hit Amazons bottom line.</p><p>Apples better-than-expected quarterly profit set the stage for its market value to top $1 trillion. But executives issued a cautionary note: The trade war with China mdash where Apple generates about 18 per cent of its revenue mdash threatens the companys ability to keep raking in profits at its current clip.</p><p>A year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable, said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behaviour. Today, they seem not to be.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

General Motors. AT...Exxon Mobil. Small potatoes.Apple on Thursday reached a milestone that these icons of capitalism never dreamed of: a market value of more than $1 trillion. That landmark is the result of an extraordinary corporate success story. In a span of just 21 years, a near-bankrupt computer-maker evolved into the most valuable publicly traded company in the United States, pushing the tech industry away from big, bulky machines and producing some of the world's most popular consumer products, like the iMac, the iPod and the iPhone. Apple's products have reshaped swaths of everyday life. Most Read Business Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]But Apple's new 13-figure valuation also highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the U.S. economy. Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s. The effect of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies \u2014 led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 has fueled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade. But the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets \u2014 and they are not entirely benign.Economists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lackluster wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States. The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in. 'It's one of the most important trends that we're experiencing,' said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva. 'It's really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare.' In the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among U.S. companies. In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.On Tuesday, Apple reported the latest in a string of strong quarterly earnings, with its profit increasing to $11.52 billion, up nearly a third from a year earlier. The report helped bolster the company's stock price; on Friday, Apple's shares closed at $208.18.More than three quarters of all U.S. industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyze proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by Michaely and others.A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration \u2014 in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits \u2014 is real and may be long-lasting. 'The number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,' said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon. The consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the U.S. economy.When the iPhone was introduced in 2007, it quickly transformed the way society interacts with technology. More than 1.4 billion have been sold since. Apple and Google combined now provide the software for 99 percent of all smartphones. Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.But the trend is not confined to technology. Today, almost half of all the assets in the U.S. financial system are controlled by five banks. In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. During the past decade, six of the largest U.S. airlines merged into three. Four companies now control 98 percent of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge. Consolidation begets profits. 'Whoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors,' said Larkin, who has studied the effect of corporate consolidation on financial markets. That is great news for the stock markets.This year, five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google's parent, Alphabet \u2014 have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard ...or's 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1 trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels. It is currently valued at more than $880 billion. Of course, this is only good as long as profits keep pouring in. If the tech companies' shares start to sputter, 'it's going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up,' said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market.And in the labor market, scholars have linked corporate consolidation to rising income inequality and the declining share of the nation's wealth that goes to workers. The so-called labor share of the economy has been declining in the United States and other rich countries since the 1990s, coinciding with the trend toward corporate concentration. That decline has been most pronounced in industries undergoing the greatest consolidation. Economists disagree about cause and effect. Some say companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and they can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labor. Other economists argue that with fewer companies in a given industry, there is simply less competition for workers and therefore little pressure to give raises to workers. That may be especially true in industries where skills are highly specialized, because it is harder for workers to look elsewhere for better pay. Recent research has highlighted examples of companies colluding to keep wages low by agreeing not to poach each other's workers and by inserting provisions into workers' contracts that bar them from joining competitors. Some on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionization, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favor. Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers.Although companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible. They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right. The same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the crosshairs of governments around the world.'A year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable,' said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behavior.

AT&amp;amp;T. Exxon Mobil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Small potatoes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple on Thursday reached a milestone that these icons of capitalism never dreamed of: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/02/technology/apple-trillion-market-cap.html\">a market value of more than</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/02/technology/apple-trillion-market-cap.html\">$1 trillion</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That landmark is the result of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/technology/apple-stock-1-trillion-market-cap.html\">an extraordinary corporate success story</url>. In a span of just 21 years, a near-bankrupt computer maker evolved into the most valuable publicly traded company in the United States, pushing the tech industry away from big, bulky machines and producing some of the world\u2019s most popular consumer products, like the iMac, the iPod and the iPhone. Apple\u2019s products have reshaped swaths of everyday life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple\u2019s new 13-figure valuation highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the United States economy. Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The impact of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies \u2014 led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 has fueled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade.</p><p>But the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets \u2014 and they are not entirely benign.</p><p>Economists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lackluster wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States. The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important trends that we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare.\u201d</p><p>In the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among American companies. In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by just 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.</p><p>On Tuesday, Apple reported the latest in a string of strong quarterly earnings, with its profit increasing to $11.52 billion, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier. The report helped bolster the company\u2019s stock price; as of Thursday, Apple\u2019s shares were trading at $207.39.</p><p>The difference between how much it costs American companies to make their products and how much they sell those products for \u2014 a metric of the power that companies possess in their markets \u2014 is at its highest level since at least 1950, according to a 2017 paper by two economists, Jan De Loecker of Princeton and Jan Eeckhout of University College London.</p><p>More than three-quarters of all American industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyze proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by Professor Michaely, along with Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and Yelena Larkin of York University in Toronto.</p><p>A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration \u2014 in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits \u2014 is real and may be long-lasting. \u201cThe number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,\u201d said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon.</p><p>The consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the United States economy.</p><p>When the iPhone was introduced in 2007, it quickly transformed the way society interacts with technology. More than 1.4 billion have been sold since.</p><p>Apple and Google combined now provide the software for 99 percent of all smartphones. Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.</p><p>But the trend is not confined to technology.</p><p>Today, almost half of all the assets in the American financial system are controlled by five banks. In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. Over the past decade, six of the largest United States airlines merged into three. Four companies now control 98 percent of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge.</p><p>Consolidation begets profits. \u201cWhoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors,\u201d said Professor Larkin, who has studied the impact of corporate consolidation on financial markets.</p><p>That is great news for the stock markets. </p><p>This year, five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet \u2014 have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard &amp;amp; Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1 trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels. It is currently valued at more than $880 billion.</p><p>Of course, this is good only as long as profits keep pouring in. If the tech companies\u2019 shares start to sputter, \u201cit\u2019s going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up,\u201d said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market.</p><p>And in the labor market, scholars have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/economy/labor-share-economic-output.html\">linked</url> corporate consolidation to rising income inequality and the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/business/economy/wages-workers-profits.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fpatricia-cohen&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=4&amp;pgtype=collection\">declining share of the nation\u2019s wealth</url> that goes to workers. The so-called labor share of the economy has been declining in the United States and other rich countries since the 1990s, coinciding with the trend toward corporate concentration. And that decline has been most pronounced in industries undergoing the greatest consolidation.</p><p>Economists disagree about cause and effect. Some say that companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labor.</p><p>Other economists argue that with fewer companies in a given industry, there is simply <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/business/economy/mergers-worker-pay.html\">less competition for workers</url> and therefore little pressure to give raises to workers. That may be especially true in industries where skills are highly specialized, because it is harder for workers to look elsewhere for better pay. Recent research has highlighted examples of companies colluding to keep wages low by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/business/fast-food-wages-no-poach-deal.html\">agreeing not to poach each other\u2019s workers</url> and by inserting provisions into workers\u2019 contracts that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/business/noncompete-clauses.html\">bar them</url> from joining competitors.</p><p>Some on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionization, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favor. Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers.</p><p>Although companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible. They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right.</p><p>The same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the cross hairs of governments around the world.</p><p>Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/technology/google-eu-android-fine.html\">was recently fined</url> a record $5 billion by European antitrust regulators who accused the search giant of abusing its market position by forcing mobile phone companies to install Google apps on their phones.</p><p>Facebook is being forced by angry politicians and regulators to do more to safeguard users\u2019 data and to prevent its platform from being used to interfere with American elections. Last week, Facebook reported that its growth was slowing and it was increasing spending on privacy and security. Its shares <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/business/facebook-stock-earnings-call.html\">plunged 19 percent</url>, lopping roughly $120 billion of the company\u2019s market value in a single day.</p><p>And President Trump has repeatedly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/us/politics/trump-amazon-taxes.html\">taken aim</url> at Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Trump \u2014 who has expressed       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/business/media/to-trump-its-the-amazon-washington-post-to-its-editor-thats-baloney.html\">anger about coverage</url> of his administration in The Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos bought in 2013 \u2014 has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes and of taking advantage of the United States Postal Service. If Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric translates into policy changes, it could hit Amazon\u2019s bottom line.</p><p>Apple\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly profit set the stage for its market value to top $1 trillion. But executives issued a cautionary note: The trade war with China \u2014 where Apple generates about 18 percent of its revenue \u2014 threatens the company\u2019s ability to keep raking in profits at its current clip.</p><p>\u201cA year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable,\u201d said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behavior. \u201cToday, they seem not to be.\u201d</p><p>Ben Casselman and Jack Nicas contributed reporting. </p><p>PHOTO: Apple on Thursday reached a market value of more than $1 trillion, a milestone that highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the United States economy.

General Motors. AT&amp;T. Exxon Mobil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Small potatoes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple on Thursday reached a milestone that these icons of capitalism never dreamed of: a market value of more than $1 trillion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That landmark is the result of an extraordinary corporate success story. In a span of just 21 years, a near-bankrupt computer maker evolved into the most valuable publicly traded company in the United States, one whose innovative products have reshaped swaths of everyday life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Apple's new 13-figure valuation also highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the United States economy. Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The impact of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies \u2014 led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 has fueled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade.</p><p>But the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets \u2014 and they are not entirely benign.</p><p>Economists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lackluster wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States. The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in.</p><p>\"It's one of the most important trends that we're experiencing,\" said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva. \"It's really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare.\"</p><p>In the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among American companies. In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by just 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.</p><p>The difference between how much it costs American companies to make their products and how much they sell those products for \u2014 a metric of the power that companies possess in their markets \u2014 is at its highest level since at least 1950, according to a 2017 paper by two economists, Jan De Loecker of Princeton and Jan Eeckhout of University College London.</p><p>More than three-quarters of all American industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyze proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by Professor Michaely, along with Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and Yelena Larkin of York University in Toronto.</p><p>A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration \u2014 in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits \u2014 is real and may be long-lasting. \"The number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,\" said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon.</p><p>The consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the United States economy.</p><p>Apple and Google, for example, provide the software for 99 percent of all smartphones. Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.</p><p>But the trend is not confined to technology.</p><p>Today, almost half of all the assets in the American financial system are controlled by five banks. In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. Over the past decade, six of the largest United States airlines merged into three. Four companies now control 98 percent of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge.</p><p>Consolidation begets profits. \"Whoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors,\" said Professor Larkin, who has studied the impact of corporate consolidation on financial markets.</p><p>That is great news for the stock markets.</p><p>This year, five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google's parent, Alphabet \u2014 have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1 trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels. It is currently valued at more than $880 billion.</p><p>Of course, this is good only as long as profits keep pouring in. If the tech companies' shares start to sputter, \"it's going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up,\" said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market.</p><p>And in the labor market, scholars have linked corporate consolidation to rising income inequality and the declining share of the nation's wealth that goes to workers. The so-called labor share of the economy has been declining in the United States and other rich countries since the 1990s, coinciding with the trend toward corporate concentration. And that decline has been most pronounced in industries undergoing the greatest consolidation.</p><p>Economists disagree about cause and effect. Some say that companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labor.</p><p>Other economists argue that with fewer companies in a given industry, there is simply less competition for workers and therefore little pressure to give raises to workers. That may be especially true in industries where skills are highly specialized, because it is harder for workers to look elsewhere for better pay. Recent research has highlighted examples of companies colluding to keep wages low by agreeing not to poach each other's workers and by inserting provisions into workers' contracts that bar them from joining competitors.</p><p>Some on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionization, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favor. Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers.</p><p>Although companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible. They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right.</p><p>The same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the cross hairs of governments around the world.</p><p>Google was recently fined a record $5 billion by European antitrust regulators who accused the search giant of abusing its market position by forcing mobile phone companies to install Google apps on their phones.</p><p>Facebook is being forced by angry politicians and regulators to do more to safeguard users' data and to prevent its platform from being used to interfere with American elections. Last week, Facebook reported that its growth was slowing and it was increasing spending on privacy and security. Its shares plunged 19 percent, lopping roughly $120 billion of the company's market value in a single day.</p><p>And President Trump has repeatedly taken aim at Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive. Mr. Trump \u2014 who has expressed anger about coverage of his administration in The Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos bought in 2013 \u2014 has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes and of taking advantage of the United States Postal Service. If Mr. Trump's rhetoric translates into policy changes, it could hit Amazon's bottom line.</p><p>Apple this week reported better-than-expected quarterly profit, setting the stage for its market value to top $1 trillion. But executives issued a cautionary note: The trade war with China \u2014 where Apple generates about 18 percent of its revenue \u2014 threatens the company's ability to keep raking in profits at its current clip.</p><p>\"A year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable,\" said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behavior. \"Today, they seem not to be.\"</p><p>Ben Casselman contributed reporting.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-122586748</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SY8-SKP1-JDJN-60R7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1495\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Yerepouni Daily News.

While the mark is largely symbolic, it does underscore Apple CEO's Tim Cook's success at changing the company's story. Investors have started seeing Apple's business less like other hardware makers and more like a software company, as indicated by Apple's quickly rising P/E ratio, which is now over 33.   On Wednesday,  Apple  became the first $2 trillion  U.S. company.    The iPhone maker's share price hit $466.77 around 11am ET, sending it over the mark. It's the most valuable publicly traded company in the world, beating out Saudi Aramco, Microsoft , and Amazon . Apple stock is up about 60% year-to-date. The milestone comes a little more than two years after Apple became the first $1 trillion company in August 2018.   While the mark is largely symbolic, it does underscore Apple CEO's Tim Cook's success at changing the company's story. Investors have started seeing Apple's business less like other hardware makers and more like a software company, as indicated by Apple's quickly rising price-to-earnings ratio, which is now over 33.   \"Over the past four months, the market has really been valuing Apple as a software company,\" said Logan Purk, analyst at Edward James, who has a hold rating on the stock. \"The services business is growing nicely \u2014 it seems to give them a multiple over 30, and gives them all the credit in the world for this subscription business.\"    \"They're starting to get compared to some really big software heavyweights,\" Purk added. Microsoft trades at a 36 PE ratio, and Amazon's PE ratio is currently over 123.    Apple first started to refocus investor attention on its services business back in 2015, as iPhone growth first slowed.   Its definition of services includes a lot of different things: iTunes purchases, App Store fees, Apple Music, licensing, AppleCare warranties on hardware, and revenue from Apple Pay, among others. In the past two years, Apple has started to launch new subscription services to bolster the business, such as Apple News+, a digital magazine bundle, and Apple TV+, a competitor to Netflix and Disney+ . Last year, Apple also introduced AppleCard, a credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs integrated into the iPhone's software.   \"The reason we're talking about...$2 trillion when it feels like it was just passing $1 trillion is just how well they've done vertically integrating through their technology stack, starting with hardware, and then now moving into software,\" Nick Grous at ARK Invest said. \"When we think about Apple, long term, we may not be focused on what other analysts are focused on, being iPhone sales and device sales. We're actually really focused on their services.\"   In January 2016, Apple released new financials related to its services business, and Cook said : \"I do think that the assets that we have in this area are huge, and I do think that it's probably something that the investment community would want to and should focus more on.\"   In 2017, Cook set an ambitious growth target for the business: Apple wanted to double its 2016 services revenue by 2020, which would put the goal at roughly $46 billion by this year.    It hit that goal six months ahead of schedule. In the quarter ending in June , Apple reported $13.16 billion in services revenue, accounting for about 22% of the company's total sales.    Before Apple was able to get investors to look at it like a software company, its low PE ratio compared to big tech peers like Microsoft was an object of fascination for techies and investors. Investors saw its hardware business as \"hits-driven\" and worried that future iPhones and iPads might not sell as well as they had in the past. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen remarked in 2015 that Apple traded like a \"steel mill going out of business.\"   According to Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, the triumph underscores Tim Cook's unique strengths compared with founding CEO Steve Jobs.   \"Steve Jobs famously would focus on, 'our goal is to to determine the few things that we should do and do them as well as possible.' And then because of the maturation of the smartphone market, I think that forced Tim Cook's hand. He's basically said okay, what is Apple good at? Now let's apply that to a lot of different things,\" said Forte. \"And I think services is probably one have the best examples, meaning that Apple's not just going to be a hardware company.\"   Apple's services business is still half the size of its iPhone business, and largely depends on it \u2014 many of Apple's services, like its AppleCare warranties or App Store, are directly targeted at its existing base of 1.5 billion devices, not at the larger market of Android or Windows users.   Increasingly, the App Store, which is one of Apple's most important and biggest services, is drawing criticism from developers who say its 30% cut on sales of digital goods is too rich. It's also feeling pressure from lawmakers and regulators \u2014 Cook had to answer several questions about the App Store's business practices at a congressional hearing in July.   Apple hasn't yet provided subscriber numbers for Apple TV+, Apple News+, or Apple Arcade, which were launched in 2019.    There are other factors behind Apple's rise. Tech stocks in general are doing well in the pandemic as investors search for safe havens that offer the possibility for growth. Apple is also a big purchaser of its own stock, authorizing a $50 billion increase to the company's share repurchase program in 2020, following top-offs of $75 billion in 2019 and $100 billion in 2018.    Some investors are betting on a \"hype cycle\" this fall because Apple is expected to release an iPhone that connects to 5G networks which could increase sales, John Vinh, KeyBanc analyst, said.    But Apple's rise to the ceremonial $2 trillion mark, doubling the company's value in about two years, doesn't happen without investors undertaking a major re-appraisal of the company's business model.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42875551829</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MP-CNM1-F07F-83HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1044\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SAUDI ARABIAN OIL CO (SAUDI ARAMCO)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

A high-profile lawsuit could become a roadmap for either building a case against tech titans under existing antitrust laws or writing new ones better suited to the digital economy.What's new: Epic on Thursday launched an effort to put Apple on its back foot in the courts of both law and public opinion over the up-to-30% commission it takes on in-app purchases and subscriptions and policies that block most developers from skirting that tax. Epic added an option for Fortnite players to either pay it directly to buy in-app currency or pay a premium to go through Apple. </p><p>The move seemed to be a ploy to get Apple to do exactly what it did next: pull Fortnite from the App Store for breaking in-app payment rules.Almost immediately after, Epic revealed it's suing Apple, asking a federal judge[1] to force Apple to relax the restrictions it places on payments and let developers offer their own payment options. Epic argues Apple is unfairly monopolizing the markets for both iOS app distribution and in-app payments.Epic also debuted a marketing campaign centered around a video[2] parodying Apple's famous \"1984\" ad \u2014 this time, with Apple itself as the Big Brother figure and a Fortnite character as the iconoclast trying to tear down the system. The big picture: Epic is just one of several developers[3] clashing with Apple. Others include Spotify, Tinder parent Match Group and the makers of email app Hey. They all argue Apple is shaking down entire industries, in some cases putting direct competitors at a disadvantage. (Apple Music, for instance, is a rival service to Spotify.) And they say Apple is unafraid of any government officials holding it to account. Yes, but: Apple is now facing antitrust scrutiny at home and abroad. App Store policies were a key subject of inquiry at the July House antitrust subcommittee hearing[4] with CEO Tim Cook. Lawmakers suggested Apple holds undue power over developers and gives some preferential treatment, highlighting internal emails showing Apple once considered raising the commission fee to 40% and that it negotiated a 15% revenue share with Amazon for its Prime Video app.The European Commission, spurred in part by complaints from Spotify, opened an investigation[5] in June into Apple's in-app purchases system and restrictions on developers. Meanwhile: The gaming industry is already upset with Apple. Many mobile game makers have built a sizable chunk of their growth strategy around an iOS feature that lets app makers track user activity to, for instance, target would-be users by interest and see if they actually clicked on a mobile ad directing them to install a particular app.iOS 14, set for a September release, is poised to change that feature so that users have to expressly opt in to let an app track them. A number of gaming publishers told Axios they expect only 20-30% of users to do so.This will make it much harder for gaming publishers, especially smaller ones, to attract new users. (It will also serve as a blow to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and others that rely on app-install ads for revenue.) Between the lines: Epic is marshaling a considerable mass of pent-up frustration with Apple in an effort to deal serious damage to the company. Even if it loses its court case, it could draw public attention and stepped-up regulatory scrutiny to Apple's practices. And it's doing it by putting users in the middle of the fight. That could be a risky proposition. But it could also leave Apple vulnerable, in part thanks to a recent Supreme Court case also involving the company. Flashback: In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled in Apple v. Pepper that consumers have the right to sue anyone who delivers them goods, even though \u2014 in the case at hand \u2014 developers set the price of their apps, not Apple. The plaintiffs argued they were paying more for apps than a competitive market would allow due to Apple's 30% commission. Epic may have just alerted a whole generation of now-irritated gamers to the existence of that commission and the notion that it's unfairly leading to above-market prices.

The commission said it had also started a <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1073\">separate investigation</url> to see whether Apple was boxing out rivals to its mobile payments system, Apple Pay.</p><p>In both Brussels and Washington, officials have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1073\">scrutinizing the power of the world\u2019s largest technology platforms.</url>Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google are being investigated by antitrust authorities over their growing power, particularly their position as gatekeepers upon which other companies depend on to reach customers.</p><p>\u201cApple obtained a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 role when it comes to the distribution of apps and content to users of Apple\u2019s popular devices,\u201d said <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1073\">Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president</url> in charge of competition policy. \u201cWe need to ensure that Apple\u2019s rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers.\u201d</p><p>The case against Apple arises from a<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1073\">complaint made last year by Spotify</url>, whose music-streaming service competes with Apple Music. Spotify and others have criticized Apple for imposing rules and charging a fee of up to 30 percent on digital services sold through its App Store. Spotify argued that the fee constituted a tax that violated competition laws and merited an investigation. In March, the European Commission said an e-book and audiobook distributor, which it didn\u2019t identify, had filed a similar complaint.</p><p>\u201cAt the heart of our case is the fact that Apple acts as the stadium owner, referee and player, and tilts the playing field in favor of its own services,\u201d Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify\u2019s chief legal officer, told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThis case is not just about Spotify. The commission\u2019s decision to take on this case against Apple is an important first step toward developing new rules of the road that will govern the conduct of online platforms for years to come.\u201d</p><p>On Tuesday, European authorities said a preliminary investigation showed the complaints had merit.</p><p>Josh Rosenstock, a spokesman for Apple, said the company disagreed with the European Commission\u2019s decision to start the investigations, describing the complaints that it is breaking antitrust laws as \u201cbaseless.\u201d The company has defended its tight control of the App Store as a means to preserve quality, privacy and security.</p><p>\u201cThroughout our history, Apple has created groundbreaking new products and services in some of the most fiercely competitive markets in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe follow the law in everything we do, and we embrace competition at every stage because we believe it pushes us to deliver even better results.\u201d</p><p>American investigations of Big Tech\u2019s power, including those by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, have tended to lump Apple in with Google, Facebook and Amazon. But  Apple was thought to be at the least risk of punishment there because its business practices appeared to be less problematic than its closest peers.</p><p>But now Europe\u2019s formal investigations show Apple still faces at least one big regulatory fight.</p><p>In Europe, the world\u2019s largest technology companies have long been viewed with suspicion as they have consolidated power over the digital economy. In 2016, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect 13 billion euros in unpaid taxes from Apple, worth about $14.7 billion today. The antitrust authorities have also issued billions of dollars in fines against Google for antitrust violations in recent years, while Amazon and <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1073\">Facebook</url> are also facing <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1073\">fresh scrutiny</url>.</p><p>Spotify has been discussing Apple\u2019s practices with European regulators for about five years, according to a person involved in the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were private. Tuesday\u2019s announcement is a major milestone, yet the commission could still spend a year or more investigating the company\u2019s practices before determining whether to bring charges.</p><p>Since Spotify made <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1073\">its formal complaint in Europe</url> in March 2019, regulators have been considering how to show harm from Apple\u2019s actions, according to the person involved. They eventually concluded that Apple\u2019s 30 percent share of some revenues collected via the App Store raised competitors\u2019 costs, eventually leading to higher prices for consumers, this person said.</p><p>Spotify said it had raised its monthly subscription price to $13 from $10 in 2014 to make up for Apple\u2019s cut. A year later, Apple introduced its streaming-music competitor, Apple Music, priced at $10 a month. Spotify then decided to pull out of the App Store payment system, restricting Apple from taking a share and prompting Spotify to drop its price back to $10 a month. It then became more complicated to sign up for Spotify\u2019s paid service; customers now have to go to a website instead of simply tapping a button in the app.</p><p>Apple has faced other scrutiny of how it uses its influence over the App Store. For years it has packed the top of many App Store search results with its own apps, even when they were less popular or relevant than competitors\u2019 offerings, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1073\">an investigation by The New York Times</url>. In 2018, Apple also began <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1073\">restricting or removing many popular apps</url> that helped people limit the time they and their children spent on their iPhones, just after Apple released competing tools. After the makers of two parental-control apps complained to European regulators and The Times reported on Apple\u2019s moves, <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1073\">Apple quietly reversed its policy</url> and let the apps back into the App Store.</p><p>In addition to App Store policies, European authorities are investigating Apple Pay, which allows people to make purchases within apps or in shops with an iPhone or Apple Watch. The questions surround requirements companies must agree to when integrating Apple Pay into apps or websites. The commission said it would review how the company controlled access to \u201ctap and go\u201d technology for rival payment systems on Apple devices.</p><p>\u201cIt is important that Apple\u2019s measures do not deny consumers the benefits of new payment technologies, including better choice, quality, innovation and competitive prices,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.</p><p>The Apple investigations are part of a multifront challenge that the biggest tech companies are grappling with around the world.</p><p>In Germany and Britain, lawmakers are debating changes to antitrust laws that would make it easier for the authorities to bring tech cases. European Union officials are exploring a digital services law with wide-ranging implications, including potential liability rules for harmful content spread on social media, as well as expanded powers for regulators to quickly step in against what they conclude are unfair business practices. Australia, India and Brazil are also cracking down.</p><p>Spotify said that federal and state regulators in the United States had approached the company about Apple and that it had provided information, but that it expects real action to come in Europe.</p><p>Gene Kimmelman, a former chief counsel of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said Europe continued to lead on enforcement.</p><p>\u201cEurope is moving much more quickly and much more aggressively with both antitrust and regulation,\u201d said Mr. Kimmelman, now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. \u201cI think the U.S. will respond to that.\u201d</p><p>Adam Satariano reported from London, and Jack Nicas from Centerville, Mass.</p><p>PHOTO: An Apple store in Paris.

App-store fees charged by Apple, Google, and others like Steam have come under increasing pressure. Some developers have routed around them, and Spotify filed a competition complaint against Apple in Europe that focused in part on the iPhone maker's app-store fees. Should Apple have to cut its average overall commission rate from the 27% it gets now to around 15%, it would lose out on about $8 billion in revenue next year and $1.25 a share in earnings, Nomura Instinet analyst Mark Kelley said. </p><p>Spotify's complaint against Apple over unfair competition could end up costing the iPhone maker billions of dollars. The streaming music maker's allegations against Apple[1] focus on the way Apple manages the App Store and the fees it charges developers who sell their apps and related items there. The complaint[2] it filed with the European Commission on Wednesday increases the chances that Apple will have to lower its commission rates on app sales, warned financial analysts who cover the company. If Apple is forced to reduce its rates, it's likely it would only have to cut them by a little, a move the company could easily swallow, said Mark Kelley, an analyst who covers the electronics giant for Nomura Instinet, in a research note on Thursday. But if Apple has to put in place a particularly large cut in its rates \u2014 which would require a \"structural change\" to its commission policies \u2014 the move could cost the company more than $8 billion in lost sales next year and about $1.25 a share in lost earnings, Kelley estimated. \"A structural change in Apple's take rate seems unlikely, but would prove more damaging\" than a slight change in rates, he said.App-store fees are coming under increasing scrutiny and pressureApple charges a 30% commission on most sales through its app store. For subscriptions charged through its store, Apple lowers its cut to 15% after the first year. Combining those two rates, the company on average gets a commission of about 27% on all the sales through the App Store, Kelley said. Google charges similar rates in its Google Play store and sees about the same overall commission rate, he said. But the fees charged by Apple, Google, and other app store operators like Steam have been coming under increasing pressure. In recent years, both Netflix[3] and Spotify stopped allowing customers to sign up for paid subscriptions inside their iPhone apps, instead encouraging new customers to sign up on their websites. Similarly, Epic Games has been routing around app stores[4] with \"Fortnite: Battle Royale,\" directing consumers on PCs and on Android smartphones to download the game from its website instead. Read this: The uproar over how 'Fortnite' is being released for Android shows how much we have acquiesced to Apple's way of doing business[5] And now Spotify has filed a formal complaint with European regulators, asserting in part that the fees Apple charges are unfair and anticompetitive. While it had to pay a 30% fee to Apple on its subscriptions, Apple Music \u2014 the iPhone maker's rival subscription music service \u2014 has to pay no such fees, Spotify charged. To receive the same amount of revenue, Spotify says it would have to increase the cost of its subscription, which it argues harms consumers. Spotify's complaint comes amid growing scrutiny of the business models of Apple and other tech giants. Just last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that she would seek to bar such companies from both operating a platform or marketplace and offering apps or services on that marketplace[6] that compete with those from third parties. \"With growing calls from more robust regulation, we continue to view app store pricing as an area that could see more pressure,\" Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Research, said in a note late Wednesday.App-store fees are important to AppleApple is particularly susceptible to potential changes in app-store fee rates[7]. The company is banking much of its future on growth in its services business[8]. Not only has that segment been growing faster than Apple's overall hardware business, it's more profitable too. Apple's App Store commissions make up the biggest component of its services business, accounting for about 30% of its total revenue, Kelley estimated. Consumers spent around $47 billion on apps and other items in its store last year, and the iPhone maker pulled in about $12.6 billion in revenue from those sales, Kelley estimated. Both of those figures are about double the comparable ones for Google. A slight reduction in Apple's App Store rates won't hurt the company very much, Kelley said. If its overall commission rate falls to about 25%, Apple's store revenue next year would be about $1.4 billion less than it would be otherwise, while its earnings per share would be about 20 cents lower, he said. But those hits would represent less than 1% of the company's expected overall revenue next year and only about 1.5% of its expected per-share earnings. But bigger cuts in its commission rates would lead to much sharper reductions in Apple's expected sales and profits, Kelley said. If its commission rate drops to 20% overall, Apple would take a $5 billion hit to its total sales next year and would see its earnings per share cut by 75 cents, or about 6%, he said. If its fee rate falls to 15%, Apple's overall revenue in 2020 would be cut by 3%, or $8 billion, and its earnings per share would be reduced $1.25, or nearly 10%. Schachter thinks there's a chance it could fall even further than that, suggesting Apple's commission rate might drop to just 12%. That would cut its earnings before interest and taxes by 15% next year, he said. \"Pressure on [the] app distribution model [is] building,\" Schachter said.

This is a new ... Continue reading Apple says its App Store facilitated $519B in commerce in 2019</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amid increasing antitrust scrutiny by U.S. regulators, Apple announced an update on its App Store ecosystem. While the company normally shares some App Store metrics during its WWDC keynote,      it s today detailing the results of a new study that claims the App Store ecosystem facilitated half a trillion ($519 billion) in billings and sales globally in 2019. This is a new and broader      figure than has been previously reported, as it includes all transactions the App Store facilitates, not just those on which Apple takes a commission.</p><p>The study, which was conducted by economists at the Analysis Group, is the first to attempt to comprehensively analyze the App Store ecosystem, which is now home to nearly 2 million apps. First      launched in 2008, the App Store is visited by half a billion people every week across 175 countries. Collectively, users have download apps hundreds of billions of times to their devices. The      Apple Developer ecosystem, meanwhile, supports 23 million developers.</p><p>The new study examines the wider world of transactions on the App Store. While Apple earlier announced it has made $155 billion in direct payments to developers to date, the study attempts to      position those payments as a  small fraction  of the total when sales from other sources   like physical goods and services   are also included.</p><p>In other words, the study is taking into consideration the number of retail sales flowing through the App Store, like when you shop the Target or Best Buy iOS app, for example. Or when you book      an Uber or order food from DoorDash or Grubhub.</p><p>The study notes that because Apple only receives commissions from the billings associated with digital goods and services,  more than 85% of the $519 billion total accrues solely to third-party      developers and businesses of all sizes,  it says.</p><p>Here s how the $519 billion breaks down, specifically.</p><p>The study estimates sales from Physical Goods and Services accounted for the largest share, at $413 billion. Within this category, M-commerce apps generated the vast majority of sales, and      Retail was the largest at $268 billion. This Retail category includes brick-and-mortar stores like Target as well as virtual marketplaces like Etsy, but excludes grocery delivery services.</p><p>Other top M-commerce apps included Travel apps like Expedia and United, coming in at $57 billion. Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft comprised $40 billion in sales. And Food Delivery apps,      like Grubhub and DoorDash, made up $31 billion. Grocery Delivery accounted for just $4 billion   but remember that this study is focused on pre-COVID-era data from 2019.</p><p>Meanwhile, the billings from the Digital Goods and Services section reached $61 billion in 2019. This includes music and video streaming services, fitness, education, e-books, audiobooks, news,      magazines, and dating apps. The Games category was the largest within digital goods and services, but the study didn t detail how much of the $61 billion was attributed to games versus the      other apps. The lack of sub-category data is an interesting omission given that Apple sells games, a music streaming service, a video streaming service, audiobooks and e-books, and a      subscription news service.</p><p>In-app Advertising Sales accounted for another $45 billion and 44% of that figure ($20 billion) was from advertising in games. Non-game apps that generated substantial in-app advertising sales      are often free, like Twitter and Pinterest, while some offer subscriptions, like MLB.com or The New York Times, the study said.</p><p>The timing of the study s release is not coincidental.</p><p>Along with Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook, U.S. House antitrust investigators have been pressing Apple to testify as part of the Judiciary Committee s tech competition probe, Axios      recently reported. Amazon is the only one of the four to have publicly confirmed its plans to participate.</p><p>For its part, Apple has been accused of running an anti-competitive app marketplace   one where its own services compete against rivals. Those competitors then have to pay Apple commissions for      transactions the App Store facilitates. Apple also doesn t allow other apps that sell apps, like the Epic Games Store. And it uses its favored status to wipe out competitors by launching      similar products that can more deeply integrate with its OS   as it plans to do with its upcoming lost item finder, AirTags which will work better than the current market leader, Tile, due to      its first-party status.</p><p>In that light, it s easy to see how this study is attempting to shift the narrative from one about how much Apple profits off developers   developers who are often now also competitors   to one      that characterizes the App Store as one where business transactions flow freely. It paints a picture of industries that generate billions without Apple s hand in the pot, so to speak.</p><p>But this ignores all the workarounds businesses have had to take to avoid Apple s cut.</p><p>For example, Amazon, for years, has directed users to the web to purchase e-books, audiobooks and, until recently, videos. (The latter is only now allowing in-app transactions due to a special      deal that was cut.) A number of top developers, including Netflix and Spotify, dropped in-app sign-ups from their apps in order to avoid the so-called  Apple tax.  Those that do the same will      sometimes see a decline in subscribers, as a result.</p><p>The study characterizes these workarounds as developers   choice. </p><p>The study is also notable for its examination of the geographic makeup of that $519 billion figure. It says the U.S. accounts for $138 billion compared with China s $246 billion, for example.      That s followed by Europe ($51 billion), Japan ($37 billion) and then the rest of the world ($47 billion).</p><p>Of course, this study on the 2019 App Store arrives in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, which will lead to a wildly different set of numbers for 2020 and beyond.</p><p> The App Store...is the world s safest and most vibrant app marketplace,  touted Apple in a release.  It helps creators, dreamers, and learners of all ages and backgrounds connect with the      tools and information they need to build a brighter future and a better world,  it said</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/exclusive-house-probe-wants-big-tech-ceos-to-testify-in-july-2cbd0ad9-5dbd-4afc-a0bf-7f1092840fa0.html\">https://www.axios.com/exclusive-house-probe-wants-big-tech-ceos-to-testify-in-july-2cbd0ad9-5dbd-4afc-a0bf-7f1092840fa0.html</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Sarah Perez<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2600642</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MJ-YJ31-F08D-50P2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1156\"/><timeReceived>3:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Can Apple really make a difference in future healthcare? Questions like this are all perfectly appropriate, argues Apple's vice president for health, Dr. Sumbul Desai.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You have to test what tech firms claim</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Desai leads Apple's teams in developing health-focused software and sensors, such as Activity, Health, ECG reading on Apple Watch and the company's selection of health-focused research apps. She joined the company in 2017.</p><p>While she clearly believes in the potential of digital health technologies, (as does her boss, CEO Tim Cook), she's also a health professional in her own right, and understands how important it is that patients and healthcare providers be sceptical as big tech attempts to get into the market.</p><p>Speaking at a roundtable discussion in London, she said: \"The scepticism from providers and patients is healthy because you should ask questions, and make sure you're using information in the way you should be using it,\" according to\u00a0The Independent.</p><p>She stressed that she believes the best approach to resistance is to work closely with healthcare providers and scientists and across the medical communities to make sure the digital health solutions tech firms provide are actually effective.</p><p>Proof is essential</p><p>In essence, that's the big difference between true healthcare product and service provision and snake oil salespeople.\u00a0In the absence of regulation or effective testing, any tech firm could claim its product delivers health benefits.</p><p>Stringent testing and the limitations of tight regulatory environments mean tech \u00a0companies must move at a much slower pace than the \"move fast and break things\" workflow the sector is used to. You really don't want to break things if those \"things\" are actually people seeking healthcare outcomes.</p><p>And that's the challenge for all the digital health firms engaged in the application of connected technologies and health. It's why you see so much of the focus in the space on prevention and lifestyle outcomes - as it's perfectly permissible to say something \"might\" be good for your health, but not acceptable at all to say it \"will be\" good unless a product or service has been tested.</p><p>The need to evidence health-related claims is why Apple is investing in research\u00a0to explore things like women's medical conditions, hearing and heart health. It is also why the company works closely with key medical organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO).</p><p>[Also read: Tim Cook keeps promising new health features, probably for Apple Watch]The data-grabbing thing</p><p>Many of the potential big picture outcomes around health relate to artificial intelligence, remote patient monitoring and data analytics - all of which rely on patient data in order to function.</p><p>The idea that your devices will be able to monitor your habits in order to pre-emptively warn you of an oncoming problem demands sensors to gather your data and machine intelligence to analyze that information.</p><p>For quite natural reasons, people are more protective of their health info than most other forms of personal data. That's why Apple's approach - it only gathers the information it needs to make its products work and lets users decide whether they want to share it with, for example, research projects - gives it an edge.</p><p>\"It's the user's data and we only ever have access to it if the user is participating in a study they consented too,\" said Desai. It helps even more that the information is never gathered in one place in the first place.</p><p>Of course, one place medical information is gathered is in your patient records, and this is certainly a space in which there is room for improvement.\u00a0Many existing EHR systems simply don't work well together; this is where Apple's Health Records app is making a difference. (Desai spoke in a great deal of depth abou this just last year).</p><p>Once a patient's data is held on devices equipped with up-to-the-moment personal health data as well as historical data, that's an opportunity for data analytics to come into its own.</p><p>This is the kind of thinking that's evidenced by the atrial fibrillation detection feature inside the Apple Watch, the efficacy of which is confirmed by the sheer number of reports of people whose lives have been saved by these devices.</p><p>The only question around these solutions will be if data is handled privately on the device, or in public using cloud-based systems. The former is secure, if limited by the size of machine-learning models used and device processor efficiency; the latter is far less private and therefore more open to abuse.</p><p>There is some work to do until our primary care provider really sits on our wrist, but Apple seems to be committed to engaging in that task.</p><p>Please follow me on\u00a0Twitter, or join me in the\u00a0AppleHolic's bar &amp; grill\u00a0and\u00a0Apple Discussions\u00a0groups on MeWe.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPWLD-3516115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y24-J481-DY58-D1S9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6943</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"805\"/><timeReceived>05:22 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 IDG Communications, Inc.

The chief executive of global liquor giant Diageo, whose favourite tipple is incidentally Johnnie Walker Black Label with ice and soda, would send tremors through his industry, which has spent 15 years promoting responsible consumption.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is not likely to happen. Menezes comes across as a moderate drinker whose mantra is that his Guinness-to-Gordon's empire can prosper if consumers drink better, not more. That means trading up to premium brands rather than bulk buying own-label vodka.</p><p>Yet the Apple supremo Tim Cook did something similar at his developer conference in California in June. After tracking data of his mobile phone usage, Cook admitted he was spending more time than he should on his handset.</p><p>It was a watershed moment. For the first time, the technology industry that within a decade has transformed the way we live was suggesting less screen time maybe a good thing. Consumers are loathe to admit it, but the dopamine hits of social media - every ping and flash that make us pick up our phone dozens of times an hour - have the addictive hallmarks of nicotine. Imagine how long it has taken Silicon Valley to get to grips with that reality.</p><p>This was not quite Apple's Gerald Ratner moment. Cook was not declaiming his iPhone as \"total crap\", merely that usage should be controlled somehow, with the aid of new time-limit settings for some apps and hidden notifications. So seductive is reaching for the modern smartphone, it is no surprise that its Nokia antecedent was known for its \"candy-bar\" shape.</p><p>It is a moment of clarity that comes for many consumer industries, egged on by public pressure and regulatory threat. Soft-drinks makers chose to reduce sugar instead of facing lower sales that a tax might bring.</p><p>A couple of years ago the boss of Philip Morris International explained to me his hope that the Marlboro giant would stop selling cigarettes in his lifetime. In its place, he is marketing supposedly safer heat-not-burn gadgets. The tobacco industry has left it late to go down the responsible route. It is more than two decades since firms conceded that smoking causes lung cancer and emphysema and spent billions settling legal claims. With shares in Big Tobacco down sharply this year, investors are betting that future growth will be stubbed out.</p><p>The technology sector is a long way from the threat of extinction. One reason is it is still remarkably young and finding its way. Consider it against the motor industry. In the transition from horsedrawn to horse-powered, speed limits were abolished completely. The 70 miles per hour upper limit for motorway drivers was made permanent in 1967 and, amazing to think now, wearing rear seat belts only became compulsory in 1991.</p><p>Metering or monitoring web access sounds like a throwback to the dial-up connections of the 1990s. Consumers have grown accustomed to all-you-caneat, always-on technology. The tech giants say they are a liberal force for good. Yet there are obvious dangers.</p><p>Technology investor Saul Klein, whose LocalGlobe fund has backed start-ups including Transferwise and Improbable, likens giving a child a smartphone to throwing the car keys to someone who has not taken driving lessons.</p><p>Efforts to regulate Big Tech can be clunky and slow.</p><p>However, the European Union's Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has not been deterred, as her recent $5 billion fine for Google owner Alphabet for abuse of the dominance of its Android mobile operating system shows.</p><p>The Silicon Valley giants are programmed to seek forgiveness, not permission. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has learnt to say sorry in many different ways. Sometimes he even sounds convincing.</p><p>Apple's move is a qualified one. Activist investors called on it to help parents restrict their children's iPhone access and look into the effects of heavy screen usage. And Cook believes it is not his devices that are addictive, but maybe the apps they carry.</p><p>All the same, something changes in September when these new controls are meant to become widely available. It is the sign of a powerful industry growing up and showing humility. It is something that eventually comes to all wildly successful corporations: with giant revenues comes giant responsibility.</p><p>Every ping that makes us pick up our phone dozens of times an hour has the hallmarks of nicotine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTAND-140350464</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTAND2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T04-FHW1-JCBX-G3BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138528</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Evening Standard (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31730\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 7, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00023L1</classCode><className>DIAGEO PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QK0</classCode><className>PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

In fact, last week, the iPhone market surpassed Saudi Aramco to become the most valuable publicly listed company in the world.</p><p><br/>Apple is more valuable than ever and so is its chief executive officer (CEO) Tim Cook, who after nine years of taking over after Steve Jobs, has become a billionaire.<br/>\u00a0<br/>When co-founder Steve Jobs died, the company was valued at $350 billion. Now that Apple is worth nearly $2 trillion, Cook's net worth has eclipsed $1 billion as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index's calculations, which are based on an analysis of regulatory filings and applying the market performance of a typical wealthy investor to his proceeds from share sales.<br/>Cook, 59, is has joined one of the most elite clubs for CEOs who didn't actually found the companies they run.<br/>In 2015, he has said that he has plans to give away most of his fortune and has already gifted away millions of dollars worth of Apple shares. This could mean that his wealth may be less than $1 billion if he has made other undisclosed charity.<br/>Rise of the FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) stocks amid the pandemic has increased the net worth of big tech CEOs. Facebook's co-founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, recently became a centri-billionaire and joined Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Microsoft's Bill Gates as the only three people in the world to hold wealth exceeding $100 billion.<br/>While Bezos and Zuckerberg have huge stakes in the companies they founded, Cook's path to the billionaire-club was more incremental. A majority of his estimated wealth comes from equity awards he's received since joining Apple in 1998.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSINA-M1324114</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSINA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JV-WCR1-DYDW-74GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410741</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"290\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business India</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 11, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

In fact, last week, the iPhone market surpassed Saudi Aramco to become the most valuable publicly listed company in the world.   Apple is more valuable than ever and so is its chief executive officer (CEO) Tim Cook, who after nine years of taking over after Steve Jobs, has become a billionaire.   When co-founder Steve Jobs died, the company was valued at $350 billion. Now that Apple is worth nearly $2 trillion, Cook's net worth has eclipsed $1 billion as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index's calculations, which are based on an analysis of regulatory filings and applying the market performance of a typical wealthy investor to his proceeds from share sales.   Cook, 59, is has joined one of the most elite clubs for CEOs who didn't actually found the companies they run.   In 2015, he has said that he has plans to give away most of his fortune and has already gifted away millions of dollars worth of Apple shares. This could mean that his wealth may be less than $1 billion if he has made other undisclosed charity.   Rise of the FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) stocks amid the pandemic has increased the net worth of big tech CEOs. Facebook's co-founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, recently became a centri-billionaire and joined Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Microsoft's Bill Gates as the only three people in the world to hold wealth exceeding $100 billion.   While Bezos and Zuckerberg have huge stakes in the companies they founded, Cook's path to the billionaire-club was more incremental. A majority of his estimated wealth comes from equity awards he's received since joining Apple in 1998.

Nor should the tech itself be a cause of harm. Cook will be addressing the 40th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners (ICDPPC), which is being held in Brussels this year to coincide with the introduction of GDPR. </p><p>Europe\u2019s updated privacy framework came into timely force, this May, weeks after the Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal had erupted into a major global scandal \u2014 further raising the profile of data protection as a consumer need, and convincing governments to prioritize an oft overlooked area. By contrast US lawmakers have found themselves on the back foot, increasingly viewed as laggards on the issue vs Europe. California also recently passed a state-wide data protection law. So federal regulators now have clear impetus to draw up domestic privacy rules. Though it remains to be seen whether they will stand up to platform power at home and hold their own on the world stage. Or merely close down the risk of a state-by-state data protection patchwork springing up to create new compliance headaches for business. Silicon Valley\u2019s response to the prospect of an overarching US privacy law has been predictably disingenuous \u2014 with attempts to reframe the issue under broadbrush, malleable concepts like \u2018control\u2019 or \u2018accountability\u2019; and lobbying efforts aimed at steering regulators away from drafting rules anywhere near as robust as GDPR. The usual soundbites are being trotted out about the need to \u2018protect innovation\u2018 (aka the data-fuelled business models such companies use as revenue engines). Cook\u2019s intervention is a reminder that not every tech giant is hostile to privacy. And privacy does not have to be systematically violated for value to be derived from data. For example, Apple has invested in pro-privacy technologies that enable it to leverage data-based insights while protecting individual privacy, such as its use of differential privacy to pull aggregate patterns of behaviour across its user-base; rather than pursuing a per-person profiling approach, as adtech giants Google and Facebook do, riding roughshod over individual privacy in the process. In his speech to the audience of international privacy commissioners, Cook is expected to thank global regulators for the work they do, and reiterate that Apple views privacy as a \u201cfundamental human right\u201d \u2014 a position which aligns the company with the EU\u2019s ethics-based perspective on big data. He will also compliment GDPR, specifically \u2014 dubbing it an example of how \u201cgood policy and political will can come together to protect the rights of us all\u201d \u2014 and focus on ethical underpinnings, saying that at Apple \u201cwe are optimistic about technology\u2019s awesome potential for good. But we know that it won\u2019t happen on its own. Every day, we work to infuse the devices we make with the humanity that makes us.\u201d In another remark, Cook will say: \u201cWe will never achieve technology\u2019s true potential without the full faith and confidence of the people who use it\u201d \u2014 which looks like a not-so-coded attack on big tech\u2019s trust crisis, which continues to be fuelled by data breach after data breach, every passing week. As we wrote previously, Apple\u2019s signalling to US lawmakers on privacy is clear. In the speech, Cook will also seek to push the conversation beyond talk of compliance and defence of rights \u2014 by laying out a broad, positive vision for technology and privacy in the 21st century. He is expected to tell delegates \u201cwe need to keep making progress \u2014 now more than ever\u201d on \u201chumanity\u2019s greatest common project\u201d, citing challenges such as climate change, fighting disease, and education and economy inclusion. Cook is the first tech CEO to give the keynote speech at the ICDPPC, accepting an invitation from the conference organizers to do so. He is also perhaps the only big tech CEO who could comfortably take to such a stage in person. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai will also be heard at the conference, but remotely, via pre-recorded video messages. The companies are sending policy staffers to answer delegates\u2019 questions in Q&amp;A sessions. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN933359820181024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJY-PMR1-DXCW-D2NW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"754\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 24, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

JPMorgan trimmed its price target and iPhone sales estimates because of macroeconomic uncertainty fueled by the US-China trade war but kept its bullish rating. Credit Suisse said that although iPhone sales in China through May are \"less bad\" than past quarters, competition in the region remains a fundamental challenge. Track Apple's stock price in real time here[2].Apple[3]'s challenges in China have eaten into the technology giant's business for months \u2014 and they're not going away, a pair of prominent Wall Street firms said on Monday. </p><p>Analysts at JPMorgan and Credit Suisse addressed China's posture in the critical market amid declining iPhone sales and trade tensions with the US[4], updating their clients on this quarter's trends. JPMorgan's analysts, for their part, slightly lowered their price target and iPhone shipments outlook, while Credit Suisse said trade uncertainty and \"deeper structural issues\" would render Apple's stock price rangebound. The two reports come amid a tangle of macroeconomic and company-specific challenges that has ensnared Apple and injected volatility into its stock price this year. Slowing global economic growth[5] at a late stage in the business cycle is under a microscope, particularly in the key US and Chinese markets. Meanwhile, the trade war the two nations are locked in has rattled markets and weighed on growth outlooks. Further, Apple shareholders have been underwhelmed[6] by some of the company's offerings in spaces like streaming as it seeks to diversify away from its flagship iPhone product.

Here's why.[7] \"Looking beyond macro/trade concerns, we believe aggressive local competition and a narrower ecosystem advantage in China remain deeper structural challenges for Apple, with no easy near-term fix,\" the Credit Suisse analysts led by Matthew Cabral wrote. Cabral's team is discouraged in part by retail sales in China, growth of which has slowed amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.JPMorgan assumed a slightly more sanguine stance than their peers at Credit Suisse. \"The worsening macro environment and its likely impact on consumer spending globally is driving us to trim our iPhone shipment estimates, which in effect modestly lowers the earnings outlook for the near-term,\" including estimates through year-end, the JPMorgan analysts led by Samik Chatterjee wrote. A bonus just for you:Click here to claim 30 days of access to Business Insider PRIME[8] The firm lowered its price target to $235 from $233 and now sees Apple shipping 183 million iPhones to China this year, compared with a prior 185 million forecast. Chatterjee's team maintained its bullish \"overweight\" rating but believes the region's concerns driven by the US-China trade dispute are somewhat temporary. They're also encouraged by Apple's performance in Asian regions outside China. \"We find investor concerns relative to Apple's share loss in China somewhat overblown, given the continued decline in iPhone shipments in China over the last few years, which Apple has been used to navigating consistently by leveraging their strong presence in the developed markets and APAC ex-China,\" they wrote.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak has added his voice to the calls to break up big tech, and even said he wishes Apple had broken up its business. </p><p>Speaking to Bloomberg[2], Wozniak said that there is a tendency for big tech companies to abuse their monopoly power. \"I am really against monopoly powers being used in unfair antitrust manners, not opening up the world to equal competition, using your power in unfair ways, and I think that's happened a lot in big tech and they can get away with a lot of bad things,\" said Wozniak. \"A company that has a strong presence in one market using that presence to grow another market is sort of unfair,\" he said, adding that he's \"pretty much in favour of looking into splitting up companies.\" Read more: Big tech warned by top regulator: We will break you up if we have to[3] \"I wish Apple on its own had split up a long time ago and spun off independent divisions to far away places and let them think independently the way Hewlett Packard did when I worked there,\" he said. Hewlett Packard split its business in 2015, dividing its printer and PC business (HP) from its data storage and enterprise business (HPE). Apple has been swept up in the antitrust gaze now being squarely leveled at Silicon Valley. Although it's not the subject of an official investigation like Facebook[4], or even the rumblings of one as is the case for Amazon[5], Apple is the target of multiple antitrust complaints levelled by third-parties. One such complaint was filed in the EU by music-streaming service Spotify[6], which alleges that the company abuses the dominance of its app store to levy charges on in-app subscription while running a competing music-streaming service, Apple Music. Wozniak, who left the company in 1985, often weighs in on Apple's strategy. In February he said he worried the company had fallen behind on the trend of folding phone displays[7].NOW WATCH: Mexico has just one store where you can legally buy a gun and it's located on a

But Silicon Valley needs to get with the program, he said during an interview with Axios that aired on HBO Sunday.</p><p> The interview marks the latest attempt by Cook to distance his company from other tech giants as they increasingly come under scrutiny for their role in spreading misinformation and hate speech and losing control over customer data.</p><p>Apple has emphasized in recent weeks that it is unlike social media platforms, because its business model depends on selling hardware such as smartphones and tablets and not selling targeted advertisements based on user information. In a speech last month in Brussels, Cook called for stronger privacy rules in the United States, and said Apple \"celebrates\" the passage of recent privacy regulations in Europe that many others in the tech industry opposed.</p><p> But Cook on Sunday faced questions over his company's ties to Google - in particular, why Apple continues to take billions of dollars from the search giant, making it the default on Safari and iOS, when Apple rejects the tactics that has made Google what it is.</p><p> Cook defended the agreements, saying Google's search engine \"is the best,\" and that Apple-designed features have helped safeguard users from prying.</p><p> \"We have private web browsing. We have intelligent tracking prevention,\" he said. \"We come up with ways to help our users through the course of the day. It's not a perfect thing, but it goes a long way in helping.\"</p><p> Cook's remarks add fuel to the brewing policy battle in Washington, where industry groups and policymakers have been discussing what principles ought to guide the government as it explores an intervention. In the coming months, the Trump administration and a reshaped Congress  likely will be faced with interpreting the fault lines in the debate.</p><p> Telecom and cable companies have been urging for a single federal standard that applies to Internet providers and tech companies alike. Meanwhile, consumer groups have pushed for rules that treat reputational damage from a loss of privacy as seriously as financial harms.</p><p> Tech industry advocates have called for policies that protect user privacy while not hindering innovation. But on Sunday, Cook called that \"a false choice.\"</p><p> \"This is not a matter of privacy versus profits, or privacy versus technical innovation,\" he said. \"Your device has incredible intelligence about you, but as a company I don't have to have that.\"</p><p> cook</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-33126640</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSG-WRH1-JC0C-J2HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"455\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 20, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

But as the company's well-rehearsed executives strode around the stage, another piece of news rippled through the crowd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With unfortunate timing, a\u00a0US Congressional committee announced that it had launched a \"top to bottom\" investigation into whether America's top tech companies exploit their power at the expense of competitors and consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the company unveiled a new Mac Pro and showed off its latest operating system to thousands of attendees, investors were sending shares down.</p><p>Of tech's big four most influential companies - Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple (also known by their Wall Street acronym \"GAFA\")\u00a0- the iPhone maker appears the least exposed to the regulatory storm blowing towards Silicon Valley.</p><p>As the company prepares to deliver quarterly financials on Wednesday, investors are increasingly optimistic, more concerned about sales of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/27/iphone-11-11-pro-review-need-know-upgrade/\">latest iPhones</url> than about the prospect of billion-dollar fines or being broken up.</p><p>But it is not totally immune from the \"techlash\". This year, the company has been included in multiple US investigations, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/27/iphone-11-11-pro-review-need-know-upgrade/\">come under the gaze of</url> the EU's competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager after a complaint from music streaming service Spotify, and lost a US Supreme Court case over whether it could be sued for violating competition law.</p><p>Apple is also part of a plan to break up big tech companies <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/27/iphone-11-11-pro-review-need-know-upgrade/\">proposed by Elizabeth Warren</url>, one of the leading hopefuls for the US Democratic presidential nomination.</p><p>\"Apple has stayed under the radar so far,\" says Sam McGowan, a research analyst at Beacon Advisors, which advises hedge funds on the political situation in Washington. \"A lot of the attention is on Facebook and Google, but there are definitely some concerns there [about Apple].\"</p><p>Last month, as part of its probe into competition in digital markets, members of Congress sent Apple's chief executive Tim Cook a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/27/iphone-11-11-pro-review-need-know-upgrade/\">12-page demand</url> for information about the company's share of various markets, its policies, and individual decisions.</p><p>Under the most scrutiny is the company's App Store, the marketplace for games and other software on the iPhone and iPad. Because the App Store is the only way most people can install new programs, app developers can live and die by the way Apple manages the store.</p><p>In recent years, Apple has launched apps or features such as the iPhone's flashlight, health tracking functions, and photo editing, that were first available in third-party apps. The practice is known as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/27/iphone-11-11-pro-review-need-know-upgrade/\">\"Sherlocking\"</url>, after the Apple Mac's\u00a0Sherlock search tool, which rendered a separate\u00a0program named Watson irrelevant after\u00a0incorporating its\u00a0features.</p><p>Apple has also been accused of putting its own apps at the top of the App Store's search results; copying features from other developers' apps; and removing those that compete with it.\u00a0</p><p>Many of these developers are small and often wary about speaking out against Apple, but in March, a big one did make its move. Spotify, the Swedish music streaming service, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/27/iphone-11-11-pro-review-need-know-upgrade/\">accused the company of illegal anti-competitive behaviour</url> .</p><p>Daniel Ek, its chief executive, said the 30pc \"tax\" that Apple charges on sales of digital services in its App Store is unfair, hurting its ability to compete with rival service Apple Music (which does not have to pay the commission), and accused Apple of enforcing restrictive conditions on developers, such as what marketing emails it can send users.</p><p>\"Apps should be able to compete fairly on the merits, and not based on who owns the App Store,\" Ek wrote. Spotify complained to the European Commission, and though she has not opened a full-blown investigation, Vestager has continued to look into the complaint. She is also scrutinising the company's payments service, Apple Pay.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/27/iphone-11-11-pro-review-need-know-upgrade/\">Music streaming | By paid subscribers</url></p><p>The EU was once the sole source of competition scrutiny for big tech companies, and has hit Google, Facebook and Microsoft with billions of euros in combined fines for monopoly abuse. But increasingly, US tech companies' domestic governments are watching them too.</p><p>In addition to the Congressional committee investigating tech's big four, the US government's Department of Justice <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/27/iphone-11-11-pro-review-need-know-upgrade/\">launched its own \"big tech\" probe in July</url> . Although Google is seen as the inquiry's primary target, news of the investigation hit Apple's shares.</p><p>Most Washington observers see any immediate action against Apple as unlikely. Most agencies are answerable to Donald Trump, who has struck up an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/27/iphone-11-11-pro-review-need-know-upgrade/\">unlikely amity with Cook</url> .</p><p>A new commander in chief after next year's election could change that, however. \"Trump tweeting an antitrust case against Apple doesn't work well for his supporters,\" says McGowan. \"A lot of this will play out in 2020.\"</p><p>While Warren has focused most of her attention on Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, her plan for breaking up big tech does include Apple, who she says would be banned from putting its own apps in the App Store if it wants to run the service. \"Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don't get to do both at the same time,\" she told tech website The Verge in March.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/27/iphone-11-11-pro-review-need-know-upgrade/\">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</url></p><p>Separately, the company was dealt a setback in the Supreme Court in May, when a group of consumers suing Apple for pushing up app prices through its control of the App Store were victorious in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/27/iphone-11-11-pro-review-need-know-upgrade/\">reversing a lower court's dismissal of their eight-year case</url> .</p><p>The decision merely declared that the plaintiffs qualify as customers, thus allowing them to sue Apple, but it is another battle the company could do without. A trial has been set for 2022, if it is not settled or dismissed before then.</p><p>Apple has defended itself from claims that it exercises an unfair grip over the App Store in recent months, a potential sign it is rattled by them. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/27/iphone-11-11-pro-review-need-know-upgrade/\">newly-published page</url> on its website goes to great lengths to list the alternatives there are to Apple's own apps.</p><p>In an age where privacy and cyber security is moving up the political agenda, Apple can claim its strict controls protect users.</p><p>Perhaps Apple's strongest argument, though, is a technical one: on many grounds, the company is no monopoly. It had little more than a third of smartphone sales in the US in the three months to September. In the EU, Google was fined last year for abusing the dominant position enjoyed by its rival Android software, making it potentially tricky for Vestager to paint Apple as a monopoly too.</p><p>\"No reasonable person would ever call Apple a monopolist,\" Cook recently told the German magazine Stern. The App Store may have 100pc of the market for iPhone apps, but users can always switch phones.</p><p>As for Apple's chief antagonist, it may see its argument weakened by its own success. This week Spotify reported a leap in subscribers and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/27/iphone-11-11-pro-review-need-know-upgrade/\">said it was growing at twice the rate as Apple Music</url> . Not exactly evidence that it is being crushed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-57404617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCV-24X1-F021-60YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1199\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 30, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

He blamed a weakness in emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and India for the more downbeat outlook.</p><p>The fall wiped about $70bn off the company's market value, taking it below the trillion dollar mark. </p><p>The emphasis on services might signify a shift in the company's focus. In the future, Apple may lean less on product sales, which have become somewhat static.</p><p>In this quarter, the company shipped 46.8 million iPhones, a 13% increase over last quarter's 41.3 million sold. The iPhone XS, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">the latest model that was released in September</url>, likely won't show up in sales until next quarter, but analysts are expecting an overall slowdown in sales going forward.</p><p>\"People just aren't buying smartphones like they used to,\" Jim Cridlin, the global head of innovation and partnership at Mindshare, a media agency owned by WPP. \"In addition to that, consumers are moving beyond the screen. Voice and automated reality are changing the way consumers react and interact with their phones,\" he added, explaining that, like its competitor Amazon, Apple might be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">foregoing</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">its core business</url>, in favor of future growth.</p><p>Cridlin says ads could be the next big thing for Apple.</p><p>\"The model they have set up around app advertising right now is pretty compelling,\" he says, adding that in recent years Apple has become the largest marketplace for apps. \"If you want your app to be surfaced, you have to pay for that real estate now.\"</p><p>It has also helped that the company has increasingly been branded as one of the most trustworthy on data protection, and is not embroiled in controversy like many of its big-tech competitors. For years, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">Cook has criticized companies like Google and Facebook</url> over their handling of consumer data, and called for more government oversight.</p><p>It has been a winning way, positioning Apple as a leader on safety, solidifying mistrust of other companies and manifesting a regulatory environment that could cause headaches for other tech companies.</p><p>In June, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">Apple ramped up data privacy efforts</url>, restricting app developers' capabilities to collect data from iPhones. The move hit services like Onavo Project - a Facebook-owned data security app that promises protection while it feeds user information to its parent company's platform.</p><p>In a keynote speech at an international conference on data privacy in October, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">Cook congratulated the European Union for cracking down</url> on companies' use of consumer data, accusing other businesses of creating an environment where our data is \"weaponized against us\", and called for the US to follow in the EU's footsteps.</p><p>Earlier in the year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">the CEO directly censured</url>Facebook's founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, warning that he believed privacy \"is a human right, a civil liberty\" and vowing that his company wouldn't monetize its customers as Facebook does.</p><p>Cook's actions may help tackle the daunting data privacy issues he has raised, but they are also a boon for his business. A joint <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">SurveyMonkey/Record poll</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">in April</url> found that Americans listed Apple among the most trusted companies in big tech.</p><p>\"This plays to Apple's strengths,\" Cridlin says, adding that a study his company conducted found that 80% of adults across the world care about the issue. But, he adds, the strong rhetoric from Apple's CEO will probably require the company to limit its ad offering to within Apple's own world of apps and products.</p><p>\"There are rumors that they have been exploring an ad network by partnering with folks like Pinterest, and Snapchat, and others,\" he explains. \"Once you do that, you open the data up to the wider platform. By keeping its ad offering, at least the way it is right now with consumer data all to itself, [Apple] can still wholly control it.\"</p><p>If Apple doesn't expand its ads, though, the company's growth could come up against a wall. Much of Cook's criticism centers on how other companies handle data; it's still unclear how the company will better navigate the obstacles. \"At that point it will be interesting,\" Cridlin says. \"Will they take a different stance so they can expand beyond their ecosystem, or not? Its stance on data privacy likely will be tested.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-48837174</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TMH-9YK1-F021-646T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"837\"/><timeReceived>9:14 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

It could also help the company control and expand future product releases, improving profit margins and potentially reducing its hardware division's reliance on iPhone sales. </p><p>\"At Apple, integrating hardware and software is fundamental to everything we do,\" Cook told the audience at the Apple Park campus Monday. \"Silicon is at the heart of our hardware.

The company has been facing uncertainties from the trade war that escalated in early May, and this has investors wondering how drastic the repercussions would be on AAPL. Additionally, Apple is also under federal investigation for possible antitrust violations, which has warranted further questions about what could be in store for the tech giant. Not only is the company facing litigation on the home front but it is also under investigation by the European Union as well. </p><p>While AAPL is in the midst of surrounding uncertainties, let's take a further look into the company and how they might report their Q3 performance.Recent News and Company Overview Federal regulators have been putting the heat on Big Tech as the U.S. Department of Justice is running the investigation of Apple and AlphabetGOOGL[2] while the Federal Trade Commission will have lead oversight of Amazon AMZN[3] and FacebookFB[4].Last Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced an investigation into the practices of market-leading online platforms. The DOJ is reviewing whether these companies are engaging in practices that reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives commented that the objective standard for the investigation is whether a company engages in anticompetitive behavior, thereby driving up prices for consumers. The objective standard differs in Europe as it is more focused on the impact of monopolies on smaller competitors with dominant market positions being frowned upon as a result.In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Apple released an iPad air and an updated iPad mini with Apple Pencil capabilities. The company also updated the iMac and the Air Pods with the option of a wireless charging case.The company also announced its emergence in the subscription service realm. Apple announced that they would be releasing the subscription-based Apple News+, Apple Arcade, and Apple TV+, amongst other services and products. This attempt to enter the subscription-based services market could bode well for the company in the long run if they can learn to compete with the industry's top players. Apple has been able to put together a solid year thus far; the tech giant is currently up 31.5% and has significantly outpaced the S...00. The company's continued focus on boosting its services business has been a key catalyst in driving the company's growth.Q2 Performance and Q3 Outlook Apple was able to bring in a quarterly revenue of $58 billion and reported earnings of $2.46, which were down 5% and 10% respectively from Q2 2018. Despite the year over year falloff, the company was able to beat our Consensus Earnings Estimate by 3.8% and revenue estimate by 0.8%. The tech giant's profits also took a year over year hit, generating $11.6 billion and dropping 16.3%. iPhone sales were down 17.3% to $31 billion while Mac and iPad products brought in $5.51 billion and $4.87 billion, respectively. Apple's services sector jumped 16.2% by bringing in $11.45 billion in Q2 2019. Furthermore, the wearables, home, and accessories segment increased 30% with revenue of $5.13 billion. Weak iPhone demand in China continued to plague the company in Q2, as net sales in Greater China fell 21.5% with $10.2 billion.For Q3, our Consensus Estimates are currently calling for earnings to drop 10.26% to $2.10 per share and revenue to be $53.3 billion for a slight increase from the year ago quarter. Our Key Company Metric Estimates are projecting for the company's iPhone demand struggle to continue in Q3 with $26.1 billion, which would be a 12.8% drop. iPad revenue is expected to continue its growth in Q3 with $5.14 billion in revenue, growing 8.32% year over year. The company's services revenue is forecasted to increase 22.6% with $11.7 billion. Wearables, Home, and Accessories Estimates are calling for a 33.3% jump from Q3 2018 with a revenue of $4.99 billion. Key Company Metric Estimates are also calling for the company's China revenue to increase to $9.71 billion, which is a slight recovery from the struggles the company has faced.Bottom Line Apple's non-iPhone businesses, in particular the Services and Wearables sectors, are expected to drive top-line growth in fiscal 2019. AAPL currently has more than 390 million paid subscribers across its services portfolio. The company's development into a variety of services and products lessen the dependence the company has on iPhone sales which in turn can supplement the company's growth in the long run. Apple Music currently has more than 50 million paid subscribers and its availability on Amazon Echo devices can expand the streaming platform's market share. Uncertainties over the trade war between Washington and Beijing will continue to plague the company as long as there is no trade deal. Furthermore, the litigation the company is facing from the U.S. and the European Union are significant headwinds for shareholders in the near term.This Could Be the Fastest Way to Grow Wealth in 2019Research indicates one sector is poised to deliver a crop of the best-performing stocks you'll find anywhere in the market.

If the good or service is physical, Apple doesn't.The catch: Life doesn't divide neatly that way any more. The big picture: Even before the pandemic, the line between our daily activities and the online world had grown fuzzy, as apps enabled rides, meals, payments and more. Then COVID-19 pushed office work, school work and so much else online, and the distinction between \"real life\" and digital life became even harder to draw. Why it matters: Apple's effort to maintain a consistent policy[1] could turn into a treacherous tarpit for the iPhone maker, the way misinformation and content moderation have for Facebook, exposing the company to criticism from many directions and sullying its reputation.How it works: If you sell most anything digital in the App Store, Apple takes 30% of the price. </p><p>For years, Apple has told app makers that if they are giving away an app free and then using that app to sell users physical goods and services \u2014 like rides (Uber and Lyft) or meals (Grubhub and Doordash) \u2014 Apple wouldn't take a cent. Apple likes to point to how much of the app economy is business done this way.But if an app sells users digital goods and services, the 30% fee kick in.More recently Apple added a wrinkle, exempting a class of \"Reader\" apps from the 30% cut. \"Readers\" are apps users employ to access digital-only goods they've paid for elsewhere \u2014 think Netflix, Spotify, or Kindle.Even more recently, Apple dropped its commission fee for recurring subscriptions to digital products to 15% after the first year. Driving the news: Apple's recent legal war with Fortnite maker Epic Games[2] seized headlines, but that conflict doesn't push the limits of Apple's rules. The features and goods that Epic wants to sell commission-free in its games are inarguably digital in nature. Other recent spats over App Store policies[3] that involved well-known software developers WordPress and Basecamp hinged on more subtle category distinctions. Mostly, they showed that Apple's rules have become so complex that the company is making high-profile mistakes. One case that shows the long-term risk in Apple's digital/physical policy involves Airbnb. A few years ago the rent-out-your-room app started a new line of business called Experiences, allowing its hosts to sell classes, tours and other in-person events. Apple took no cut since these were \"physical world\" offerings.After the coronavirus pandemic forced these entrepreneurs to move these Experiences online, Apple started asking for its 30%.ClassPass, an app for booking exercise classes, found itself in the same boat when the pandemic hit and teachers shifted to virtual instruction. The New York Times reported both incidents[4] and said Airbnb and Apple are still trying to negotiate a settlement. Apple's defense: The tech giant argues that... Running the App Store costs money.It has the right to establish the ground rules for its platform.Those rules keep users safe from malware, porn and spam. It also points to the cornucopia of commerce and developer growth the iPhone has enabled. History lesson: When the App Store launched in 2008, Apple's 30% cut looked like a steal compared with what wireless carriers and others charged software developers and the higher share that brick-and-mortar retailers took. Today, as direct-to-consumer distribution has become the norm in many markets, more companies want the option to go it alone. Yes, but: Apple already sits on an unrivaled hoard of treasure at a moment when millions of small businesses and individuals are hurting financially. 30%, even if it is in line with what other platforms claim, is a very large cut.Apple is in the middle of a major push to find new revenue in digital services[5] as growth in the smartphone market tails off. The power Apple wields over App Store developers has already piqued the interest of antitrust regulators[6] at the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and many state attorneys general, and CEO Tim Cook took heat from Congress[7] at a recent House hearing. (A virtual event, yet one with high real-world impact.) Our thought bubble: Apple is the only one of today's tech giants to make most of its profits producing and selling physical goods, so it may have faith in the enduring distinction between hardware and software, physical and digital. But these categories aren't as concrete as we think. Who's to say that a yoga class beamed out through an app is a purely digital experience? The teachers are moving in their physical space. The students are having their own physical experiences. All that's digital is the channel that connects them. What's next: The rise of augmented reality apps, which use VR-style technology to overlay the real world with digital information and enhancements, promises to further entangle the digital and physical categories.

Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders.\"<br/>The timing of the letter comes as Europe's updated data protection framework, the GDPR, reaches its two-year anniversary - facing ongoing questions around the lack of enforcement related to a string of cross-border complaints.<br/>Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has been taking the brunt of criticism over whether the General Data Protection Regulation is functioning as intended - as a result of how many tech giants locate their regional headquarters on its soil (Apple included).<br/>Responding to the latest Apple complaint from le Bonniec, the DPC's deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told TechCrunch: \"The DPC engaged with Apple on this issue when it first arose last summer and Apple has since made some changes. However, we have followed up again with Apple following the release of this public statement and await responses.\"<br/>At the time of writing Apple had not responded to a request for comment.<br/>The Irish DPC is currently handling more than 20 major cross-border cases, as lead data protection agency - probing the data processing activities of companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Twitter. So le Bonniec's letter adds to the pile of pressure on commissioner Helen Dixon to begin issuing decisions vis-\u00e0-vis cross-border GDPR complaints.

Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders. </p><p>The timing of the letter comes as Europe s updated data protection framework, the GDPR, reaches its two-year anniversary   facing ongoing questions around the lack of enforcement related to a string of cross-border complaints.</p><p>Ireland s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has been taking the brunt of criticism over whether the General Data Protection Regulation is functioning as intended   as a result of how many tech giants locate their regional headquarters on its soil (Apple included).</p><p>Responding to the latest Apple complaint from le Bonniec, the DPC s deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told TechCrunch:  The DPC engaged with Apple on this issue when it first arose last summer and Apple has since made some changes. However, we have followed up again with Apple following the release of this public statement and await responses. </p><p>At the time of writing Apple had not responded to a request for comment.</p><p>The Irish DPC is currently handling more than 20 major cross-border cases, as lead data protection agency   probing the data processing activities of companies including Apple, Facebook, Google  and Twitter. So le Bonniec s letter adds to the pile of pressure on commissioner Helen Dixon to begin issuing decisions vis-\u00e0-vis cross-border GDPR complaints. (Some of which are now a full two years old.)</p><p>Last year Dixon said the first decisions for these cross-border cases would be coming  early  in 2020.</p><p>At issue is that if Europe s recently updated flagship data protection regime isn t seen to be functioning well two years in   and is still saddled with a bottleneck of high-profile cases, rather than having a string of major decisions to its name   it will be increasingly difficult for the region s lawmakers to sell it as a success.</p><p>At the same time the existence of a pan-EU data protection regime   and the attention paid to contravention, by both media and regulators   has had a tangible impact on certain practices.</p><p>Apple suspended human review of Siri  snippets globally last August, after The Guardian had reported that contractors it employed to review audio recordings of users of its voice assistant tech   for quality grading purposes   regularly listened in to sensitive content such as medical information and even recordings of couples having sex.</p><p>Later the same month it made changes to the grading program, switching audio review to an explicitly opt-in process.

Apple may also unveil a new iMac computer, with some company watchers suggesting it may include chips from British-based ARM, but the group usually plans hardware launches for later in the year.</p><p>This year's conference also comes amid significant challenges to Apple's App Store business model, the conduit to more than $45 billion in company revenues from its services business last year.</p><p>Last week, EU regulators opened an antitrust investigation into both the company's App Store and Apple Pay units, with a focus on Apple's demand that developers use its in-App purchasing system to sell their products to customers.

Good Friday morning, everybody. TGIF.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Friday, November 2nd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Major market moves this morning -- Apple shares the story of the day. It is down on weak revenue guidance and on the announcement that the company is no longer going to be providing unit sales. So we will not know specific unit sales on a quarterly basis anymore. The technology giant at risk of losing a $1-trillion market valuation with today's move. It is down 5.25 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The other big story of the market, of course, is the October jobs report. Yes, it is jobs Friday right here. The expectation is for 190,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of October with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent which is a multi-decade low.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We will take a look at what this means for the midterm elections and the market. Of course, the midterms now four days away.</p><p>Check out futures this morning. Even with the 5.5 percent selloff in Apple, we're looking at a rally of 260 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It's going to be up about 1 percent right out of the gate this morning. The S&amp;P 500 is expected to be up 21 points. That's three- quarters of 1 percent. And the Nasdaq right now up 15 points, a quarter of a percent on the Nasdaq.</p><p>This after another day of gains yesterday. This is the third day of gains for the markets yesterday. The Dow Industrials up 265 points at the close. All the major indices finished at their highs of the -- or near their highs of the session. The Dow, S&amp;P up better than 1 percent; the Nasdaq up 1.75 percent, 128 points higher yesterday for the Nasdaq.</p><p>Markets this morning across the globe higher -- FT 100 up three-quarters of a percent, 53 points higher in London; one-and-a-third percent higher in Paris on the CAC 40 at 66 points higher; and the DAX index in Germany up 172 points, that's 1.5 percent higher in Germany.</p><p>In Asia, overnight gains across the board -- check it out. Best performer Hong Kong -- Hang Seng index up better than 4 percent overnight.</p><p>On the earnings front, we are watching Alibaba earnings later this morning. We will hear from oil giants and Dow components, ExxonMobil and Chevron. We'll have those numbers and analysis.</p><p>Right now, it's really Apple which is a big focus but these are coming out soon.</p><p>China trade in focus -- this was important yesterday in the markets. President Trump spoke with China's president Xi Jinping and apparently there was progress in the trade dispute from what we understand from that phone call. It definitely helped markets rally yesterday in the middle of the day.</p><p>Here's what IAC chairman Barry Diller told me about China's trade practices yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARRY DILLER, CHAIRMAN, IAC: I am not a proponent of quote, \"trade wars\" - - their trade practices have to change, trying to pick trade wars. If you let an unfettered trade war actually take place, which is in our control, it would be disastrous for everybody.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have the very latest coming up. More of Barry Diller this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning. And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman; and Benchmark managing partner, Kevin Kelly. Great to see you this morning.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: So Alibaba is actually up right now 5 percent in the premarket because they actually beat pretty significantly on the revenues and on their bottom line. They have a revenue forecast cut on macroeconomic conditions though. So even though they did beat, so it was initially up 5 percent, now it seems like it's coming down a little bit because probably of this forecast of macro concerns.</p><p>And one of the things they're actually talking about is also the money they need to spend into their streaming services. So in order for them to be the Netflix of China, they're indicating they need to spend significantly more on their content.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it is losing ground quickly.</p><p>KELLY: It is losing ground quickly. But they said their annual active buyers are actually up 23 percent so they're doing very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So the numbers are better than expected --</p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- but they're going to be having to see costs go up.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. They're seeing costs go up, and also they're guiding revenues down because of macro conditions. So unless Trump and President Xi Jinping have beautiful chocolate cake, Alibaba is very concerned.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The chocolate cake moment.</p><p>We've got a lot coming up this morning. Part two of my exclusive interview with the chairman and senior executive of both IAC and Expedia Group. That's Barry Diller. He weighs in on Amazon, Google, U.S. trade relations with China as well as General Electric as well. You don't want to miss a moment of it. So do stay with us for that interview.</p><p>But we want to get to Apple because the stock is trading down this morning on disappointing guidance. It is on track to shave about 85 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Stock right now down 5.5 percent as CEO Tim Cook said that the company will no longer give unit sales figures in future reports. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: This is like if you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says or he says how many units you have in there? It doesn't -- it doesn't matter a lot, how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what's in the cart.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Interesting. Well, I can understand the analogy. Does it not matter? I would imagine analysts --</p><p>KELLY: No. I think it matters.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: If your investors tell you it matters, then it matters. Whatever your messaging is -- more information is better. You can't be in the news business and say I want less information from the world's $1 trillion company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": No, I'm not going to say that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ok.</p><p>FREEMAN: Obviously, you do want more information and as people think about the company's future, they want to see in each segment how it's doing. But I would say in his defense, this has never been a company that -- where it's about volume. Apple really has not been the big volume producer. That's the android universe.</p><p>So what Apple sells is to a smaller market but to a much more lucrative market, very high-priced, very high-margin products. So if you're seeing what you want to see on the revenue and the earnings from each of these products --</p><p>KELLY: I beg to differ.</p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't know that it's the end of the world that you don't see how many devices.</p><p>KELLY: It's not about that. It's not even about the iPhone anymore. It's 60 percent of sales now. It used to be a lot more of that. It actually used to be 75 percent of sales. But we need to get unit sales on Mac books, on their home pods, on their watches -- that is the next leg of growth for them and attribution into their ecosystem.</p><p>So the problem is that they missed on the services side. In order for the services side to grow, we need to know how many units they're selling of each product line. So I need to know what's in that shopping cart because they missed on the services.</p><p>They had less than $10 billion. They're saying that it's $10 billion. It was actually less than that. It was $9.981 billion when every analyst across the street had at least $10.18 billion.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We should point out that services --</p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>KELLY: So that's the biggest issue.</p><p>FREEMAN: The market agrees with you. Over time, I think this is probably not going to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're calling this a miss.</p><p>KELLY: No -- but this is a miss. They missed on unit sales for iPhones which is 60 percent of the revenue. And then they're refreshing all their Macbook Pros and their watches and now we're not going to get guidance into that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: The growth -- they missed on the forecast for the December quarter that it was -- they show slowing growth there. That was the revenue forecast. In terms of the services business, we should just point out that's app store sales, Apple pay use, music streaming, subscriptions stuff like that -- revenue growth there was up 17 percent. That's slower in recent quarters.</p><p>When you have a valuation like this, you have to -- your growth rates need to be bigger and bigger and bigger, not smaller and smaller and smaller.</p><p>KELLY: That's it. And listen Morgan Stanley just downgraded the price target from $247 to $226 and their analyst has been very good on the stock. You had BAML -- Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch downgrade their price target to $223 --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't forget what Dan Miles -- I know I keep saying this -- but he was right. I mean what's your take on inventory because Dan said that in the second quarter inventory was up 89 percent. And that also goes hand in hand with the unit sales because if you've got all this inventory, first you've got get rid of that before you actually start producing more.</p><p>KELLY: That's it. And they're not expecting to sell more that's why you're seeing them increase the price of their products -- ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KELLY: And then they also had their component costs go down. So that's great. But I don't invest in the stock market looking in the rearview mirror. I invest looking forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's look forward to the jobs report. That's another major story this morning because the jobs report is coming out in an hour-and-a- half.</p><p>We want to check out one of the election's most pivotal states this morning and that's Florida.</p><p>Kristina Partsinevelos as has more from the Sunshine State this morning. And Kristina -- it's been a good jobs market in Florida as well. Good morning to you.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. And you're right.</p><p>Yes, it is a pivotal race. It's a swing state. And this year is no different. We have a lot of people looking at the governor's race and the senate race.</p><p>We have former President Obama who is going to be here in Miami where I am right now on Route 1. It's very early in the morning so it's still quite dark out. He's throwing his support behind the Dems. You've got Andrew Gillum who's running for governor and then incumbent Bill Nelson who is also going for Senate. So those are the two candidates that former President Obama is supporting.</p><p>If we take a look at the Real Clear Politics polls and average multi-polls (ph) that we're seeing across the board for governor in Florida, you're seeing a slight lead, a little bit less than 3 percent for Gillum. Gillum is 39 years old, a progressive, mayor of Tallahassee -- pretty much pushing for higher minimum wage and higher corporate taxes.</p><p>He is going against Republican Ron DeSantis who has the full support of President Trump. They will be together on Saturday in Pensacola. And you have Ron DeSantis who is an advocate for gun control. There hasn't been a Democrat who's been elected for the governor's race since 1994.</p><p>And we switch over to Senate race which is also closely watched -- we look at the polls over there from Real Clear Politics again, you're seeing as of this morning less than 2 percent lead for Bill Nelson. So Bill Nelson, 75 years old, a centrist -- he's pushing for a ban on assault rifles.</p><p>And he's going against Governor Rick Scott who's very familiar here because he served two terms as governor. He wants to continue his political life which is why he's running for Senate. A lot can happen here.</p><p>We have former President Obama here, in Georgia on Friday and in Chicago on Sunday. Lots of movement in Florida and we're going to be here.</p><p>Back to you -- guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's really an important race. Kristina -- thank you. We'll keep checking back. Kristina Partsinevelos is in Miami this morning.</p><p>Joining us right now is Florida Congressman Ted Yoho. He's running for office in Florida's third congressional district and is on the Foreign Affairs and Agriculture House Committees. Sir -- it's good to have you on this morning.</p><p>REP. TED YOHO (R), FLORIDA: Hi.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>YOHO: Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you feel going into the midterms in terms of your own prospects?</p><p>YOHO: I feel really good. We've got a lot of momentum on the ground. We've got people out door-knocking, making phone calls. We're doing rallies and coffees all over the district.</p><p>The momentum is on our side that we're seeing. And I think you're going to see it carry through the governor's race and the Senate race with Rick Scott.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it doesn't look like that. We're looking at the numbers. And if you believe the polls, it looks like Gillum is in the lead and even Nelson is in the lead. What do you think about that?</p><p>YOHO: Well, we got internal polls-- we've got internal polls that show different. If you go back to the last presidential election, they had Hillary Clinton leading the day of the election. So I think there's a lot of movement on the ground. I think you're going see this.</p><p>And then you've got our governor's race -- you know, you've got a guy that's under FBI investigation and he's got a liberal progressive agenda that wants to roll back what Rick Scott has done.</p><p>And then you compare Rick Scott's record with Bill Nelson is just like a place holder and he's not accomplished a whole lot. Rick Scott has created 1.6 million jobs in this state, lowered taxes and we've got one of the best ratings, if not the best rating in the country for a state.</p><p>Rick Scott has done an awesome job. He'll do that in the senate. And I can't wait for him to get up there and work with him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman -- it's Dagen McDowell. The unemployment rate in the state of Florida is below the national average. It was 3.5 percent in Florida.</p><p>YOHO: It sure is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Rick Scott took that economy to a trillion dollars in terms of its value.</p><p>YOHO: He sure did.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why isn't that resonating with the voters? Why wouldn't he be leading Bill Nelson?</p><p>YOHO: Well, you know, I guess politics. You know, you've got all these negative ads going out there from both sides. Mainly, you see more attacks from the other side.</p><p>But then you look at, you know, where he stands on things. Rick Scott has not varied on who he is and what he said and what he said he was going to accomplish. He's done that. And the voters -- like I said, our internal polls show a different story than what you're seeing on national polls.</p><p>And then, you know, again I can account for District 3 which is six counties in north central Florida. But we talk to people all over the state. This economy that we have, we've not seen this before.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>YOHO: And then you take, you know, the tax cuts that we did with President Trump and rolled back regulations, that fits hand in hand. Andrew Gillum wants to go the other way --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>YOHO: -- and Bill Nelson want to go the other way. The people of Florida are not ready for that.</p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And so you're just -- you're not believing -- you're not believing these polls. You say your polls say something different.</p><p>How important is the China story for Floridians? I mean the U.S.-China trade issue? The President yesterday sounded optimistic because he had a phone call with the Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>But I spoke with the former CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer yesterday, along with the chairman of IAC Barry Diller, and they were both incredibly concerned about China's business practices. Listen to this. I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: 90 percent of companies are using the Microsoft operating platform and only 1 percent are paying for it. How do we -- what are we going to do that China keeps stealing everything this way? I mean that's pretty extraordinary.</p><p>STEVE BALLMER, FORMER CEO, MICROSOFT: I'm a free trader by nature. I went to school, economics -- it's the best thing for the world. This one's a tricky issue because it's absolutely clear that the rules don't apply in China and the U.S. government needs to do something -- whether tariffs are right or wrong, I'm silent on that point.</p><p>But without any pressure from the U.S. government, we're talking about $10 billion plus for example in Microsoft that would go into profit.</p><p>DILLER: Their trade practices have to change. And us being tough-minded about it, I think it's sensible. I think us being outrageous and excessive about it is dangerous. I don't think the trade war is -- if you let an unfettered trade war actually take place, which is in our control, it will be disastrous for everybody. So they will have to mature their practices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman-- your reaction? Is this an issue for Floridians?</p><p>YOHO: It's an issue all over the nation. But what President Trump is doing is something that had to be done. Unchecked it would get worse. And so I'm glad he's doing what he's doing and I stand behind him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman -- it's good to have you on the program. We'll be watching the developments on Tuesday. It's nice (ph) to see you -- thank you.</p><p>YOHO: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ted Yoho.</p><p>We also invited Congressman Yoho's opponent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching earnings. We get two more Dow components coming this morning.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with all the details now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: A lot of market moving news before the market even opens -- Maria.</p><p>ExxonMobil expected to post double digit gains in earnings and revenue from a year ago with the average price for oil up 34 percent for the third quarter in general.</p><p>We're also going to get results from Chevron today. Analysts looking for the company's profits to double with revenue up nearly 30 percent. That's the oil story.</p><p>Alibaba out with its latest results just a few minutes ago. Revenue rising 54 percent from a year ago to $12.4 billion. Shares are substantially higher in the premarket, up almost 6 percent right now. All right. That stock though is off the highs from previous revenue guidance.</p><p>And also, we're looking at Apple, real quick here. The stock is trading sharply lower, down almost 6 percent in the premarket. Earnings, as we've been talking about today topped the street's estimates in the latest quarter but Apple also issued disappointing guidance for the current quarter which includes, of course, the holiday season and we've been talking about the unit sales issue. This raises questions about weaker than expected demand for their more expensive new iPhones which we're not going to be getting numbers on anymore.</p><p>All right. There is this -- a group of Tesla shareholders wants to put tighter reins on CEO Elon Musk. Three Tesla investors sent the board a letter saying the company should permanently separate the positions of chairman and chief executive, both of which Musk holds. That would go beyond Tesla's settlement with the SEC that required Musk to step down as chairman for just three years.</p><p>The directors are also calling for more turnover on the company's board, recommending a time line be set for some directors to leave. There is Tesla in the premarket, up almost three-quarters of a percent.</p><p>And then there is this -- bottomless beer no more. Co-working space Wework is now setting a limit for what used to be bottomless kegs of beer for its tenants. The New York tenants are now going to be limited to just four beers per day-- each person per day. Wework says that the change was determined by software to help manage the beer supply.</p><p>So it's a software issue, not the fact that people were getting drunk at Wework while they were working there. Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't even understand that. They were drinking more than four beers a day during the day?</p><p>CASONE: Yes. Bottomless beer, bottomless mimosas -- you know what happens. This is what the story is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's in your cup?</p><p>KELLY: Oh yes. This is definitely not gin. It's for sure water.</p><p>But I just wanted real quickly on the Alibaba side --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Thanks -- Cheryl.</p><p>KELLY: I accidentally said that they beat on the top line, miss on the bottom. It was the inverse. Alibaba missed on the top line, beat significantly on the bottom line. But the main takeaway is that they actually guided their revenue forecast down 4 percent to 6 percent going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Look at this. Stock is still up -- Kevin.</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's up almost 6 percent even though it's a revenue miss. Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, a scare on the high seas to tell you about -- details on the terrifying moments that caused a cruise ship to tilt. That's coming up.</p><p>Then countdown to the midterms is on, we break down why the number one issue for voters apparently according to the polls is health care.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We are only four days away from the midterm elections. In a recent Fox News poll, health care is the number one issue driving Americans to the voting booth. Joining us right now is Dr. Joseph Galati. He is the author of \"Eating Yourself Sick\".</p><p>Why do you think health care has become a top priority in our country is the number one issue here? Dr. Galati -- good to see you. Thanks for being here.</p><p>DR. JOSEPH GALATI, AUTHOR, \"EATING YOURSELF SICK\": Well -- thank you, Maria.</p><p>You know, health care is always a hot button topic. Our patients -- the ones that I'm dealing with in Texas come to me with all sorts of insurance problems. They're worried about pre-existing. They're worried about insurance companies not covering certain procedures or disorders that they have.</p><p>And so a day doesn't go by that patients are not sitting in my office, talking and complaining about their health care. How it's going to be solved, I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GALATI: It's really a big, behemoth problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So James -- lay out the issue for us in terms of pre-existing conditions.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. So the idea is you don't want to let people buy insurance on their way to the hospital. This would be the argument to say let's have an insurance market. If you are sick already, you don't need insurance. You need health care.</p><p>So you need a system that allows people to get the care they need but if you're going to have an insurance market, they have to be able to sell to healthy people, not just sick people and so that's the theory. Now, the President has said he doesn't want to change anything with pre-existing conditions. That wasn't changed obviously. The Republicans never rewrote Obamacare.</p><p>So it's kind of a phony issue in that way. But to me, I don't know if you're hearing from patients, this issue of the Medicare-for-all plan, which ends Medicare and ends private insurance, in other words, it ends all pre-existing coverage, every person in the United States this is the plan that most Democrats in the House have endorsed -- Bernie Sanders, a lot of the Senate candidates. It ends all coverage in the U.S. and creates a new government plan. What does that mean for patients?</p><p>GALATI: You know, when you read about this Medicare for all, it's very thin on details. It's very thin on whether administrative costs are going to go down, whether it's going to provide better health care. That is really unclear.</p><p>And unfortunately, whenever people hear something for all, people jump on the bandwagon and say this is good for America. When really if we're voting on it or talking about it, the details are thin and you know, what really are we dealing with?</p><p>FREEMAN: But we do know from the legislation whether it's the Bernie Sanders plan or the one that most House Democrats have co-sponsored, it explicitly says private insurance goes away. Medicare goes away.</p><p>So this is the end of pre-existing coverage. Not just particular conditions. Your whole health plan is changing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: People do not understand this.</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't know why this isn't an issue in this election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. And you're all about wellness and prevention, I mean getting ahead of disease.</p><p>GALATI: It is. And the sad part is, in my area of liver disease that I take care of, we see patients, we counsel them on staying well. Because taking care of somebody at the end is not the way to take care of yourself.</p><p>And so in the book, \"Eating Yourself Sick\", 30 years of interviewing thousands of patients, I see that. I had a conversation with a patient five years ago, six years ago, and they just continued to decline. And the common thread in so many of these diseases -- fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, diabetes, heart disease, cancer -- it's what we're eating.</p><p>It sounds real simple but what Americans are eating -- the processed foods -- is crazy. We have lost our way on eating at home, cooking at home with your children. And what I propose, as simple as it is, is to get back to the basics.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. It's prevention all the way. Get ahead of disease. That will eliminate all the costs that we're faced with in the terms of cure and care rather than prevention.</p><p>GALATI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dr. Galati -- we could talk about this all day.</p><p>GALATI: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is probably our favorite subject, actually.</p><p>GALATI: It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you for joining us.</p><p>GALATI: Absolutely. It's been a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you. Joseph Galati there.</p><p>Coming up -- the streaming wars are heating up, technology giants Amazon and (AUDIO GAP) Netflix.</p><p>Stay with us for part two of my exclusive interview with the chairman and senior exec of both IAC and Expedia Group.

Good Friday  morning, everybody.  TGIF.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Friday, November 2nd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Major market moves this morning -- Apple shares the story of the day.  It  is down on weak revenue guidance and on the announcement that the company  is no longer going to be providing unit sales.  So we will not know  specific unit sales on a quarterly basis anymore.  The technology giant at  risk of losing a $1-trillion market valuation with today's move.  It is  down 5.25 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The other big story of the market, of course, is the October jobs report.   Yes, it is jobs Friday right here.  The expectation is for 190,000 jobs  added to the economy in the month of October with the unemployment rate  holding steady at 3.7 percent which is a multi-decade low.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We will take a look at what this means for the midterm elections and the  market.  Of course, the midterms now four days away.</p><p>Check out futures this morning.  Even with the 5.5 percent selloff in  Apple, we're looking at a rally of 260 points on the Dow Jones Industrial  Average.  It's going to be up about 1 percent right out of the gate this  morning.  The S&amp;P 500 is expected to be up 21 points.  That's three- quarters of 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq right now up 15 points, a quarter of  a percent on the Nasdaq.</p><p>This after another day of gains yesterday.  This is the third day of gains  for the markets yesterday.  The Dow Industrials up 265 points at the close.   All the major indices finished at their highs of the -- or near their highs  of the session.  The Dow, S&amp;P up better than 1 percent; the Nasdaq up 1.75  percent, 128 points higher yesterday for the Nasdaq.</p><p>Markets this morning across the globe higher -- FT 100 up three-quarters of  a percent, 53 points higher in London; one-and-a-third percent higher in  Paris on the CAC 40 at 66 points higher; and the DAX index in Germany up  172 points, that's 1.5 percent higher in Germany. </p><p>In Asia, overnight gains across the board -- check it out.  Best performer  Hong Kong -- Hang Seng index up better than 4 percent overnight.</p><p>On the earnings front, we are watching Alibaba earnings later this morning.   We will hear from oil giants and Dow components, ExxonMobil and Chevron.   We'll have those numbers and analysis.</p><p>Right now, it's really Apple which is a big focus but these are coming out  soon.</p><p>China trade in focus -- this was important yesterday in the markets.   President Trump spoke with China's president Xi Jinping and apparently  there was progress in the trade dispute from what we understand from that  phone call.  It definitely helped markets rally yesterday in the middle of  the day.</p><p>Here's what IAC chairman Barry Diller told me about China's trade practices  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARRY DILLER, CHAIRMAN, IAC:  I am not a proponent of quote, \"trade wars\" - - their trade practices have to change, trying to pick trade wars.  If you  let an unfettered trade war actually take place, which is in our control,  it would be disastrous for everybody.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest coming up.  More of Barry Diller this  morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street  Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman; and Benchmark  managing partner, Kevin Kelly.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  So Alibaba is actually up right  now 5 percent in the premarket because they actually beat pretty  significantly on the revenues and on their bottom line.  They have a  revenue forecast cut on macroeconomic conditions though.  So even though  they did beat, so it was initially up 5 percent, now it seems like it's  coming down a little bit because probably of this forecast of macro  concerns.</p><p>And one of the things they're actually talking about is also the money they  need to spend into their streaming services.  So in order for them to be  the Netflix of China, they're indicating they need to spend significantly  more on their content.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it is losing ground quickly.  </p><p>KELLY:  It is losing ground quickly.  But they said their annual active  buyers are actually up 23 percent so they're doing very well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the numbers are better than expected -- </p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- but they're going to be having to see costs go up.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  They're seeing costs go up, and also they're guiding revenues  down because of macro conditions.  So unless Trump and President Xi Jinping  have beautiful chocolate cake, Alibaba is very concerned.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The chocolate cake moment.  </p><p>We've got a lot coming up this morning.  Part two of my exclusive interview  with the chairman and senior executive of both IAC and Expedia Group.   That's Barry Diller.  He weighs in on Amazon, Google, U.S. trade relations  with China as well as General Electric as well.  You don't want to miss a  moment of it.  So do stay with us for that interview.</p><p>But we want to get to Apple because the stock is trading down this morning  on disappointing guidance.  It is on track to shave about 85 points from  the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Stock right now down 5.5 percent as CEO  Tim Cook said that the company will no longer give unit sales figures in  future reports.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  This is like if you go to the market and you push  your cart up to the cashier and she says or he says how many units you have  in there?  It doesn't -- it doesn't matter a lot, how many units there are  in there in terms of the overall value of what's in the cart.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  Well, I can understand the analogy.  Does it not  matter?  I would imagine analysts -- </p><p>KELLY:  No.  I think it matters.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  If your investors tell you it  matters, then it matters.  Whatever your messaging is -- more information  is better.  You can't be in the news business and say I want less  information from the world's $1 trillion company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   No, I'm not going to say that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Obviously, you do want more information and as people think about  the company's future, they want to see in each segment how it's doing.  But  I would say in his defense, this has never been a company that -- where  it's about volume.  Apple really has not been the big volume producer.   That's the android universe.</p><p>So what Apple sells is to a smaller market but to a much more lucrative  market, very high-priced, very high-margin products.  So if you're seeing  what you want to see on the revenue and the earnings from each of these  products -- </p><p>KELLY:  I beg to differ.  </p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know that it's the end of the world that you don't see  how many devices.  </p><p>KELLY:  It's not about that.  It's not even about the iPhone anymore.  It's  60 percent of sales now.  It used to be a lot more of that.  It actually  used to be 75 percent of sales.  But we need to get unit sales on Mac  books, on their home pods, on their watches -- that is the next leg of  growth for them and attribution into their ecosystem.</p><p>So the problem is that they missed on the services side.  In order for the  services side to grow, we need to know how many units they're selling of  each product line.  So I need to know what's in that shopping cart because  they missed on the services.</p><p>They had less than $10 billion.  They're saying that it's $10 billion.  It  was actually less than that.  It was $9.981 billion when every analyst  across the street had at least $10.18 billion.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We should point out that services -- </p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>KELLY:  So that's the biggest issue.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The market agrees with you.  Over time, I think this is probably  not going to be -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're calling this a miss.  </p><p>KELLY:  No -- but this is a miss.  They missed on unit sales for iPhones  which is 60 percent of the revenue.  And then they're refreshing all their  Macbook Pros and their watches and now we're not going to get guidance into  that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The growth -- they missed on the forecast for the December  quarter that it was -- they show slowing growth there.  That was the  revenue forecast.  In terms of the services business, we should just point  out that's app store sales, Apple pay use, music streaming, subscriptions  stuff like that -- revenue growth there was up 17 percent.  That's slower  in recent quarters.</p><p>When you have a valuation like this, you have to -- your growth rates need  to be bigger and bigger and bigger, not smaller and smaller and smaller.  </p><p>KELLY:  That's it.  And listen Morgan Stanley just downgraded the price  target from $247 to $226 and their analyst has been very good on the stock.   You had BAML -- Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch downgrade their price target  to $223 -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't forget what Dan Miles -- I know I keep saying this -- but  he was right.  I mean what's your take on inventory because Dan said that  in the second quarter inventory was up 89 percent.  And that also goes hand  in hand with the unit sales because if you've got all this inventory, first  you've got get rid of that before you actually start producing more.  </p><p>KELLY:  That's it.  And they're not expecting to sell more that's why  you're seeing them increase the price of their products -- ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KELLY:  And then they also had their component costs go down.  So that's  great.  But I don't invest in the stock market looking in the rearview  mirror.  I invest looking forward.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's look forward to the jobs report.  That's another major  story this morning because the jobs report is coming out in an hour-and-a- half.</p><p>We want to check out one of the election's most pivotal states this morning  and that's Florida.</p><p>Kristina Partsinevelos as has more from the Sunshine State this morning.   And Kristina -- it's been a good jobs market in Florida as well.  Good  morning to you.  </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   And you're right.</p><p>Yes, it is a pivotal race.  It's a swing state.  And this year is no  different.  We have a lot of people looking at the governor's race and the  senate race.</p><p>We have former President Obama who is going to be here in Miami where I am  right now on Route 1.  It's very early in the morning so it's still quite  dark out.  He's throwing his support behind the Dems.  You've got Andrew  Gillum who's running for governor and then incumbent Bill Nelson who is  also going for Senate.  So those are the two candidates that former  President Obama is supporting.</p><p>If we take a look at the Real Clear Politics polls and average multi-polls  (ph) that we're seeing across the board for governor in Florida, you're  seeing a slight lead, a little bit less than 3 percent for Gillum.  Gillum  is 39 years old, a progressive, mayor of Tallahassee -- pretty much pushing  for higher minimum wage and higher corporate taxes.</p><p>He is going against Republican Ron DeSantis who has the full support of  President Trump.  They will be together on Saturday in Pensacola.  And you  have Ron DeSantis who is an advocate for gun control.  There hasn't been a  Democrat who's been elected for the governor's race since 1994.  </p><p>And we switch over to Senate race which is also closely watched -- we look  at the polls over there from Real Clear Politics again, you're seeing as of  this morning less than 2 percent lead for Bill Nelson.  So Bill Nelson, 75  years old, a centrist -- he's pushing for a ban on assault rifles.</p><p>And he's going against Governor Rick Scott who's very familiar here because  he served two terms as governor.  He wants to continue his political life  which is why he's running for Senate.  A lot can happen here.  </p><p>We have former President Obama here, in Georgia on Friday and in Chicago on  Sunday.  Lots of movement in Florida and we're going to be here.  </p><p>Back to you -- guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's really an important race.  Kristina -- thank you.   We'll keep checking back.  Kristina Partsinevelos is in Miami this morning.</p><p>Joining us right now is Florida Congressman Ted Yoho.  He's running for  office in Florida's third congressional district and is on the Foreign  Affairs and Agriculture House Committees.  Sir -- it's good to have you on  this morning.  </p><p>REP. TED YOHO (R), FLORIDA:  Hi.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>YOHO:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you feel going into the midterms in terms of your own  prospects?  </p><p>YOHO:  I feel really good.  We've got a lot of momentum on the ground.   We've got people out door-knocking, making phone calls.  We're doing  rallies and coffees all over the district.</p><p>The momentum is on our side that we're seeing.  And I think you're going to  see it carry through the governor's race and the Senate race with Rick  Scott.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it doesn't look like that.  We're looking at the numbers.   And if you believe the polls, it looks like Gillum is in the lead and even  Nelson is in the lead.  What do you think about that?  </p><p>YOHO:  Well, we got internal polls-- we've got internal polls that show  different.  If you go back to the last presidential election, they had  Hillary Clinton leading the day of the election.  So I think there's a lot  of movement on the ground.  I think you're going see this. </p><p>And then you've got our governor's race -- you know, you've got a guy  that's under FBI investigation and he's got a liberal progressive agenda  that wants to roll back what Rick Scott has done.</p><p>And then you compare Rick Scott's record with Bill Nelson is just like a  place holder and he's not accomplished a whole lot.  Rick Scott has created  1.6 million jobs in this state, lowered taxes and we've got one of the best  ratings, if not the best rating in the country for a state.</p><p>Rick Scott has done an awesome job.  He'll do that in the senate.  And I  can't wait for him to get up there and work with him.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- it's Dagen McDowell.  The unemployment rate in  the state of Florida is below the national average.  It was 3.5 percent in  Florida.  </p><p>YOHO:  It sure is.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rick Scott took that economy to a trillion dollars in terms of  its value.  </p><p>YOHO:  He sure did.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why isn't that resonating with the voters?  Why wouldn't he be  leading Bill Nelson?  </p><p>YOHO:  Well, you know, I guess politics.  You know, you've got all these  negative ads going out there from both sides.  Mainly, you see more attacks  from the other side.</p><p>But then you look at, you know, where he stands on things.  Rick Scott has  not varied on who he is and what he said and what he said he was going to  accomplish.  He's done that.  And the voters -- like I said, our internal  polls show a different story than what you're seeing on national polls.</p><p>And then, you know, again I can account for District 3 which is six  counties in north central Florida.  But we talk to people all over the  state.  This economy that we have, we've not seen this before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>YOHO:  And then you take, you know, the tax cuts that we did with President  Trump and rolled back regulations, that fits hand in hand.  Andrew Gillum  wants to go the other way -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>YOHO:  -- and Bill Nelson want to go the other way.  The people of Florida  are not ready for that.  </p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so you're just -- you're not believing -- you're not  believing these polls.  You say your polls say something different.  </p><p>How important is the China story for Floridians?  I mean the U.S.-China  trade issue?  The President yesterday sounded optimistic because he had a  phone call with the Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>But I spoke with the former CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer yesterday,  along with the chairman of IAC Barry Diller, and they were both incredibly  concerned about China's business practices.  Listen to this.  I've got to  get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  90 percent of companies are using the Microsoft operating  platform and only 1 percent are paying for it.  How do we -- what are we  going to do that China keeps stealing everything this way?  I mean that's  pretty extraordinary.  </p><p>STEVE BALLMER, FORMER CEO, MICROSOFT:  I'm a free trader by nature.  I went  to school, economics -- it's the best thing for the world.  This one's a  tricky issue because it's absolutely clear that the rules don't apply in  China and the U.S. government needs to do something -- whether tariffs are  right or wrong, I'm silent on that point.</p><p>But without any pressure from the U.S. government, we're talking about $10  billion plus for example in Microsoft that would go into profit.  </p><p>DILLER:  Their trade practices have to change.  And us being tough-minded  about it, I think it's sensible.  I think us being outrageous and excessive  about it is dangerous.  I don't think the trade war is -- if you let an  unfettered trade war actually take place, which is in our control, it will  be disastrous for everybody.  So they will have to mature their practices.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman-- your reaction?  Is this an issue for Floridians?  </p><p>YOHO:  It's an issue all over the nation.  But what President Trump is  doing is something that had to be done.  Unchecked it would get worse.  And  so I'm glad he's doing what he's doing and I stand behind him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- it's good to have you on the program.  We'll be  watching the developments on Tuesday.  It's nice (ph) to see you -- thank  you.</p><p>YOHO:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ted Yoho.</p><p>We also invited Congressman Yoho's opponent.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching earnings.  We get two more Dow components coming this  morning.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with all the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  A lot of market moving  news before the market even opens -- Maria.</p><p>ExxonMobil expected to post double digit gains in earnings and revenue from  a year ago with the average price for oil up 34 percent for the third  quarter in general.</p><p>We're also going to get results from Chevron today.  Analysts looking for  the company's profits to double with revenue up nearly 30 percent.  That's  the oil story.</p><p>Alibaba out with its latest results just a few minutes ago.  Revenue rising  54 percent from a year ago to $12.4 billion.  Shares are substantially  higher in the premarket, up almost 6 percent right now.  All right.  That  stock though is off the highs from previous revenue guidance.</p><p>And also, we're looking at Apple, real quick here.  The stock is trading  sharply lower, down almost 6 percent in the premarket.  Earnings, as we've  been talking about today topped the street's estimates in the latest  quarter but Apple also issued disappointing guidance for the current  quarter which includes, of course, the holiday season and we've been  talking about the unit sales issue.  This raises questions about weaker  than expected demand for their more expensive new iPhones which we're not  going to be getting numbers on anymore.</p><p>All right.  There is this -- a group of Tesla shareholders wants to put  tighter reins on CEO Elon Musk.  Three Tesla investors sent the board a  letter saying the company should permanently separate the positions of  chairman and chief executive, both of which Musk holds.  That would go  beyond Tesla's settlement with the SEC that required Musk to step down as  chairman for just three years.</p><p>The directors are also calling for more turnover on the company's board,  recommending a time line be set for some directors to leave.  There is  Tesla in the premarket, up almost three-quarters of a percent.</p><p>And then there is this -- bottomless beer no more.  Co-working space Wework  is now setting a limit for what used to be bottomless kegs of beer for its  tenants.  The New York tenants are now going to be limited to just four  beers per day-- each person per day.  Wework says that the change was  determined by software to help manage the beer supply.</p><p>So it's a software issue, not the fact that people were getting drunk at  Wework while they were working there.  Ok.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't even understand that.  They were drinking more than  four beers a day during the day?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Bottomless beer, bottomless mimosas -- you know what  happens.  This is what the story is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's in your cup?  </p><p>KELLY:  Oh yes.  This is definitely not gin.  It's for sure water.</p><p>But I just wanted real quickly on the Alibaba side -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Thanks -- Cheryl.</p><p>KELLY:  I accidentally said that they beat on the top line, miss on the  bottom.  It was the inverse.  Alibaba missed on the top line, beat  significantly on the bottom line.  But the main takeaway is that they  actually guided their revenue forecast down 4 percent to 6 percent going  forward.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Look at this.  Stock is still up -- Kevin.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's up almost 6 percent even though it's a revenue miss.   Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, a scare on the high seas to tell you about -- details on the  terrifying moments that caused a cruise ship to tilt.  That's coming up.</p><p>Then countdown to the midterms is on, we break down why the number one  issue for voters apparently according to the polls is health care.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are only four days away from the midterm elections.  In a recent Fox  News poll, health care is the number one issue driving Americans to the  voting booth.  Joining us right now is Dr. Joseph Galati.  He is the author  of \"Eating Yourself Sick\".</p><p>Why do you think health care has become a top priority in our country is  the number one issue here?  Dr. Galati -- good to see you.  Thanks for  being here.  </p><p>DR. JOSEPH GALATI, AUTHOR, \"EATING YOURSELF SICK\":  Well -- thank you,  Maria.</p><p>You know, health care is always a hot button topic.  Our patients -- the  ones that I'm dealing with in Texas come to me with all sorts of insurance  problems.  They're worried about pre-existing.  They're worried about  insurance companies not covering certain procedures or disorders that they  have.</p><p>And so a day doesn't go by that patients are not sitting in my office,  talking and complaining about their health care.  How it's going to be  solved, I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GALATI:  It's really a big, behemoth problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So James -- lay out the issue for us in terms of pre-existing  conditions.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So the idea is you don't want to let people buy insurance  on their way to the hospital.  This would be the argument to say let's have  an insurance market.  If you are sick already, you don't need insurance.   You need health care.</p><p>So you need a system that allows people to get the care they need but if  you're going to have an insurance market, they have to be able to sell to  healthy people, not just sick people and so that's the theory.  Now, the  President has said he doesn't want to change anything with pre-existing  conditions.  That wasn't changed obviously.  The Republicans never rewrote  Obamacare.</p><p>So it's kind of a phony issue in that way.  But to me, I don't know if  you're hearing from patients, this issue of the Medicare-for-all plan,  which ends Medicare and ends private insurance, in other words, it ends all  pre-existing coverage, every person in the United States this is the plan  that most Democrats in the House have endorsed -- Bernie Sanders, a lot of  the Senate candidates.  It ends all coverage in the U.S. and creates a new  government plan.  What does that mean for patients?  </p><p>GALATI:  You know, when you read about this Medicare for all, it's very  thin on details.  It's very thin on whether administrative costs are going  to go down, whether it's going to provide better health care.  That is  really unclear.</p><p>And unfortunately, whenever people hear something for all, people jump on  the bandwagon and say this is good for America.  When really if we're  voting on it or talking about it, the details are thin and you know, what  really are we dealing with?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But we do know from the legislation whether it's the Bernie  Sanders plan or the one that most House Democrats have co-sponsored, it  explicitly says private insurance goes away.  Medicare goes away.</p><p>So this is the end of pre-existing coverage.  Not just particular  conditions.  Your whole health plan is changing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People do not understand this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know why this isn't an issue in this election.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And you're all about wellness and prevention, I mean  getting ahead of disease.  </p><p>GALATI:  It is.  And the sad part is, in my area of liver disease that I  take care of, we see patients, we counsel them on staying well.  Because  taking care of somebody at the end is not the way to take care of yourself.</p><p>And so in the book, \"Eating Yourself Sick\", 30 years of interviewing  thousands of patients, I see that.  I had a conversation with a patient  five years ago, six years ago, and they just continued to decline.  And the  common thread in so many of these diseases -- fatty liver disease,  cirrhosis, diabetes, heart disease, cancer -- it's what we're eating.</p><p>It sounds real simple but what Americans are eating -- the processed foods  -- is crazy.  We have lost our way on eating at home, cooking at home with  your children.  And what I propose, as simple as it is, is to get back to  the basics.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  It's prevention all the way.  Get ahead of  disease.  That will eliminate all the costs that we're faced with in the  terms of cure and care rather than prevention.</p><p>GALATI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. Galati -- we could talk about this all day.  </p><p>GALATI:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is probably our favorite subject, actually.  </p><p>GALATI:  It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us.  </p><p>GALATI:  Absolutely.  It's been a pleasure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  Joseph Galati there.</p><p>Coming up -- the streaming wars are heating up, technology giants Amazon  and (AUDIO GAP) Netflix.</p><p>Stay with us for part two of my exclusive interview with the chairman and  senior exec of both IAC and Expedia Group.  Barry Diller weighs in on big  tech.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>730</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It  is down on weak revenue guidance and on the announcement that the company  is no longer going to be providing unit sales.  So we will not know  specific unit sales on a quarterly basis anymore.  The technology giant at  risk of losing a $1-trillion market valuation with today's move.  It is  down 5.25 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The other big story of the market, of course, is the October jobs report.   Yes, it is jobs Friday right here.  The expectation is for 190,000 jobs  added to the economy in the month of October with the unemployment rate  holding steady at 3.7 percent which is a multi-decade low.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We will take a look at what this means for the midterm elections and the  market.  Of course, the midterms now four days away.</p><p>Check out futures this morning.  Even with the 5.5 percent selloff in  Apple, we're looking at a rally of 260 points on the Dow Jones Industrial  Average.  It's going to be up about 1 percent right out of the gate this  morning.  The S&amp;P 500 is expected to be up 21 points.  That's three- quarters of 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq right now up 15 points, a quarter of  a percent on the Nasdaq.</p><p>This after another day of gains yesterday.  This is the third day of gains  for the markets yesterday.  The Dow Industrials up 265 points at the close.   All the major indices finished at their highs of the -- or near their highs  of the session.  The Dow, S&amp;P up better than 1 percent; the Nasdaq up 1.75  percent, 128 points higher yesterday for the Nasdaq.</p><p>Markets this morning across the globe higher -- FT 100 up three-quarters of  a percent, 53 points higher in London; one-and-a-third percent higher in  Paris on the CAC 40 at 66 points higher; and the DAX index in Germany up  172 points, that's 1.5 percent higher in Germany. </p><p>In Asia, overnight gains across the board -- check it out.  Best performer  Hong Kong -- Hang Seng index up better than 4 percent overnight.</p><p>On the earnings front, we are watching Alibaba earnings later this morning.   We will hear from oil giants and Dow components, ExxonMobil and Chevron.   We'll have those numbers and analysis.</p><p>Right now, it's really Apple which is a big focus but these are coming out  soon.</p><p>China trade in focus -- this was important yesterday in the markets.   President Trump spoke with China's president Xi Jinping and apparently  there was progress in the trade dispute from what we understand from that  phone call.  It definitely helped markets rally yesterday in the middle of  the day.</p><p>Here's what IAC chairman Barry Diller told me about China's trade practices  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARRY DILLER, CHAIRMAN, IAC:  I am not a proponent of quote, \"trade wars\" - - their trade practices have to change, trying to pick trade wars.  If you  let an unfettered trade war actually take place, which is in our control,  it would be disastrous for everybody.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest coming up.  More of Barry Diller this  morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street  Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman; and Benchmark  managing partner, Kevin Kelly.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  So Alibaba is actually up right  now 5 percent in the premarket because they actually beat pretty  significantly on the revenues and on their bottom line.  They have a  revenue forecast cut on macroeconomic conditions though.  So even though  they did beat, so it was initially up 5 percent, now it seems like it's  coming down a little bit because probably of this forecast of macro  concerns.</p><p>And one of the things they're actually talking about is also the money they  need to spend into their streaming services.  So in order for them to be  the Netflix of China, they're indicating they need to spend significantly  more on their content.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it is losing ground quickly.  </p><p>KELLY:  It is losing ground quickly.  But they said their annual active  buyers are actually up 23 percent so they're doing very well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the numbers are better than expected -- </p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- but they're going to be having to see costs go up.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  They're seeing costs go up, and also they're guiding revenues  down because of macro conditions.  So unless Trump and President Xi Jinping  have beautiful chocolate cake, Alibaba is very concerned.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The chocolate cake moment.  </p><p>We've got a lot coming up this morning.  Part two of my exclusive interview  with the chairman and senior executive of both IAC and Expedia Group.   That's Barry Diller.  He weighs in on Amazon, Google, U.S. trade relations  with China as well as General Electric as well.  You don't want to miss a  moment of it.  So do stay with us for that interview.</p><p>But we want to get to Apple because the stock is trading down this morning  on disappointing guidance.  It is on track to shave about 85 points from  the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Stock right now down 5.5 percent as CEO  Tim Cook said that the company will no longer give unit sales figures in  future reports.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  This is like if you go to the market and you push  your cart up to the cashier and she says or he says how many units you have  in there?  It doesn't -- it doesn't matter a lot, how many units there are  in there in terms of the overall value of what's in the cart.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  Well, I can understand the analogy.  Does it not  matter?  I would imagine analysts -- </p><p>KELLY:  No.  I think it matters.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  If your investors tell you it  matters, then it matters.  Whatever your messaging is -- more information  is better.  You can't be in the news business and say I want less  information from the world's $1 trillion company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   No, I'm not going to say that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Obviously, you do want more information and as people think about  the company's future, they want to see in each segment how it's doing.  But  I would say in his defense, this has never been a company that -- where  it's about volume.  Apple really has not been the big volume producer.   That's the android universe.</p><p>So what Apple sells is to a smaller market but to a much more lucrative  market, very high-priced, very high-margin products.  So if you're seeing  what you want to see on the revenue and the earnings from each of these  products -- </p><p>KELLY:  I beg to differ.  </p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know that it's the end of the world that you don't see  how many devices.  </p><p>KELLY:  It's not about that.  It's not even about the iPhone anymore.  It's  60 percent of sales now.  It used to be a lot more of that.  It actually  used to be 75 percent of sales.  But we need to get unit sales on Mac  books, on their home pods, on their watches -- that is the next leg of  growth for them and attribution into their ecosystem.</p><p>So the problem is that they missed on the services side.  In order for the  services side to grow, we need to know how many units they're selling of  each product line.  So I need to know what's in that shopping cart because  they missed on the services.</p><p>They had less than $10 billion.  They're saying that it's $10 billion.  It  was actually less than that.  It was $9.981 billion when every analyst  across the street had at least $10.18 billion.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We should point out that services -- </p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>KELLY:  So that's the biggest issue.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The market agrees with you.  Over time, I think this is probably  not going to be -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're calling this a miss.  </p><p>KELLY:  No -- but this is a miss.  They missed on unit sales for iPhones  which is 60 percent of the revenue.  And then they're refreshing all their  Macbook Pros and their watches and now we're not going to get guidance into  that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The growth -- they missed on the forecast for the December  quarter that it was -- they show slowing growth there.  That was the  revenue forecast.  In terms of the services business, we should just point  out that's app store sales, Apple pay use, music streaming, subscriptions  stuff like that -- revenue growth there was up 17 percent.  That's slower  in recent quarters.</p><p>When you have a valuation like this, you have to -- your growth rates need  to be bigger and bigger and bigger, not smaller and smaller and smaller.  </p><p>KELLY:  That's it.  And listen Morgan Stanley just downgraded the price  target from $247 to $226 and their analyst has been very good on the stock.   You had BAML -- Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch downgrade their price target  to $223 -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't forget what Dan Miles -- I know I keep saying this -- but  he was right.  I mean what's your take on inventory because Dan said that  in the second quarter inventory was up 89 percent.  And that also goes hand  in hand with the unit sales because if you've got all this inventory, first  you've got get rid of that before you actually start producing more.  </p><p>KELLY:  That's it.  And they're not expecting to sell more that's why  you're seeing them increase the price of their products -- ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KELLY:  And then they also had their component costs go down.  So that's  great.  But I don't invest in the stock market looking in the rearview  mirror.  I invest looking forward.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's look forward to the jobs report.  That's another major  story this morning because the jobs report is coming out in an hour-and-a- half.</p><p>We want to check out one of the election's most pivotal states this morning  and that's Florida.</p><p>Kristina Partsinevelos as has more from the Sunshine State this morning.   And Kristina -- it's been a good jobs market in Florida as well.  Good  morning to you.  </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   And you're right.</p><p>Yes, it is a pivotal race.  It's a swing state.  And this year is no  different.  We have a lot of people looking at the governor's race and the  senate race.</p><p>We have former President Obama who is going to be here in Miami where I am  right now on Route 1.  It's very early in the morning so it's still quite  dark out.  He's throwing his support behind the Dems.  You've got Andrew  Gillum who's running for governor and then incumbent Bill Nelson who is  also going for Senate.  So those are the two candidates that former  President Obama is supporting.</p><p>If we take a look at the Real Clear Politics polls and average multi-polls  (ph) that we're seeing across the board for governor in Florida, you're  seeing a slight lead, a little bit less than 3 percent for Gillum.  Gillum  is 39 years old, a progressive, mayor of Tallahassee -- pretty much pushing  for higher minimum wage and higher corporate taxes.</p><p>He is going against Republican Ron DeSantis who has the full support of  President Trump.  They will be together on Saturday in Pensacola.  And you  have Ron DeSantis who is an advocate for gun control.  There hasn't been a  Democrat who's been elected for the governor's race since 1994.  </p><p>And we switch over to Senate race which is also closely watched -- we look  at the polls over there from Real Clear Politics again, you're seeing as of  this morning less than 2 percent lead for Bill Nelson.  So Bill Nelson, 75  years old, a centrist -- he's pushing for a ban on assault rifles.</p><p>And he's going against Governor Rick Scott who's very familiar here because  he served two terms as governor.  He wants to continue his political life  which is why he's running for Senate.  A lot can happen here.  </p><p>We have former President Obama here, in Georgia on Friday and in Chicago on  Sunday.  Lots of movement in Florida and we're going to be here.  </p><p>Back to you -- guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's really an important race.  Kristina -- thank you.   We'll keep checking back.  Kristina Partsinevelos is in Miami this morning.</p><p>Joining us right now is Florida Congressman Ted Yoho.  He's running for  office in Florida's third congressional district and is on the Foreign  Affairs and Agriculture House Committees.  Sir -- it's good to have you on  this morning.  </p><p>REP. TED YOHO (R), FLORIDA:  Hi.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>YOHO:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you feel going into the midterms in terms of your own  prospects?  </p><p>YOHO:  I feel really good.  We've got a lot of momentum on the ground.   We've got people out door-knocking, making phone calls.  We're doing  rallies and coffees all over the district.</p><p>The momentum is on our side that we're seeing.  And I think you're going to  see it carry through the governor's race and the Senate race with Rick  Scott.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it doesn't look like that.  We're looking at the numbers.   And if you believe the polls, it looks like Gillum is in the lead and even  Nelson is in the lead.  What do you think about that?  </p><p>YOHO:  Well, we got internal polls-- we've got internal polls that show  different.  If you go back to the last presidential election, they had  Hillary Clinton leading the day of the election.  So I think there's a lot  of movement on the ground.  I think you're going see this. </p><p>And then you've got our governor's race -- you know, you've got a guy  that's under FBI investigation and he's got a liberal progressive agenda  that wants to roll back what Rick Scott has done.</p><p>And then you compare Rick Scott's record with Bill Nelson is just like a  place holder and he's not accomplished a whole lot.  Rick Scott has created  1.6 million jobs in this state, lowered taxes and we've got one of the best  ratings, if not the best rating in the country for a state.</p><p>Rick Scott has done an awesome job.  He'll do that in the senate.  And I  can't wait for him to get up there and work with him.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- it's Dagen McDowell.  The unemployment rate in  the state of Florida is below the national average.  It was 3.5 percent in  Florida.  </p><p>YOHO:  It sure is.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rick Scott took that economy to a trillion dollars in terms of  its value.  </p><p>YOHO:  He sure did.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why isn't that resonating with the voters?  Why wouldn't he be  leading Bill Nelson?  </p><p>YOHO:  Well, you know, I guess politics.  You know, you've got all these  negative ads going out there from both sides.  Mainly, you see more attacks  from the other side.</p><p>But then you look at, you know, where he stands on things.  Rick Scott has  not varied on who he is and what he said and what he said he was going to  accomplish.  He's done that.  And the voters -- like I said, our internal  polls show a different story than what you're seeing on national polls.</p><p>And then, you know, again I can account for District 3 which is six  counties in north central Florida.  But we talk to people all over the  state.  This economy that we have, we've not seen this before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>YOHO:  And then you take, you know, the tax cuts that we did with President  Trump and rolled back regulations, that fits hand in hand.  Andrew Gillum  wants to go the other way -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>YOHO:  -- and Bill Nelson want to go the other way.  The people of Florida  are not ready for that.  </p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so you're just -- you're not believing -- you're not  believing these polls.  You say your polls say something different.  </p><p>How important is the China story for Floridians?  I mean the U.S.-China  trade issue?  The President yesterday sounded optimistic because he had a  phone call with the Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>But I spoke with the former CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer yesterday,  along with the chairman of IAC Barry Diller, and they were both incredibly  concerned about China's business practices.  Listen to this.  I've got to  get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  90 percent of companies are using the Microsoft operating  platform and only 1 percent are paying for it.  How do we -- what are we  going to do that China keeps stealing everything this way?  I mean that's  pretty extraordinary.  </p><p>STEVE BALLMER, FORMER CEO, MICROSOFT:  I'm a free trader by nature.  I went  to school, economics -- it's the best thing for the world.  This one's a  tricky issue because it's absolutely clear that the rules don't apply in  China and the U.S. government needs to do something -- whether tariffs are  right or wrong, I'm silent on that point.</p><p>But without any pressure from the U.S. government, we're talking about $10  billion plus for example in Microsoft that would go into profit.  </p><p>DILLER:  Their trade practices have to change.  And us being tough-minded  about it, I think it's sensible.  I think us being outrageous and excessive  about it is dangerous.  I don't think the trade war is -- if you let an  unfettered trade war actually take place, which is in our control, it will  be disastrous for everybody.  So they will have to mature their practices.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman-- your reaction?  Is this an issue for Floridians?  </p><p>YOHO:  It's an issue all over the nation.  But what President Trump is  doing is something that had to be done.  Unchecked it would get worse.  And  so I'm glad he's doing what he's doing and I stand behind him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- it's good to have you on the program.  We'll be  watching the developments on Tuesday.  It's nice (ph) to see you -- thank  you.</p><p>YOHO:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ted Yoho.</p><p>We also invited Congressman Yoho's opponent.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching earnings.  We get two more Dow components coming this  morning.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with all the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  A lot of market moving  news before the market even opens -- Maria.</p><p>ExxonMobil expected to post double digit gains in earnings and revenue from  a year ago with the average price for oil up 34 percent for the third  quarter in general.</p><p>We're also going to get results from Chevron today.  Analysts looking for  the company's profits to double with revenue up nearly 30 percent.  That's  the oil story.</p><p>Alibaba out with its latest results just a few minutes ago.  Revenue rising  54 percent from a year ago to $12.4 billion.  Shares are substantially  higher in the premarket, up almost 6 percent right now.  All right.  That  stock though is off the highs from previous revenue guidance.</p><p>And also, we're looking at Apple, real quick here.  The stock is trading  sharply lower, down almost 6 percent in the premarket.  Earnings, as we've  been talking about today topped the street's estimates in the latest  quarter but Apple also issued disappointing guidance for the current  quarter which includes, of course, the holiday season and we've been  talking about the unit sales issue.  This raises questions about weaker  than expected demand for their more expensive new iPhones which we're not  going to be getting numbers on anymore.</p><p>All right.  There is this -- a group of Tesla shareholders wants to put  tighter reins on CEO Elon Musk.  Three Tesla investors sent the board a  letter saying the company should permanently separate the positions of  chairman and chief executive, both of which Musk holds.  That would go  beyond Tesla's settlement with the SEC that required Musk to step down as  chairman for just three years.</p><p>The directors are also calling for more turnover on the company's board,  recommending a time line be set for some directors to leave.  There is  Tesla in the premarket, up almost three-quarters of a percent.</p><p>And then there is this -- bottomless beer no more.  Co-working space Wework  is now setting a limit for what used to be bottomless kegs of beer for its  tenants.  The New York tenants are now going to be limited to just four  beers per day-- each person per day.  Wework says that the change was  determined by software to help manage the beer supply.</p><p>So it's a software issue, not the fact that people were getting drunk at  Wework while they were working there.  Ok.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't even understand that.  They were drinking more than  four beers a day during the day?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Bottomless beer, bottomless mimosas -- you know what  happens.  This is what the story is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's in your cup?  </p><p>KELLY:  Oh yes.  This is definitely not gin.  It's for sure water.</p><p>But I just wanted real quickly on the Alibaba side -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Thanks -- Cheryl.</p><p>KELLY:  I accidentally said that they beat on the top line, miss on the  bottom.  It was the inverse.  Alibaba missed on the top line, beat  significantly on the bottom line.  But the main takeaway is that they  actually guided their revenue forecast down 4 percent to 6 percent going  forward.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Look at this.  Stock is still up -- Kevin.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's up almost 6 percent even though it's a revenue miss.   Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, a scare on the high seas to tell you about -- details on the  terrifying moments that caused a cruise ship to tilt.  That's coming up.</p><p>Then countdown to the midterms is on, we break down why the number one  issue for voters apparently according to the polls is health care.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are only four days away from the midterm elections.  In a recent Fox  News poll, health care is the number one issue driving Americans to the  voting booth.  Joining us right now is Dr. Joseph Galati.  He is the author  of \"Eating Yourself Sick\".</p><p>Why do you think health care has become a top priority in our country is  the number one issue here?  Dr. Galati -- good to see you.  Thanks for  being here.  </p><p>DR. JOSEPH GALATI, AUTHOR, \"EATING YOURSELF SICK\":  Well -- thank you,  Maria.</p><p>You know, health care is always a hot button topic.  Our patients -- the  ones that I'm dealing with in Texas come to me with all sorts of insurance  problems.  They're worried about pre-existing.  They're worried about  insurance companies not covering certain procedures or disorders that they  have.</p><p>And so a day doesn't go by that patients are not sitting in my office,  talking and complaining about their health care.  How it's going to be  solved, I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GALATI:  It's really a big, behemoth problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So James -- lay out the issue for us in terms of pre-existing  conditions.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So the idea is you don't want to let people buy insurance  on their way to the hospital.  This would be the argument to say let's have  an insurance market.  If you are sick already, you don't need insurance.   You need health care.</p><p>So you need a system that allows people to get the care they need but if  you're going to have an insurance market, they have to be able to sell to  healthy people, not just sick people and so that's the theory.  Now, the  President has said he doesn't want to change anything with pre-existing  conditions.  That wasn't changed obviously.  The Republicans never rewrote  Obamacare.</p><p>So it's kind of a phony issue in that way.  But to me, I don't know if  you're hearing from patients, this issue of the Medicare-for-all plan,  which ends Medicare and ends private insurance, in other words, it ends all  pre-existing coverage, every person in the United States this is the plan  that most Democrats in the House have endorsed -- Bernie Sanders, a lot of  the Senate candidates.  It ends all coverage in the U.S. and creates a new  government plan.  What does that mean for patients?  </p><p>GALATI:  You know, when you read about this Medicare for all, it's very  thin on details.  It's very thin on whether administrative costs are going  to go down, whether it's going to provide better health care.  That is  really unclear.</p><p>And unfortunately, whenever people hear something for all, people jump on  the bandwagon and say this is good for America.  When really if we're  voting on it or talking about it, the details are thin and you know, what  really are we dealing with?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But we do know from the legislation whether it's the Bernie  Sanders plan or the one that most House Democrats have co-sponsored, it  explicitly says private insurance goes away.  Medicare goes away.</p><p>So this is the end of pre-existing coverage.  Not just particular  conditions.  Your whole health plan is changing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People do not understand this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know why this isn't an issue in this election.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And you're all about wellness and prevention, I mean  getting ahead of disease.  </p><p>GALATI:  It is.  And the sad part is, in my area of liver disease that I  take care of, we see patients, we counsel them on staying well.  Because  taking care of somebody at the end is not the way to take care of yourself.</p><p>And so in the book, \"Eating Yourself Sick\", 30 years of interviewing  thousands of patients, I see that.  I had a conversation with a patient  five years ago, six years ago, and they just continued to decline.  And the  common thread in so many of these diseases -- fatty liver disease,  cirrhosis, diabetes, heart disease, cancer -- it's what we're eating.</p><p>It sounds real simple but what Americans are eating -- the processed foods  -- is crazy.  We have lost our way on eating at home, cooking at home with  your children.  And what I propose, as simple as it is, is to get back to  the basics.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  It's prevention all the way.  Get ahead of  disease.  That will eliminate all the costs that we're faced with in the  terms of cure and care rather than prevention.</p><p>GALATI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. Galati -- we could talk about this all day.  </p><p>GALATI:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is probably our favorite subject, actually.  </p><p>GALATI:  It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us.  </p><p>GALATI:  Absolutely.  It's been a pleasure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  Joseph Galati there.</p><p>Coming up -- the streaming wars are heating up, technology giants Amazon  and (AUDIO GAP) Netflix.</p><p>Stay with us for part two of my exclusive interview with the chairman and  senior exec of both IAC and Expedia Group.  Barry Diller weighs in on big  tech.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>730</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

In April 2017, Apple received a permit to test self-driving vehicles in California. </p><p>Apple's Project Titan project has attracted talent like Doug Field, who previously developed vehicles at Tesla, Ford and Segway, and Julian Honig, who designed cars at Audi.</p><p>But how significant an impact the changes will have on Apple's ambitions remain unclear. The company has kept a low profile, saying little about its ambitions for autonomous systems. Previous reports have pointed to Apple trimming staff and scaling back efforts to develop an autonomous vehicle.</p><p>Apple had approximately 132,000 employees as of Sept. 29, 2018, according to a company filing.</p><p>Earlier this month, Apple warned that its sales would suffer due to lower than anticipated iPhone sales in China.</p><p>As its smartphone business faces questions, autonomous vehicles don't appear to offer a quick solution to Apple's woes. The technology isn't emerging as fast as many suggested. </p><p>Waymo, the self-driving arm of Google's parent company, has launched a limited public service in Chandler, Arizona, following a decade of research. GM, which said it would test autonomous vehicles in New York City in early 2018, has yet to do so. </p><p>A long road of resolving technical, regulatory and social challenges associated with unleashing fully autonomous on roads appears to remain ahead.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

If not repaid, then tech debt, like the monetary kind, can incur \u201cinterest\u201d, making change even more expensive to implement later.</p><p>Cultural debt may be a similar phenomenon in many businesses, particularly in the tech sector. The fast-moving, risk-taking, win-at-all costs corporate culture that enabled a start-up like Uber to succeed is too buggy for a global public company and has to be updated.</p><p>One intriguing question is whether Apple will have to repay its cultural debt as it squares up for a fist-fight with regulators. Will the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54170f10-82e9-11e9-b592-5fe435b57a3b\"> monomaniacal culture</url> that allowed it to become one of the most successful and profitable businesses in history need to be reimagined?</p><p>Last month, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c847838-ca25-43cf-a962-0d3588d8d34d\"> EU launched two antitrust cases</url> against Apple. The first concerns the operations of Apple\u2019s App Store following complaints from Spotify, the music-streaming service, and Kobo, the ebook business. Each has attacked the company for demanding an initial 30 per cent cut of the subscription fee from all customers who sign up via the App Store, while promoting its own rival music and books services.</p><p>Margrethe Vestager, EU vice-president in charge of competition policy, said Apple appeared to be acting as a discriminatory \u201cgatekeeper\u201d controlling the distribution of apps while keeping most of the data derived from them. \u201cWe need to ensure that Apple\u2019s rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1073\"> she said</url>.</p><p>The second investigation focuses on whether Apple unfairly denies Apple Pay\u2019s \u201ctap and go\u201d functionality on iPhones to rival payments companies.</p><p>Both cases are likely to be argued for many years by teams of high-powered lawyers. Apple\u2019s response to the probes has been predictably furious. The company argues that it invented and built the App Store that now reaches <url normalizedValue=\"https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/28/apple-hits-1-5-billion-active-devices-with-80-of-recent-iphones-and-ipads-running-ios-13/\"> 1.5bn device users</url>. If developers do not like its rules then they do not have to play. Millions of developers, who have made a lot of money from the App Store, are happy with the way it operates and comforted by the security it offers. Besides, Apple charges no fees on the 85 per cent of apps that are free to users.</p><p>This reflects the uncompromising attitude of the company\u2019s founder, Steve Jobs, who acknowledged that the introduction of the 30 per cent charge in 2011 might result in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/733ae8d4-e516-4418-9998-30414c368c6f\"> some \u201croadkill\u201d among developers</url>. Apple has denounced the latest complainants as \u201c <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/733ae8d4-e516-4418-9998-30414c368c6f\"> free-riders</url>\u201d and signalled its determination to fight.\u00a0</p><p>It will be fascinating to see whether Apple maintains its aggressive stance as the regulatory pressure increases. The EU\u2019s scrutiny seems to have emboldened other developers. Base camp, which runs the Hey premium email service, has even accused Apple of running a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020\"> mafia-style protection racket</url>.</p><p>Such complaints are increasingly attracting the attention of US legislators, who have summoned the bosses of the big tech companies to Washington <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ceos-amazon-apple-google-facebook-agree-appear-house-antitrust-hearing-n1232717\"> later this month</url>.\u00a0</p><p>David Cicilline, the Democratic congressman who chairs the antitrust subcommittee of the House judiciary committee, has described Apple\u2019s bullying of developers into paying the 30 per cent fee as \u201chighway robbery\u201d. He has threatened to legislate to curb Apple\u2019s monopoly powers. \u201cIt\u2019s contrary to our laws. It\u2019s unfair to new developers, new start-ups, and it hurts consumers,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020\"> he said.</url></p><p>Apple has an interesting choice to make. It can simply tough out this regulatory scrutiny while it continues to generate an estimated $1bn of revenue a month from the App Store. It can count on the EU taking years to reach a ruling while the US Congress may never legislate. For some big tech companies, fines have become no more than the cost of doing business.</p><p>Yet Apple may also see virtue in defanging the most critical of its 23m developers by modifying the way the App Store operates to benefit all parties. The history of Microsoft in the 1990s is instructive. While Bill Gates was running the company, Microsoft was contemptuous of complainants and regulators, and ended up entangled in distracting legal fights for 16 years before finally rebooting its own culture. Led by the more consensual Satya Nadella, it has vaulted back to rival Apple as the top US companies by market capitalisation.</p><p>It is pretty certain that Jobs would have adopted Mr Gates\u2019s combative approach. But that does not make it right for Apple today. It may make more sense, and may ultimately make Apple more money, for it to repay its cultural debt and negotiate more flexible terms with disgruntled developers.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-93d83faa26dd4b05843f6a65d5cb4f82</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6096-G9W1-DXP9-923H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 6, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

You can see them  and in fact, the big cube here which this store is famous for, which lead  you to an underground entrance way, the store is normally a 24-7 operation.   They closed it overnight.  It will not open until 8 a.m. local time.  And  of course, that is the roll out plan across nine different nations here.  </p><p>This is the widest rollout that Apple has had yet for one of their  iPhones.  Now, a key numbers to hit here.  We've seen every iPhone new  version has outsold a combined total of all the previous versions.  This of  course is a law of large numbers.  It is going to be tough to duplicate.   We'll have to wait and see.  Most reviewers out there saying this phone a  little bit more evolutionary than revolutionary.  </p><p>And of course, there's been a lot of feedback and flak, if you will,  about the new connectors out there.  They are of course shrinking the  connectors down to nine pins from 30.  So, all the products that you have  around the house, connectors et cetera, you'll going to have to go out and  buy some more of those.  So, Apple is expected to make a big hole out of  this as well as of course some of their third party partners out there.   You're going to talk a little bit all morning long.  </p><p>Of course, we're expecting a faster processor on board, you got the  new ear pods, the camera higher resolution, reportedly better.  As the  phone even now of course, some reviewers out there and analysts that I've  spoken with Diane, saying that as far as the camera goes and processing  speed, they're just now catching up to some of the rivals out there.  But  of course, as you can see, still plenty of Apple fans out here braving the  early morning, though we must say pretty mild here in New York City.  Back  to you.  </p><p>MACEDO:  All right.  That's Robert Gray live at the Apple store.   Thanks, Robert.</p><p>GRAY:  You're welcome.</p><p>MACEDO:  Meanwhile, E.U. anti-trust regulators have cleared universal  music group to buy British record company EMI as recorded music unit for  $1.9 billion after the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's  most valuable record labels.  Universal says, the assets to be sold amounts  to 30 percent of EMI's global sales.  Citigroup is selling EMI having  acquired the music group when buy-out firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans  owed to the investment bank.  </p><p>Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., futures have been in the  green across the board all morning.  Dow futures are up by about 40 points.   The S&amp;P is up by almost four.  The NASDAQ is up by seven.  </p><p>In Europe, the Financial Times reports European Union authorities are  working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and  unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.  Markets are currently  mixed.  London was green earlier, now we're seeing it in the red down by  almost nine points.  Paris and Frankfurt still in the green.  </p><p>Let's take a closer look at what's moving those markets with Josh  Raymond now, chief market strategist at City Index in London.  Now, Josh,  the FT is reporting that Spain is moving closer to a bailout.  Should  investors read that as a negative or should they find some release in  having some more certainty on that front? </p><p>JOSH RAYMOND, CITY INDEX CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  I think it is a  positive.  And it does provide some certainty.  You know, the markets --  investors have been fairly convinced that more is required.  There has been  political maneuvering going on with Spain saying that they've got austerity  measures in there.  They don't require the fully -- bailout.  But we  already know that they're actually in talks, so we have that -- a few  people of the Spanish government actually recently earlier on this week  say, it will provide a level of certainty.  And I think that would be  reacted positively by the market.  Of course, it depends on the scale which  the (INAUDIBLE) will require, I mean, the ECB through monetary transactions  have an unlimited scope to do so as well.  </p><p>MACEDO:  And Josh, Mario Monti is holding meetings in Italy with  several leaders today.  What do you expect to come out of them? </p><p>RAYMOND:  Not much unfortunately.  And we're getting used to all these  meetings taking place and strong rhetoric talking about a fiscal union,  stronger banking regulations, that sort of thing but nothing really comes  of it.  And I think investors are a little bit more wiser to that these  days.  Now, we already have the ECB.  And the main focus for us at the  moment really is the ECB and Spain.  Now, we've obviously got the -- from  the ECB and we're waiting for Spain to confirm or to agree that the terms  towards that fully first bailout.  Those are the key things that we're  looking at.  </p><p>MACEDO:  OK.  More brain storming for the many results.  We'll see if  it comes out that way.  Thanks, Josh.  That's Josh Raymond from London.</p><p>K.B. Home meanwhile is reporting a surprise profit this morning.  The  home builder says it made four cents a share in its third quarter.  The  company was expected to lose 16 cents a share but revenue came in light at  $424.5 million.  The estimate was for 430 million.  K.B. Home says, it's  order backlog at the end of August rose 18 percent from a year ago to more  than 3,100 and home deliveries rose seven percent to more than 1,700.  </p><p>Here's a quick look at commodities.  Oil and gold are both to the  upside.  </p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business.  </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Well, it's going to be a great show.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Great show.  Great day in New York today.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yep.</p><p>IMUS:  Last day of summer.  Going to be 73 degrees.  Let's do some  sunbathing, baby.  </p><p>So, anyway, coming up this morning, Juan Williams, FOX News, and the  great Vince Gill.  Now, Vince -- when I say great, I mean great.  He's not  going to sing.  He's coming in to talk.  Now, why would you book somebody  like Vince Gill just to talk?  Because he's worth talking to.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's it.</p><p>IMUS:  There's a few of these guys, people who I would talk to.  It  would be him -- who are worth talking to.  Dwight Yoakam.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  Smart guy, Yoakam.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Uh-huh!</p><p>IMUS:  Crazy but good crazy.  Delbert, smart guy, funny.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Of course.</p><p>IMUS:  Kinky.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, not many more, right? </p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER:  Billy Ray? </p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM PRODUCER:  He's one of the nicest guys too, Dwight  Yoakam.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Oh, yes.</p><p>IMUS:  He is, isn't he?  </p><p>RUFINO:  Yes, he's really nice guy.  </p><p>IMUS:  You know the day I got fired, he called me on my cell phone.   I was on my way to meet the team.  And I was in the car.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  </p><p>IMUS:  He's a good man.  He understood what the deal was.  And so,  you know.  You can't say stuff like that, man.  Don't pick on people.  Just  don't do it, whether you're trying to be funny or not.  Come on.  </p><p>Anyway, and so, and then the big dog's here, Bill Clinton.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, good.</p><p>IMUS:  He's concerned about this book that Monica Lewinsky is going  to do.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I like that.</p><p>IMUS:  About them sex positions.  And then, Warner? </p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  You and Gunz.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, sir.</p><p>IMUS:  You skunks.  And Steve Mariucci, the pregame show on the NFL  Network, there are two reasons to watch that.  Other than that.</p><p>RUFINO:  Yes, good bye.</p><p>IMUS:  They suck, Rich Eisen, sucks.  Steve Mariucci, sucks.  Deion  Sanders, moron, Michael Irving moron, and that other guy, moron.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Moron.</p><p>IMUS:  Every one of them picked the Carolina Panthers.  What  happened?  The New York Giants put a butt whipping on them.  </p><p>WOLF:  Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS:  Thirty six-seven.  Come on.  </p><p>RUFINO:  Pussy riot, come on!</p><p>IMUS:  Start the pussy riot.  </p><p>WOLF:  That's right.  Come on.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, man!  Eli got the ball, what did he do?  He marched down  the field and scored a touchdown.  Every time he got the ball.  Come on!</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  And the reserves, man, those guys, the regulars better  look over their shoulders.  Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, you and the ice cream cone on the forehead, Gunzelman --</p><p>RUFINO:  Oh, wow!</p><p>WOLF:  Oh, God!</p><p>IMUS: -- should have anticipated this.  </p><p>(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p>I mean, this was an outrage.  </p><p>WOLF:  That's right.  </p><p>RUFINO:  Enjoy that ice cream.</p><p>IMUS:  I will never listen to -- and you're right, Warner, about  these pregame shows.  These people don't know anything.  </p><p>WOLF:  No, waste of time.  </p><p>IMUS:  That's total waste of time.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p>RUFINO:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Honeymoon is over.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Welcome.</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  We're going to do the news now.  Bernard.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yo, chief.  </p><p>IMUS:  Or Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Any of you.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Anybody.  </p><p>IMUS:  The Libyan attack on the embassy.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  </p><p>IMUS:  The administration initially, the President and the Secretary  of State characterized this as a direct result of this YouTube movie,  right? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Susan Rice all over the Sunday shows, she did a tour.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  U.N. ambassador.  Yep.</p><p>IMUS:  Now, is there any evidence -- and how are they describing it  now, the administration? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  That there is evidence that the guy who was released from  Guantanamo Bay in 2007 was behind -- an al-Qaeda guy was behind the attack  on the embassy in Libya.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  So, is the President willing to use the word terrorist and  describe this as a terrorist attack? </p><p>MCSHANE:  Not personally.  Jay Carney used that word yesterday but the  President did not when he was asked about it in the forum in Florida.  </p><p>IMUS:  Has he ever used the word terrorist? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Good question.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  Now, so my question is this then, did they have evidence  that -- did they know better that it was the result of the movie?  Or of  course, not so coincidently falling on September 11th.  Did they not know  that or did they lie about it or did they just assume -- you would think  with our intelligence apparatus they would know better.  But then, we've  had other bunch of other screw ups.  So what happened here?  In other  words, did they lie?  Did they know?  Did they not have the information?   What? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  They jumped to conclusions.  If they didn't know, they  should have said they didn't know instead of proclaiming definitively that  it was a direct result of the movie.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  They should not have proclaimed that.  They should have  said let's wait and see.  They didn't.  Again, and they still harp on the  movie as though -- and they're conflating two things.  The movie, the  terrorists used the movie perhaps as a cover to get the morons to come out  and cause a riot so that they could use that as cover to go in.  But in  either case, they were misleading, was the administration.  They obviously  don't want it to look like -- they want to say GM is alive and bin Laden is  dead, and that's it.  They can't say that anymore.  And that's why they're,  you know.  </p><p>IMUS:  I know you can't see it, but do you like my new hat? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, that's bad.  That's a bad as Johnny Cash.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Look out now.  </p><p>IMUS:  Do you know who did this?  Stuart Dunlap, Men's hat shop,  Albuquerque.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Nobody but him.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Did he?</p><p>IMUS:  He did in San Antonio.</p><p>WOLF:  That's the Rango Kidd  hat.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, man, that guy is -- come on.  All right.  Let's do the  news.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.</p><p>IMUS:  You're a disgrace, Warner.  Don't you be yucking it up over  there.  This is unbelievable.  The country singer Josh Turner is  downstairs.  That boy is pretty good.  He's on FOX and Fiends.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  I guess people, there's an 80-plus demographic by records,  right?  Here's Connell with the news.  Good morning, Connell.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Good morning, I-man.  Protesters are actually in the streets  today in Pakistan.  They won't be able to use their cell phones.  Though,  the government there is blocking cell service, major cities, so the phones  can't be used to detonate bombs.  It's a national day of protest against  that movie we were talking about, the anti-Muslim film produced here in the  United States.  The surge in Afghanistan meantime is over according to the  Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta who says in his view it worked.  </p><p>The 33,000 additional troops sent to Afghanistan a couple of years  ago now pulled out of the country.  The latest Gallup daily tracking poll  has the race for the White House a dead heat.  Forty seven percent a piece.</p><p>IMUS:  I'll be darned.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Mitt Romney and President Obama.  But Romney is still  hurting in some of these key swing states.  \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC  numbers, Obama is up eight points in Ohio.  Leading by five both in  Wisconsin and Colorado.  </p><p>IMUS:  You know, we are at a state in this country where this is the  best we can do?  A suit dummy and the president? </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's the choice you have.  </p><p>IMUS:  I mean, I know a bunch of smart guys.  So, do you?  I mean, we  all do.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  You mean like business leaders and that type of  thing and --   </p><p>IMUS:  Really smart people.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  Can't get them to run.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, I was going to say, it's hard to get people to run.   Absolutely.  </p><p>IMUS:  I don't know.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Be vetted and everything else.  </p><p>IMUS:  Twelve minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  Juan Williams, Vince Gill.  Neil Cavuto.  That's a pretty good  lineup.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, it is.  Connell continues.</p><p>IMUS:  We got some comments from Ann Romney here in a second but  first, the campaign has turned to comments not by either Romney but by the  President saying yesterday, \"Washington cannot be changed from the inside.\"   Big things, he says, get done when people pressure politicians from the  outside.  So, Romney was all over that saying that Obama's thrown in the  white flag of surrender on the economy.  Now, here's Ann Romney.  She was  on a radio show in Iowa asking Republicans to stop attacking her husband.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY:  What do you say to your fellow  Republicans?  Sure.  Stop it.  This is hard.  You want to try it, get in  the ring.  This is hard.  It's an important thing that we're doing right  now, and it's an important election.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  Today, the President -- </p><p>IMUS:  Her husband is a moron.  He'll do better than this guy.  Having  said all that -- I mean, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.  Those  of you who know me know I probably don't.  But I'm going to vote for him.   And I'm going to tell you that the day he gets elected, the economy is  better.  He doesn't have to do anything.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  You just think confidence is going to improve? </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's one of the argument he made in that video that came  out.  Romney will be in Nevada today.  Obama campaigning in Virginia.  Some  American airliners frequent fliers worried after hearing about the  company's intentions to lay off thousands of workers and then reduce  flights.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN:  I'm pretty loyal to them.  Because I do travel  and get my miles with them.  I have really not had too many problems.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Had a number of flights, so they've been canceled this  week, American announcing more than 1,000 employees could lose their jobs.   They're going through bankruptcy reorganization.  </p><p>And Fast and Furious, lawmakers analyzing this new report that's come  in on the botch, ATF gun walking operation, it's a report from the  inspector general from the Justice Department.  They found the Attorney  General Eric Holder was not aware of the operation until it came out in the  media and other places.  Here's California republican Congressman Darrell  Issa says the report the raises an important question.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA:  There is clearly a question not  of did he know, because he said he didn't know.  The question is why in the  world did key lieutenants keep it from him and of course why is that  something that we should -- </p><p>(SCREAMING SHUT UP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>IMUS:  Sounds like a car alarm going off.  Did the guy invented those  Bernie or Connell?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Please step away from the  car.  That's his --</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  Please step away from the car.  Please step away from  your mouth.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh my God!</p><p>IMUS:  Sick of hearing about this.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  Enough is enough.</p><p>IMUS:  Come on.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well --  </p><p>IMUS:  Let's just get the problems of this country solved.  Bernard  McGuirk is going to be a guest on O'Reilly tonight at 8 p.m. on the FOX  News Channel.  Bernard McGuirk and Greg Gutfeld in a segment called what  the hell just happened or something.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Something like that.</p><p>IMUS:  And it's good and they're good.  A quarter after the hour.   Let's do some business news.  Here with that is Dagen McDowell.  Good  morning, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, sir.  Yesterday, the Dow was up a paltry  almost 19 points and the futures are higher this morning.  And OK, all  these ding-a-lings are lined up for the new iPhone 5.  It goes on sale this  morning at 8 a.m. Local Time in stores in nine countries.  I'm sure it's  going to have record sales.  But here's what we care about even more than  that, that Apple has fallen flat on its face with this new mapping software  that it released.  It's on this new phone.  It's also in the new software,  the IOS-6.  It replaced Google maps, kicked Google maps off the phone, and  it's a disaster.  It sucks.  That's how bad it is.  Basically like  businesses wind up in the middle of rivers.  </p><p>IMUS:  So, I told Dagen I used map quest.  She said, that's so 90's.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Map quest.  </p><p>IMUS:  I said, well, the place I'm going hasn't moved.  They'll tell  you how to get there.  What the hell do I care? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You could do so much better than that.  That's the issue.   You could do so much better than that.  It's like saying I've got like a  Xerox typewriter, like, you know, IBM Selectric or something like that  before I curse.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Like what?  What's better? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  No, all this.</p><p>IMUS:  What's the matter?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Google maps is better.  Google maps is far and above  better than map quest, and particularly this new Apple.  </p><p>IMUS:  Old weird Dave Patterson from Texas, he just updated my iPhone  iOS 6 last night.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you lost your Google maps and if you want to look  for the Hoover dam on the 3D imaging, on this Apple mapping software, it  looks like a -- roller coaster.  That's how lousy it is.  </p><p>IMUS:  I know where the Hoover dam is.  Right outside of Las Vegas.   Let's go look at it.  Come on, dude.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can't do it on that Apple mapping -- </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, come on.  Get a life.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Don't we love when some giant, the biggest company in the  world screws up? </p><p>IMUS:  First of all, all you ever care about is a bunch of red-neck  goobers driving around in a circle and who knows where they're going to  race this weekend, the NASCAR dopes.  Where is the race? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, in New Hampshire actually.  </p><p>IMUS:  That's pretty good track, so.  So, they don't need a map.  I  tell you what they do need.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's right.</p><p>IMUS:  They need a clue.  All right.  Eighteen after the hour here on  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Have you done sports yet, Warner? </p><p>WOLF:  No.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  Don't wear me out but here's Warner with sports.  Go  ahead.  </p><p>WOLF:  All right, I-man.  Thursday night football in Charlotte, now  the Giants even with four offensive injuries beat the Panthers 36 to seven.   Just like Gunzelman and myself called it.  Backup running back Andre Brown  playing for the injured Ahmad Bradshaw, 113 yards and 20 carries and two  touchdowns.  </p><p>And then reserved wide receiver Ramses Barden playing in place of a  Hakeem Nicks caught nine passes for 138 yards.  Eli 27 for 35, 288 yards, a  touchdown, no interceptions.  And Lawrence Tynes kicked five field goals.  </p><p>IMUS:  Wow!</p><p>WOLF:  Now, here was Cam Newton who, by the way, I don't know if you  saw this, after he scored a touchdown to make it cut it to 23 to seven, he  went into his superman celebration.  Pretty good timing for that.  So, here  was Newton only 16 for 30 intercepted three times and ran the ball six  times for only six yards.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAM NEWTON, CAROLINA PANTHERS:  Who wants to support something that  puts on a performance of embarrassment.  That's what that was tonight.  If  I was a fan of the Carolina Panthers, I would be holding my head down and  ashamed of the product that was out there today.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  He was awful.  </p><p>IMUS:  Stop your stupid end zone celebrations, OK?  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  How about that?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  What a dope.  </p><p>RUFINO:  You have been killed.</p><p>IMUS:  You have been murdered.</p><p>RUFINO:  Why do that? </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, man!</p><p>WOLF:  Yankees beat the Jays 10-seven, sweep the series.  Ichiro by  the way, a homerun and a double, he's not nine for his last 12.  </p><p>IMUS:  That guy is crazy.  </p><p>WOLF:  Oh, man!</p><p>IMUS:  On fire?</p><p>WOLF:  On fire.  So, Yankees lead the Orioles by one with 13 to play.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.</p><p>WOLF:  And this is embarrassing, I-man.  </p><p>IMUS:  What?</p><p>WOLF:  At City Field, the Phillies scored eight in the first, seven  in the ninth and beat the Mets 16 to one.  Here was Met Manager Terry  Collins was asked after the game -- </p><p>RUFINO:  There was nobody there.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  That's right.</p><p>WOLF:  They were addressing these empty seats.  Here was Mets manager  Terry Collins asked after the game if he was embarrassed.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TERRY COLLINS, METS MANAGER:  I am.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  Does his team quit?  </p><p>COLLINS:  You'll have to ask them.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  What do you think?</p><p>COLLINS:  You'll have to ask them.  I have my own opinion.  I'm not  going to express it publicly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF:  That's horrible.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, man.  They got to get rid of him.  All right.  Twenty  minutes after the hour.  Do you have anything else, Warner? </p><p>WOLF:  Well, real quick.  Tiger Woods and Justin Rose share the lead  of that FedEx cup playoff.  Roy McElroy is three back.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Coming up on 21 after the hour here on the IMUS IN  THE MORNING program.  Juan Williams, Vince Gill, Neil Cavuto, Bill Clinton,  and Tony Robbins are all coming up.  Bernie's got a briefing too.  What's  there, B? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  That's a more fiery Obama versus Romney.  Jimmy Fallon bust  on the President.  And Tim Tebow tells the world what kind of woman he  wants.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right, baby.  What kind of woman do you want?  So, Dwight  Yoakam's new album is called \"Three Pears.\"  There's not a bad cut on it.   It's the number-two country album on I-tunes.  Dwight Yoakam, number two,  come on here.  It's a great record.  Here's one of the better songs on it.   </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS:  Well, Lindamood-Bell teaches children and adults to read words  and comprehend language.

You ought to take  some aspirin.  I mean, you do that, by the way.  </p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN:  What should the answer be? </p><p>IMUS:  Nothing.  It's just venting.  It doesn't require an answer,  doesn't require a suggestion.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  It doesn't require a comment.  Shut up.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Here's the problem.  </p><p>IMUS:  What? </p><p>MCSHANE:  If we don't say anything, any of us, what happens, Tony? </p><p>TONY POWELL, COMEDIAN:  Don't you bastards care I'm starving? </p><p>IMUS:  No, that's not true.    </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Twenty nine after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.

And Tuf Cooper, he's a current world champion, he's at 98,000.   The great Cody O.  Now that Joe doesn't rope anymore, he's my favorite  roper.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  Wyatt too.  He's third at 96,000.  And Hunter Herrin, Cory  Solomon, Shane Hanchey, Clint Robinson, Houston Hutko , the great Fred  Whitfield, African-American -- one of the great ropers ever, eight-time  world champion.  And on and on.  Blare Burke, 15th place.  So, that's where  we are.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  </p><p>IMUS:  If we were going to go to -- Vegas and have it today, those  are the 15 guys who would be roping.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  Time for a Bernie briefing at 29 after the hour.  And here  with that is Bernard McGuirk, good morning, B.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Good morning, chief.  And President Obama sat down with this  Univision people yesterday, the Spanish language TV station, and if he  thought he was going to get questions like what's your favorite salsa  music, or do you like J-Lo or stuff like that, he was in for a big  surprise.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh-oh.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  The dude hit him hard, this Jorge Ramos.  He was like the  Spanish inquisition.</p><p>IMUS:  He's a good reporter.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Very good reporter.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes, he is.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, it was like the Spanish inquisition.  For a little  while, anyway, he asked him about changing things in government.  And he  gave a bad answer.  And then Mitt Romney jumped on it, as Connell alluded  to earlier.  Here's Obama first and then Mitt Romney right afterwards.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES:  I've learned some lessons  over the last four years.  And the most important lesson I've learned is  that you can't change Washington from the inside.  You can only change it  from the outside.  That's how I got elected.  And that's how the big  accomplishments like health care got done.  </p><p>FMR. GOV. MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The President  today threw in the white flag of surrender again.  He said he can't change  Washington from inside.  He can only change it from outside.  Well, we're  going to give him that chance in November.  He's going outside.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  About as animated and funny as Mitt Romney will get, but it  wasn't that bad.  And the New York Giants, of course on a tear.  Right,  boss?  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Who cares?  Tim Tebow, he's on the cover of \"Vogue\"  magazine, he's on the cover of \"The New York Post\" this morning.</p><p>IMUS:  Sure.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Putting his physique on display there.  And I'm sure that's  going to rile up all the Giants this morning.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  But of course, he's a devout Christian and he tells -- </p><p>IMUS:  Praise God.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, exactly right.  He tells \"Vogue\" magazine what he looks  for in a woman.  And here's his quote.  I've been blessed to have an  amazing mom and two amazing sisters, so they set a very high standard.   I'll stop right there.  What I think of -- when I think of a woman, I don't  think of my mom and -- God bless them.  God rest them, I should say.  But  anyway, he goes on and that's what makes him a good guy apparently,  obviously.  </p><p>Obviously looks play a big part.  Looks play a big part.  Being  attracted to someone plays a big part but there is also much more than  that.  To me, it is about finding someone who is sweet and kind and that  has a servant's heart.  It's about finding a girl who likes me for me.  And  not because of what I do or who I am or the name.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, tasty rat covering that servant's heart.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yep.  He did add that she's got to have a booty that's high  and tight.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>If it ain't tight, it ain't right.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Bu so, you know, the boy's got some feeling.  </p><p>IMUS:  There has got to be -- </p><p>RUFINO:  Can see him saying that.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, somebody else to talk about.  </p><p>RUFINO:  He's got to have a booty.  </p><p>IMUS:  He seems like a nice guy.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  People can't get enough of -- the front page of \"The New  York Post.\"</p><p>IMUS:  OK.  I like him -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Don't be a hater now, chief.  </p><p>IMUS:  I'm not a hater at all, quite the contrary.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  All right.  Well, I can conclude on that because Juan  Williams is in the bull pen.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  Don't you have something else? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  I do.  Jimmy Fallon, take a listen to him busting on the  President I think from last night.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY FALLON, HOST, \"LATE NIGHT\":  Here's an election news, during a  fund-raiser with Jay-Z last night, President Obama said that he and the  rapper have a lot in common because their wives are more popular than they  are.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Well, Jay-Z said, they have a lot in common because neither one of  them have a plan to fix the economy.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Jimmy Fallon, that's funny, right?  He'll be here in about an  hour.  He's not going to sing.  He's going to talk with us.  </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  If you're on PC, you're in the wrong place.

Now that Apple's iPhone 5 is available, we're  finding out what exactly makes the smart phone work.  The repair firm I-fix  got its hands on one and pried it open to find the device uses chips from  Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solutions.  The iPhone also  includes an audio chip made by Cirrus, Logic and its Gyroscope which is  used to track its orientation was made by STmicroelectronics.  So, keep an  eye on stocks of those companies and those who didn't make the iPhone 5 to  see their reaction today.  </p><p>Shares of Oracle were up slightly in extended trading after first  quarter results revealed while the company's traditional software business  improved, hardware system sales continue to be a problem.  Oracle's  earnings were up 11 percent from a year ago to 53 cents a share.  In line  with estimates, revenue of $8.2 billion fell short of the $8.42 billion  estimate.  The computer hardware segment fell for a sixth straight quarter.  </p><p>Here's a look at commodities.  Oil and gold are up.  </p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues after we check the weather now with FOX  5 meteorologist Mike Woods.  </p><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST:  Good morning, everyone.  Looks like  we have some wet weather out there but not a ton of it for the country  here.  We've got low pressure still rotating up around the Great Lakes but  it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwestern states, the Northern Plains  States all the way down to the Central Mississippi valley area.  And then  back up towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east.  Also a few  showers are popping up down around Florida.  </p><p>Again, southeast slightly risky in terms of showers and storms.   Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms, high temp today, 88 degrees.   Phoenix, no rain for you.  Sunny skies with a high of 103.  Seattle partly  cloudy skies with a high of 63.  Sacramento, California, we've got some  sunny skies there today with a high of 91, still warm.  I'm Mike Woods from  FOX 5 in New York.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Twenty one until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE  MORNING program.  I lost my phone and I can't call it because I keep it on  -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Vibrate or whatever.  </p><p>IMUS:  Whatever.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  </p><p>IMUS:  I have no idea where it is.  I thought I gave it to Carley,  but it could be anywhere.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program -- </p><p>RUFINO:  I'm still getting him.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, you're still getting him.</p><p>RUFINO:  Yes -- that little phony shoe thing.  </p><p>IMUS:  Vince Gill is coming up this morning, talk to him about some  stuff, the state of country music and the state of Vince Gill.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's it.</p><p>IMUS:  And then Neil Cavuto, he's going to be in.  We'll talk to him  about the state of the country, the economy and all that.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, there's big Romney interview.</p><p>IMUS:  Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, FOX  News contributor Juan Williams.  Good morning, Mr. Williams.  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR (on the phone):  Good morning, Mr.  Imus.  I was worried for a second you forgot about me.  You didn't know my  name?  What is this?  What's going on over there? </p><p>IMUS:  I'm thinking about two or three different things.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  You know, what?  You're thinking about beautiful women or  something.  I guess that's on your mind all the time.  </p><p>IMUS:  Trying to find my phone.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  (LAUGHING)</p><p>IMUS:  You know what I'm reading, which is terrific is O'Reilly's  \"Killing Kennedy.\"  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Did you read \"Killing Lincoln\"? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I did.  </p><p>IMUS:  And? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I liked it.  You know, he gave me a copy early on, and I  gave one to my son because I liked it so much.  And I told him, you know,  he can be reluctant even to accept praise, but yes, I thought it was pretty  good.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  I wasn't a big fan of that.  I didn't read it all  because \"Killing Kennedy,\" you know, I was talking about it -- do you mind  talking about this or no? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.  Why would I mind talking about it? </p><p>IMUS:  Well, I don't know.  The difference is between, say, Walter  Isaacson, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Doug Brinkley, and those people.  They tell  you about, you know, in the story they tell you about the Cuban missile  crisis.  So, they write about Khrushchev, O'Reilly does.  And he describes  him as 5'3,\" about 200 pounds, got a big old mole, gap in his teeth,  murdering little bastard.  But if it is Doris and all those other people,  you've got 43 pages about where he grew up, his sister, his brother, his  parent, I mean, stuff that maybe I want to know.  But here's -- do you  believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin of Jack Kennedy? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think he was the lone assassin if you're asking who  pulled the trigger, yes, I do.  If you're asking were there other people  involved who may have been backing Oswald, funding Oswald, you know, did  Jack Ruby have any role to play there, I'm very suspicious of that.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, here's what they're trying to do in the book which  doesn't annoy me, but is they're trying to set Oswald up -- he describes on  page 15, does O'Reilly, Oswald as a crack shot.  Well, I was in the Marine  Corps at the same time Oswald was.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Sure.</p><p>IMUS:  I was in from '57 to '59 on a two-year reserve program.  Two  years active duty and then reserve.  He was in from '56 to '59.  So, I  qualified for the rifle -- in the same program as he did.  And I barely  qualified as a marksman.  Then, there are three categories, marksman,  sharpshooter and expert.  So, O'Reilly describes Oswald as a sharpshooter.   But in May of 1956, he qualified, did Oswald, barely two points into being  designated a sharpshooter.  In other words, two fewer points and he would  have been a marksman, the lowest category.  And then -- pardon me?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hang on.  Hang on.  But wait a minute.  The idea is he was  a trained shooter, Imus.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I mean, so, OK, you can get into your gradations of how  skilled he was.  But I think Bill's point was this guy didn't just pick up  a gun and he was, you know, some schlock who was trying out.  I mean, he  had been trained in how to fire and he had been qualified, I think that  makes some compared to me for example who's never fired a gun.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  But don't sell him to me as a crack shot, which he was  not.  Because when he tried to assassinate General Walker, he missed him.   He was 40 feet from him.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I love your point.</p><p>IMUS:  And then he qualified again in 1959 just before he got out.   And he qualified barely with a score of 191 as a marksman, the lowest  designation.  Two fewer points and he would not have qualified.  So my only  point is yes, he could shoot a rifle better than some bozo on the street.   But don't try to sell him to me as being this expert crack shot, because he  wasn't.  So, that's it.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.  You may know too much on this count.  But anyway,  your point is well taken.  Especially -- but I think that the larger point  is to the reader that this is a guy who was trained in how to shoot.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And as you point out, not only qualified once but  qualified twice is the other way to interpret the exact same events that  you just said make you doubt, you know, how good -- he was.  </p><p>IMUS:  Only an idiot like me would get bogged down in the minutia of  that.  All right.  About the president, about Romney.  Let me see if you're  guy --  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Do you really want to talk about that?  Doesn't sound like  it?  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, talk about what? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  American presidential politics.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, I don't mind.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I know Romney is not doing so well and I figured you're  going to be depressed and upset about it.  </p><p>IMUS:  I don't care.  My job is to monitor the freak parade.  And he's  in it.  Anyway, now has the President and the Secretary of State and the  national security advisor and these other people, Susan Rice and the rest  of them, have they decided now what the attack in Libya was?  They first  tried to sell it that it was the result of this YouTube movie, which every  fool on the planet knew that wasn't the case, particularly falling on  September 11.  And now when the president is reluctant to use the word  \"terrorist,\" I don't know if I've ever heard him utter that word, now  they're acknowledging that it was a terrorist attack.  So my question for  you is, were they initially lying, one?  Or did they not know, two?  Or,  three, were they just assuming or guessing?  Or, four, were they waiting  until they got more information and thought they would throw up a smoke  screen to try to hoodwink us? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I think that there was a strong sense that this was  terrorism.  But again, you know, they don't have a sense of Libya and I  think the intelligence background necessary to lay things out.  But if  you're asking about whether or not they were reluctant to call terrorism  what it is, I don't think there is any question.  This has been a problem  throughout the administration.  You know, they talk about manmade disasters  instead of terrorism.  </p><p>I mean, but that has to do with a mind-set that, you know, again,  caution about attacking people, especially Muslims and reluctance to  embrace the idea that it's terrorism because somehow that would take us  back to the Bush years of the war on terror and they don't want to do that.   But that has been the mind-set with this folks from the start, I-man.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  Who's the National Security advisor? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  At the moment.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, no.  In October of 1922.  Yes, at the moment, Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't know.  </p><p>IMUS:  You know, it's Keith Alexander.  Isn't that right, Bernie? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  That is correct.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  So, neither Bernie nor I had any idea who it was.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.  Well, I couldn't call the name.  You got me.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, wouldn't you think we could do better than that dope  empty suit Romney or your guy? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  You mean as Americans? </p><p>IMUS:  Somebody to run this country? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, yes.  That's what I meant, as Americans.  Well, you  know, what?  We've got political structure.  And, you know, this is who's  been nominated.  And gosh, you know, if you look on the republican side,  they went through a lot of people to get here, and this was the decision  made.  Well, I tell you, you know, yesterday's comment by Ann Romney, you  know, stop questioning my husband.  Stop the doubts.  If you think you can  do better, get in the ring, I thought some level of frustration over on  that side.  </p><p>IMUS:  Are you a Christian? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I am.  </p><p>IMUS:  Are you ready to deal with Jesus maybe having a wife? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  You know, I never had any trouble with it.  In fact, you  know, there's all these questions about whether or not, in the last supper,  that drawing, you know, if that is a woman next to him.  It seems to me  inevitable.  I mean, all the talk about not just Mary Magdalene, but I  mean, you know, people that were described as prostitutes and outcasts and  the like, I think he was, you know, fully human.  Let me just say that, in  human form.  And I just think that part of being human is your sexuality.  </p><p>IMUS:  I got punked by Jesus the other day.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now this is interesting.  What happened to you? </p><p>IMUS:  Well, I tore my rotator cuff and then suddenly it stopped  hurting.  And I thought thank you, God!  Jesus!  And then it started  hurting again.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh no.  </p><p>IMUS:  So I got punked by Jesus.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, you know, you think you had some good times there for  a minute.  I mean, thank God you got some relief.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  Well, now I'm OK, so.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, well, I'm glad to hear that.  </p><p>IMUS:  Behave yourself, Mr. Williams.  I always love having you on.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I appreciate it.  I appreciate it.  And I'm going to just  burn Tom Donilon's name into my head again.  You know what I mean, I don't  know why I forgot that name.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  He is the national security advisor to the President.  The  director of the agency is the guy named General Keith Alexander.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  The NSA, right.</p><p>IMUS:  OK.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK.  </p><p>IMUS:  Thanks, you guys.  Eleven until the hour.  </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  IMUS IN THE MORNING.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo.  And it's time to  check the markets.

Everybody is having a good  time.  The line is starting to move so we're starting to get kind of  excited.  </p><p>GRAY:  Yes you've got about an hour to go now.  You've got your Willie  Wonka golden ticket here.  Are you pretty happy about that?  And also you  have to wait until 8 a.m. Local time.  You just moved here from Tucson.   Are you already ribbing your friends back home that you're going to have  yours first?  </p><p>JARED:  Yes I did.  I posted it on Facebook I've been kind of poking  at them.  I have a few friends that are like really Apple fanatics.  And  it's kind of a -- its kind of a fun jest.  So I'm getting them back you  know.</p><p>GRAY:  Is there any one particular thing about the iPhone 5 that is  drawing you to it aside from the fact that it's just the newest, the latest  and greatest?  </p><p>JARED:  I really like what they've done from the body.  The aluminum - - the aluminum body looks really sleek, it's going to be really nice.  And  the wider screen is -- you can't go wrong.  </p><p>GRAY:  And what about the connector?  We've heard a lot of flap about  this the new connector.  You're going to have to get all new devices and  you know the peripherals to go with it, like alarm clock, et cetera.  Is  that a problem for you?  </p><p>JARED:  It's not a problem.  I mean, you know people try to jab where  they can jab.  But it's going to be great.  I mean, iPhone, the connector  has always been proprietary.  It just they're better, they're making it  better.  They're improving.  When technology moves, you've got to move with  it.  And that's just -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GRAY:  All right.</p><p>JARED:  -- that's what you do.  </p><p>GRAY:  All right, Jared we've got to move too.  Diane so yes we'll be  following all day for you there.  The line is starting to move.  Several  hundred of folks as I mentioned lined up out here to pay anywhere from $200  up for the new iPhone.  Back to you.</p><p>MACEDO:  All right, that's Robert Gray making friends at the Apple  store.  Thanks Robert.</p><p>GRAY:  Sure.</p><p>MACEDO:  And we're getting earnings in from Darden restaurants now,  the parent company of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster is reporting a  profit of 85 cents a share just beating the estimate for 84 cents.  Revenue  came in at $2.03 billion.  And that was right in line with what we were  expecting.  </p><p>Now on the day of the iPhone release, Blackberry is reporting an  outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Blackberry  announced the issue and postings on Facebook and Twitter and says it is  urgently working to fix the problem.  </p><p>Checking markets this morning here in the U.S. futures are up across  the board, Dow futures are up by 30, the S&amp;P is up by about two, the NASDAQ  is up by five.  In Europe the Financial Times is reporting European Union  Authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a  bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the ECB.  Markets there are mixed  with London and Paris both down, Frankfurt holding on to green territory by  about six points.  </p><p>Let's take a closer look now at what's moving the markets with James  Hughes, senior market analyst at Alpari over in London.  James the Greek  government officials are holding another round of negotiations with  creditors in hopes of agreeing to almost 12 billion euros worth of  cutbacks.  How do you expect this to play out?  </p><p>JAMES HUGHES, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, ALPARI:  I mean, I think we  expect it to play out the same way that we've seen it's done in the past.   I mean there's been a lot of negativity around what (inaudible).  Greece  trying to renegotiate these plans and the issue we've had is that they --  that they have an initial plan, initial measures we're put in place that  Greece had to -- had to hit but the goal post has been moved so many times  now.  There always seems to be another renegotiation of -- of austerity or  cuts.  </p><p>And I mean we're hopeful of course that Greece is going to agree to  something.  And -- but I think whether they agree or not is not the key  point.  It's whether they stick to it which is the key point.  And that's  been an issue for this for a long time now.  </p><p>MACEDO:  All right that's James Hughes from Alpari in London.  Thanks  so much James.</p><p>HUGHES:  All right.</p><p>MACEDO:  Universal Music Group has won approval from EU antitrust  regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion after the  Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record  labels.  Universal says the assets to be sold announced that 30 percent of  EMI's global sales, Citigroup is selling EMI after it acquires the Music  Group when buyout firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the  investment bank.  </p><p>Here's a look at commodities now oil and gold are both to the upside,  oil is up by about 70 cents trading around $93 dollars a barrel.

So Rob Bartlett, who has no idea about cowboy hats, he  says to me, man, that's a great-looking hat.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh God.</p><p>IMUS:  And that's the key.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  If a civilian can tell a hat's great, then it's great.  </p><p>RUFINO:  A layman.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  There you go.</p><p>IMUS:  And I got it yesterday from the Man's Hat shop out in  Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Why am I plugging them?  I'm not.  How many hats  can they sell?  I mean hello?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes hello.</p><p>IMUS:  But -- well, Stuart bought it for me and (inaudible) it out to  the I-Man.  Come on dude.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Old Stuart.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  All right, he's shaking the ladies off your leg stepping out  of the building.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well the dude can make a hat.  Vince Gill is coming up we're  going to talk to him.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Neil Cavuto is here.  So is Bill Clinton.  Bill, how are you?  </p><p>BARTLETT:  I'm all right, I-Man.</p><p>IMUS:  Mr. President I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTLETT:  It's a good looking hat.</p><p>IMUS:  And Tony Robbins, how are you?  </p><p>POWELL:  Good morning, Imus.</p><p>IMUS:  Tony's here and Dagen and Carley and Lou Rufino and Bernard  McGuirk and Warner Wolf and Gunz.  What a couple of dopes.  </p><p>WOLF:  Come on.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh God.</p><p>IMUS:  We like the Carolina Panthers.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  The Giants went down there and put a butt whipping on them 36- 7, 36-7 -- I woke up.  </p><p>WOLF:  That's right.  I told Mike we should go -- </p><p>IMUS:  I woke up in the fourth quarter about -- fourth quarter just  started.  It was 26-7.  The Carolina Panthers were driving.  Apparently  they didn't drive anywhere.  </p><p>WOLF:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  The Giants have put up 10 more.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  So -- </p><p>WOLF:  The backups were great.  That was the key.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh you and Gunz should have anticipated that.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, we should have.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  In fairness to you, those guys on the pregame show on the NFL  network, Steve Mariucci, Rich Eisen, that dope Deion Sanders, that other  dope Michael Irving.  And I don't know who that other guy is.  Who is that  guy Lou?</p><p>WOLF:  Marshall Faulk.  </p><p>IMUS:  Marshall Faulk.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh yes Marshall Faulk.</p><p>IMUS:  Now they're all fine but they're dumb.  Every single of them  picked the Carolina Panthers -- everyone of them.  </p><p>This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING incidentally is sponsored by  \"The New York Times\" best-selling author, Mitch (inaudible) new book \"The  Timekeeper\" the dude has sold 30 million books.

And then Neil Cavuto I ran into Neil downstairs and I had my  little bottle of oxygen with me because I couldn't breathe.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I know.</p><p>IMUS:  So he was like terrified.  Why don't you go home?  Because I'm  a man, that's why I didn't go home.  </p><p>Time for the news now at eight minutes after the hour and here with  that is Connell McShane.  Good morning Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, good morning, I-Man.  </p><p>We'll start with the campaign.  President Obama pressed on some of the  failures in his first term, immigration and other things at a forum in  Florida hosted by the Spanish language station Univision.  The President  says he's learned a few things over the past four years.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You can't change  Washington from the inside.  You can only change it from the outside.   That's how I got elected.  And that's how the big accomplishments like  health care got done.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  I'm going to go to Robert Gray now.  Do you care?</p><p>MCSHANE:  No not really.  Was that you screaming by the way?</p><p>IMUS:  Yes do you have something else you want to say?  </p><p>RUFINO:  You have to ask.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Romney campaigning across Florida real quick.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  The President has already  thrown in the white flag of surrender.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Suit dummy.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's all I have.</p><p>IMUS:  All right, from Fox Business News, here's Robert Gray.  Good  morning, Mr. Gray.  </p><p>GRAY:  Hey, I-Man.  Good morning.  </p><p>IMUS:  Where are you?  </p><p>GRAY:  I'm out in front of the Apple store on Fifth Avenue, and 59th  Street, it's normally a 24/7 store here I-Man.  You may have gone in the  middle of the night but they actually closed it.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh they did?  </p><p>GRAY:  So that they could create.  Yes they wanted to manufacture a  line.  And as you know from back in the day, no one manufactures lines like  they do here in New York.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes I've actually been in that store a couple of times.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTLETT:  Really.</p><p>RUFINO:  I'll be darned.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Robert.  </p><p>RUFINO:  Say it, Robert.  I'll be darned.  </p><p>IMUS:  Do you have something to report, Robert?  </p><p>GRAY:  Absolutely.  </p><p>Yes, we're out here.  Look, there are several hundred people lined up  waiting for this new iPhone 5 to go on sale.  It's coming out 8 a.m. folks  will be rolling in.  And they could sell as many as -- as many as 10  million of these by the end of this month alone.  </p><p>IMUS:  Ok we'll it's a very fine report.  Thank you for that important  information, Robert.  </p><p>RUFINO:  What a loser parade.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Those idiots have been camped out there for five nights -- </p><p>GRAY:  Some of these guys have been out here all week.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Morons.</p><p>IMUS:  Big Foot.</p><p>TOM BOWMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Yes sir.</p><p>IMUS:  Have you lost your mind?  </p><p>BOWMAN:  What are you kidding?  This is a great story today.  </p><p>IMUS:  But -- </p><p>BOWMAN:  And you personalized it as always.  </p><p>IMUS:  Do we have a unique situation here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  We have wall-wall-commercials which is how we keep doing this,  which I'm happy that we do have.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  So we don't have an inordinate amount of time for Warner to go  on and on about Yogi Berra or somebody or Miller Huggins or -- and you know  I like Robert Gray.  But you go to Robert Gray with no information.  Well,  I'm standing outside the store.  Here we've got a few hundred people.  Ok  good, great.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Robert Gray all the way.</p><p>RUFINO:  Miller Huggins is waiting -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS:  I like Robert Gray.  He is a terrific reporter.  He's got a  nice sense of humor.  But he gave us zero information.  We know -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  That isn't fair.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Come on he talked about how many iPhones might be sold and  that kind of thing.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes why -- why would these idiots camp out and not wait  five, ten days and buy it in the store days later on?  </p><p>IMUS:  Who knows?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Exactly.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well maybe he knows.</p><p>IMUS:  Do you know why they do it Robert?  </p><p>GRAY:  Yes I do we've talked to several of these folks I-Man and some  of these guys are big tech fans.  And they wanted to be a part of the  experience here and the first to have it.  We just talked to a guy from  Tucson.  He wants to have it before his buddies.  He's posting it on  Facebook.  He's going to have the newest, latest and greatest.</p><p>MCSHANE:  There you go.</p><p>GRAY:  And these guys like to have the faster processor, bigger  screen.  Some of the other phones have already had that for six to nine  months so the iPhone is playing catch-up here.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right, there you go.</p><p>IMUS:  Robert Gray, the Fox Business Network.  Live outside the 59th  and Fifth at the Apple store.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Good report dude.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well done Robert.</p><p>IMUS:  12 minutes after the hour.  Please stop calling people dude,  Imus.  It's 12 after the hour.  Let's do a little new, more news.  And here  with that is Connell McShane.  Good morning Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, good morning I-Man.  Well, the campaign moves to  Nevada today where Mitt Romney will be campaigning, in Virginia where  President Obama will be holding a rally.  </p><p>IMUS:  You shut up.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Here are some numbers that are in, Obama leads the \"Wall  Street Journal\"/NBC News swing state poll.  He's up eight in Iowa, five in  Wisconsin and Colorado.  The Gallup Daily tracking poll though, dead heat,  47 percent a piece around the country for Mitt Romney and President Obama.  </p><p>There are protests today taking place in Pakistan.  In fact they've --  they've named it a national day of protests there over this anti-Muslim  movie that was produced here in the United States.  And the government in  Pakistan actually disabling cell phone service, some of their major cities  are trying to prevent phones from being used in detonating bombs.  </p><p>And then in Syria, President Bashar Assad talking tough, an Egyptian  magazine reporting that Assad predicts the defeat of the armed opposition  that foreign intervention like the one in Libya will not be repeated there,  he said.  This, as at least 30 are reported dead in the northern part of  the country.  Government airstrikes reportedly hit a gas station and caused  a huge explosion in Syria.  </p><p>Then the surge is over in Afghanistan.  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta  says the 33,000 additional troops that were sent a couple of years ago to  Afghanistan have now pulled out of the country.  He calls it a very  important milestone, says the surge accomplished its goals in Afghanistan.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Really.</p><p>MCSHANE:  And one other thing for you, I-Man.  The Emmys this Sunday  but Kelsey Grammar not a nominee.  Critics and fans of Grammar's stars show  \"Boss\" have agreed that he was snubbed when these Emmy nominations were  announced.  He recently suggested that his conservative political leanings  were the reason.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>KELSEY GRAMMER, ACTOR:  I did speculate about the fact that maybe I'm  a pretty well outed conservative in Hollywood and maybe there's some energy  there.  But you know I've since come to think that it hasn't gotten out  there enough.  I don't know.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  There you go.  Well, Kelsey Grammer thinks he was snubbed  there I-Man for the Emmys.  And those are your -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  No justice, no peace.</p><p>MCSHANE:  -- exactly, right, your headlines this morning.</p><p>IMUS:  All right, hey, Big Foot, load up Tony Robbins and Lady Gaga,  ok?  </p><p>BOWMAN:  Yes sir.</p><p>IMUS:  Let's do a business report now at 14 after the hour.  And here  with that, just ahead of Vince Gill and Bernie with a briefing and Warner  with sports is Dagen McDowell.  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, sir.  </p><p>Did you know that the new iPhone 5 goes on sale this morning at 8  a.m.?  Maybe we could take a live look at the Apple store here in midtown  Manhattan for the lines of people.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Don't be mean.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All those -- you know why those doofuses line up?  Because  they've got no woman at home and they've got to be one of the first of  their friends to get the new iPhone 5.  </p><p>IMUS:  They either don't have a woman at home or they've got a woman  at home like you. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Or the only woman at home is their mom.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, the I-Man.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what; no truer thing has ever been said.  </p><p>RUFINO:  I'll wait on this line for four days to get away from her.  </p><p>IMUS:  Let's go here.  </p><p>RUFINO:  Is that Jonas?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it's going to set records.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS:  Ok.  That big race in New Hampshire, Nascar this weekend?  All  right, second race with the chase or whatever</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I do have something though.  The iPhone sells like it does  because Blackberry stinks to high heaven.  And Blackberry service is  actually out today in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  So  there is justice in this world.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  A quarter after the hour.  Let's do some sports.   No, first let's go to Tony Robbins who has some thoughts about Lady Gaga.   Good morning, Mr. Robbins.  </p><p>POWELL:  Good morning, Imus.  Lady Gaga is having a physical crisis.   She recently put on a couple of pounds.  Who am I kidding?  I saw her in  concert with that big hat and those big glasses.  I thought she was Cee Lo  Green.  She's gone from doing well-choreographed routines to the electric  slide.  Apparently it's not as taxing.</p><p>Gaga claims that she gained weight eating delicious food at her  father's Italian restaurant in Manhattan.  That's a relief.  I'm glad she  wasn't eating her dresses.  A bacon muumuu has got to be like what --  50,000 calories.  Eating her clothes would certainly qualify as an  unhealthy relationship with food.</p><p>Gaga lives, breathes, sleeps and eats music.  She's passionate about  music and obviously.  I told her to combine her loves.  She took my advice  and started writing her sheet music on sheet cakes.  Share your music with  the world but share your cakes with friends.  That's the out of the box  statement that's made her a superstar.</p><p>Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the  visible.  Lady Gaga's goals to go from being an unknown artist to being  well, the biggest thing in music.  I'd say we've got that covered.  </p><p>IMUS:  Tony Robbins here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>All right.  Let's do sports at 16 minutes after the hour.  Just ahead  of Vince Gill later on this morning and Neil Cavuto.</p><p>Sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers.  Here with sports, best  sportscaster in the country, Warner Wolf.  Good morning Warner.</p><p>WOLF:  Thank you very much.  Good morning I-Man. Thursday night  football in Charlotte.  The Giants beat the Panthers, 36-7.  It was the  story of the backups.  Running back Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw  -- 113 yards, 20 carries, 2 touchdowns; and wide receiver Ramses Barden  playing in place of Hakeem Nicks, 9 receptions for 138 yards.  Eli, 288  yards, 1 touchdown, no interceptions; Lawrence Tynes kicks 5 field goals.</p><p>Cam Newton trailing 23-0 in the third quarter and obviously thinking a  touchdown was worth 23 points, scored on a 1-yard touchdown and then went  into his superman celebration.  Come on, Cam.</p><p>Baseball: Yankees beat the Jays -- </p><p>IMUS:  I tell Wyatt that all the time.  You put up an 8 in roping,  don't throw your hat.</p><p>WOLF:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  Act like you've been there before.</p><p>WOLF:  That's right.  That's what Tom Landry said, right.</p><p>RUFINO:  What an idiot.</p><p>IMUS:  What a dope.</p><p>RUFINO:  Oh God.</p><p>WOLF:  Yanks sweep the Jays.  Ichiro, a home run, a double, he's 9  for his last 12.  </p><p>IMUS:  That guy is great.</p><p>WOLF:  Oh man.  He's on fire.</p><p>IMUS:  And apparently New York is -- well, come on dude.</p><p>WOLF:  Well, they lead by one.  Both have 13 to play. </p><p>And before a bogus announced crowd of 20,000 at City Field, the  Phillies scored 8 in the first, 9 -- 7 in the 9th and beat the Mets 16-1.   The Mets are only 4 in 25 at home since the all-star break.</p><p>IMUS:  Wow.</p><p>WOLF:  Boise state beat BYU, 7-6.  BYU scored a touchdown, three and  a half minutes left, went for the 2-point conversion and missed.  </p><p>Wait a minute.  Stop the music.</p><p>IMUS:  All right.</p><p>WOLF:  Finally there may be a long-awaited Floyd Mayweather-Manny  Pacquiao fight.</p><p>IMUS:  Wow.</p><p>WOLF:  Pacquiao who, by the way, has to fight Juan Manuel Marquez for  the fourth time -- </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, fourth time.</p><p>WOLF:  -- has agreed, number one, to give Mayweather -- </p><p>IMUS:  Want to have more time -- they're ruining marriages . </p><p>WOLF:  He's agreed to give Mayweather a 55-45 split, Mayweather  getting the 55 rather than the 50-50.</p><p>Number two, Pacquiao says he will agree to Mayweather's demand that  he take the Olympic-style drug test which includes the blood test.</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Yes, sure.</p><p>WOLF:  The only drawback is when the fight occurs Mayweather will be  36 and Pacquiao 34.</p><p>In golf, you have the top 30 golfers in the world at that FedEx Cup  playoff.  Tiger Woods and Justin Rose share the lead, 4 under 66.</p><p>And finally, I-Man, our old friend Jerry Jones agrees with Buccaneers  coach Greg Schiano that it's ok for a team to go for the ball when the  other team is kneeling down to run out the clock.  Jones says the kneel- down is a wasted play, should be outlawed.  And if a team doesn't run a  play, they should be penalized.  </p><p>IMUS:  We're trying to win.  When we're out there on the field, out  there -- we're trying to win.  And we're the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>We didn't win in Seattle, and that sucked.  So I went to the  (inaudible) bar.  What are you going to do?</p><p>It's 20 minutes after the hour.  Thank you very much, Warner.   There's a briefing coming up.  What's there, B?  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  President Obama grilled by this Spanish language TV station  host.</p><p>And another secret Paris Hilton tape revealed.  We have the tape.  </p><p>IMUS:  One of the great songs Vince Gill ever wrote or recorded.  It  was a huge hit for the boy.  It was a huge hit -- \"Pocket Full of Gold\",  about a guy, he's married and goes in the bar somewhere and he takes that  ring off his finger. </p><p>I do that when I go to the titty bar.  I have a pocket full of gold.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo.</p><p>And General Motors is recalling more than 426,000 ChevroletPontiac  and Saturn sedans in the U.S. due to a transmission problem.  The recall  affects vehicles from model years 2007 to 2010.  The auto maker says the  transmission gear position may not match the gear on the shift gear and  that causes vehicles to move when drivers think they're in park.  GM says  it's aware of four crashes due to the problem, but no injuries reported so  far.</p><p>Here's a look at futures now, we are seeing them up across the board;  Dow futures up by 38, the S&amp;P is up by 3 and the Nasdaq is up about 6.

You  know, they found this.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  This historian of early Christianity up there at Harvard  Divinity School, the girl found a scrap of march weed or whatever the hell  it was papyrus -- is that what we call it?</p><p>MCSHANE:  yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Written in the fourth century containing the phrase that we've  never seen in any piece of scripture and it's Jesus, and he said unto them,  \"My wife\".  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Whoa.  </p><p>IMUS:  What up, girl?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Wow.  </p><p>IMUS:  Anyway, so that that.  And man -- what's that, godfather?  </p><p>BARTLETT:  I need the Christ to come on over for coffee tonight.  </p><p>POWELL:  I wonder whose name she called out when they were making  love.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  No, no.</p><p>IMUS:  Anyway.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  28 after the hour; we'll talk to Vince Gill in a  couple of minutes.</p><p>First, this Bernie Briefing is sponsored by Ramsey Fiat, Route 17,  Upper Saddle River, New Jersey.  Go to RamseyFiat.com.  Here's Bernard  McGuirk.  What up, B.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, President Obama, boss, candidate Barack Obama back in  2008 promised in no uncertain terms that he would pass a comprehensive  immigration reform.  He had a Democratic Congress for two years.  In any  case he's on Univision yesterday and host, Jorge Ramos, again, the Spanish  inquisition.  He hammered the President on this and listen to the  President's answer.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JORGE RAMOS, HOST, UNIVISION:  A promise is a promise.  And with all  due respect you didn't keep that promise.  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Here is what I would  say Jorge, is that we've had this conversation before.  There's a thinking  that the President is somebody who is all powerful and can get everything  done.  In our branch-- in our system of government, I am the head of the  executive branch.  I'm not the head of the legislature.  I'm not the head  of the judiciary.  We have to have cooperation from all these sources in  order to get something done.  And so, I am happy to take responsibility for  the fact that we didn't get it done, but I didn't make a promise that I  would get everything done 100 percent when I was elected as president.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Of course not.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, we can.  No, we can't.  </p><p>IMUS:  Come on here.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Anyway, there's another secret tape scandal out here boss.   This time -- first it was Mitt Romney.  Now it's your girl, Paris Hilton.  </p><p>IMUS:  My girl?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  everybody's girl, come on.</p><p>IMUS:  Ok.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  You know you love that tape, the first one she was in. Now,  she was in a taxi back during fashion week here in Manhattan and this cab  driver actually taped her and her gay friend -- the gay friend was telling  her about a guy he know who has AIDS and has unprotected sex, this, that  and the other. And she said some stuff that's getting her into a little bit  of trouble. Take a listen to it. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): You know if you want to (EXPLETIVE DELETED)  and you might be able to like just stick you (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>PARIS HILTON (voice-over): Eww.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>HILTON: Eww.

What is she saying, Berne? </p><p>MCGUIRK: She said gay guys are the horniest people in the world. They're  disgusting. Dude, most of them probably have AIDS.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: She said in the taxi that --</p><p>IMUS: That's not good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Some dude was, you know, Mohammad  there was rolling on while she  had the conversation. </p><p>IMUS: Just don't be hating on everybody, baby. All right.</p><p>Anything else, Bernie? </p><p>MCGUIRK: No, I'm done. </p><p>IMUS: It's 30 minutes past the hour.</p><p>I was talking to Kinky Friedman yesterday. Kinky refuses to use a computer.  Won't text. Won't e-mail. So there's no way to stay in touch with him. I  mean, you can call him. But we were talking about Dwight Yoakam's new  record. So, I said, have you heard \"Waterfall\"? And Kinky said, I love it  to death. It's just -- all right. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network.  And now here's Diane Macedo. </p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>KB Home is reporting a surprise profit after two quarters of losses as home  prices recovered. The fifth largest home builder says it made 4 cents a  share in its third quarter. The company was expected to lose 16 cents a  share, but revenue came in a little light at $424.5 million. The estimate  was for $430 million. KB Home says potential future housing revenue rose to  a four year high and home deliveries climbed 7 percent from last year to  more than 1,700. Shares are higher in the pre-market. </p><p>More companies, meanwhile, are rewarding their shareholders with higher  quarterly dividends. McDonald's is hiking its quarterly payout by 10  percent to 77 cents a share. Texas Instruments is boosting its dividend by  24 percent to 21 cents a share. And Covidien is increasing its quarterly  dividend by 16 percent to 26 cents a share.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right after we check the weather now with Fox  5 meteorologist Mike Woods. </p><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>Looks like we have some wet weather out there, but not a ton of it for the  country here. We've got an area of low pressure still rotating up around  the Great Lakes but it's bringing showers from the upper Midwestern states,  the northern plains states, all the way down into the central Mississippi  Valley area and then back up toward the rest of the Great Lakes over to the  east. </p><p>Also a few showers are popping up down around Florida. Again, the southeast  slightly risky in terms of showers and storms. Tampa, you'll see a few  scattered storms. High temp today 88 degrees. Phoenix, no rain for you.  Sunny skies with the high of 103. Seattle, partly cloudy skies with a high  of 63. Sacramento, California, you've got sunny skies there today with a  high of 91. Still warm. </p><p>I'm Mike Woods from Fox 5 in New York. </p><p>IMUS: It's 22 minutes till the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program. </p><p>Please welcome to the program, I don't want to embarrass him, but one of  the great country singers of all time, songwriters, Vince Gill. </p><p>Good morning, Mr. Gill.</p><p>GILL: How you doing, Donny?</p><p>IMUS: I'm fine. How are you?</p><p>GILL: I'm good. Good to see you.</p><p>IMUS: Fine. Fine. Nice to see you. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>GILL: You bet.</p><p>IMUS: So I was talking this morning, not to patronize you, which I wouldn't  do, I said there's a few people who sing who I'd have come in just to talk.  You're one of them.</p><p>GILL: Well, thanks.</p><p>IMUS: Do you like Dwight Yoakam? </p><p>GILL: I do. I always have. He's a good guy. </p><p>IMUS: A smart guy, too. </p><p>GILL: Yes. Smart as a whip. </p><p>IMUS: Crazy. Crazy.</p><p>GILL: He's a little bit crazy, but most talented people are just one tick  shy of nuts. </p><p>IMUS: Yes, but good crazy. </p><p>GILL: It's a good crazy.</p><p>IMUS: Kinky Friedman, Delbert McClinton.</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And -- but like Montgomery Gentry, I love them, but -- man, they  can't put two words together. </p><p>GILL: I wouldn't know. </p><p>IMUS: You know what I've learned --</p><p>GILL: It's a political year. No comment. </p><p>IMUS: Well, here's the -- I'm the worst kind of country disc jockey. Really  that's what I am at heart. </p><p>GILL: Well, you're one of the last people on earth that love music. </p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: That's why I love coming seeing you. You know, when I got a new  record or something's exciting going on, because I know you'll get it and I  know you'll, you know, you'll enjoy it. </p><p>IMUS: I just got Dwight's new -- do you care if we talk about other  artists? </p><p>GILL: No, I don't.</p><p>IMUS: I just got his new record. It is fabulous. </p><p>GILL: Yes, I've heard. I haven't heard it yet, but I've heard people raving  about it. (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>IMUS: Got a song called \"Waterfall\" that's --</p><p>GILL: I heard a little bit of that. </p><p>IMUS: That's clever, isn't it?</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So -- and -- because Dwight, he's a man who, when he went out with  Sharon Stone, you know, she described him as a dirt sandwich. </p><p>GILL: About as much fun as a dirt sandwich. </p><p>IMUS: Hey, have you ever heard of the Christian rock group Striker. </p><p>GILL: Yes, I have. </p><p>IMUS: OK. This is a tedious story. Maybe it's not tedious. But when my  brother, God bless him, and -- was working with the railroad as a breakman,  his partner was Phil Sweet. </p><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: And Fred and Phil wrote a song called \"I Don't Want To Have To Marry  You\" when they were working for the railroad.</p><p>GILL: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And they eventually got it cut. And it went to number one and all  that stuff. And Phil married a woman named Janice. And he's a great guy.  They live in Las Vegas. And they had two sons, Michael and Robert, and they  are Striker. </p><p>GILL: Oh, I didn't know that. </p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: That's neat. </p><p>IMUS: And Christian rock, they are. </p><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: And then Michael spent the last -- the past two summers going out  singing lead for Boston. It's a small world, isn't it? </p><p>GILL: Yes, it is. You know, ever since I married Amy, everybody thinks I  know everything about Christian music, but I don't. I wish I did.</p><p>IMUS: Well, Amy Grant won a -- won the -- everybody in the country had a  crush on her when she was --</p><p>GILL: Oh, yes.</p><p>IMUS: I remember all -- I remember all these disc jockeys over at NBC years  ago. I met Frank Reed  -- I don't know if you remember his name or not --  he used to tell me -- he said, have you heard Amy Grant? And I said, no. He  said, oh, man, come on here. </p><p>So, what's new with you?</p><p>GILL: Not much. After I married Amy, I used to have to fight my way out of  the bars. Now I have to fight my way out of the churches being married to  her. </p><p>IMUS: Hey, you built a studio at home. </p><p>GILL: I did. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Isn't a studio now just pretty much your laptop or no?</p><p>GILL: Well, pretty much. I mean it can be. But I went a little further than  that. Not as big as a commercial studio, but enough to track. And it's  really fun because we all kind of gather around in a room and play music  together instead of sequester each other off in a booth somewhere where you  can't see each other and we're all just playing together. And it's been the  greatest experience, this new record, the \"Time Jumpers\" record, that -- I  started playing with this band about two and a half years ago. And they're  a western swing band.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: Me being from Oklahoma, I was crazy -- I've always been crazy for Bob  Wills music and that swing stuff and they would ask me to come in and  occasionally sit in and fill in and, you know, if a guitar player couldn't  make it, they'd call me up and sub. And little by little they grew  confidence in me and said, hey, you want to be in the band. A couple guys  quit. And I said, sure. It would be fun. So I talked them into making a  record at the house and we decided to put it out. I said, man, we could  make a record for nothing. It would be a blast. And so away we went. </p><p>IMUS: Talking with Vince Gill here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Weren't you originally in Pure Prairie League? </p><p>GILL: A long time ago. Yes, 33 years ago. </p><p>IMUS: And before that? </p><p>GILL: I played with a guy named Byron Berline. A really great fiddle  player. Lived in Los Angeles. Was a session player. Played on Rolling  Stones' records and Birds  records and all kind of great rock records and  was the go-to guy for fiddle out on the West Coast forever and ever and  ever. And he had an opening and I was 18 or 19. We moved out there as a kid  and started out there. </p><p>IMUS: You just played guitar for a long time, right? </p><p>GILL: Yes. Still do. </p><p>IMUS: No, I know you do. But, I mean, I guess you knew you could sing, but  nobody else did or did they? </p><p>GILL: Well, a lot of times those gigs I would get would be because I could  sing, too, you know, and in those days if you could find somebody that  could multi-task, I guess would be a good word for it, and do a bunch of  different stuff, you were a better asset to a band. And so I was always  able to play a little bit of everything and could fill in whatever was  needed. </p><p>IMUS: What's the state of country music in your view? </p><p>GILL: It's interesting. </p><p>IMUS: You like it or no? </p><p>GILL: I'm not crazy about it. But I'm not supposed to. I'm 55 years old and  I'm supposed to like, what, you know, my era did and the era before me. I  don't -- I don't dislike it, I just don't necessarily believe that it's --  it's -- the term country music fits it so much.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>GILL: But, you know, they're young kids and they're following their muse,  they're do what they love and I've got no -- I've got no bitterness towards  them at all. </p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm 72 and I be loving that \"Pontoon\" record by Little Big  Town. </p><p>GILL: Oh, isn't that cool? </p><p>IMUS: That's a good record, man. </p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I like Jason Aldean. Come on. </p><p>GILL: Yes, he's fun. </p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: You know, they're rocking, they're -- you know, they're kind of --  they're pretty -- pretty brash. They're, you know, party time and all that  stuff. That's just, you know, it's not for me. It's not that I don't like  it. </p><p>IMUS: Jamey Johnson, of course, he's --</p><p>GILL: Great songwriter.</p><p>IMUS: Speaking about being out where the buses don't run. So -- but he's  great, isn't he?</p><p>GILL: He is. </p><p>IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p>GILL: He's a great throwback, you know. </p><p>IMUS: How do you really think is great? </p><p>GILL: Oh, well, I like -- I -- actually, there's a lot of people I love. I  think Carrie Underwood sings her brains out. </p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>GILL: Yes. She's a great singer.</p><p>IMUS: I just can't take that screaming. </p><p>GILL: Well, she does -- she will sing hard, but that's -- you've got  understand, that's what people are -- that's what they're learning. That's  what they're singing.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: From \"Star Search\" and \"American Idol.\" All these shows. It's like  grandiose and the big finish and, you know, it's -- </p><p>IMUS: I listened to something the other day that -- a duet you did with  her. It's good.</p><p>GILL: Oh, the \"How Great Thou Art\" thing?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: That was nice. </p><p>IMUS: Are you really religious? I mean --</p><p>GILL: To some degree, I guess. Probably not to the level of probably what  the expectation is of me because I'm married to Amy. </p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: I feel like a novice, you know, because I haven't had a church life  in my adult life. I did as a kid, but my adult life was never conducive to  it, only because of my work. I was gone every weekend. </p><p>IMUS: But you believe Jesus is the Son of God? </p><p>GILL: I do. </p><p>IMUS: OK. And like Mojo Nixon says about Elvis, Elvis is everywhere. And I  believe Jesus is everywhere. I mean -- I also know, though, however, not  that anybody asked me, but I respect all other religions as well. I --</p><p>GILL: Me, too. </p><p>IMUS: See, I don't think there's just one way to get there. </p><p>GILL: Well, I've traveled the world enough to -- you know, it just seems --  it doesn't seem logical that other parts of the world would know this way.  You know, maybe I'm wrong. I have been before.</p><p>IMUS: And now  are you prepared for this new information that Jesus may  have had a wife. </p><p>GILL: I heard. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: My observation was, if -- wasn't it her job then to come up with a  (INAUDIBLE) -- just idiotic.</p><p>GILL: That explains the missing years.</p><p>IMUS: You know Billy Joe Shaver? </p><p>GILL: A little bit, yes. </p><p>IMUS: Yes. I think he's one of the great songwriters ever. </p><p>GILL: I do too. Yes. </p><p>IMUS: But there's somebody who is certifiably -- but a sweet man. My  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>GILL: Yes, that's my -- you know, that's really my era of the people I love  were guys like him, Guy Clark, Jerry Jeff and Rodney Crowell and just those  really great songwriters from the '60s and '70s, (INAUDIBLE) Van Zant and  Emmy Lou was a great, great mentor to me, and teaching me what great songs  were like and who great song writers were, so, yes. </p><p>IMUS: Bill Anderson, one of the great songwriters ever. </p><p>GILL: No question. Most recorded, probably, in the history of country  music.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. I love him.</p><p>GILL: Even more so than Harlan or any of the others. So, I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: God, wasn't he great, Harlan Howard. Oh, my God. Please.</p><p>GILL: Yes.  We were good buddies. You know, when I first moved to  Nashville, we were great friends and I  would sing all of his demos for  him, $10 a song. </p><p>IMUS: Really? </p><p>GILL: Yes. </p><p>IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p>GILL: There was tons of demos of Harlan's and we were great friends. </p><p>IMUS: Before he died, he sent me a CD that he cut of all of his songs. </p><p>GILL: Wow. </p><p>IMUS: That he had written. He just dubbed, you know, (INAUDIBLE). I mean,  just everything that he did. And, oh, my God, what a great song. </p><p>GILL: He's a great man. You know, when I was first getting started, he  pulled me aside and he said, kid, you're one hell of a guitar player. And I  said, well, thanks, Harlan. And he says, and you're a pretty good  songwriter, but you're one hell of a guitar player, one hell of a singer,  and a pretty good song writer. I said, I get what you're saying. </p><p>IMUS: So you have a new record? </p><p>GILL: Not me, the \"Time Jumpers.\"</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>GILL: This band does. It came out last week.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe I could pay attention.</p><p>GILL: No, that's cool. I mean it's a fun record. You would really love this  record if you like Bill Wills and that swing music. It's an 11 piece bad  full of arguably some of the best talent that's ever graced instruments in  Nashville, Tennessee. All side me. All guys that played for other people.  Session players, things like that. All wanted to have fun on Monday night.  So we got together and -- years ago, they did, and started playing every  Monday night just for the love of it and fun of it. And we still are. We  just made a record. </p><p>IMUS: I can take a little bit of Bob Wills, but it's my contention -- and I  know I'm right -- that nobody likes blue grass music, including the people  who play it. </p><p>GILL: I think you might get a wrestling match over that one. </p><p>IMUS: Oh, I'm sure I will. </p><p>It's great to see you.</p><p>GILL: You too.</p><p>IMUS: It's an honor to have you on the program.</p><p>GILL: Thanks.</p><p>IMUS: You're one of my favorites. You're one of everybody's favorites, so - -</p><p>GILL: Well, right back at you.</p><p>IMUS: My wife loves you and my 14-year-old kid loves you and a lot of  people do. </p><p>GILL: I appreciate it.</p><p>IMUS: The great Vince Gill. </p><p>You know I played that \"Go Rest High on the Mountains\" you wrote for your  brother.</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I -- and thanks for the money you sent to the ranch when Fred  died. But -- </p><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: He's been dead a year. It's still hard to talk about him. I try --</p><p>GILL: I know.</p><p>IMUS: I played your record. I tried to talk about it and --</p><p>GILL: Yes, my brother's been gone for 20 years. You know, hard to believe.  But, you know, that's -- </p><p>IMUS: Why do we -- what is it? Is it -- why do we -- why does people dying  have that effect on us? It's part of life. </p><p>GILL: Yes. It's because you miss them. </p><p>IMUS: Is it?</p><p>GILL: Yes. I do. </p><p>IMUS: Yes, I guess that is. I mean we're not -- yes, I guess that's what it  is. </p><p>All right, man, it's great to see you. </p><p>GILL: You too, buddy. </p><p>IMUS: Vince Gill. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>We have an update on that Blackberry outage. Research In Motion says  service has been restored and things are back to normal. The company had  reported an outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. </p><p>Checking the markets now. Stocks in Asia rose as the release of that new  iPhone gave the telecom sector a boost. Hong Kong led the way with a 0.7  percent gain. In Europe, the Financial Times is reporting European Union  authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a  bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.  Markets there are currently mixed. London still to the downside by about  three points, but Paris is back in the green, up almost 10 points and  Frankfurt's up by 51. </p><p>Here in the U.S., we've had green arrows across the board all morning. Dow  futures are up by 43, the S&amp;P's up by about four, and the Nasdaq's up by  seven. </p><p>So now that Apple's iPhone 5 is available, we're also finding out what  exactly makes this smartphone work. The repair firm iFixit got its hands on  one, pried it open and found that the device uses chips from Qualcomm,  Avego Technologies and Skyworks Solutions. The phone also includes an audio  chip made by Cirrus Logic. And its gyroscope, which is used to track the  orientation, was made by STMicroelectronics. You can keep an eye on stocks  of those companies and those who didn't contribute to the iPhone 5 to see  how they react today.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities now. Oil and gold are to the upside. Oil's up  by about 60 cents, around $93 a barrel. Gold's up $6 at $1,776 an ounce.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the  power to prosper.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: IMUS IN THE MORNING continues here in  the next hour with Neil Cavuto from the Fox Business Network. He had a  recent interview with Mitt Romney here. So we'll talk to -- the I-man will  talk to Neil about all that's going on in the world. </p><p>And this portion of IMUS IN THE MORNING is brought to you by \"A Wanted Man\"  by Lee Child, now available in hard cover and e-book from Delacorte. Now  five minutes till the hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Here with -- with some thoughts on pot --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Is Brian Wilson, on the genius of the Beach Boys. </p><p>Good morning, Mr. Wilson. </p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Good morning, Opie.</p><p>I hear there's a movement to decriminalize marijuana, which is good,  because pot never did anything criminal to anybody, just made them feel  good. People say it's a gateway drug, which I guess it is. It's a gateway  to a beautiful world of pretty flowers and beautiful music and little  bunnies who sing pretty songs and give out candy. </p><p>But it's not like you're going to smoke a doobie and next thing you know  you're mainlining smack or anything. Of course it depends on how strong  your dope is. Like I just got a lid of northern lights white widow wonder  woman. You don't even have to smoke it. You just hold a butt in your hand  for 10 minutes and once the oil gets into your pours, you're a bottle  rocket, man. I think it also might have been sprayed with PCP and Easy Off,  because after I did a half a bong's worth last night, a genie appeared and  told me my oven was magically cleaned. </p><p>But legalization would be good for the economy, not just for the tax they  could collect on the (INAUDIBLE) itself, but for all the sales of  paraphernalia. It'd create jobs making rolling papers, Zip-loc bags,  Twinkies. If they had made weed legal, we could balance a budget by 4:20  the next afternoon.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: Nice.</p><p>BARTLETT: And I'll be sitting in my sandbox with my KCO  keyboard writing a  new song for the cute little bunny who gives out the candy. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  Apple fans around the world are lining up  to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves around the  world today here in New York City.  </p><p>The door should be opening sooner, and Robert Gray is standing by at  Apple's fifth avenue store.  Robert, what is it like out there? </p><p>ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS:  Well, Diane, I don't know if you can hear the  cheers, they're audible behind me. </p><p>Apple employees are outside, greeting the first of the 500 folks who have  been camping out here.</p><p>And the crowd has been swelling as the sun has being rising over Manhattan  this morning, waiting to get in to buy the iPhone 5.  </p><p>The store behind me is not only open 24 hours, seven days a week, they did  close it last night.  </p><p>Not opening until 8 a.m., that is the time that each Apple store in each  time zone has been opening in local time.  </p><p>So, we've had folks here from Arizona, saying that they're facebooking and  tweeting their friends back in Arizona.</p><p>Boasting that they're going to get their hands on the iPhone before those  guys can.  And you can hear the crowd starting to cheer even more there, as  I said, some 500 folks here. </p><p>The new iPhone 5 -- sold out two million, pre-selling in an hour's time.   It's expected to be the fastest and widest rollout yet for Apple, nine  nations have the iPhone selling it.  </p><p>That's the most to participate in it and what we've seen and, analysts  saying that they've stocked piled as many as 10 million units, that's about  $6.4 billion worth of inventory by the way.</p><p>And they're expected according to some analysts to sell as many as 10  million, Ben Stevens saying, they could sell 13 million before the end of  this month.  </p><p>Now, the new phone does boosts faster, processing speed, it works on the 4  GLTE network where you can get that. </p><p>It also -- it has an enhanced camera, the Siri voice command, it would  give you turn-by-turn navigation, you can post to Facebook.</p><p>You can also book reservations on open table but critics point to the  mapping features saying that they're incomplete, there's been some errors  there, and a lot of hoopla and negative flap about the connectors.</p><p>Which have short meaning that all of those i-gadgets you have there, work  with iPhones, you're going to have to go out and buy new ones, although  there're some analysts who say we're moving to Bluetooth.</p><p>Anyway, it may not be a big issue, down the line it will be though  immediately and Diane, we should also point out a robust secondary market  for iPhones.  </p><p>If you have an iPhone 4s, still under warranty, there are websites out  there, vili.com is one and the CEO telling me, they've seen interest triple  in the past week alone.  </p><p>You'll get about 260 bucks for your old iPhone 4s, that will about cover  the fees, you don't have to pay AT&amp;T to upgrade.  </p><p>If you're going to buy one, you can get one, it'll cost you about 300  bucks, but that's still less than the new ones. </p><p>Which started 199 with a two-year contract.  Back to you. </p><p>MACEDO:  All right, that's Robert Gray outside the Apple store, thanks,  Robert. </p><p>GRAY:  You're welcome. </p><p>MACEDO:  And as Apple focuses on the release of the iPhone 5, Research In  Motion is focusing on a blackberry outage.  </p><p>The company now says service has been restored and things are back to  normal after reporting an earlier outage affecting users in Europe, the  Middle East and Africa.  </p><p>Let's look at the markets now, here in the U.S., Futures have been in the  green across the board all morning, Dow Futures are now up by about 41  points, the S&amp;P is up by almost four, the Nasdaq is up by eight.  </p><p>In Europe, the financial times is reporting European Union Authorities are  working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and  unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p>You can see markets there are currently mixed, and now let's take a closer  look at what's moving them with European markets analyst Jan Randolph.  </p><p>He's a director of Sovereign Risk at IHS Global Insight.  Now Jan,  according to this financial times report, Spain and these European  authorities that it's talking to, are hoping to unveil this bailout plan  possibly in about a week.  </p><p>How do you expect investors to respond if that happens?</p><p>JAN RANDOLPH, DIRECTOR, SOVEREIGN RISK, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT:  I think  positively.  </p><p>I think they're expecting it, I think the lower borrowing costs we've seen  from Spain, in anticipation of the ECB bond buying and the bailout fund  being made available. </p><p>I think it will be a bailout light though, not a fully fledged bailout  though, that will be far too much money.  </p><p>The trick, you can call it that, is to keep private sector on board in  terms of refinancing the Spanish state and to encourage more.  </p><p>I think that's the trick and I think the package will be designed for that  purpose. </p><p>MACEDO:  All right, we'll see if they can do that.  That's Jan Randolph at  IHS, thanks so much, Jan.  </p><p>RANDOLPH:  Thank you.  </p><p>MACEDO:  And Universal Music Group has won approval from EU anti-trust  regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion.  After the  Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record  labels.  </p><p>Universal says the assets to be sold amount to 30 percent of EMI's global  sales.  Citigroup is selling EMI after they acquired the music group when  Vita firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the investment bank. </p><p>Here's a look at commodities now, oil and gold still up, oil is up by about  74 cents around $93 a gallon.  Gold is up 6 bucks at 1,776 an ounce.  </p><p>Coming up this hour, Imus' guest will be our own Neil Cavuto and now,  here's the i-man live on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.  </p><p>IMUS:  So big foot says to me, of all the people we've ever had on the  program, two of the nicest, perhaps the nicest, Vince Gill -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p>IMUS:  And Levon Helm.  So, Vince Gill is, that man, that's an American  treasure there, I'll tell you that right now.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.   </p><p>IMUS:  Well, here's what I'm trying to understand, Bernard, Connell,  anybody.  Warner, anybody?  Dagen? First, the administration said,  regarding the attack on Libya.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  That it was all the fault of this hideous movie that was on YouTube  and -- then we had people like K.T. McFarland and others on this program  say, that they believed the attack was essentially nonsense.</p><p>Although it may have served as a convenient excuse, but the anniversary of  9/11 had a lot more to do with it.  </p><p>And now we're being told, I guess, that no, the administration now says,  well, it was a terrorist attack. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.   </p><p>IMUS:  So, here is my question.  Did they know that -- did the President  use the word terrorist, by the way? </p><p>MCSHANE:  No.   </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  Has he ever? </p><p>MCSHANE:  Has he ever used the word period? </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, does he believe that there's terrorism in the world?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, yes, he's used -- </p><p>IMUS:  Sure -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  The word certainly --  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, OK, all right.  Does -- so did they use the movie as a  convenient excuse until they could develop all of the facts and find out  what really happened? Or as opposed to saying we don't know, which would  mean they lied to us. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right. </p><p>IMUS:  So, sort it out for me, start with you, Bernie? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, they went out as Susan Rice, the U.N. Ambassador on Sunday,  she went, did the tour and proclaimed, pretty much, no uncertain terms,  that it was all about the movie.  </p><p>And which seemed premature and a lot of people said as John McCain said,  you know there was a spontaneous demonstration she said, and John McCain  said you don't bring RPG's to a spontaneous demonstration.</p><p>And sure enough, it comes out later, Fox News now reporting that there was  an al Qaeda guy who was released from Gitmo in 2007.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Who was behind the attacks.  And so, it makes you wonder how  stupid -- I mean, didn't they know that that would come out?  They must  have known, or at least should have considered that it might have come out  when they put out Susan Rice to say these stupid things.</p><p>And it did come out and now they're backtracking, Jay Carney said, yes, it  was an act of terror.  And so, they look dead, they shot themselves in the  foot --  </p><p>IMUS:  Well -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Once again.  </p><p>IMUS:  The president's conduct to foreign policy is laughable and then my  guy, the suit dummy --  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Romney. </p><p>IMUS:  His comments in the wake of it were idiotic as well.  Shut up until  you know something.  By the way, just butt out. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, but to mislead the American people -- </p><p>IMUS:  Or what I said -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Because it would look bad politically, so, you can't -- </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Say that the GM is alive and Bin Laden is dead sort of puts a  monkey wrench into all that. </p><p>IMUS:  I understand.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  I mean that's sort of insulting -- </p><p>IMUS:  That's what I wondered, so --  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, that's what the critics are saying that, you know, they're  trying to change -- oh, it's much easier for the administration to come out  and say what Susan Rice said.  </p><p>It's kind of interesting that she was put out there.  Right, the President  has been very careful on what he's personally said about this.  </p><p>Even yesterday, as you said, he didn't use the word terrorism, it was Jay  Carney, his spokesman, not him.   </p><p>IMUS:  Well, there we are.  Neil Cavuto -- I mean, and these are the two  guys we've got running. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.   </p><p>IMUS:  I mean, it's just -- all right, eight minutes after the hour here on  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  </p><p>Neil Cavuto is coming up, I saw him this morning, when I walked in the  building and it was before 5:30 a.m. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Wow. </p><p>IMUS:  And he looked cute and perky down there in the lobby and he got all  exercised hysterical because I had my little oxygen tank with me because I  couldn't breathe this morning so -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Got to get by.  </p><p>IMUS:  What is it you're going to do?</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's right. </p><p>IMUS:  What is it you're going to do? So, all that's going on, and then of  course last night's football game, we're going to listen to Warner Wolf and  that dope Gunz -- </p><p>WOLF:  Hey, come on.  </p><p>IMUS:  Or any of the guys on the pre-game show -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p>IMUS:  On the NFL network, which by the way is a disaster. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  But Rich Eison and that dope Deion Sanders and Michael Irvin and --  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Marshall Faulk?  </p><p>IMUS:  Marshall Faulk and that dope, that fat dope -- why is the, why is  the name calling necessary?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Simply -- </p><p>IMUS:  Steve Mariucci -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's better -- </p><p>IMUS:  Every single one of these dopes -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right -- </p><p>IMUS:  Picked the tail out of Panthers across the board.  And the Giants  won 36 to 7.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well -- </p><p>IMUS:  Now what?  </p><p>WOLF:  I told Gunz I'm going to watch out for these reserves --  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, God, you're a disgrace. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On that, no -- </p><p>IMUS:  What are the Yankees doing? </p><p>WOLF:  Now, the Yankees lead by one with 13 to play -- </p><p>IMUS:  All right -- </p><p>WOLF:  And they all play, Orioles play losers and so do the Yanks. </p><p>IMUS:  Is there any other race any place in the country?   </p><p>WOLF:  Well, we have a two-game lead in the White Sox and Tigers.  </p><p>IMUS:  Right.  </p><p>WOLF:  That's really it, because -- </p><p>IMUS:  OK -- </p><p>WOLF:  Now the A's are four back --  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, fine, we don't need to run that -- </p><p>WOLF:  That's it -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, OK.    </p><p>IMUS:  All right, ten minutes after the hour, let's do some news, Bill  Clinton is here, going to talk about -- what are you talking about? </p><p>BARTLETT:  Monica Lewinsky's new book. </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, man, I can't wait to read this, come on, dude.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  You know, Juan Williams is right.  I'm probably making too big a  deal out of O'Reilly's characterization of Lee Harvey Oswald as a  sharpshooter. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  </p><p>IMUS:  I don't know, but it just annoys me, but other than that, the book  is great, \"Killing Kennedy\".  All right, let's do the news, good morning  Connell. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Good morning, i-man.  Well, we're keeping an eye on Pakistan this  morning because there are protesters on the streets over there.  </p><p>One of the things they won't be able to use their cell phones because the  government blocked cell service in major cities, worried that phones might  be used to detonate bombs. </p><p>And speaking of, you know that movie -- </p><p>IMUS:  People living in mud huts -- </p><p>BARTLETT:  I mean is it -- </p><p>IMUS:  Living in dirt and they've got cell phones. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  If these people put this kind of energy into being industrious -- </p><p>IMUS:  Yes -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  And you know, building up their -- you know, it's unbelievable.   Just relax, man, go to work. </p><p>IMUS:  Like a fool, I'm going to have Gunz and Warner pick the games coming  up here. </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK, good --   </p><p>WOLF:  Right. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, today is a national day of protest in Pakistan against that  movie, that -- you know, you mentioned produced here in the United States.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Listened to Ann Romney for a second, she was on a radio show in  Iowa asking Republicans to stop attacking her husband. </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What do you say to your fellow Republicans who are -- </p><p>ANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY:  Stop it.  This is hard, you want to try  it, get in the ring.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP) </p><p>MCSHANE:  You want to try it, get in the ring, is what she said. </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, well, I mean, I mean, I appreciate her depending her husband. </p><p>WOLF:  Yes. </p><p>IMUS:  She's a nice woman and all that, it's just --  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's it. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, let's wait until after November before we start with the  second guessing with the critics, I mean, not you chief.  But I'm talking  about some of these supposed Republican allies. </p><p>IMUS:  That's right.  . </p><p>MCGUIRK:  We're in a battle here, come on.  Whose side you want?    </p><p>MCSHANE:  Speaking of which, the polls 47 percent apiece, dead heat in the  daily tracking poll from Gallop yesterday, but Romney's problem has been in  these swing state polls.</p><p>Another one out from the \"Wall Street Journal\" \"Nbc News\", it's Obama up  eight points in Iowa, leading by five points both in Wisconsin and in  Colorado.</p><p>Here's the question for you, who do you think had the most watched  convention speech? Well, it turns out Joe Biden, the Vice-President.  43.6  million people for what it's worth, President Obama close second followed  by Mitt Romney, Bill Clinton and Marco Rubio. </p><p>IMUS:  Well, of course, because we thought it was going to be a car wreck.  </p><p>RUFINO:  That's right.  </p><p>IMUS:  Absolutely.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Tuning in, in case -- </p><p>IMUS:  Thirteen after the hour, let's do some business news, and here with  that is Dagen McDowell.

All right, please welcome now, speaking of that to  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, former president of the United States,  Bill Clinton, good morning, Mr. President.   </p><p>BARTLETT:  Well, morning, i-man.  Well, it was only a matter of time, but I  guess $12 million is $12 million.  So Monica Lewinsky is going to publish  her memoir with all the gory details.</p><p>Every sleazy, sticky, creepy, crawly bit of nastiness, and once it hits the  bestseller list, Bill O'Reilly is going to be able to start writing his  next book, \"Killing Clinton\".</p><p>Because Hillary will shoot me.  It's bad enough that the love ick on the  blue dress was made public for a while there.</p><p>I even thought they were going to put it on display and this masonian next  to Lincoln's stovepipe hat. </p><p>But now, Monica is going to reveal all my sex secrets, like my insatiable  appetite for three-way sex.  Which isn't what you were thinking is, is it  just really?</p><p>I only know three ways of doing it, four, if count missionary, but having  somebody else in the picture, that's just sick, unless the extra person is  A, a woman and B, hot.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTLETT:  But Monica is also going to reveal my fondness for sex toys.   OK, one time I used some legos to build a little garage for my weiner. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But it wasn't, you know a butt plug the size of a lava lamp.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But what really hurts is the allegation that she has to do this because she  needs to make a living and can't get a job because of me, which is just not  true.  </p><p>She could get a job tomorrow, in a cigar store -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTLETT:  Or better yet, a shoe store because you know, she's real good on  her knees. </p><p>IMUS:  So, 19 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  From  their brand new album, \"Hillbilly Jedi\", Big and Rich.  That was a good  record.  </p><p>And my baby gone.  </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>IMUS:  You know, I never thought about it, about women's hair thinning.  I  thought only men got bald until I saw a bald-headed woman.

And the big dawg Bill Clinton was on  with your friend Jon Stewart last night and he was boring, he was just  flat-out.  </p><p>He made Charlie Rose sound like Mad Dog Russo, he was so boring.  But,  listen to Jon Stewart do his best impersonation of Monica Lewinsky  journalistically. </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>JON STEWART, COMEDIAN &amp; TELEVISION HOST:  Give any good speeches lately or?  How was that -- how did that feel at the convention? </p><p>Could you tell that you were crushing it as you were doing it? Did you, did  you feel that? </p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Yes and no.  But --  because I didn't want to talk down to people, I wanted to explain what I  thought was going on. </p><p>STEWART:  That's what was so stunning, I think.  That's why it was such a  bracing speech.  The phrase you mentioned earlier about getting the facts  right, and they would have -- you would attach numbers to them that were  real.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I thought it was a bold choice on your part. </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  I mean he's going to have to send his jackets to the cleaners  after that, I mean, just figuratively, it was sort of nauseating.  But --  </p><p>IMUS:  What? There was not any --  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  The way he just -- I mean, did he ask him about the memoir that's  coming out? --  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, no -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Memoir --</p><p>IMUS:  Stewart was jerking his chain. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  No, he wasn't. </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, he was. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  I saw it.  He was --  </p><p>IMUS:  He wasn't jerking his chain?   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Not at all.  He was telling him what a great speech you gave and  could you put facts out there, unlike Mitt Romney -- </p><p>IMUS:  You're telling me Stewart wasn't kidding with that? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  No, not at all.  That was a straight-up journalistic -- </p><p>IMUS:  Didn't he sound like he was kidding -- </p><p>BARTLETT:  I mean, I didn't see it, so, I mean, I was there?  </p><p>IMUS:  He didn't sound like he was kidding? </p><p>POWELL:  Little tongue in cheek to me.   </p><p>IMUS:  That's what he sounded, like a little tongue in cheek.  Really? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  No, absolutely not.   </p><p>IMUS:  Well, because you're a hater. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  No, because I actually watched it, I saw it.  Now, let's move on  here, boss, because the clock is ticking and I know you want to get Mr.  Cavuto on.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  And we got us a little sex scandal over at \"Good Morning  America\". </p><p>IMUS:  All right. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  You know, locally here in New York City, you have this news  anchor on \"Channel 7\", \"Wabc\" Liz Cho. </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, my God, that's a home wrecker there. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, excuse me.  She and this dude, Josh Elliott, who's an  anchor on \"Good Morning America\", they're apparently an item.  I'm going to  read from the \"New York Post\" --  </p><p>IMUS:  I thought she was married. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, she was.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  This is what the \"New York Post\" page six writes this morning.   \"After we revealed yesterday that 41-year-old beauty Cho, the co-anchor of  \"Wabc TV\" in New York, split with her husband and moved out of their  Yonkers mansion three months ago.  </p><p>She insisted through friends that they're just friends.  She's 41, he's 41  and they say \"That this guy Elliott is a regular visitor to Liz's new  apartment on west 90th street, baby.</p><p>And he's been spotted leaving the building in the morning.  He's even been  picked up from Cho's part to head to work at \"Good Morning America\" where  he works as a news anchor.</p><p>Good morning Elizabeth.  But they insists that the relationship began after  she moved out of the Yonkers mansion. </p><p>IMUS:  OK.   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Right, it has to be true, right?  </p><p>RUFINO:  All right.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, but in any case, you know this guy Josh Elliott, he's sort  of in Kris Humphries area, he hosts this unwatchable \"Good Afternoon  America\" show -- </p><p>IMUS:  No, I don't --   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  With Lara Spencer.  Well, anyway this is blooming over -- </p><p>IMUS:  Stuff about praising anchor, no, I don't.   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  And they're beating the crap out of the \"Today Show\" by the way - - </p><p>IMUS:  Not good, I'm happy about that.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  That's all you got? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, I do have another piece of David Letterman clip, busting on  Jay Leno and Mitt Romney, but --   </p><p>IMUS:  No, he's a creep -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  We can save it.  </p><p>IMUS:  Thirty minutes after the hour, and here, Cavuto is next.  </p><p>One of Neil's favorite songs.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network.   And now, here is Diane Macedo.</p><p>MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  General Motors is recalling more than  426,000 Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn sedans in the U.S. due to  transmission problems.  The recall affects vehicles model years 2007 to  2010.</p><p>The automaker says the transmission gear position may not match the  gear on the shifter and that could cause the vehicle to move when drivers  think they're in park.  GM says it's aware of four crashes due to the  problem, but no injuries reported as of now.</p><p>Meanwhile, the recall news after General Motors announced it has  reached an agreement with the Canadian Autoworkers Union over a labor  contract.  Under the tentative four year deal, GM will add a third shift to  its flex line at its Ontario facility.</p><p>The automaker had planned to shutdown that plant three-shift  consolidated line next June, but will operate with at least one line until  June of 2014.  The CAW continues to negotiate a deal with Chrysler after it  already reached one with Ford earlier in the week.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues now after we check the weather with  Fox 5 meteorologist, Mike Woods.</p><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST:  Good morning, everyone.  Looks like we  have some wet weather out there, but not a ton of it for the country here.   We've got an area of low pressure still rotating around the Great Lakes,  but it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwest and Central Mississippi  Valley area.</p><p>And then back towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east  and also a few showers popping up around Florida again, southeast, slightly  risky in terms of showers and storms.  Tampa, you'll see a few scattered  storms and high temp today, 88 degrees.</p><p>And Phoenix, no rain for you, sunny skies with a high of 103 and  Seattle partly cloudy skies with a high of 63.  Sacramento, California,  you've got sunny skies there today with a high of 91, still warm.  I'm Mike  Woods from Fox 5 in New York.</p><p>IMUS:  All right, it's 36 minutes past the hour here on the IMUS IN THE  MORNING program.  Please welcome to the program, senior vice president,  anchor manager, Fox Business News, Fox News Channel, a man who sadly calls  himself the financial factor, Neil P. Cavuto.  What does the P stand for?</p><p>NEIL P. CAVUTO, FOX BUSINESS:  Patrick.</p><p>IMUS:  Good morning, Mr. Cavuto.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Good morning, Mr. Imus.</p><p>IMUS:  How are you?</p><p>CAVUTO:  It was scary bumping into you this morning.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, I had my little oxygen tank with me.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You kind of looked like Hannibal Lector being driven in on a  gurney and I thought, is he up to doing the show today?  But here you are,  encouragement to all us.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, anaerobic, but I recover quickly and I don't need oxygen just  to sit around and talk.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I admire that.</p><p>IMUS:  Happy birthday tomorrow.</p><p>CAVUTO:  How did you know that?</p><p>IMUS:  It's my job to know those things.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Thank you very much.</p><p>IMUS:  So, you like the Vince Gill interview?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I liked it very much, I'm a big fan of his and I thought you did a  very good job.  A lot of people, you know, when you interview stars it's  always tough.  You do a fawning interview or you do a revealing one  particularly like the things about your brother, how tough that is and  trying to get a handle on it, very real.  I liked it very much.</p><p>IMUS:  So I asked you off the air if you liked Romney.  Do you?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I do, personally I like him a lot.</p><p>IMUS:  It doesn't bother you that he's a dope, right?</p><p>CAVUTO:  He's not a dope.</p><p>IMUS:  OK, he's not a good campaigner, is he?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think that remains to be seen.  The election hasn't happened  yet.</p><p>IMUS:  No, sir.  Do you think that these leaked videos, these missteps that  they've each made, is going to make a difference when people vote?</p><p>CAVUTO:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  You don't?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I do not.  I think in the end, it always is the economy.  I think  that's what-- we could have extenuating circumstances, the Middle East  explosion, could have the impact, but almost every U.S. election is decided  by the economy.</p><p>How good people feel, how maybe not so good people feel and we're  always willing to entertain switching horses mid stream when an incumbent  is battling a tough economy, but we've really got to see the other horse.</p><p>I think in 1980 when the polls were similarly tight between Jimmy  Carter and Ronald Reagan.  A lot of people liked Jimmy Carter, frustrated  with the economy, but they were more than willing to entertain an  alternative and along came Ronald Reagan to appeal to alternative.</p><p>IMUS:  How many people vote for the person who they like the best?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think it plays a part.</p><p>IMUS:  How big a part?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I do think it helped George Bush, many polls were done on  the debate between he and Al Gore and then later on between he and John  Kerry.  And I think most people said who won the debates?</p><p>And a lot of them said, particularly in 2004, with John Kerry, who  do you like more or relate to more?  George Bush.  I'm not saying that's  always the case, but it does help if people feel you're either more  approachable or likeable.</p><p>And I think in 1960 from the television critics later who said that  Richard Nixon was sweating and detached and John Kennedy looked relaxed and  smooth.  These things on some level do connect for people.</p><p>IMUS:  Talking with Neil Cavuto -- talking with Neil Cavuto here on the  IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  It's 5 until the hour, you know what you  ought to do here at Fox?</p><p>CAVUTO:  What's that?</p><p>IMUS:  An interesting experiment because my wife mentioned this to me.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  She wants to have sex with you, by the way.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Who doesn't?</p><p>IMUS:  I don't.  Wants to have sex with you -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  And go ahead.</p><p>IMUS:  Anyway.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Come on, Don, tell me.  Go ahead, please.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, I forgot -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  At least say something, you guys.</p><p>IMUS:  Here is what you should do.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Like an interview by Rainman.</p><p>IMUS:  When is the first debate, October 1st?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think the 3rd.</p><p>IMUS:  It's the day he hit the home run.  Here is what you should do.   Please don't interrupt when I'm talking with Mr. Cavuto, Warner.  I'll come  over there and beat on you like a rented mule.  Just kidding.  You should  get a group of people.</p><p>Frank -- You should do it.  Get a group, have them listen to the  audio feed and don't let them watch it and have the group just watch it on  television and then poll each group to see who won.  Who they think won.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's not a bad idea.</p><p>IMUS:  It is a good idea isn't it?</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's a very good idea.</p><p>IMUS:  Because Deirdre said to me -- don't you hate it when guys quote  their wives.  You know, that means they're so p-whipped.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And she's insane for putting up with you.</p><p>IMUS:  Absolutely.  Because you get distracted who looked and -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, yes.  And history bears that out.  I mean, people who, I  guess, were listened in to the Nixon-Kennedy debate thought Nixon, and Bush  and Al Gore.  That was a little more debatable than Kerry and Bush.</p><p>IMUS:  Should I call Roger and -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Please do, please do.  I'm not going to act on this because I  actually think the idea is silly.</p><p>IMUS:  Do you really?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  I do.</p><p>IMUS:  You do?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think 90 percent of people are going to be watching and not  listening.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, you're just, I don't know, you're just -- I don't know.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I just, I think in 1960, it would have been a brilliant  idea, but last time I checked -- </p><p>IMUS:  It's a good idea now just to see.  It's 18 until the hour here on  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Did you read \"Killing Lincoln?\"</p><p>CAVUTO:  I did read it.  It's a great book.</p><p>IMUS:  But I'll tell you what is a terrific book \"Killing Kennedy.\"</p><p>CAVUTO:  I haven't -- I know it's out or will be out, but-- I really  enjoyed \"Killing Lincoln\", the way he built it up and x number of days to  live and I thought when I first opened it, we know what happened in the  end.</p><p>But he didn't do a great job and see what the Kennedy book, but I  think he's got -- he could a series on his hands.  I don't know how you  handle Philmore, getting Philmore, but -- </p><p>IMUS:  It's enormously entertaining and there's no heavy lifting, not a -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  I think it's a very good point.  A lot of the stories, Brinkley, I  love dearly and Harry Truman, 900 pages on and on and all great, but you  can make this fun and engaging.</p><p>IMUS:  And accessible.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's a way to do it.  I didn't see the kids' version that's out  but -- </p><p>IMUS:  That's pretty good, too.  It's pretty good, too, so, do you think he  writes any of it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think he does.</p><p>IMUS:  What's -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  -- his show.</p><p>IMUS:  That doesn't make any difference.</p><p>CAVUTO:  No, it doesn't, but when you say does he write his stuff?  Of  course, he writes his stuff.</p><p>IMUS:  How is that demeaning -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  You say does he write the book.</p><p>IMUS:  As a journalist, I have a -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Excuse me?  Excuse me.</p><p>IMUS:  It's 17 until the hour here in the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Are  you a sports fan?</p><p>CAVUTO:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  Not at all.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I heard you guys go through the Sunday games.  I guess these are  football games?  Terrific, no offense guns and Warner but -- </p><p>IMUS:  That's fine, but do you ever watch sports on television?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I have the attention span of a gnat.  I watch the highlights.  I  said, why can't the games be like the highlights?</p><p>IMUS:  Do you ever watch Sports Center?</p><p>CAVUTO:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  Where do you get the highlights?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Passing around the news or online, but I'm not really -- I'm  afraid I'm not really into it.</p><p>IMUS:  So, do you watch television?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I know this is going to sound elitist, but I really don't.  I'm  just, it's not -- </p><p>IMUS:  Mr. Cavuto -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  I watch you, of course, I mean, that's a staple.  Connell and  Dagen and flip over -- </p><p>IMUS:  Mr. Cavuto is on at 4 in the afternoon on the Fox News Channel and 8  p.m. and do you think that -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  I want to come back at you with anger, but I saw you with the  oxygen tank and go lightly no need to be mean.</p><p>IMUS:  It's a quarter until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.</p><p>CAVUTO:  This is three times in this hour with this interview, you relay  the time.  It's always fascinating to me why you do that.</p><p>IMUS:  I'm doing a radio program.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I know that.  I know, but -- like I say there are clocks in those  cars, right?</p><p>IMUS:  I can stop giving the time.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK, more time for me.</p><p>IMUS:  Bernie, put a call in to Bob -- anyway do you think Obama is a  socialist?</p><p>CAVUTO:  No.  I think he likes big government.  I think he likes more big  government and espouses the view much like FDR in 1932, government the only  way to get us out of the mess and a lot more people are beholden to the  government as a result of that.</p><p>And he's got a pretty good base of people who would vote for him as  a result and I think that probably was what Mitt Romney was inelegantly  getting at.  But we all remember, you know, but FDR got re-elected in a  landslide in 36 even though the economy still, still was pretty bad.</p><p>IMUS:  As ours does.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  And you would think that one of the things that Romney could get  some traction and I think, that you asked, I think -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Your thoughts are very valuable to me.</p><p>IMUS:  I think the day that Romney gets elected, the economy is better just  by -- he doesn't have to do anything, do you agree with that?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, you have to do something.  You're popping up in a different  -- </p><p>IMUS:  That wasn't the question.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You mean, well, it's a stupid point.  Sounds like Godzilla,  January 20th just by virtue of being Godzilla being in the office because  it's not Barack Obama, things are better.</p><p>IMUS:  If it makes you feel like a bigger person, which you're -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  OK, you know, I could lose weight, you will always be evil.</p><p>IMUS:  To make me feel bad by calling me a list of names, but don't you  think the way the markets would react -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  It's always fine until -- </p><p>IMUS:  And the financial community.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  That the things would, people would feel better and I know he has do  something, your suit dummy candidate and mine, but wouldn't have to do  anything, but just get elected and it would be better.  Do you think that's  true?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't, I don't, obviously if the nation turns to the challenger  to throw the incumbent out of office.  It's hoping what you said.  And  remember, electing Ronald Reagan in a landslide didn't bring results, in  fact, the recession many more years and jobs lost until we had to boom in  '82.</p><p>Coming out of that so things take time, I'm not subscribing to the  screw that automatically things are better.  They're ready to do well if we  don't keep what we're doing and stop with a new guy in there.  But you have  to do stuff.</p><p>You have to put up some initiatives that will change the direction.   Ronald Reagan did, and you know, the question would be for Romney  administration, if it were to happen, whether it would.</p><p>IMUS:  Is there a way now to know -- is there a way for you to know who  will win the election?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I have no idea.</p><p>IMUS:  Do you have a gut sense?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I do, but I'm not going to share that with you.  I will say this - - </p><p>IMUS:  You're really a creep.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's lovely.  I only relate this to you.  I think I told you  this before.  When I went to Wisconsin to cover the recall election, polls  going into that weekend had dead even.  I think it had it dead even and we  know at that Walker won by six points.</p><p>Now, I had a theory and I could be very wrong that conservative  support is understated in some of the state polls, maybe with unwinding a  bit it's beyond the margin of error, but I do think these states apparently  Mitt Romney is going to get blown out in, I don't subscribe to that.</p><p>IMUS:  You're going to get to the point eventually, right?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I just told you.  And I think the polls in the battle ground state  understate Romney's support.</p><p>IMUS:  Hope you're right.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And when you say Romney's my man you always say that.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But then you disparage him.</p><p>IMUS:  Keeping it real.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And for every wonderful interview like Vince Gill and then you do  one like you did with Frank Rich.</p><p>IMUS:  My job is to keep it real, right, Bernie?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Frank Rich interview, just kept it real.</p><p>IMUS:  Keeping it real.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  Thank you very much for -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  This is it? </p><p>IMUS:  You were on for 12 minutes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's 12 minutes of my life.  I'm never getting back.</p><p>IMUS:  And so does the audience.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEOD:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo.  Let's take a look at  the markets.  In Europe, the \"Financial Times\" is reporting that European  Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a  bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p>Markets there are now mixed with London down by about 5 points.   Paris is up 10 and Frankfort is up about 64.  Here in the U.S., we have  seen green arrows across the board all morning.  Dow futures are up by 56.   The S&amp;P is up by about 5 and the Nasdaq is up by 13.</p><p>Now that Apple's iPhone is available, we're also finding out exactly  what makes the smartphone work.  The repair firm fix it, got one open and  chips from Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solution.</p><p>The iPhone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus Logic and its  gyroscope, which is used to track its orientation was made by ST  Microelectronics.  Keep an eye on those stocks and those are the companies  that didn't participate in the iPhone to see the reaction today.</p><p>The world's biggest retailer is looking to do business in India.   The \"Wall Street Journal\" reports Wal-Mart hopes to open its first stores  in the country within two years.  That move comes after the government last  week agreed to allow international supermarket chains to enter India  through joint ventures.</p><p>Wal-Mart says it hadn't decided yet where or how many stores it  would like to have, but the company expects to continue its current  partnerships with barky enterprises of India, a chain of 17 cash and carry  stores.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities, oil and gold are up.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Good morning, everyone.  Apple  fans are on the world of lining up to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which  hits store shelves around the world today including here in New York City  where our own Robert Gray is standing by at Apple's Fifth Avenue store.   Robert, it is 6:00 in the morning.  What does it look like out there right  now? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Diane.  Good morning.   There are a few hundred folks out here in line behind me.  You can see them  and in fact, the big cube here which this store is famous for, which lead  you to an underground entrance way, the store is normally a 24-7 operation.   They closed it overnight.  It will not open until 8 a.m. local time.  And  of course, that is the roll out plan across nine different nations here.  </p><p>This is the widest rollout that Apple has had yet for one of their  iPhones.  Now, a key numbers to hit here.  We've seen every iPhone new  version has outsold a combined total of all the previous versions.  This of  course is a law of large numbers.  It is going to be tough to duplicate.   We'll have to wait and see.  Most reviewers out there saying this phone a  little bit more evolutionary than revolutionary.  </p><p>And of course, there's been a lot of feedback and flak, if you will,  about the new connectors out there.  They are of course shrinking the  connectors down to nine pins from 30.  So, all the products that you have  around the house, connectors et cetera, you'll going to have to go out and  buy some more of those.  So, Apple is expected to make a big hole out of  this as well as of course some of their third party partners out there.   You're going to talk a little bit all morning long.  </p><p>Of course, we're expecting a faster processor on board, you got the  new ear pods, the camera higher resolution, reportedly better.  As the  phone even now of course, some reviewers out there and analysts that I've  spoken with Diane, saying that as far as the camera goes and processing  speed, they're just now catching up to some of the rivals out there.  But  of course, as you can see, still plenty of Apple fans out here braving the  early morning, though we must say pretty mild here in New York City.  Back  to you.  </p><p>MACEDO:  All right.  That's Robert Gray live at the Apple store.   Thanks, Robert.</p><p>GRAY:  You're welcome.</p><p>MACEDO:  Meanwhile, E.U. anti-trust regulators have cleared universal  music group to buy British record company EMI as recorded music unit for  $1.9 billion after the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's  most valuable record labels.  Universal says, the assets to be sold amounts  to 30 percent of EMI's global sales.  Citigroup is selling EMI having  acquired the music group when buy-out firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans  owed to the investment bank.  </p><p>Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., futures have been in the  green across the board all morning.  Dow futures are up by about 40 points.   The S&amp;P is up by almost four.  The NASDAQ is up by seven.  </p><p>In Europe, the Financial Times reports European Union authorities are  working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and  unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.  Markets are currently  mixed.  London was green earlier, now we're seeing it in the red down by  almost nine points.  Paris and Frankfurt still in the green.  </p><p>Let's take a closer look at what's moving those markets with Josh  Raymond now, chief market strategist at City Index in London.  Now, Josh,  the FT is reporting that Spain is moving closer to a bailout.  Should  investors read that as a negative or should they find some release in  having some more certainty on that front? </p><p>JOSH RAYMOND, CITY INDEX CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  I think it is a  positive.  And it does provide some certainty.  You know, the markets --  investors have been fairly convinced that more is required.  There has been  political maneuvering going on with Spain saying that they've got austerity  measures in there.  They don't require the fully -- bailout.  But we  already know that they're actually in talks, so we have that -- a few  people of the Spanish government actually recently earlier on this week  say, it will provide a level of certainty.  And I think that would be  reacted positively by the market.  Of course, it depends on the scale which  the (INAUDIBLE) will require, I mean, the ECB through monetary transactions  have an unlimited scope to do so as well.  </p><p>MACEDO:  And Josh, Mario Monti is holding meetings in Italy with  several leaders today.  What do you expect to come out of them? </p><p>RAYMOND:  Not much unfortunately.  And we're getting used to all these  meetings taking place and strong rhetoric talking about a fiscal union,  stronger banking regulations, that sort of thing but nothing really comes  of it.  And I think investors are a little bit more wiser to that these  days.  Now, we already have the ECB.  And the main focus for us at the  moment really is the ECB and Spain.  Now, we've obviously got the -- from  the ECB and we're waiting for Spain to confirm or to agree that the terms  towards that fully first bailout.  Those are the key things that we're  looking at.  </p><p>MACEDO:  OK.  More brain storming for the many results.  We'll see if  it comes out that way.  Thanks, Josh.  That's Josh Raymond from London.</p><p>K.B. Home meanwhile is reporting a surprise profit this morning.  The  home builder says it made four cents a share in its third quarter.  The  company was expected to lose 16 cents a share but revenue came in light at  $424.5 million.  The estimate was for 430 million.  K.B. Home says, it's  order backlog at the end of August rose 18 percent from a year ago to more  than 3,100 and home deliveries rose seven percent to more than 1,700.  </p><p>Here's a quick look at commodities.  Oil and gold are both to the  upside.  </p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business.  </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Well, it's going to be a great show.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Great show.  Great day in New York today.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yep.</p><p>IMUS:  Last day of summer.  Going to be 73 degrees.  Let's do some  sunbathing, baby.  </p><p>So, anyway, coming up this morning, Juan Williams, FOX News, and the  great Vince Gill.  Now, Vince -- when I say great, I mean great.  He's not  going to sing.  He's coming in to talk.  Now, why would you book somebody  like Vince Gill just to talk?  Because he's worth talking to.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's it.</p><p>IMUS:  There's a few of these guys, people who I would talk to.  It  would be him -- who are worth talking to.  Dwight Yoakam.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  Smart guy, Yoakam.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Uh-huh!</p><p>IMUS:  Crazy but good crazy.  Delbert, smart guy, funny.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Of course.</p><p>IMUS:  Kinky.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, not many more, right? </p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER:  Billy Ray? </p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM PRODUCER:  He's one of the nicest guys too, Dwight  Yoakam.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Oh, yes.</p><p>IMUS:  He is, isn't he?  </p><p>RUFINO:  Yes, he's really nice guy.  </p><p>IMUS:  You know the day I got fired, he called me on my cell phone.   I was on my way to meet the team.  And I was in the car.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  </p><p>IMUS:  He's a good man.  He understood what the deal was.  And so,  you know.  You can't say stuff like that, man.  Don't pick on people.  Just  don't do it, whether you're trying to be funny or not.  Come on.  </p><p>Anyway, and so, and then the big dog's here, Bill Clinton.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, good.</p><p>IMUS:  He's concerned about this book that Monica Lewinsky is going  to do.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I like that.</p><p>IMUS:  About them sex positions.  And then, Warner? </p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  You and Gunz.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, sir.</p><p>IMUS:  You skunks.  And Steve Mariucci, the pregame show on the NFL  Network, there are two reasons to watch that.  Other than that.</p><p>RUFINO:  Yes, good bye.</p><p>IMUS:  They suck, Rich Eisen, sucks.  Steve Mariucci, sucks.  Deion  Sanders, moron, Michael Irving moron, and that other guy, moron.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Moron.</p><p>IMUS:  Every one of them picked the Carolina Panthers.  What  happened?  The New York Giants put a butt whipping on them.  </p><p>WOLF:  Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS:  Thirty six-seven.  Come on.  </p><p>RUFINO:  Pussy riot, come on!</p><p>IMUS:  Start the pussy riot.  </p><p>WOLF:  That's right.  Come on.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, man!  Eli got the ball, what did he do?  He marched down  the field and scored a touchdown.  Every time he got the ball.  Come on!</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  And the reserves, man, those guys, the regulars better  look over their shoulders.  Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, you and the ice cream cone on the forehead, Gunzelman --</p><p>RUFINO:  Oh, wow!</p><p>WOLF:  Oh, God!</p><p>IMUS: -- should have anticipated this.  </p><p>(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p>I mean, this was an outrage.  </p><p>WOLF:  That's right.  </p><p>RUFINO:  Enjoy that ice cream.</p><p>IMUS:  I will never listen to -- and you're right, Warner, about  these pregame shows.  These people don't know anything.  </p><p>WOLF:  No, waste of time.  </p><p>IMUS:  That's total waste of time.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p>RUFINO:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Honeymoon is over.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Welcome.</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  We're going to do the news now.  Bernard.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yo, chief.  </p><p>IMUS:  Or Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Any of you.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Anybody.  </p><p>IMUS:  The Libyan attack on the embassy.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  </p><p>IMUS:  The administration initially, the President and the Secretary  of State characterized this as a direct result of this YouTube movie,  right? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Susan Rice all over the Sunday shows, she did a tour.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  U.N. ambassador.  Yep.</p><p>IMUS:  Now, is there any evidence -- and how are they describing it  now, the administration? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  That there is evidence that the guy who was released from  Guantanamo Bay in 2007 was behind -- an al-Qaeda guy was behind the attack  on the embassy in Libya.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  So, is the President willing to use the word terrorist and  describe this as a terrorist attack? </p><p>MCSHANE:  Not personally.  Jay Carney used that word yesterday but the  President did not when he was asked about it in the forum in Florida.  </p><p>IMUS:  Has he ever used the word terrorist? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Good question.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  Now, so my question is this then, did they have evidence  that -- did they know better that it was the result of the movie?  Or of  course, not so coincidently falling on September 11th.  Did they not know  that or did they lie about it or did they just assume -- you would think  with our intelligence apparatus they would know better.  But then, we've  had other bunch of other screw ups.  So what happened here?  In other  words, did they lie?  Did they know?  Did they not have the information?   What? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  They jumped to conclusions.  If they didn't know, they  should have said they didn't know instead of proclaiming definitively that  it was a direct result of the movie.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  They should not have proclaimed that.  They should have  said let's wait and see.  They didn't.  Again, and they still harp on the  movie as though -- and they're conflating two things.  The movie, the  terrorists used the movie perhaps as a cover to get the morons to come out  and cause a riot so that they could use that as cover to go in.  But in  either case, they were misleading, was the administration.  They obviously  don't want it to look like -- they want to say GM is alive and bin Laden is  dead, and that's it.  They can't say that anymore.  And that's why they're,  you know.  </p><p>IMUS:  I know you can't see it, but do you like my new hat? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, that's bad.  That's a bad as Johnny Cash.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Look out now.  </p><p>IMUS:  Do you know who did this?  Stuart Dunlap, Men's hat shop,  Albuquerque.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Nobody but him.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Did he?</p><p>IMUS:  He did in San Antonio.</p><p>WOLF:  That's the Rango Kidd  hat.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, man, that guy is -- come on.  All right.  Let's do the  news.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.</p><p>IMUS:  You're a disgrace, Warner.  Don't you be yucking it up over  there.  This is unbelievable.  The country singer Josh Turner is  downstairs.  That boy is pretty good.  He's on FOX and Fiends.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  I guess people, there's an 80-plus demographic by records,  right?  Here's Connell with the news.  Good morning, Connell.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Good morning, I-man.  Protesters are actually in the streets  today in Pakistan.  They won't be able to use their cell phones.  Though,  the government there is blocking cell service, major cities, so the phones  can't be used to detonate bombs.  It's a national day of protest against  that movie we were talking about, the anti-Muslim film produced here in the  United States.  The surge in Afghanistan meantime is over according to the  Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta who says in his view it worked.  </p><p>The 33,000 additional troops sent to Afghanistan a couple of years  ago now pulled out of the country.  The latest Gallup daily tracking poll  has the race for the White House a dead heat.  Forty seven percent a piece.</p><p>IMUS:  I'll be darned.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Mitt Romney and President Obama.  But Romney is still  hurting in some of these key swing states.  \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC  numbers, Obama is up eight points in Ohio.  Leading by five both in  Wisconsin and Colorado.  </p><p>IMUS:  You know, we are at a state in this country where this is the  best we can do?  A suit dummy and the president? </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's the choice you have.  </p><p>IMUS:  I mean, I know a bunch of smart guys.  So, do you?  I mean, we  all do.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  You mean like business leaders and that type of  thing and --   </p><p>IMUS:  Really smart people.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  Can't get them to run.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, I was going to say, it's hard to get people to run.   Absolutely.  </p><p>IMUS:  I don't know.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Be vetted and everything else.  </p><p>IMUS:  Twelve minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  Juan Williams, Vince Gill.  Neil Cavuto.  That's a pretty good  lineup.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, it is.  Connell continues.</p><p>IMUS:  We got some comments from Ann Romney here in a second but  first, the campaign has turned to comments not by either Romney but by the  President saying yesterday, \"Washington cannot be changed from the inside.\"   Big things, he says, get done when people pressure politicians from the  outside.  So, Romney was all over that saying that Obama's thrown in the  white flag of surrender on the economy.  Now, here's Ann Romney.  She was  on a radio show in Iowa asking Republicans to stop attacking her husband.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY:  What do you say to your fellow  Republicans?  Sure.  Stop it.  This is hard.  You want to try it, get in  the ring.  This is hard.  It's an important thing that we're doing right  now, and it's an important election.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  Today, the President -- </p><p>IMUS:  Her husband is a moron.  He'll do better than this guy.  Having  said all that -- I mean, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.  Those  of you who know me know I probably don't.  But I'm going to vote for him.   And I'm going to tell you that the day he gets elected, the economy is  better.  He doesn't have to do anything.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  You just think confidence is going to improve? </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's one of the argument he made in that video that came  out.  Romney will be in Nevada today.  Obama campaigning in Virginia.  Some  American airliners frequent fliers worried after hearing about the  company's intentions to lay off thousands of workers and then reduce  flights.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN:  I'm pretty loyal to them.  Because I do travel  and get my miles with them.  I have really not had too many problems.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Had a number of flights, so they've been canceled this  week, American announcing more than 1,000 employees could lose their jobs.   They're going through bankruptcy reorganization.  </p><p>And Fast and Furious, lawmakers analyzing this new report that's come  in on the botch, ATF gun walking operation, it's a report from the  inspector general from the Justice Department.  They found the Attorney  General Eric Holder was not aware of the operation until it came out in the  media and other places.  Here's California republican Congressman Darrell  Issa says the report the raises an important question.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA:  There is clearly a question not  of did he know, because he said he didn't know.  The question is why in the  world did key lieutenants keep it from him and of course why is that  something that we should -- </p><p>(SCREAMING SHUT UP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>IMUS:  Sounds like a car alarm going off.  Did the guy invented those  Bernie or Connell?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Please step away from the  car.  That's his --</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  Please step away from the car.  Please step away from  your mouth.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh my God!</p><p>IMUS:  Sick of hearing about this.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  Enough is enough.</p><p>IMUS:  Come on.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well --  </p><p>IMUS:  Let's just get the problems of this country solved.  Bernard  McGuirk is going to be a guest on O'Reilly tonight at 8 p.m. on the FOX  News Channel.  Bernard McGuirk and Greg Gutfeld in a segment called what  the hell just happened or something.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Something like that.</p><p>IMUS:  And it's good and they're good.  A quarter after the hour.   Let's do some business news.  Here with that is Dagen McDowell.  Good  morning, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, sir.  Yesterday, the Dow was up a paltry  almost 19 points and the futures are higher this morning.  And OK, all  these ding-a-lings are lined up for the new iPhone 5.  It goes on sale this  morning at 8 a.m. Local Time in stores in nine countries.  I'm sure it's  going to have record sales.  But here's what we care about even more than  that, that Apple has fallen flat on its face with this new mapping software  that it released.  It's on this new phone.  It's also in the new software,  the IOS-6.  It replaced Google maps, kicked Google maps off the phone, and  it's a disaster.  It sucks.  That's how bad it is.  Basically like  businesses wind up in the middle of rivers.  </p><p>IMUS:  So, I told Dagen I used map quest.  She said, that's so 90's.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Map quest.  </p><p>IMUS:  I said, well, the place I'm going hasn't moved.  They'll tell  you how to get there.  What the hell do I care? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You could do so much better than that.  That's the issue.   You could do so much better than that.  It's like saying I've got like a  Xerox typewriter, like, you know, IBM Selectric or something like that  before I curse.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Like what?  What's better? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  No, all this.</p><p>IMUS:  What's the matter?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Google maps is better.  Google maps is far and above  better than map quest, and particularly this new Apple.  </p><p>IMUS:  Old weird Dave Patterson from Texas, he just updated my iPhone  iOS 6 last night.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you lost your Google maps and if you want to look  for the Hoover dam on the 3D imaging, on this Apple mapping software, it  looks like a -- roller coaster.  That's how lousy it is.  </p><p>IMUS:  I know where the Hoover dam is.  Right outside of Las Vegas.   Let's go look at it.  Come on, dude.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can't do it on that Apple mapping -- </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, come on.  Get a life.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Don't we love when some giant, the biggest company in the  world screws up? </p><p>IMUS:  First of all, all you ever care about is a bunch of red-neck  goobers driving around in a circle and who knows where they're going to  race this weekend, the NASCAR dopes.  Where is the race? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, in New Hampshire actually.  </p><p>IMUS:  That's pretty good track, so.  So, they don't need a map.  I  tell you what they do need.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's right.</p><p>IMUS:  They need a clue.  All right.  Eighteen after the hour here on  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Have you done sports yet, Warner? </p><p>WOLF:  No.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  Don't wear me out but here's Warner with sports.  Go  ahead.  </p><p>WOLF:  All right, I-man.  Thursday night football in Charlotte, now  the Giants even with four offensive injuries beat the Panthers 36 to seven.   Just like Gunzelman and myself called it.  Backup running back Andre Brown  playing for the injured Ahmad Bradshaw, 113 yards and 20 carries and two  touchdowns.  </p><p>And then reserved wide receiver Ramses Barden playing in place of a  Hakeem Nicks caught nine passes for 138 yards.  Eli 27 for 35, 288 yards, a  touchdown, no interceptions.  And Lawrence Tynes kicked five field goals.  </p><p>IMUS:  Wow!</p><p>WOLF:  Now, here was Cam Newton who, by the way, I don't know if you  saw this, after he scored a touchdown to make it cut it to 23 to seven, he  went into his superman celebration.  Pretty good timing for that.  So, here  was Newton only 16 for 30 intercepted three times and ran the ball six  times for only six yards.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAM NEWTON, CAROLINA PANTHERS:  Who wants to support something that  puts on a performance of embarrassment.  That's what that was tonight.  If  I was a fan of the Carolina Panthers, I would be holding my head down and  ashamed of the product that was out there today.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  He was awful.  </p><p>IMUS:  Stop your stupid end zone celebrations, OK?  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  How about that?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  What a dope.  </p><p>RUFINO:  You have been killed.</p><p>IMUS:  You have been murdered.</p><p>RUFINO:  Why do that? </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, man!</p><p>WOLF:  Yankees beat the Jays 10-seven, sweep the series.  Ichiro by  the way, a homerun and a double, he's not nine for his last 12.  </p><p>IMUS:  That guy is crazy.  </p><p>WOLF:  Oh, man!</p><p>IMUS:  On fire?</p><p>WOLF:  On fire.  So, Yankees lead the Orioles by one with 13 to play.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.</p><p>WOLF:  And this is embarrassing, I-man.  </p><p>IMUS:  What?</p><p>WOLF:  At City Field, the Phillies scored eight in the first, seven  in the ninth and beat the Mets 16 to one.  Here was Met Manager Terry  Collins was asked after the game -- </p><p>RUFINO:  There was nobody there.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  That's right.</p><p>WOLF:  They were addressing these empty seats.  Here was Mets manager  Terry Collins asked after the game if he was embarrassed.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TERRY COLLINS, METS MANAGER:  I am.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  Does his team quit?  </p><p>COLLINS:  You'll have to ask them.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  What do you think?</p><p>COLLINS:  You'll have to ask them.  I have my own opinion.  I'm not  going to express it publicly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF:  That's horrible.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, man.  They got to get rid of him.  All right.  Twenty  minutes after the hour.  Do you have anything else, Warner? </p><p>WOLF:  Well, real quick.  Tiger Woods and Justin Rose share the lead  of that FedEx cup playoff.  Roy McElroy is three back.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Coming up on 21 after the hour here on the IMUS IN  THE MORNING program.  Juan Williams, Vince Gill, Neil Cavuto, Bill Clinton,  and Tony Robbins are all coming up.  Bernie's got a briefing too.  What's  there, B? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  That's a more fiery Obama versus Romney.  Jimmy Fallon bust  on the President.  And Tim Tebow tells the world what kind of woman he  wants.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right, baby.  What kind of woman do you want?  So, Dwight  Yoakam's new album is called \"Three Pears.\"  There's not a bad cut on it.   It's the number-two country album on I-tunes.  Dwight Yoakam, number two,  come on here.  It's a great record.  Here's one of the better songs on it.   </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS:  Well, Lindamood-Bell teaches children and adults to read words  and comprehend language.

You ought to take  some aspirin.  I mean, you do that, by the way.  </p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN:  What should the answer be? </p><p>IMUS:  Nothing.  It's just venting.  It doesn't require an answer,  doesn't require a suggestion.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  It doesn't require a comment.

And Tuf Cooper, he's a current world champion, he's at 98,000.   The great Cody O.  Now that Joe doesn't rope anymore, he's my favorite  roper.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  Wyatt too.  He's third at 96,000.  And Hunter Herrin, Cory  Solomon, Shane Hanchey, Clint Robinson, Houston Hutko , the great Fred  Whitfield, African-American -- one of the great ropers ever, eight-time  world champion.  And on and on.  Blare Burke, 15th place.  So, that's where  we are.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  </p><p>IMUS:  If we were going to go to -- Vegas and have it today, those  are the 15 guys who would be roping.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  Time for a Bernie briefing at 29 after the hour.  And here  with that is Bernard McGuirk, good morning, B.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Good morning, chief.  And President Obama sat down with this  Univision people yesterday, the Spanish language TV station, and if he  thought he was going to get questions like what's your favorite salsa  music, or do you like J-Lo or stuff like that, he was in for a big  surprise.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh-oh.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  The dude hit him hard, this Jorge Ramos.  He was like the  Spanish inquisition.</p><p>IMUS:  He's a good reporter.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Very good reporter.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes, he is.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, it was like the Spanish inquisition.  For a little  while, anyway, he asked him about changing things in government.  And he  gave a bad answer.  And then Mitt Romney jumped on it, as Connell alluded  to earlier.  Here's Obama first and then Mitt Romney right afterwards.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES:  I've learned some lessons  over the last four years.  And the most important lesson I've learned is  that you can't change Washington from the inside.  You can only change it  from the outside.  That's how I got elected.  And that's how the big  accomplishments like health care got done.  </p><p>FMR. GOV. MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The President  today threw in the white flag of surrender again.  He said he can't change  Washington from inside.  He can only change it from outside.  Well, we're  going to give him that chance in November.  He's going outside.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  About as animated and funny as Mitt Romney will get, but it  wasn't that bad.  And the New York Giants, of course on a tear.  Right,  boss?  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Who cares?  Tim Tebow, he's on the cover of \"Vogue\"  magazine, he's on the cover of \"The New York Post\" this morning.</p><p>IMUS:  Sure.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Putting his physique on display there.  And I'm sure that's  going to rile up all the Giants this morning.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  But of course, he's a devout Christian and he tells -- </p><p>IMUS:  Praise God.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, exactly right.  He tells \"Vogue\" magazine what he looks  for in a woman.  And here's his quote.  I've been blessed to have an  amazing mom and two amazing sisters, so they set a very high standard.   I'll stop right there.  What I think of -- when I think of a woman, I don't  think of my mom and -- God bless them.  God rest them, I should say.  But  anyway, he goes on and that's what makes him a good guy apparently,  obviously.  </p><p>Obviously looks play a big part.  Looks play a big part.  Being  attracted to someone plays a big part but there is also much more than  that.  To me, it is about finding someone who is sweet and kind and that  has a servant's heart.  It's about finding a girl who likes me for me.  And  not because of what I do or who I am or the name.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, tasty rat covering that servant's heart.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yep.  He did add that she's got to have a booty that's high  and tight.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>If it ain't tight, it ain't right.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Bu so, you know, the boy's got some feeling.  </p><p>IMUS:  There has got to be -- </p><p>RUFINO:  Can see him saying that.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, somebody else to talk about.  </p><p>RUFINO:  He's got to have a booty.  </p><p>IMUS:  He seems like a nice guy.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  People can't get enough of -- the front page of \"The New  York Post.\"</p><p>IMUS:  OK.  I like him -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Don't be a hater now, chief.  </p><p>IMUS:  I'm not a hater at all, quite the contrary.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  All right.  Well, I can conclude on that because Juan  Williams is in the bull pen.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  Don't you have something else? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  I do.  Jimmy Fallon, take a listen to him busting on the  President I think from last night.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY FALLON, HOST, \"LATE NIGHT\":  Here's an election news, during a  fund-raiser with Jay-Z last night, President Obama said that he and the  rapper have a lot in common because their wives are more popular than they  are.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Well, Jay-Z said, they have a lot in common because neither one of  them have a plan to fix the economy.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Jimmy Fallon, that's funny, right?

The repair firm I-fix  got its hands on one and pried it open to find the device uses chips from  Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solutions.  The iPhone also  includes an audio chip made by Cirrus, Logic and its Gyroscope which is  used to track its orientation was made by STmicroelectronics.  So, keep an  eye on stocks of those companies and those who didn't make the iPhone 5 to  see their reaction today.  </p><p>Shares of Oracle were up slightly in extended trading after first  quarter results revealed while the company's traditional software business  improved, hardware system sales continue to be a problem.  Oracle's  earnings were up 11 percent from a year ago to 53 cents a share.  In line  with estimates, revenue of $8.2 billion fell short of the $8.42 billion  estimate.  The computer hardware segment fell for a sixth straight quarter.  </p><p>Here's a look at commodities.  Oil and gold are up.  </p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues after we check the weather now with FOX  5 meteorologist Mike Woods.  </p><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST:  Good morning, everyone.  Looks like  we have some wet weather out there but not a ton of it for the country  here.  We've got low pressure still rotating up around the Great Lakes but  it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwestern states, the Northern Plains  States all the way down to the Central Mississippi valley area.  And then  back up towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east.  Also a few  showers are popping up down around Florida.  </p><p>Again, southeast slightly risky in terms of showers and storms.   Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms, high temp today, 88 degrees.   Phoenix, no rain for you.  Sunny skies with a high of 103.  Seattle partly  cloudy skies with a high of 63.  Sacramento, California, we've got some  sunny skies there today with a high of 91, still warm.  I'm Mike Woods from  FOX 5 in New York.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Twenty one until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE  MORNING program.  I lost my phone and I can't call it because I keep it on  -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Vibrate or whatever.  </p><p>IMUS:  Whatever.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  </p><p>IMUS:  I have no idea where it is.  I thought I gave it to Carley,  but it could be anywhere.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program -- </p><p>RUFINO:  I'm still getting him.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, you're still getting him.</p><p>RUFINO:  Yes -- that little phony shoe thing.  </p><p>IMUS:  Vince Gill is coming up this morning, talk to him about some  stuff, the state of country music and the state of Vince Gill.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's it.</p><p>IMUS:  And then Neil Cavuto, he's going to be in.  We'll talk to him  about the state of the country, the economy and all that.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, there's big Romney interview.</p><p>IMUS:  Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, FOX  News contributor Juan Williams.  Good morning, Mr. Williams.  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR (on the phone):  Good morning, Mr.  Imus.  I was worried for a second you forgot about me.  You didn't know my  name?  What is this?  What's going on over there? </p><p>IMUS:  I'm thinking about two or three different things.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  You know, what?  You're thinking about beautiful women or  something.  I guess that's on your mind all the time.  </p><p>IMUS:  Trying to find my phone.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  (LAUGHING)</p><p>IMUS:  You know what I'm reading, which is terrific is O'Reilly's  \"Killing Kennedy.\"  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Did you read \"Killing Lincoln\"? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I did.  </p><p>IMUS:  And? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I liked it.  You know, he gave me a copy early on, and I  gave one to my son because I liked it so much.  And I told him, you know,  he can be reluctant even to accept praise, but yes, I thought it was pretty  good.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  I wasn't a big fan of that.  I didn't read it all  because \"Killing Kennedy,\" you know, I was talking about it -- do you mind  talking about this or no? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.  Why would I mind talking about it? </p><p>IMUS:  Well, I don't know.  The difference is between, say, Walter  Isaacson, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Doug Brinkley, and those people.  They tell  you about, you know, in the story they tell you about the Cuban missile  crisis.  So, they write about Khrushchev, O'Reilly does.  And he describes  him as 5'3,\" about 200 pounds, got a big old mole, gap in his teeth,  murdering little bastard.  But if it is Doris and all those other people,  you've got 43 pages about where he grew up, his sister, his brother, his  parent, I mean, stuff that maybe I want to know.  But here's -- do you  believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin of Jack Kennedy? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think he was the lone assassin if you're asking who  pulled the trigger, yes, I do.  If you're asking were there other people  involved who may have been backing Oswald, funding Oswald, you know, did  Jack Ruby have any role to play there, I'm very suspicious of that.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, here's what they're trying to do in the book which  doesn't annoy me, but is they're trying to set Oswald up -- he describes on  page 15, does O'Reilly, Oswald as a crack shot.  Well, I was in the Marine  Corps at the same time Oswald was.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Sure.</p><p>IMUS:  I was in from '57 to '59 on a two-year reserve program.  Two  years active duty and then reserve.  He was in from '56 to '59.  So, I  qualified for the rifle -- in the same program as he did.  And I barely  qualified as a marksman.  Then, there are three categories, marksman,  sharpshooter and expert.  So, O'Reilly describes Oswald as a sharpshooter.   But in May of 1956, he qualified, did Oswald, barely two points into being  designated a sharpshooter.  In other words, two fewer points and he would  have been a marksman, the lowest category.  And then -- pardon me?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hang on.  Hang on.  But wait a minute.  The idea is he was  a trained shooter, Imus.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I mean, so, OK, you can get into your gradations of how  skilled he was.  But I think Bill's point was this guy didn't just pick up  a gun and he was, you know, some schlock who was trying out.  I mean, he  had been trained in how to fire and he had been qualified, I think that  makes some compared to me for example who's never fired a gun.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  But don't sell him to me as a crack shot, which he was  not.  Because when he tried to assassinate General Walker, he missed him.   He was 40 feet from him.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I love your point.</p><p>IMUS:  And then he qualified again in 1959 just before he got out.   And he qualified barely with a score of 191 as a marksman, the lowest  designation.  Two fewer points and he would not have qualified.  So my only  point is yes, he could shoot a rifle better than some bozo on the street.   But don't try to sell him to me as being this expert crack shot, because he  wasn't.  So, that's it.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.  You may know too much on this count.  But anyway,  your point is well taken.  Especially -- but I think that the larger point  is to the reader that this is a guy who was trained in how to shoot.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And as you point out, not only qualified once but  qualified twice is the other way to interpret the exact same events that  you just said make you doubt, you know, how good -- he was.  </p><p>IMUS:  Only an idiot like me would get bogged down in the minutia of  that.  All right.  About the president, about Romney.  Let me see if you're  guy --  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Do you really want to talk about that?  Doesn't sound like  it?  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, talk about what? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  American presidential politics.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, I don't mind.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I know Romney is not doing so well and I figured you're  going to be depressed and upset about it.  </p><p>IMUS:  I don't care.  My job is to monitor the freak parade.  And he's  in it.  Anyway, now has the President and the Secretary of State and the  national security advisor and these other people, Susan Rice and the rest  of them, have they decided now what the attack in Libya was?  They first  tried to sell it that it was the result of this YouTube movie, which every  fool on the planet knew that wasn't the case, particularly falling on  September 11.  And now when the president is reluctant to use the word  \"terrorist,\" I don't know if I've ever heard him utter that word, now  they're acknowledging that it was a terrorist attack.  So my question for  you is, were they initially lying, one?  Or did they not know, two?  Or,  three, were they just assuming or guessing?  Or, four, were they waiting  until they got more information and thought they would throw up a smoke  screen to try to hoodwink us? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, I think that there was a strong sense that this was  terrorism.  But again, you know, they don't have a sense of Libya and I  think the intelligence background necessary to lay things out.  But if  you're asking about whether or not they were reluctant to call terrorism  what it is, I don't think there is any question.  This has been a problem  throughout the administration.  You know, they talk about manmade disasters  instead of terrorism.  </p><p>I mean, but that has to do with a mind-set that, you know, again,  caution about attacking people, especially Muslims and reluctance to  embrace the idea that it's terrorism because somehow that would take us  back to the Bush years of the war on terror and they don't want to do that.   But that has been the mind-set with this folks from the start, I-man.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  Who's the National Security advisor? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  At the moment.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, no.  In October of 1922.  Yes, at the moment, Juan.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't know.  </p><p>IMUS:  You know, it's Keith Alexander.  Isn't that right, Bernie? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  That is correct.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  So, neither Bernie nor I had any idea who it was.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.  Well, I couldn't call the name.  You got me.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, wouldn't you think we could do better than that dope  empty suit Romney or your guy? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  You mean as Americans? </p><p>IMUS:  Somebody to run this country? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh, yes.  That's what I meant, as Americans.  Well, you  know, what?  We've got political structure.  And, you know, this is who's  been nominated.  And gosh, you know, if you look on the republican side,  they went through a lot of people to get here, and this was the decision  made.  Well, I tell you, you know, yesterday's comment by Ann Romney, you  know, stop questioning my husband.  Stop the doubts.  If you think you can  do better, get in the ring, I thought some level of frustration over on  that side.  </p><p>IMUS:  Are you a Christian? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I am.  </p><p>IMUS:  Are you ready to deal with Jesus maybe having a wife? </p><p>WILLIAMS:  You know, I never had any trouble with it.  In fact, you  know, there's all these questions about whether or not, in the last supper,  that drawing, you know, if that is a woman next to him.  It seems to me  inevitable.  I mean, all the talk about not just Mary Magdalene, but I  mean, you know, people that were described as prostitutes and outcasts and  the like, I think he was, you know, fully human.  Let me just say that, in  human form.  And I just think that part of being human is your sexuality.  </p><p>IMUS:  I got punked by Jesus the other day.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now this is interesting.  What happened to you? </p><p>IMUS:  Well, I tore my rotator cuff and then suddenly it stopped  hurting.  And I thought thank you, God!  Jesus!  And then it started  hurting again.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh no.  </p><p>IMUS:  So I got punked by Jesus.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, you know, you think you had some good times there for  a minute.  I mean, thank God you got some relief.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  Well, now I'm OK, so.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, well, I'm glad to hear that.  </p><p>IMUS:  Behave yourself, Mr. Williams.  I always love having you on.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I appreciate it.  I appreciate it.  And I'm going to just  burn Tom Donilon's name into my head again.  You know what I mean, I don't  know why I forgot that name.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  He is the national security advisor to the President.  The  director of the agency is the guy named General Keith Alexander.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  The NSA, right.</p><p>IMUS:  OK.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  OK.  </p><p>IMUS:  Thanks, you guys.  Eleven until the hour.  </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  IMUS IN THE MORNING.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo.  And it's time to  check the markets.

How about this one from Bob from Oak Ridge, in New  Jersey.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.</p><p>SHIMKUS:  Bob says, \"You need to have Heather Childers sit on a stool  with the red dress she had on this morning and your ratings will go through  the roof.\"  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Where was Heather?  Was she on the FOX News Channel? </p><p>SHIMKUS:  Yes.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.  </p><p>MACEDO:  Good morning everyone.  Apple fans around the world are lining up  to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves today,  including here in New York City where our own Robert Gray is standing by at  Apple's Fifth Avenue store.  Robert, describe the scene for us.  </p><p>ROBERT GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well Diane, you've got several  hundred people lined up outside of the Apple store, normally they're open  24 hours a day seven days a week.  They closed it last night just for the  event, opens at 8:00 a.m.</p><p>And Jared here is kind enough to join us and tell us why you've been  in line here all night long here just waiting to get in to buy the iPhone  instead of going this afternoon.  </p><p>JARED, APPLE CUSTOMER:  I mean, it's about being here for the opening.   You know it's about -- I made a couple friends in line.  It's about being  like the best Apple store in the country, you know.</p><p>It's a fun experience.  It's a fun event.  Everybody is having a good  time.  The line is starting to move so we're starting to get kind of  excited.  </p><p>GRAY:  Yes you've got about an hour to go now.  You've got your Willie  Wonka golden ticket here.  Are you pretty happy about that?  And also you  have to wait until 8 a.m. Local time.  You just moved here from Tucson.   Are you already ribbing your friends back home that you're going to have  yours first?  </p><p>JARED:  Yes I did.  I posted it on Facebook I've been kind of poking  at them.  I have a few friends that are like really Apple fanatics.  And  it's kind of a -- its kind of a fun jest.  So I'm getting them back you  know.</p><p>GRAY:  Is there any one particular thing about the iPhone 5 that is  drawing you to it aside from the fact that it's just the newest, the latest  and greatest?  </p><p>JARED:  I really like what they've done from the body.  The aluminum - - the aluminum body looks really sleek, it's going to be really nice.  And  the wider screen is -- you can't go wrong.  </p><p>GRAY:  And what about the connector?  We've heard a lot of flap about  this the new connector.  You're going to have to get all new devices and  you know the peripherals to go with it, like alarm clock, et cetera.  Is  that a problem for you?  </p><p>JARED:  It's not a problem.  I mean, you know people try to jab where  they can jab.  But it's going to be great.  I mean, iPhone, the connector  has always been proprietary.  It just they're better, they're making it  better.  They're improving.  When technology moves, you've got to move with  it.  And that's just -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GRAY:  All right.</p><p>JARED:  -- that's what you do.  </p><p>GRAY:  All right, Jared we've got to move too.  Diane so yes we'll be  following all day for you there.  The line is starting to move.  Several  hundred of folks as I mentioned lined up out here to pay anywhere from $200  up for the new iPhone.  Back to you.</p><p>MACEDO:  All right, that's Robert Gray making friends at the Apple  store.  Thanks Robert.</p><p>GRAY:  Sure.</p><p>MACEDO:  And we're getting earnings in from Darden restaurants now,  the parent company of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster is reporting a  profit of 85 cents a share just beating the estimate for 84 cents.  Revenue  came in at $2.03 billion.  And that was right in line with what we were  expecting.  </p><p>Now on the day of the iPhone release, Blackberry is reporting an  outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Blackberry  announced the issue and postings on Facebook and Twitter and says it is  urgently working to fix the problem.  </p><p>Checking markets this morning here in the U.S. futures are up across  the board, Dow futures are up by 30, the S&amp;P is up by about two, the NASDAQ  is up by five.  In Europe the Financial Times is reporting European Union  Authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a  bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the ECB.  Markets there are mixed  with London and Paris both down, Frankfurt holding on to green territory by  about six points.  </p><p>Let's take a closer look now at what's moving the markets with James  Hughes, senior market analyst at Alpari over in London.  James the Greek  government officials are holding another round of negotiations with  creditors in hopes of agreeing to almost 12 billion euros worth of  cutbacks.  How do you expect this to play out?  </p><p>JAMES HUGHES, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, ALPARI:  I mean, I think we  expect it to play out the same way that we've seen it's done in the past.   I mean there's been a lot of negativity around what (inaudible).  Greece  trying to renegotiate these plans and the issue we've had is that they --  that they have an initial plan, initial measures we're put in place that  Greece had to -- had to hit but the goal post has been moved so many times  now.  There always seems to be another renegotiation of -- of austerity or  cuts.  </p><p>And I mean we're hopeful of course that Greece is going to agree to  something.  And -- but I think whether they agree or not is not the key  point.  It's whether they stick to it which is the key point.  And that's  been an issue for this for a long time now.  </p><p>MACEDO:  All right that's James Hughes from Alpari in London.  Thanks  so much James.</p><p>HUGHES:  All right.</p><p>MACEDO:  Universal Music Group has won approval from EU antitrust  regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion after the  Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record  labels.

And I don't know who that other guy is.  Who is that  guy Lou?</p><p>WOLF:  Marshall Faulk.  </p><p>IMUS:  Marshall Faulk.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh yes Marshall Faulk.</p><p>IMUS:  Now they're all fine but they're dumb.  Every single of them  picked the Carolina Panthers -- everyone of them.  </p><p>This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING incidentally is sponsored by  \"The New York Times\" best-selling author, Mitch (inaudible) new book \"The  Timekeeper\" the dude has sold 30 million books.

And then Neil Cavuto I ran into Neil downstairs and I had my  little bottle of oxygen with me because I couldn't breathe.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I know.</p><p>IMUS:  So he was like terrified.  Why don't you go home?  Because I'm  a man, that's why I didn't go home.  </p><p>Time for the news now at eight minutes after the hour and here with  that is Connell McShane.  Good morning Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, good morning, I-Man.  </p><p>We'll start with the campaign.  President Obama pressed on some of the  failures in his first term, immigration and other things at a forum in  Florida hosted by the Spanish language station Univision.  The President  says he's learned a few things over the past four years.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You can't change  Washington from the inside.  You can only change it from the outside.   That's how I got elected.  And that's how the big accomplishments like  health care got done.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  I'm going to go to Robert Gray now.  Do you care?</p><p>MCSHANE:  No not really.  Was that you screaming by the way?</p><p>IMUS:  Yes do you have something else you want to say?  </p><p>RUFINO:  You have to ask.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Romney campaigning across Florida real quick.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  The President has already  thrown in the white flag of surrender.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Suit dummy.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's all I have.</p><p>IMUS:  All right, from Fox Business News, here's Robert Gray.  Good  morning, Mr. Gray.  </p><p>GRAY:  Hey, I-Man.  Good morning.  </p><p>IMUS:  Where are you?  </p><p>GRAY:  I'm out in front of the Apple store on Fifth Avenue, and 59th  Street, it's normally a 24/7 store here I-Man.  You may have gone in the  middle of the night but they actually closed it.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh they did?  </p><p>GRAY:  So that they could create.  Yes they wanted to manufacture a  line.  And as you know from back in the day, no one manufactures lines like  they do here in New York.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes I've actually been in that store a couple of times.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTLETT:  Really.</p><p>RUFINO:  I'll be darned.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Robert.  </p><p>RUFINO:  Say it, Robert.  I'll be darned.  </p><p>IMUS:  Do you have something to report, Robert?  </p><p>GRAY:  Absolutely.  </p><p>Yes, we're out here.  Look, there are several hundred people lined up  waiting for this new iPhone 5 to go on sale.  It's coming out 8 a.m. folks  will be rolling in.  And they could sell as many as -- as many as 10  million of these by the end of this month alone.  </p><p>IMUS:  Ok we'll it's a very fine report.  Thank you for that important  information, Robert.  </p><p>RUFINO:  What a loser parade.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Those idiots have been camped out there for five nights -- </p><p>GRAY:  Some of these guys have been out here all week.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Morons.</p><p>IMUS:  Big Foot.</p><p>TOM BOWMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Yes sir.</p><p>IMUS:  Have you lost your mind?  </p><p>BOWMAN:  What are you kidding?  This is a great story today.  </p><p>IMUS:  But -- </p><p>BOWMAN:  And you personalized it as always.  </p><p>IMUS:  Do we have a unique situation here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  We have wall-wall-commercials which is how we keep doing this,  which I'm happy that we do have.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  So we don't have an inordinate amount of time for Warner to go  on and on about Yogi Berra or somebody or Miller Huggins or -- and you know  I like Robert Gray.  But you go to Robert Gray with no information.  Well,  I'm standing outside the store.  Here we've got a few hundred people.  Ok  good, great.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Robert Gray all the way.</p><p>RUFINO:  Miller Huggins is waiting -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS:  I like Robert Gray.  He is a terrific reporter.  He's got a  nice sense of humor.  But he gave us zero information.  We know -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  That isn't fair.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Come on he talked about how many iPhones might be sold and  that kind of thing.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes why -- why would these idiots camp out and not wait  five, ten days and buy it in the store days later on?  </p><p>IMUS:  Who knows?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Exactly.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well maybe he knows.</p><p>IMUS:  Do you know why they do it Robert?  </p><p>GRAY:  Yes I do we've talked to several of these folks I-Man and some  of these guys are big tech fans.  And they wanted to be a part of the  experience here and the first to have it.  We just talked to a guy from  Tucson.  He wants to have it before his buddies.  He's posting it on  Facebook.  He's going to have the newest, latest and greatest.</p><p>MCSHANE:  There you go.</p><p>GRAY:  And these guys like to have the faster processor, bigger  screen.  Some of the other phones have already had that for six to nine  months so the iPhone is playing catch-up here.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right, there you go.</p><p>IMUS:  Robert Gray, the Fox Business Network.  Live outside the 59th  and Fifth at the Apple store.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Good report dude.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well done Robert.</p><p>IMUS:  12 minutes after the hour.  Please stop calling people dude,  Imus.  It's 12 after the hour.  Let's do a little new, more news.  And here  with that is Connell McShane.  Good morning Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, good morning I-Man.  Well, the campaign moves to  Nevada today where Mitt Romney will be campaigning, in Virginia where  President Obama will be holding a rally.  </p><p>IMUS:  You shut up.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Here are some numbers that are in, Obama leads the \"Wall  Street Journal\"/NBC News swing state poll.  He's up eight in Iowa, five in  Wisconsin and Colorado.  The Gallup Daily tracking poll though, dead heat,  47 percent a piece around the country for Mitt Romney and President Obama.  </p><p>There are protests today taking place in Pakistan.  In fact they've --  they've named it a national day of protests there over this anti-Muslim  movie that was produced here in the United States.  And the government in  Pakistan actually disabling cell phone service, some of their major cities  are trying to prevent phones from being used in detonating bombs.  </p><p>And then in Syria, President Bashar Assad talking tough, an Egyptian  magazine reporting that Assad predicts the defeat of the armed opposition  that foreign intervention like the one in Libya will not be repeated there,  he said.  This, as at least 30 are reported dead in the northern part of  the country.  Government airstrikes reportedly hit a gas station and caused  a huge explosion in Syria.  </p><p>Then the surge is over in Afghanistan.  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta  says the 33,000 additional troops that were sent a couple of years ago to  Afghanistan have now pulled out of the country.  He calls it a very  important milestone, says the surge accomplished its goals in Afghanistan.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Really.</p><p>MCSHANE:  And one other thing for you, I-Man.  The Emmys this Sunday  but Kelsey Grammar not a nominee.  Critics and fans of Grammar's stars show  \"Boss\" have agreed that he was snubbed when these Emmy nominations were  announced.  He recently suggested that his conservative political leanings  were the reason.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>KELSEY GRAMMER, ACTOR:  I did speculate about the fact that maybe I'm  a pretty well outed conservative in Hollywood and maybe there's some energy  there.  But you know I've since come to think that it hasn't gotten out  there enough.  I don't know.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  There you go.  Well, Kelsey Grammer thinks he was snubbed  there I-Man for the Emmys.  And those are your -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  No justice, no peace.</p><p>MCSHANE:  -- exactly, right, your headlines this morning.</p><p>IMUS:  All right, hey, Big Foot, load up Tony Robbins and Lady Gaga,  ok?  </p><p>BOWMAN:  Yes sir.</p><p>IMUS:  Let's do a business report now at 14 after the hour.  And here  with that, just ahead of Vince Gill and Bernie with a briefing and Warner  with sports is Dagen McDowell.  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, sir.  </p><p>Did you know that the new iPhone 5 goes on sale this morning at 8  a.m.?  Maybe we could take a live look at the Apple store here in midtown  Manhattan for the lines of people.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Don't be mean.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All those -- you know why those doofuses line up?  Because  they've got no woman at home and they've got to be one of the first of  their friends to get the new iPhone 5.  </p><p>IMUS:  They either don't have a woman at home or they've got a woman  at home like you. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Or the only woman at home is their mom.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, the I-Man.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what; no truer thing has ever been said.  </p><p>RUFINO:  I'll wait on this line for four days to get away from her.  </p><p>IMUS:  Let's go here.  </p><p>RUFINO:  Is that Jonas?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it's going to set records.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS:  Ok.  That big race in New Hampshire, Nascar this weekend?  All  right, second race with the chase or whatever</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I do have something though.  The iPhone sells like it does  because Blackberry stinks to high heaven.  And Blackberry service is  actually out today in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  So  there is justice in this world.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  A quarter after the hour.  Let's do some sports.   No, first let's go to Tony Robbins who has some thoughts about Lady Gaga.   Good morning, Mr. Robbins.  </p><p>POWELL:  Good morning, Imus.  Lady Gaga is having a physical crisis.   She recently put on a couple of pounds.  Who am I kidding?  I saw her in  concert with that big hat and those big glasses.  I thought she was Cee Lo  Green.  She's gone from doing well-choreographed routines to the electric  slide.  Apparently it's not as taxing.</p><p>Gaga claims that she gained weight eating delicious food at her  father's Italian restaurant in Manhattan.  That's a relief.  I'm glad she  wasn't eating her dresses.  A bacon muumuu has got to be like what --  50,000 calories.  Eating her clothes would certainly qualify as an  unhealthy relationship with food.</p><p>Gaga lives, breathes, sleeps and eats music.  She's passionate about  music and obviously.  I told her to combine her loves.  She took my advice  and started writing her sheet music on sheet cakes.  Share your music with  the world but share your cakes with friends.  That's the out of the box  statement that's made her a superstar.</p><p>Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the  visible.  Lady Gaga's goals to go from being an unknown artist to being  well, the biggest thing in music.  I'd say we've got that covered.  </p><p>IMUS:  Tony Robbins here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>All right.  Let's do sports at 16 minutes after the hour.  Just ahead  of Vince Gill later on this morning and Neil Cavuto.</p><p>Sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers.  Here with sports, best  sportscaster in the country, Warner Wolf.  Good morning Warner.</p><p>WOLF:  Thank you very much.  Good morning I-Man. Thursday night  football in Charlotte.  The Giants beat the Panthers, 36-7.  It was the  story of the backups.  Running back Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw  -- 113 yards, 20 carries, 2 touchdowns; and wide receiver Ramses Barden  playing in place of Hakeem Nicks, 9 receptions for 138 yards.  Eli, 288  yards, 1 touchdown, no interceptions; Lawrence Tynes kicks 5 field goals.</p><p>Cam Newton trailing 23-0 in the third quarter and obviously thinking a  touchdown was worth 23 points, scored on a 1-yard touchdown and then went  into his superman celebration.  Come on, Cam.</p><p>Baseball: Yankees beat the Jays -- </p><p>IMUS:  I tell Wyatt that all the time.  You put up an 8 in roping,  don't throw your hat.</p><p>WOLF:  Right.</p><p>IMUS:  Act like you've been there before.</p><p>WOLF:  That's right.  That's what Tom Landry said, right.</p><p>RUFINO:  What an idiot.</p><p>IMUS:  What a dope.</p><p>RUFINO:  Oh God.</p><p>WOLF:  Yanks sweep the Jays.  Ichiro, a home run, a double, he's 9  for his last 12.  </p><p>IMUS:  That guy is great.</p><p>WOLF:  Oh man.  He's on fire.</p><p>IMUS:  And apparently New York is -- well, come on dude.</p><p>WOLF:  Well, they lead by one.  Both have 13 to play. </p><p>And before a bogus announced crowd of 20,000 at City Field, the  Phillies scored 8 in the first, 9 -- 7 in the 9th and beat the Mets 16-1.   The Mets are only 4 in 25 at home since the all-star break.</p><p>IMUS:  Wow.</p><p>WOLF:  Boise state beat BYU, 7-6.  BYU scored a touchdown, three and  a half minutes left, went for the 2-point conversion and missed.  </p><p>Wait a minute.  Stop the music.</p><p>IMUS:  All right.</p><p>WOLF:  Finally there may be a long-awaited Floyd Mayweather-Manny  Pacquiao fight.</p><p>IMUS:  Wow.</p><p>WOLF:  Pacquiao who, by the way, has to fight Juan Manuel Marquez for  the fourth time -- </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, fourth time.</p><p>WOLF:  -- has agreed, number one, to give Mayweather -- </p><p>IMUS:  Want to have more time -- they're ruining marriages . </p><p>WOLF:  He's agreed to give Mayweather a 55-45 split, Mayweather  getting the 55 rather than the 50-50.</p><p>Number two, Pacquiao says he will agree to Mayweather's demand that  he take the Olympic-style drug test which includes the blood test.</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Yes, sure.</p><p>WOLF:  The only drawback is when the fight occurs Mayweather will be  36 and Pacquiao 34.</p><p>In golf, you have the top 30 golfers in the world at that FedEx Cup  playoff.  Tiger Woods and Justin Rose share the lead, 4 under 66.</p><p>And finally, I-Man, our old friend Jerry Jones agrees with Buccaneers  coach Greg Schiano that it's ok for a team to go for the ball when the  other team is kneeling down to run out the clock.  Jones says the kneel- down is a wasted play, should be outlawed.  And if a team doesn't run a  play, they should be penalized.  </p><p>IMUS:  We're trying to win.  When we're out there on the field, out  there -- we're trying to win.  And we're the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>We didn't win in Seattle, and that sucked.  So I went to the  (inaudible) bar.  What are you going to do?</p><p>It's 20 minutes after the hour.  Thank you very much, Warner.   There's a briefing coming up.  What's there, B?  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  President Obama grilled by this Spanish language TV station  host.</p><p>And another secret Paris Hilton tape revealed.  We have the tape.  </p><p>IMUS:  One of the great songs Vince Gill ever wrote or recorded.  It  was a huge hit for the boy.  It was a huge hit -- \"Pocket Full of Gold\",  about a guy, he's married and goes in the bar somewhere and he takes that  ring off his finger. </p><p>I do that when I go to the titty bar.  I have a pocket full of gold.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo.</p><p>And General Motors is recalling more than 426,000 ChevroletPontiac  and Saturn sedans in the U.S. due to a transmission problem.  The recall  affects vehicles from model years 2007 to 2010.  The auto maker says the  transmission gear position may not match the gear on the shift gear and  that causes vehicles to move when drivers think they're in park.  GM says  it's aware of four crashes due to the problem, but no injuries reported so  far.</p><p>Here's a look at futures now, we are seeing them up across the board;  Dow futures up by 38, the S&amp;P is up by 3 and the Nasdaq is up about 6.   Commodities are also to the upside.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Jesus had a ball and chain.  Jesus had a ball and chain.  You  know, they found this.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  This historian of early Christianity up there at Harvard  Divinity School, the girl found a scrap of march weed or whatever the hell  it was papyrus -- is that what we call it?</p><p>MCSHANE:  yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Written in the fourth century containing the phrase that we've  never seen in any piece of scripture and it's Jesus, and he said unto them,  \"My wife\".  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Whoa.  </p><p>IMUS:  What up, girl?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Wow.  </p><p>IMUS:  Anyway, so that that.  And man -- what's that, godfather?  </p><p>BARTLETT:  I need the Christ to come on over for coffee tonight.  </p><p>POWELL:  I wonder whose name she called out when they were making  love.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  No, no.</p><p>IMUS:  Anyway.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  28 after the hour; we'll talk to Vince Gill in a  couple of minutes.</p><p>First, this Bernie Briefing is sponsored by Ramsey Fiat, Route 17,  Upper Saddle River, New Jersey.  Go to RamseyFiat.com.  Here's Bernard  McGuirk.  What up, B.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, President Obama, boss, candidate Barack Obama back in  2008 promised in no uncertain terms that he would pass a comprehensive  immigration reform.  He had a Democratic Congress for two years.  In any  case he's on Univision yesterday and host, Jorge Ramos, again, the Spanish  inquisition.  He hammered the President on this and listen to the  President's answer.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JORGE RAMOS, HOST, UNIVISION:  A promise is a promise.  And with all  due respect you didn't keep that promise.  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Here is what I would  say Jorge, is that we've had this conversation before.  There's a thinking  that the President is somebody who is all powerful and can get everything  done.  In our branch-- in our system of government, I am the head of the  executive branch.  I'm not the head of the legislature.  I'm not the head  of the judiciary.  We have to have cooperation from all these sources in  order to get something done.  And so, I am happy to take responsibility for  the fact that we didn't get it done, but I didn't make a promise that I  would get everything done 100 percent when I was elected as president.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Of course not.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, we can.  No, we can't.  </p><p>IMUS:  Come on here.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Anyway, there's another secret tape scandal out here boss.   This time -- first it was Mitt Romney.

Won't text. Won't e-mail. So there's no way to stay in touch with him. I  mean, you can call him. But we were talking about Dwight Yoakam's new  record. So, I said, have you heard \"Waterfall\"? And Kinky said, I love it  to death. It's just -- all right. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network.  And now here's Diane Macedo. </p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>KB Home is reporting a surprise profit after two quarters of losses as home  prices recovered. The fifth largest home builder says it made 4 cents a  share in its third quarter. The company was expected to lose 16 cents a  share, but revenue came in a little light at $424.5 million. The estimate  was for $430 million. KB Home says potential future housing revenue rose to  a four year high and home deliveries climbed 7 percent from last year to  more than 1,700. Shares are higher in the pre-market. </p><p>More companies, meanwhile, are rewarding their shareholders with higher  quarterly dividends.

Really  that's what I am at heart. </p><p>GILL: Well, you're one of the last people on earth that love music. </p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: That's why I love coming seeing you. You know, when I got a new  record or something's exciting going on, because I know you'll get it and I  know you'll, you know, you'll enjoy it. </p><p>IMUS: I just got Dwight's new -- do you care if we talk about other  artists? </p><p>GILL: No, I don't.</p><p>IMUS: I just got his new record. It is fabulous. </p><p>GILL: Yes, I've heard. I haven't heard it yet, but I've heard people raving  about it. (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>IMUS: Got a song called \"Waterfall\" that's --</p><p>GILL: I heard a little bit of that. </p><p>IMUS: That's clever, isn't it?</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So -- and -- because Dwight, he's a man who, when he went out with  Sharon Stone, you know, she described him as a dirt sandwich. </p><p>GILL: About as much fun as a dirt sandwich. </p><p>IMUS: Hey, have you ever heard of the Christian rock group Striker. </p><p>GILL: Yes, I have. </p><p>IMUS: OK. This is a tedious story. Maybe it's not tedious. But when my  brother, God bless him, and -- was working with the railroad as a breakman,  his partner was Phil Sweet. </p><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: And Fred and Phil wrote a song called \"I Don't Want To Have To Marry  You\" when they were working for the railroad.</p><p>GILL: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And they eventually got it cut. And it went to number one and all  that stuff. And Phil married a woman named Janice. And he's a great guy.  They live in Las Vegas. And they had two sons, Michael and Robert, and they  are Striker. </p><p>GILL: Oh, I didn't know that. </p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: That's neat. </p><p>IMUS: And Christian rock, they are. </p><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: And then Michael spent the last -- the past two summers going out  singing lead for Boston. It's a small world, isn't it? </p><p>GILL: Yes, it is. You know, ever since I married Amy, everybody thinks I  know everything about Christian music, but I don't. I wish I did.</p><p>IMUS: Well, Amy Grant won a -- won the -- everybody in the country had a  crush on her when she was --</p><p>GILL: Oh, yes.</p><p>IMUS: I remember all -- I remember all these disc jockeys over at NBC years  ago. I met Frank Reed  -- I don't know if you remember his name or not --  he used to tell me -- he said, have you heard Amy Grant? And I said, no. He  said, oh, man, come on here. </p><p>So, what's new with you?</p><p>GILL: Not much. After I married Amy, I used to have to fight my way out of  the bars. Now I have to fight my way out of the churches being married to  her. </p><p>IMUS: Hey, you built a studio at home. </p><p>GILL: I did. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Isn't a studio now just pretty much your laptop or no?</p><p>GILL: Well, pretty much. I mean it can be. But I went a little further than  that. Not as big as a commercial studio, but enough to track. And it's  really fun because we all kind of gather around in a room and play music  together instead of sequester each other off in a booth somewhere where you  can't see each other and we're all just playing together. And it's been the  greatest experience, this new record, the \"Time Jumpers\" record, that -- I  started playing with this band about two and a half years ago. And they're  a western swing band.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: Me being from Oklahoma, I was crazy -- I've always been crazy for Bob  Wills music and that swing stuff and they would ask me to come in and  occasionally sit in and fill in and, you know, if a guitar player couldn't  make it, they'd call me up and sub. And little by little they grew  confidence in me and said, hey, you want to be in the band. A couple guys  quit. And I said, sure. It would be fun. So I talked them into making a  record at the house and we decided to put it out. I said, man, we could  make a record for nothing. It would be a blast. And so away we went. </p><p>IMUS: Talking with Vince Gill here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Weren't you originally in Pure Prairie League? </p><p>GILL: A long time ago. Yes, 33 years ago. </p><p>IMUS: And before that? </p><p>GILL: I played with a guy named Byron Berline. A really great fiddle  player. Lived in Los Angeles. Was a session player. Played on Rolling  Stones' records and Birds  records and all kind of great rock records and  was the go-to guy for fiddle out on the West Coast forever and ever and  ever. And he had an opening and I was 18 or 19. We moved out there as a kid  and started out there. </p><p>IMUS: You just played guitar for a long time, right? </p><p>GILL: Yes. Still do. </p><p>IMUS: No, I know you do. But, I mean, I guess you knew you could sing, but  nobody else did or did they? </p><p>GILL: Well, a lot of times those gigs I would get would be because I could  sing, too, you know, and in those days if you could find somebody that  could multi-task, I guess would be a good word for it, and do a bunch of  different stuff, you were a better asset to a band. And so I was always  able to play a little bit of everything and could fill in whatever was  needed. </p><p>IMUS: What's the state of country music in your view? </p><p>GILL: It's interesting. </p><p>IMUS: You like it or no? </p><p>GILL: I'm not crazy about it. But I'm not supposed to. I'm 55 years old and  I'm supposed to like, what, you know, my era did and the era before me. I  don't -- I don't dislike it, I just don't necessarily believe that it's --  it's -- the term country music fits it so much.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>GILL: But, you know, they're young kids and they're following their muse,  they're do what they love and I've got no -- I've got no bitterness towards  them at all. </p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm 72 and I be loving that \"Pontoon\" record by Little Big  Town. </p><p>GILL: Oh, isn't that cool? </p><p>IMUS: That's a good record, man. </p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I like Jason Aldean. Come on. </p><p>GILL: Yes, he's fun. </p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: You know, they're rocking, they're -- you know, they're kind of --  they're pretty -- pretty brash. They're, you know, party time and all that  stuff. That's just, you know, it's not for me. It's not that I don't like  it. </p><p>IMUS: Jamey Johnson, of course, he's --</p><p>GILL: Great songwriter.</p><p>IMUS: Speaking about being out where the buses don't run. So -- but he's  great, isn't he?</p><p>GILL: He is. </p><p>IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p>GILL: He's a great throwback, you know. </p><p>IMUS: How do you really think is great? </p><p>GILL: Oh, well, I like -- I -- actually, there's a lot of people I love. I  think Carrie Underwood sings her brains out. </p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>GILL: Yes. She's a great singer.</p><p>IMUS: I just can't take that screaming. </p><p>GILL: Well, she does -- she will sing hard, but that's -- you've got  understand, that's what people are -- that's what they're learning. That's  what they're singing.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: From \"Star Search\" and \"American Idol.\" All these shows. It's like  grandiose and the big finish and, you know, it's -- </p><p>IMUS: I listened to something the other day that -- a duet you did with  her. It's good.</p><p>GILL: Oh, the \"How Great Thou Art\" thing?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: That was nice. </p><p>IMUS: Are you really religious? I mean --</p><p>GILL: To some degree, I guess. Probably not to the level of probably what  the expectation is of me because I'm married to Amy. </p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: I feel like a novice, you know, because I haven't had a church life  in my adult life. I did as a kid, but my adult life was never conducive to  it, only because of my work. I was gone every weekend. </p><p>IMUS: But you believe Jesus is the Son of God? </p><p>GILL: I do. </p><p>IMUS: OK. And like Mojo Nixon says about Elvis, Elvis is everywhere. And I  believe Jesus is everywhere. I mean -- I also know, though, however, not  that anybody asked me, but I respect all other religions as well. I --</p><p>GILL: Me, too. </p><p>IMUS: See, I don't think there's just one way to get there. </p><p>GILL: Well, I've traveled the world enough to -- you know, it just seems --  it doesn't seem logical that other parts of the world would know this way.  You know, maybe I'm wrong. I have been before.</p><p>IMUS: And now  are you prepared for this new information that Jesus may  have had a wife. </p><p>GILL: I heard. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: My observation was, if -- wasn't it her job then to come up with a  (INAUDIBLE) -- just idiotic.</p><p>GILL: That explains the missing years.</p><p>IMUS: You know Billy Joe Shaver? </p><p>GILL: A little bit, yes. </p><p>IMUS: Yes. I think he's one of the great songwriters ever. </p><p>GILL: I do too. Yes. </p><p>IMUS: But there's somebody who is certifiably -- but a sweet man. My  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>GILL: Yes, that's my -- you know, that's really my era of the people I love  were guys like him, Guy Clark, Jerry Jeff and Rodney Crowell and just those  really great songwriters from the '60s and '70s, (INAUDIBLE) Van Zant and  Emmy Lou was a great, great mentor to me, and teaching me what great songs  were like and who great song writers were, so, yes. </p><p>IMUS: Bill Anderson, one of the great songwriters ever. </p><p>GILL: No question. Most recorded, probably, in the history of country  music.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. I love him.</p><p>GILL: Even more so than Harlan or any of the others. So, I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: God, wasn't he great, Harlan Howard. Oh, my God. Please.</p><p>GILL: Yes.  We were good buddies. You know, when I first moved to  Nashville, we were great friends and I  would sing all of his demos for  him, $10 a song. </p><p>IMUS: Really? </p><p>GILL: Yes. </p><p>IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p>GILL: There was tons of demos of Harlan's and we were great friends. </p><p>IMUS: Before he died, he sent me a CD that he cut of all of his songs. </p><p>GILL: Wow. </p><p>IMUS: That he had written. He just dubbed, you know, (INAUDIBLE). I mean,  just everything that he did. And, oh, my God, what a great song. </p><p>GILL: He's a great man. You know, when I was first getting started, he  pulled me aside and he said, kid, you're one hell of a guitar player. And I  said, well, thanks, Harlan. And he says, and you're a pretty good  songwriter, but you're one hell of a guitar player, one hell of a singer,  and a pretty good song writer. I said, I get what you're saying. </p><p>IMUS: So you have a new record? </p><p>GILL: Not me, the \"Time Jumpers.\"</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>GILL: This band does. It came out last week.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe I could pay attention.</p><p>GILL: No, that's cool. I mean it's a fun record. You would really love this  record if you like Bill Wills and that swing music. It's an 11 piece bad  full of arguably some of the best talent that's ever graced instruments in  Nashville, Tennessee. All side me. All guys that played for other people.  Session players, things like that. All wanted to have fun on Monday night.  So we got together and -- years ago, they did, and started playing every  Monday night just for the love of it and fun of it. And we still are. We  just made a record. </p><p>IMUS: I can take a little bit of Bob Wills, but it's my contention -- and I  know I'm right -- that nobody likes blue grass music, including the people  who play it. </p><p>GILL: I think you might get a wrestling match over that one. </p><p>IMUS: Oh, I'm sure I will. </p><p>It's great to see you.</p><p>GILL: You too.</p><p>IMUS: It's an honor to have you on the program.</p><p>GILL: Thanks.</p><p>IMUS: You're one of my favorites. You're one of everybody's favorites, so - -</p><p>GILL: Well, right back at you.</p><p>IMUS: My wife loves you and my 14-year-old kid loves you and a lot of  people do. </p><p>GILL: I appreciate it.</p><p>IMUS: The great Vince Gill. </p><p>You know I played that \"Go Rest High on the Mountains\" you wrote for your  brother.</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I -- and thanks for the money you sent to the ranch when Fred  died. But -- </p><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: He's been dead a year. It's still hard to talk about him. I try --</p><p>GILL: I know.</p><p>IMUS: I played your record. I tried to talk about it and --</p><p>GILL: Yes, my brother's been gone for 20 years. You know, hard to believe.  But, you know, that's -- </p><p>IMUS: Why do we -- what is it? Is it -- why do we -- why does people dying  have that effect on us? It's part of life. </p><p>GILL: Yes. It's because you miss them. </p><p>IMUS: Is it?</p><p>GILL: Yes. I do. </p><p>IMUS: Yes, I guess that is. I mean we're not -- yes, I guess that's what it  is. </p><p>All right, man, it's great to see you. </p><p>GILL: You too, buddy. </p><p>IMUS: Vince Gill. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>We have an update on that Blackberry outage. Research In Motion says  service has been restored and things are back to normal. The company had  reported an outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. </p><p>Checking the markets now. Stocks in Asia rose as the release of that new  iPhone gave the telecom sector a boost. Hong Kong led the way with a 0.7  percent gain. In Europe, the Financial Times is reporting European Union  authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a  bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.  Markets there are currently mixed. London still to the downside by about  three points, but Paris is back in the green, up almost 10 points and  Frankfurt's up by 51. </p><p>Here in the U.S., we've had green arrows across the board all morning. Dow  futures are up by 43, the S&amp;P's up by about four, and the Nasdaq's up by  seven. </p><p>So now that Apple's iPhone 5 is available, we're also finding out what  exactly makes this smartphone work. The repair firm iFixit got its hands on  one, pried it open and found that the device uses chips from Qualcomm,  Avego Technologies and Skyworks Solutions. The phone also includes an audio  chip made by Cirrus Logic. And its gyroscope, which is used to track the  orientation, was made by STMicroelectronics. You can keep an eye on stocks  of those companies and those who didn't contribute to the iPhone 5 to see  how they react today.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities now. Oil and gold are to the upside. Oil's up  by about 60 cents, around $93 a barrel. Gold's up $6 at $1,776 an ounce.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the  power to prosper.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: IMUS IN THE MORNING continues here in  the next hour with Neil Cavuto from the Fox Business Network. He had a  recent interview with Mitt Romney here. So we'll talk to -- the I-man will  talk to Neil about all that's going on in the world. </p><p>And this portion of IMUS IN THE MORNING is brought to you by \"A Wanted Man\"  by Lee Child, now available in hard cover and e-book from Delacorte. Now  five minutes till the hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Here with -- with some thoughts on pot --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Is Brian Wilson, on the genius of the Beach Boys. </p><p>Good morning, Mr. Wilson. </p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Good morning, Opie.</p><p>I hear there's a movement to decriminalize marijuana, which is good,  because pot never did anything criminal to anybody, just made them feel  good. People say it's a gateway drug, which I guess it is. It's a gateway  to a beautiful world of pretty flowers and beautiful music and little  bunnies who sing pretty songs and give out candy. </p><p>But it's not like you're going to smoke a doobie and next thing you know  you're mainlining smack or anything. Of course it depends on how strong  your dope is. Like I just got a lid of northern lights white widow wonder  woman. You don't even have to smoke it. You just hold a butt in your hand  for 10 minutes and once the oil gets into your pours, you're a bottle  rocket, man. I think it also might have been sprayed with PCP and Easy Off,  because after I did a half a bong's worth last night, a genie appeared and  told me my oven was magically cleaned. </p><p>But legalization would be good for the economy, not just for the tax they  could collect on the (INAUDIBLE) itself, but for all the sales of  paraphernalia. It'd create jobs making rolling papers, Zip-loc bags,  Twinkies. If they had made weed legal, we could balance a budget by 4:20  the next afternoon.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: Nice.</p><p>BARTLETT: And I'll be sitting in my sandbox with my KCO  keyboard writing a  new song for the cute little bunny who gives out the candy. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  Apple fans around the world are lining up  to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves around the  world today here in New York City.  </p><p>The door should be opening sooner, and Robert Gray is standing by at  Apple's fifth avenue store.  Robert, what is it like out there? </p><p>ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS:  Well, Diane, I don't know if you can hear the  cheers, they're audible behind me. </p><p>Apple employees are outside, greeting the first of the 500 folks who have  been camping out here.</p><p>And the crowd has been swelling as the sun has being rising over Manhattan  this morning, waiting to get in to buy the iPhone 5.  </p><p>The store behind me is not only open 24 hours, seven days a week, they did  close it last night.  </p><p>Not opening until 8 a.m., that is the time that each Apple store in each  time zone has been opening in local time.  </p><p>So, we've had folks here from Arizona, saying that they're facebooking and  tweeting their friends back in Arizona.</p><p>Boasting that they're going to get their hands on the iPhone before those  guys can.  And you can hear the crowd starting to cheer even more there, as  I said, some 500 folks here. </p><p>The new iPhone 5 -- sold out two million, pre-selling in an hour's time.   It's expected to be the fastest and widest rollout yet for Apple, nine  nations have the iPhone selling it.  </p><p>That's the most to participate in it and what we've seen and, analysts  saying that they've stocked piled as many as 10 million units, that's about  $6.4 billion worth of inventory by the way.</p><p>And they're expected according to some analysts to sell as many as 10  million, Ben Stevens saying, they could sell 13 million before the end of  this month.  </p><p>Now, the new phone does boosts faster, processing speed, it works on the 4  GLTE network where you can get that. </p><p>It also -- it has an enhanced camera, the Siri voice command, it would  give you turn-by-turn navigation, you can post to Facebook.</p><p>You can also book reservations on open table but critics point to the  mapping features saying that they're incomplete, there's been some errors  there, and a lot of hoopla and negative flap about the connectors.</p><p>Which have short meaning that all of those i-gadgets you have there, work  with iPhones, you're going to have to go out and buy new ones, although  there're some analysts who say we're moving to Bluetooth.</p><p>Anyway, it may not be a big issue, down the line it will be though  immediately and Diane, we should also point out a robust secondary market  for iPhones.  </p><p>If you have an iPhone 4s, still under warranty, there are websites out  there, vili.com is one and the CEO telling me, they've seen interest triple  in the past week alone.  </p><p>You'll get about 260 bucks for your old iPhone 4s, that will about cover  the fees, you don't have to pay AT&amp;T to upgrade.  </p><p>If you're going to buy one, you can get one, it'll cost you about 300  bucks, but that's still less than the new ones. </p><p>Which started 199 with a two-year contract.  Back to you. </p><p>MACEDO:  All right, that's Robert Gray outside the Apple store, thanks,  Robert. </p><p>GRAY:  You're welcome. </p><p>MACEDO:  And as Apple focuses on the release of the iPhone 5, Research In  Motion is focusing on a blackberry outage.  </p><p>The company now says service has been restored and things are back to  normal after reporting an earlier outage affecting users in Europe, the  Middle East and Africa.  </p><p>Let's look at the markets now, here in the U.S., Futures have been in the  green across the board all morning, Dow Futures are now up by about 41  points, the S&amp;P is up by almost four, the Nasdaq is up by eight.  </p><p>In Europe, the financial times is reporting European Union Authorities are  working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and  unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p>You can see markets there are currently mixed, and now let's take a closer  look at what's moving them with European markets analyst Jan Randolph.  </p><p>He's a director of Sovereign Risk at IHS Global Insight.  Now Jan,  according to this financial times report, Spain and these European  authorities that it's talking to, are hoping to unveil this bailout plan  possibly in about a week.  </p><p>How do you expect investors to respond if that happens?</p><p>JAN RANDOLPH, DIRECTOR, SOVEREIGN RISK, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT:  I think  positively.  </p><p>I think they're expecting it, I think the lower borrowing costs we've seen  from Spain, in anticipation of the ECB bond buying and the bailout fund  being made available. </p><p>I think it will be a bailout light though, not a fully fledged bailout  though, that will be far too much money.  </p><p>The trick, you can call it that, is to keep private sector on board in  terms of refinancing the Spanish state and to encourage more.  </p><p>I think that's the trick and I think the package will be designed for that  purpose. </p><p>MACEDO:  All right, we'll see if they can do that.  That's Jan Randolph at  IHS, thanks so much, Jan.  </p><p>RANDOLPH:  Thank you.  </p><p>MACEDO:  And Universal Music Group has won approval from EU anti-trust  regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion.  After the  Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record  labels.  </p><p>Universal says the assets to be sold amount to 30 percent of EMI's global  sales.  Citigroup is selling EMI after they acquired the music group when  Vita firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the investment bank. </p><p>Here's a look at commodities now, oil and gold still up, oil is up by about  74 cents around $93 a gallon.  Gold is up 6 bucks at 1,776 an ounce.  </p><p>Coming up this hour, Imus' guest will be our own Neil Cavuto and now,  here's the i-man live on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.  </p><p>IMUS:  So big foot says to me, of all the people we've ever had on the  program, two of the nicest, perhaps the nicest, Vince Gill -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p>IMUS:  And Levon Helm.  So, Vince Gill is, that man, that's an American  treasure there, I'll tell you that right now.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.   </p><p>IMUS:  Well, here's what I'm trying to understand, Bernard, Connell,  anybody.  Warner, anybody?  Dagen? First, the administration said,  regarding the attack on Libya.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  That it was all the fault of this hideous movie that was on YouTube  and -- then we had people like K.T. McFarland and others on this program  say, that they believed the attack was essentially nonsense.</p><p>Although it may have served as a convenient excuse, but the anniversary of  9/11 had a lot more to do with it.  </p><p>And now we're being told, I guess, that no, the administration now says,  well, it was a terrorist attack. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.   </p><p>IMUS:  So, here is my question.  Did they know that -- did the President  use the word terrorist, by the way? </p><p>MCSHANE:  No.   </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  Has he ever? </p><p>MCSHANE:  Has he ever used the word period? </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, does he believe that there's terrorism in the world?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, yes, he's used -- </p><p>IMUS:  Sure -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  The word certainly --  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, OK, all right.  Does -- so did they use the movie as a  convenient excuse until they could develop all of the facts and find out  what really happened? Or as opposed to saying we don't know, which would  mean they lied to us. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right. </p><p>IMUS:  So, sort it out for me, start with you, Bernie? </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, they went out as Susan Rice, the U.N. Ambassador on Sunday,  she went, did the tour and proclaimed, pretty much, no uncertain terms,  that it was all about the movie.  </p><p>And which seemed premature and a lot of people said as John McCain said,  you know there was a spontaneous demonstration she said, and John McCain  said you don't bring RPG's to a spontaneous demonstration.</p><p>And sure enough, it comes out later, Fox News now reporting that there was  an al Qaeda guy who was released from Gitmo in 2007.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Who was behind the attacks.  And so, it makes you wonder how  stupid -- I mean, didn't they know that that would come out?  They must  have known, or at least should have considered that it might have come out  when they put out Susan Rice to say these stupid things.</p><p>And it did come out and now they're backtracking, Jay Carney said, yes, it  was an act of terror.  And so, they look dead, they shot themselves in the  foot --  </p><p>IMUS:  Well -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Once again.  </p><p>IMUS:  The president's conduct to foreign policy is laughable and then my  guy, the suit dummy --  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Romney. </p><p>IMUS:  His comments in the wake of it were idiotic as well.  Shut up until  you know something.  By the way, just butt out. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, but to mislead the American people -- </p><p>IMUS:  Or what I said -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Because it would look bad politically, so, you can't -- </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Say that the GM is alive and Bin Laden is dead sort of puts a  monkey wrench into all that. </p><p>IMUS:  I understand.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  I mean that's sort of insulting -- </p><p>IMUS:  That's what I wondered, so --  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, that's what the critics are saying that, you know, they're  trying to change -- oh, it's much easier for the administration to come out  and say what Susan Rice said.  </p><p>It's kind of interesting that she was put out there.  Right, the President  has been very careful on what he's personally said about this.  </p><p>Even yesterday, as you said, he didn't use the word terrorism, it was Jay  Carney, his spokesman, not him.   </p><p>IMUS:  Well, there we are.  Neil Cavuto -- I mean, and these are the two  guys we've got running. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.   </p><p>IMUS:  I mean, it's just -- all right, eight minutes after the hour here on  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  </p><p>Neil Cavuto is coming up, I saw him this morning, when I walked in the  building and it was before 5:30 a.m. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Wow. </p><p>IMUS:  And he looked cute and perky down there in the lobby and he got all  exercised hysterical because I had my little oxygen tank with me because I  couldn't breathe this morning so -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Got to get by.  </p><p>IMUS:  What is it you're going to do?</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's right. </p><p>IMUS:  What is it you're going to do? So, all that's going on, and then of  course last night's football game, we're going to listen to Warner Wolf and  that dope Gunz -- </p><p>WOLF:  Hey, come on.  </p><p>IMUS:  Or any of the guys on the pre-game show -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p>IMUS:  On the NFL network, which by the way is a disaster. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  But Rich Eison and that dope Deion Sanders and Michael Irvin and --  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Marshall Faulk?  </p><p>IMUS:  Marshall Faulk and that dope, that fat dope -- why is the, why is  the name calling necessary?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Simply -- </p><p>IMUS:  Steve Mariucci -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's better -- </p><p>IMUS:  Every single one of these dopes -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right -- </p><p>IMUS:  Picked the tail out of Panthers across the board.  And the Giants  won 36 to 7.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well -- </p><p>IMUS:  Now what?  </p><p>WOLF:  I told Gunz I'm going to watch out for these reserves --  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, God, you're a disgrace. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On that, no -- </p><p>IMUS:  What are the Yankees doing? </p><p>WOLF:  Now, the Yankees lead by one with 13 to play -- </p><p>IMUS:  All right -- </p><p>WOLF:  And they all play, Orioles play losers and so do the Yanks. </p><p>IMUS:  Is there any other race any place in the country?   </p><p>WOLF:  Well, we have a two-game lead in the White Sox and Tigers.  </p><p>IMUS:  Right.  </p><p>WOLF:  That's really it, because -- </p><p>IMUS:  OK -- </p><p>WOLF:  Now the A's are four back --  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, fine, we don't need to run that -- </p><p>WOLF:  That's it -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh, OK.    </p><p>IMUS:  All right, ten minutes after the hour, let's do some news, Bill  Clinton is here, going to talk about -- what are you talking about? </p><p>BARTLETT:  Monica Lewinsky's new book. </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, man, I can't wait to read this, come on, dude.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  You know, Juan Williams is right.  I'm probably making too big a  deal out of O'Reilly's characterization of Lee Harvey Oswald as a  sharpshooter. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  </p><p>IMUS:  I don't know, but it just annoys me, but other than that, the book  is great, \"Killing Kennedy\".  All right, let's do the news, good morning  Connell. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Good morning, i-man.  Well, we're keeping an eye on Pakistan this  morning because there are protesters on the streets over there.  </p><p>One of the things they won't be able to use their cell phones because the  government blocked cell service in major cities, worried that phones might  be used to detonate bombs. </p><p>And speaking of, you know that movie -- </p><p>IMUS:  People living in mud huts -- </p><p>BARTLETT:  I mean is it -- </p><p>IMUS:  Living in dirt and they've got cell phones. </p><p>MCGUIRK:  If these people put this kind of energy into being industrious -- </p><p>IMUS:  Yes -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  And you know, building up their -- you know, it's unbelievable.   Just relax, man, go to work. </p><p>IMUS:  Like a fool, I'm going to have Gunz and Warner pick the games coming  up here. </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK, good --   </p><p>WOLF:  Right. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, today is a national day of protest in Pakistan against that  movie, that -- you know, you mentioned produced here in the United States.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Listened to Ann Romney for a second, she was on a radio show in  Iowa asking Republicans to stop attacking her husband. </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What do you say to your fellow Republicans who are -- </p><p>ANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY:  Stop it.

But I'm talking  about some of these supposed Republican allies. </p><p>IMUS:  That's right.  . </p><p>MCGUIRK:  We're in a battle here, come on.  Whose side you want?    </p><p>MCSHANE:  Speaking of which, the polls 47 percent apiece, dead heat in the  daily tracking poll from Gallop yesterday, but Romney's problem has been in  these swing state polls.</p><p>Another one out from the \"Wall Street Journal\" \"Nbc News\", it's Obama up  eight points in Iowa, leading by five points both in Wisconsin and in  Colorado.</p><p>Here's the question for you, who do you think had the most watched  convention speech? Well, it turns out Joe Biden, the Vice-President.  43.6  million people for what it's worth, President Obama close second followed  by Mitt Romney, Bill Clinton and Marco Rubio. </p><p>IMUS:  Well, of course, because we thought it was going to be a car wreck.  </p><p>RUFINO:  That's right.  </p><p>IMUS:  Absolutely.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Tuning in, in case -- </p><p>IMUS:  Thirteen after the hour, let's do some business news, and here with  that is Dagen McDowell.

So Monica Lewinsky is going to publish  her memoir with all the gory details.</p><p>Every sleazy, sticky, creepy, crawly bit of nastiness, and once it hits the  bestseller list, Bill O'Reilly is going to be able to start writing his  next book, \"Killing Clinton\".</p><p>Because Hillary will shoot me.  It's bad enough that the love ick on the  blue dress was made public for a while there.</p><p>I even thought they were going to put it on display and this masonian next  to Lincoln's stovepipe hat. </p><p>But now, Monica is going to reveal all my sex secrets, like my insatiable  appetite for three-way sex.  Which isn't what you were thinking is, is it  just really?</p><p>I only know three ways of doing it, four, if count missionary, but having  somebody else in the picture, that's just sick, unless the extra person is  A, a woman and B, hot.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTLETT:  But Monica is also going to reveal my fondness for sex toys.   OK, one time I used some legos to build a little garage for my weiner. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But it wasn't, you know a butt plug the size of a lava lamp.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But what really hurts is the allegation that she has to do this because she  needs to make a living and can't get a job because of me, which is just not  true.  </p><p>She could get a job tomorrow, in a cigar store -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTLETT:  Or better yet, a shoe store because you know, she's real good on  her knees. </p><p>IMUS:  So, 19 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.

Did you, did  you feel that? </p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Yes and no.  But --  because I didn't want to talk down to people, I wanted to explain what I  thought was going on. </p><p>STEWART:  That's what was so stunning, I think.  That's why it was such a  bracing speech.  The phrase you mentioned earlier about getting the facts  right, and they would have -- you would attach numbers to them that were  real.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I thought it was a bold choice on your part. </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  I mean he's going to have to send his jackets to the cleaners  after that, I mean, just figuratively, it was sort of nauseating.

That was a straight-up journalistic -- </p><p>IMUS:  Didn't he sound like he was kidding -- </p><p>BARTLETT:  I mean, I didn't see it, so, I mean, I was there?  </p><p>IMUS:  He didn't sound like he was kidding? </p><p>POWELL:  Little tongue in cheek to me.   </p><p>IMUS:  That's what he sounded, like a little tongue in cheek.

And now, here is Diane Macedo.</p><p>MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  General Motors is recalling more than  426,000 Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn sedans in the U.S. due to  transmission problems.  The recall affects vehicles model years 2007 to  2010.</p><p>The automaker says the transmission gear position may not match the  gear on the shifter and that could cause the vehicle to move when drivers  think they're in park.  GM says it's aware of four crashes due to the  problem, but no injuries reported as of now.</p><p>Meanwhile, the recall news after General Motors announced it has  reached an agreement with the Canadian Autoworkers Union over a labor  contract.  Under the tentative four year deal, GM will add a third shift to  its flex line at its Ontario facility.</p><p>The automaker had planned to shutdown that plant three-shift  consolidated line next June, but will operate with at least one line until  June of 2014.  The CAW continues to negotiate a deal with Chrysler after it  already reached one with Ford earlier in the week.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues now after we check the weather with  Fox 5 meteorologist, Mike Woods.</p><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST:  Good morning, everyone.  Looks like we  have some wet weather out there, but not a ton of it for the country here.   We've got an area of low pressure still rotating around the Great Lakes,  but it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwest and Central Mississippi  Valley area.</p><p>And then back towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east  and also a few showers popping up around Florida again, southeast, slightly  risky in terms of showers and storms.  Tampa, you'll see a few scattered  storms and high temp today, 88 degrees.</p><p>And Phoenix, no rain for you, sunny skies with a high of 103 and  Seattle partly cloudy skies with a high of 63.  Sacramento, California,  you've got sunny skies there today with a high of 91, still warm.  I'm Mike  Woods from Fox 5 in New York.</p><p>IMUS:  All right, it's 36 minutes past the hour here on the IMUS IN THE  MORNING program.  Please welcome to the program, senior vice president,  anchor manager, Fox Business News, Fox News Channel, a man who sadly calls  himself the financial factor, Neil P. Cavuto.  What does the P stand for?</p><p>NEIL P. CAVUTO, FOX BUSINESS:  Patrick.</p><p>IMUS:  Good morning, Mr. Cavuto.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Good morning, Mr. Imus.</p><p>IMUS:  How are you?</p><p>CAVUTO:  It was scary bumping into you this morning.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, I had my little oxygen tank with me.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You kind of looked like Hannibal Lector being driven in on a  gurney and I thought, is he up to doing the show today?  But here you are,  encouragement to all us.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, anaerobic, but I recover quickly and I don't need oxygen just  to sit around and talk.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I admire that.</p><p>IMUS:  Happy birthday tomorrow.</p><p>CAVUTO:  How did you know that?</p><p>IMUS:  It's my job to know those things.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Thank you very much.</p><p>IMUS:  So, you like the Vince Gill interview?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I liked it very much, I'm a big fan of his and I thought you did a  very good job.  A lot of people, you know, when you interview stars it's  always tough.  You do a fawning interview or you do a revealing one  particularly like the things about your brother, how tough that is and  trying to get a handle on it, very real.  I liked it very much.</p><p>IMUS:  So I asked you off the air if you liked Romney.  Do you?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I do, personally I like him a lot.</p><p>IMUS:  It doesn't bother you that he's a dope, right?</p><p>CAVUTO:  He's not a dope.</p><p>IMUS:  OK, he's not a good campaigner, is he?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think that remains to be seen.  The election hasn't happened  yet.</p><p>IMUS:  No, sir.  Do you think that these leaked videos, these missteps that  they've each made, is going to make a difference when people vote?</p><p>CAVUTO:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  You don't?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I do not.  I think in the end, it always is the economy.  I think  that's what-- we could have extenuating circumstances, the Middle East  explosion, could have the impact, but almost every U.S. election is decided  by the economy.</p><p>How good people feel, how maybe not so good people feel and we're  always willing to entertain switching horses mid stream when an incumbent  is battling a tough economy, but we've really got to see the other horse.</p><p>I think in 1980 when the polls were similarly tight between Jimmy  Carter and Ronald Reagan.  A lot of people liked Jimmy Carter, frustrated  with the economy, but they were more than willing to entertain an  alternative and along came Ronald Reagan to appeal to alternative.</p><p>IMUS:  How many people vote for the person who they like the best?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think it plays a part.</p><p>IMUS:  How big a part?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I do think it helped George Bush, many polls were done on  the debate between he and Al Gore and then later on between he and John  Kerry.  And I think most people said who won the debates?</p><p>And a lot of them said, particularly in 2004, with John Kerry, who  do you like more or relate to more?  George Bush.  I'm not saying that's  always the case, but it does help if people feel you're either more  approachable or likeable.</p><p>And I think in 1960 from the television critics later who said that  Richard Nixon was sweating and detached and John Kennedy looked relaxed and  smooth.  These things on some level do connect for people.</p><p>IMUS:  Talking with Neil Cavuto -- talking with Neil Cavuto here on the  IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  It's 5 until the hour, you know what you  ought to do here at Fox?</p><p>CAVUTO:  What's that?</p><p>IMUS:  An interesting experiment because my wife mentioned this to me.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  She wants to have sex with you, by the way.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Who doesn't?</p><p>IMUS:  I don't.  Wants to have sex with you -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  And go ahead.</p><p>IMUS:  Anyway.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Come on, Don, tell me.  Go ahead, please.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, I forgot -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  At least say something, you guys.</p><p>IMUS:  Here is what you should do.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Like an interview by Rainman.</p><p>IMUS:  When is the first debate, October 1st?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think the 3rd.</p><p>IMUS:  It's the day he hit the home run.  Here is what you should do.   Please don't interrupt when I'm talking with Mr. Cavuto, Warner.  I'll come  over there and beat on you like a rented mule.  Just kidding.  You should  get a group of people.</p><p>Frank -- You should do it.  Get a group, have them listen to the  audio feed and don't let them watch it and have the group just watch it on  television and then poll each group to see who won.  Who they think won.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's not a bad idea.</p><p>IMUS:  It is a good idea isn't it?</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's a very good idea.</p><p>IMUS:  Because Deirdre said to me -- don't you hate it when guys quote  their wives.  You know, that means they're so p-whipped.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And she's insane for putting up with you.</p><p>IMUS:  Absolutely.  Because you get distracted who looked and -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, yes.  And history bears that out.  I mean, people who, I  guess, were listened in to the Nixon-Kennedy debate thought Nixon, and Bush  and Al Gore.  That was a little more debatable than Kerry and Bush.</p><p>IMUS:  Should I call Roger and -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Please do, please do.  I'm not going to act on this because I  actually think the idea is silly.</p><p>IMUS:  Do you really?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  I do.</p><p>IMUS:  You do?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think 90 percent of people are going to be watching and not  listening.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, you're just, I don't know, you're just -- I don't know.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I just, I think in 1960, it would have been a brilliant  idea, but last time I checked -- </p><p>IMUS:  It's a good idea now just to see.  It's 18 until the hour here on  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Did you read \"Killing Lincoln?\"</p><p>CAVUTO:  I did read it.  It's a great book.</p><p>IMUS:  But I'll tell you what is a terrific book \"Killing Kennedy.\"</p><p>CAVUTO:  I haven't -- I know it's out or will be out, but-- I really  enjoyed \"Killing Lincoln\", the way he built it up and x number of days to  live and I thought when I first opened it, we know what happened in the  end.</p><p>But he didn't do a great job and see what the Kennedy book, but I  think he's got -- he could a series on his hands.  I don't know how you  handle Philmore, getting Philmore, but -- </p><p>IMUS:  It's enormously entertaining and there's no heavy lifting, not a -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  I think it's a very good point.  A lot of the stories, Brinkley, I  love dearly and Harry Truman, 900 pages on and on and all great, but you  can make this fun and engaging.</p><p>IMUS:  And accessible.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's a way to do it.  I didn't see the kids' version that's out  but -- </p><p>IMUS:  That's pretty good, too.  It's pretty good, too, so, do you think he  writes any of it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think he does.</p><p>IMUS:  What's -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  -- his show.</p><p>IMUS:  That doesn't make any difference.</p><p>CAVUTO:  No, it doesn't, but when you say does he write his stuff?  Of  course, he writes his stuff.</p><p>IMUS:  How is that demeaning -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  You say does he write the book.</p><p>IMUS:  As a journalist, I have a -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Excuse me?  Excuse me.</p><p>IMUS:  It's 17 until the hour here in the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Are  you a sports fan?</p><p>CAVUTO:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  Not at all.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I heard you guys go through the Sunday games.  I guess these are  football games?  Terrific, no offense guns and Warner but -- </p><p>IMUS:  That's fine, but do you ever watch sports on television?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I have the attention span of a gnat.  I watch the highlights.  I  said, why can't the games be like the highlights?</p><p>IMUS:  Do you ever watch Sports Center?</p><p>CAVUTO:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  Where do you get the highlights?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Passing around the news or online, but I'm not really -- I'm  afraid I'm not really into it.</p><p>IMUS:  So, do you watch television?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I know this is going to sound elitist, but I really don't.  I'm  just, it's not -- </p><p>IMUS:  Mr. Cavuto -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  I watch you, of course, I mean, that's a staple.  Connell and  Dagen and flip over -- </p><p>IMUS:  Mr. Cavuto is on at 4 in the afternoon on the Fox News Channel and 8  p.m. and do you think that -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  I want to come back at you with anger, but I saw you with the  oxygen tank and go lightly no need to be mean.</p><p>IMUS:  It's a quarter until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.</p><p>CAVUTO:  This is three times in this hour with this interview, you relay  the time.  It's always fascinating to me why you do that.</p><p>IMUS:  I'm doing a radio program.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I know that.  I know, but -- like I say there are clocks in those  cars, right?</p><p>IMUS:  I can stop giving the time.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK, more time for me.</p><p>IMUS:  Bernie, put a call in to Bob -- anyway do you think Obama is a  socialist?</p><p>CAVUTO:  No.  I think he likes big government.  I think he likes more big  government and espouses the view much like FDR in 1932, government the only  way to get us out of the mess and a lot more people are beholden to the  government as a result of that.</p><p>And he's got a pretty good base of people who would vote for him as  a result and I think that probably was what Mitt Romney was inelegantly  getting at.  But we all remember, you know, but FDR got re-elected in a  landslide in 36 even though the economy still, still was pretty bad.</p><p>IMUS:  As ours does.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  And you would think that one of the things that Romney could get  some traction and I think, that you asked, I think -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Your thoughts are very valuable to me.</p><p>IMUS:  I think the day that Romney gets elected, the economy is better just  by -- he doesn't have to do anything, do you agree with that?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, you have to do something.  You're popping up in a different  -- </p><p>IMUS:  That wasn't the question.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You mean, well, it's a stupid point.  Sounds like Godzilla,  January 20th just by virtue of being Godzilla being in the office because  it's not Barack Obama, things are better.</p><p>IMUS:  If it makes you feel like a bigger person, which you're -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  OK, you know, I could lose weight, you will always be evil.</p><p>IMUS:  To make me feel bad by calling me a list of names, but don't you  think the way the markets would react -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  It's always fine until -- </p><p>IMUS:  And the financial community.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  That the things would, people would feel better and I know he has do  something, your suit dummy candidate and mine, but wouldn't have to do  anything, but just get elected and it would be better.  Do you think that's  true?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't, I don't, obviously if the nation turns to the challenger  to throw the incumbent out of office.  It's hoping what you said.  And  remember, electing Ronald Reagan in a landslide didn't bring results, in  fact, the recession many more years and jobs lost until we had to boom in  '82.</p><p>Coming out of that so things take time, I'm not subscribing to the  screw that automatically things are better.  They're ready to do well if we  don't keep what we're doing and stop with a new guy in there.  But you have  to do stuff.</p><p>You have to put up some initiatives that will change the direction.   Ronald Reagan did, and you know, the question would be for Romney  administration, if it were to happen, whether it would.</p><p>IMUS:  Is there a way now to know -- is there a way for you to know who  will win the election?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I have no idea.</p><p>IMUS:  Do you have a gut sense?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I do, but I'm not going to share that with you.  I will say this - - </p><p>IMUS:  You're really a creep.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's lovely.  I only relate this to you.  I think I told you  this before.  When I went to Wisconsin to cover the recall election, polls  going into that weekend had dead even.  I think it had it dead even and we  know at that Walker won by six points.</p><p>Now, I had a theory and I could be very wrong that conservative  support is understated in some of the state polls, maybe with unwinding a  bit it's beyond the margin of error, but I do think these states apparently  Mitt Romney is going to get blown out in, I don't subscribe to that.</p><p>IMUS:  You're going to get to the point eventually, right?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I just told you.  And I think the polls in the battle ground state  understate Romney's support.</p><p>IMUS:  Hope you're right.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And when you say Romney's my man you always say that.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But then you disparage him.</p><p>IMUS:  Keeping it real.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And for every wonderful interview like Vince Gill and then you do  one like you did with Frank Rich.</p><p>IMUS:  My job is to keep it real, right, Bernie?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Frank Rich interview, just kept it real.</p><p>IMUS:  Keeping it real.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  Thank you very much for -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  This is it? </p><p>IMUS:  You were on for 12 minutes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's 12 minutes of my life.  I'm never getting back.</p><p>IMUS:  And so does the audience.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEOD:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo.  Let's take a look at  the markets.  In Europe, the \"Financial Times\" is reporting that European  Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a  bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p>Markets there are now mixed with London down by about 5 points.   Paris is up 10 and Frankfort is up about 64.  Here in the U.S., we have  seen green arrows across the board all morning.  Dow futures are up by 56.   The S&amp;P is up by about 5 and the Nasdaq is up by 13.</p><p>Now that Apple's iPhone is available, we're also finding out exactly  what makes the smartphone work.  The repair firm fix it, got one open and  chips from Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solution.</p><p>The iPhone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus Logic and its  gyroscope, which is used to track its orientation was made by ST  Microelectronics.  Keep an eye on those stocks and those are the companies  that didn't participate in the iPhone to see the reaction today.</p><p>The world's biggest retailer is looking to do business in India.   The \"Wall Street Journal\" reports Wal-Mart hopes to open its first stores  in the country within two years.  That move comes after the government last  week agreed to allow international supermarket chains to enter India  through joint ventures.</p><p>Wal-Mart says it hadn't decided yet where or how many stores it  would like to have, but the company expects to continue its current  partnerships with barky enterprises of India, a chain of 17 cash and carry  stores.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities, oil and gold are up.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone. Apple fans are on the world of lining up to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves around the world today including here in New York City where our own Robert Gray is standing by at Apple's Fifth Avenue store. Robert, it is 6:00 in the morning. What does it look like out there right now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Diane. Good morning. There are a few hundred folks out here in line behind me. You can see them and in fact, the big cube here which this store is famous for, which lead you to an underground entrance way, the store is normally a 24-7 operation. They closed it overnight. It will not open until 8 a.m. local time. And of course, that is the roll out plan across nine different nations here.</p><p/><p>This is the widest rollout that Apple has had yet for one of their iPhones. Now, a key numbers to hit here. We've seen every iPhone new version has outsold a combined total of all the previous versions. This of course is a law of large numbers. It is going to be tough to duplicate. We'll have to wait and see. Most reviewers out there saying this phone a little bit more evolutionary than revolutionary.</p><p/><p>And of course, there's been a lot of feedback and flak, if you will, about the new connectors out there. They are of course shrinking the connectors down to nine pins from 30. So, all the products that you have around the house, connectors et cetera, you'll going to have to go out and buy some more of those. So, Apple is expected to make a big hole out of this as well as of course some of their third party partners out there. You're going to talk a little bit all morning long.</p><p/><p>Of course, we're expecting a faster processor on board, you got the new ear pods, the camera higher resolution, reportedly better. As the phone even now of course, some reviewers out there and analysts that I've spoken with Diane, saying that as far as the camera goes and processing speed, they're just now catching up to some of the rivals out there. But of course, as you can see, still plenty of Apple fans out here braving the early morning, though we must say pretty mild here in New York City. Back to you.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right. That's Robert Gray live at the Apple store. Thanks, Robert.</p><p/><p>GRAY: You're welcome.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Meanwhile, E.U. anti-trust regulators have cleared universal music group to buy British record company EMI as recorded music unit for $1.9 billion after the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record labels. Universal says, the assets to be sold amounts to 30 percent of EMI's global sales. Citigroup is selling EMI having acquired the music group when buy-out firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the investment bank.</p><p/><p>Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., futures have been in the green across the board all morning. Dow futures are up by about 40 points. The S&amp;P is up by almost four. The NASDAQ is up by seven.</p><p/><p>In Europe, the Financial Times reports European Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank. Markets are currently mixed. London was green earlier, now we're seeing it in the red down by almost nine points. Paris and Frankfurt still in the green.</p><p/><p>Let's take a closer look at what's moving those markets with Josh Raymond now, chief market strategist at City Index in London. Now, Josh, the FT is reporting that Spain is moving closer to a bailout. Should investors read that as a negative or should they find some release in having some more certainty on that front?</p><p/><p>JOSH RAYMOND, CITY INDEX CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: I think it is a positive. And it does provide some certainty. You know, the markets -- investors have been fairly convinced that more is required. There has been political maneuvering going on with Spain saying that they've got austerity measures in there. They don't require the fully -- bailout. But we already know that they're actually in talks, so we have that -- a few people of the Spanish government actually recently earlier on this week say, it will provide a level of certainty. And I think that would be reacted positively by the market. Of course, it depends on the scale which the (INAUDIBLE) will require, I mean, the ECB through monetary transactions have an unlimited scope to do so as well.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: And Josh, Mario Monti is holding meetings in Italy with several leaders today. What do you expect to come out of them?</p><p/><p>RAYMOND: Not much unfortunately. And we're getting used to all these meetings taking place and strong rhetoric talking about a fiscal union, stronger banking regulations, that sort of thing but nothing really comes of it. And I think investors are a little bit more wiser to that these days. Now, we already have the ECB. And the main focus for us at the moment really is the ECB and Spain. Now, we've obviously got the -- from the ECB and we're waiting for Spain to confirm or to agree that the terms towards that fully first bailout. Those are the key things that we're looking at.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: OK. More brain storming for the many results. We'll see if it comes out that way. Thanks, Josh. That's Josh Raymond from London.</p><p/><p>K.B. Home meanwhile is reporting a surprise profit this morning. The home builder says it made four cents a share in its third quarter. The company was expected to lose 16 cents a share but revenue came in light at $424.5 million. The estimate was for 430 million. K.B. Home says, it's order backlog at the end of August rose 18 percent from a year ago to more than 3,100 and home deliveries rose seven percent to more than 1,700.</p><p/><p>Here's a quick look at commodities. Oil and gold are both to the upside.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business.</p><p/><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. Well, it's going to be a great show.</p><p/><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Great show. Great day in New York today.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yep.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Last day of summer. Going to be 73 degrees. Let's do some sunbathing, baby.</p><p/><p>So, anyway, coming up this morning, Juan Williams, <person><nameText>FOX News, </nameText></person>and the great Vince Gill. Now, Vince -- when I say great, I mean great. He's not going to sing. He's coming in to talk. Now, why would you book somebody like Vince Gill just to talk? Because he's worth talking to.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: There's a few of these guys, people who I would talk to. It would be him -- who are worth talking to. Dwight Yoakam.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Smart guy, Yoakam.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Uh-huh!</p><p/><p>IMUS: Crazy but good crazy. Delbert, smart guy, funny.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Of course.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Kinky.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, not many more, right?</p><p/><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: Billy Ray?</p><p/><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM PRODUCER: He's one of the nicest guys too, Dwight Yoakam.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He is, isn't he?</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Yes, he's really nice guy.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know the day I got fired, he called me on my cell phone. I was on my way to meet the team. And I was in the car.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He's a good man. He understood what the deal was. And so, you know. You can't say stuff like that, man. Don't pick on people. Just don't do it, whether you're trying to be funny or not. Come on.</p><p/><p>Anyway, and so, and then the big dog's here, Bill Clinton.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh, good.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He's concerned about this book that Monica Lewinsky is going to do.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: I like that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: About them sex positions. And then, Warner?</p><p/><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You and Gunz.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, sir.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You skunks. And Steve Mariucci, the pregame show on the NFL Network, there are two reasons to watch that. Other than that.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Yes, good bye.</p><p/><p>IMUS: They suck, Rich Eisen, sucks. Steve Mariucci, sucks. Deion Sanders, moron, Michael Irving moron, and that other guy, moron.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Moron.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Every one of them picked the Carolina Panthers. What happened? The New York Giants put a butt whipping on them.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Oh, man.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Thirty six-seven. Come on.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Pussy riot, come on!</p><p/><p>IMUS: Start the pussy riot.</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's right. Come on.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man! Eli got the ball, what did he do? He marched down the field and scored a touchdown. Every time he got the ball. Come on!</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes. And the reserves, man, those guys, the regulars better look over their shoulders. Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, you and the ice cream cone on the forehead, Gunzelman --</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Oh, wow!</p><p/><p>WOLF: Oh, God!</p><p/><p>IMUS: -- should have anticipated this.</p><p/><p>(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p/><p>I mean, this was an outrage.</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's right.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Enjoy that ice cream.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I will never listen to -- and you're right, Warner, about these pregame shows. These people don't know anything.</p><p/><p>WOLF: No, waste of time.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's total waste of time.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Honeymoon is over.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Welcome.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. We're going to do the news now. Bernard.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yo, chief.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Or Connell.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Any of you.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Anybody.</p><p/><p>IMUS: The Libyan attack on the embassy.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: The administration initially, the President and the Secretary of State characterized this as a direct result of this YouTube movie, right?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Susan Rice all over the Sunday shows, she did a tour.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: U.N. ambassador. Yep.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Now, is there any evidence -- and how are they describing it now, the administration?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That there is evidence that the guy who was released from Guantanamo Bay in 2007 was behind -- an al-Qaeda guy was behind the attack on the embassy in Libya.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, is the President willing to use the word terrorist and describe this as a terrorist attack?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Not personally. Jay Carney used that word yesterday but the President did not when he was asked about it in the forum in Florida.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Has he ever used the word terrorist?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Good question.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. Now, so my question is this then, did they have evidence that -- did they know better that it was the result of the movie? Or of course, not so coincidently falling on September 11th. Did they not know that or did they lie about it or did they just assume -- you would think with our intelligence apparatus they would know better. But then, we've had other bunch of other screw ups. So what happened here? In other words, did they lie? Did they know? Did they not have the information? What?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: They jumped to conclusions. If they didn't know, they should have said they didn't know instead of proclaiming definitively that it was a direct result of the movie.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: They should not have proclaimed that. They should have said let's wait and see. They didn't. Again, and they still harp on the movie as though -- and they're conflating two things. The movie, the terrorists used the movie perhaps as a cover to get the morons to come out and cause a riot so that they could use that as cover to go in. But in either case, they were misleading, was the administration. They obviously don't want it to look like -- they want to say GM is alive and bin Laden is dead, and that's it. They can't say that anymore. And that's why they're, you know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I know you can't see it, but do you like my new hat?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, that's bad. That's a bad as Johnny Cash.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Look out now.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do you know who did this? Stuart Dunlap, Men's hat shop, Albuquerque.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Nobody but him.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Did he?</p><p/><p>IMUS: He did in San Antonio.</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's the Rango Kidd hat.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man, that guy is -- come on. All right. Let's do the news.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're a disgrace, Warner. Don't you be yucking it up over there. This is unbelievable. The country singer Josh Turner is downstairs. That boy is pretty good. He's on FOX and Fiends.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I guess people, there's an 80-plus demographic by records, right? Here's Connell with the news. Good morning, Connell.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man. Protesters are actually in the streets today in Pakistan. They won't be able to use their cell phones. Though, the government there is blocking cell service, major cities, so the phones can't be used to detonate bombs. It's a national day of protest against that movie we were talking about, the anti-Muslim film produced here in the United States. The surge in Afghanistan meantime is over according to the Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta who says in his view it worked.</p><p/><p>The 33,000 additional troops sent to Afghanistan a couple of years ago now pulled out of the country. The latest Gallup daily tracking poll has the race for the White House a dead heat. Forty seven percent a piece.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I'll be darned.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Mitt Romney and President Obama. But Romney is still hurting in some of these key swing states. \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC numbers, Obama is up eight points in Ohio. Leading by five both in Wisconsin and Colorado.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know, we are at a state in this country where this is the best we can do? A suit dummy and the president?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's the choice you have.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I mean, I know a bunch of smart guys. So, do you? I mean, we all do.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right. You mean like business leaders and that type of thing and --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Really smart people.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Can't get them to run.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well, I was going to say, it's hard to get people to run. Absolutely.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I don't know.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Be vetted and everything else.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Twelve minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Juan Williams, Vince Gill. Neil Cavuto. That's a pretty good lineup.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, it is. Connell continues.</p><p/><p>IMUS: We got some comments from Ann Romney here in a second but first, the campaign has turned to comments not by either Romney but by the President saying yesterday, \"Washington cannot be changed from the inside.\" Big things, he says, get done when people pressure politicians from the outside. So, Romney was all over that saying that Obama's thrown in the white flag of surrender on the economy. Now, here's Ann Romney. She was on a radio show in Iowa asking Republicans to stop attacking her husband.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>ANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY: What do you say to your fellow Republicans? Sure. Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it, get in the ring. This is hard. It's an important thing that we're doing right now, and it's an important election.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes. Today, the President --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Her husband is a moron. He'll do better than this guy. Having said all that -- I mean, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. Those of you who know me know I probably don't. But I'm going to vote for him. And I'm going to tell you that the day he gets elected, the economy is better. He doesn't have to do anything.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: You just think confidence is going to improve?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's one of the argument he made in that video that came out. Romney will be in Nevada today. Obama campaigning in Virginia. Some American airliners frequent fliers worried after hearing about the company's intentions to lay off thousands of workers and then reduce flights.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I'm pretty loyal to them. Because I do travel and get my miles with them. I have really not had too many problems.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Had a number of flights, so they've been canceled this week, American announcing more than 1,000 employees could lose their jobs. They're going through bankruptcy reorganization.</p><p/><p>And Fast and Furious, lawmakers analyzing this new report that's come in on the botch, ATF gun walking operation, it's a report from the inspector general from the Justice Department. They found the Attorney General Eric Holder was not aware of the operation until it came out in the media and other places. Here's California republican Congressman Darrell Issa says the report the raises an important question.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: There is clearly a question not of did he know, because he said he didn't know. The question is why in the world did key lieutenants keep it from him and of course why is that something that we should --</p><p/><p>(SCREAMING SHUT UP)</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sounds like a car alarm going off. Did the guy invented those Bernie or Connell?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Please step away from the car. That's his --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes. Please step away from the car. Please step away from your mouth.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh my God!</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sick of hearing about this.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right. Enough is enough.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Come on.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Let's just get the problems of this country solved. Bernard McGuirk is going to be a guest on O'Reilly tonight at 8 p.m. on the <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>Channel. Bernard McGuirk and Greg Gutfeld in a segment called what the hell just happened or something.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Something like that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And it's good and they're good. A quarter after the hour. Let's do some business news. Here with that is Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, sir. Yesterday, the Dow was up a paltry almost 19 points and the futures are higher this morning. And OK, all these ding-a-lings are lined up for the new iPhone 5. It goes on sale this morning at 8 a.m. Local Time in stores in nine countries. I'm sure it's going to have record sales. But here's what we care about even more than that, that Apple has fallen flat on its face with this new mapping software that it released. It's on this new phone. It's also in the new software, the IOS-6. It replaced Google maps, kicked Google maps off the phone, and it's a disaster. It sucks. That's how bad it is. Basically like businesses wind up in the middle of rivers.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, I told Dagen I used map quest. She said, that's so 90's.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Map quest.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I said, well, the place I'm going hasn't moved. They'll tell you how to get there. What the hell do I care?</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: You could do so much better than that. That's the issue. You could do so much better than that. It's like saying I've got like a Xerox typewriter, like, you know, IBM Selectric or something like that before I curse.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Like what? What's better?</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Right. No, all this.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What's the matter?</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Google maps is better. Google maps is far and above better than map quest, and particularly this new Apple.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Old weird Dave Patterson from Texas, he just updated my iPhone iOS 6 last night.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you lost your Google maps and if you want to look for the Hoover dam on the 3D imaging, on this Apple mapping software, it looks like a -- roller coaster. That's how lousy it is.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I know where the Hoover dam is. Right outside of Las Vegas. Let's go look at it. Come on, dude.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Can't do it on that Apple mapping --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, come on. Get a life.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Don't we love when some giant, the biggest company in the world screws up?</p><p/><p>IMUS: First of all, all you ever care about is a bunch of red-neck goobers driving around in a circle and who knows where they're going to race this weekend, the NASCAR dopes. Where is the race?</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Well, in New Hampshire actually.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's pretty good track, so. So, they don't need a map. I tell you what they do need.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: They need a clue. All right. Eighteen after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Have you done sports yet, Warner?</p><p/><p>WOLF: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. Don't wear me out but here's Warner with sports. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>WOLF: All right, I-man. Thursday night football in Charlotte, now the Giants even with four offensive injuries beat the Panthers 36 to seven. Just like Gunzelman and myself called it. Backup running back Andre Brown playing for the injured Ahmad Bradshaw, 113 yards and 20 carries and two touchdowns.</p><p/><p>And then reserved wide receiver Ramses Barden playing in place of a Hakeem Nicks caught nine passes for 138 yards. Eli 27 for 35, 288 yards, a touchdown, no interceptions. And Lawrence Tynes kicked five field goals.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Wow!</p><p/><p>WOLF: Now, here was Cam Newton who, by the way, I don't know if you saw this, after he scored a touchdown to make it cut it to 23 to seven, he went into his superman celebration. Pretty good timing for that. So, here was Newton only 16 for 30 intercepted three times and ran the ball six times for only six yards.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CAM NEWTON, CAROLINA PANTHERS: Who wants to support something that puts on a performance of embarrassment. That's what that was tonight. If I was a fan of the Carolina Panthers, I would be holding my head down and ashamed of the product that was out there today.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes. He was awful.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Stop your stupid end zone celebrations, OK?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes. How about that?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>IMUS: What a dope.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: You have been killed.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You have been murdered.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Why do that?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man!</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yankees beat the Jays 10-seven, sweep the series. Ichiro by the way, a homerun and a double, he's not nine for his last 12.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That guy is crazy.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Oh, man!</p><p/><p>IMUS: On fire?</p><p/><p>WOLF: On fire. So, Yankees lead the Orioles by one with 13 to play.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p/><p>WOLF: And this is embarrassing, I-man.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What?</p><p/><p>WOLF: At City Field, the Phillies scored eight in the first, seven in the ninth and beat the Mets 16 to one. Here was Met Manager Terry Collins was asked after the game --</p><p/><p>RUFINO: There was nobody there.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That's right.</p><p/><p>WOLF: They were addressing these empty seats. Here was Mets manager Terry Collins asked after the game if he was embarrassed.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>TERRY COLLINS, METS MANAGER: I am.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Does his team quit?</p><p/><p>COLLINS: You'll have to ask them.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: What do you think?</p><p/><p>COLLINS: You'll have to ask them. I have my own opinion. I'm not going to express it publicly.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's horrible.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man. They got to get rid of him. All right. Twenty minutes after the hour. Do you have anything else, Warner?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, real quick. Tiger Woods and Justin Rose share the lead of that FedEx cup playoff. Roy McElroy is three back.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. Coming up on 21 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Juan Williams, Vince Gill, Neil Cavuto, Bill Clinton, and Tony Robbins are all coming up. Bernie's got a briefing too. What's there, B?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That's a more fiery Obama versus Romney. Jimmy Fallon bust on the President. And Tim Tebow tells the world what kind of woman he wants.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right, baby. What kind of woman do you want? So, Dwight Yoakam's new album is called \"Three Pears.\" There's not a bad cut on it. It's the number-two country album on I-tunes. Dwight Yoakam, number two, come on here. It's a great record. Here's one of the better songs on it.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p/><p>ANNOUNCER: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, Lindamood-Bell teaches children and adults to read words and comprehend language. Children often fail in school because they struggle to read words accurately or they struggle to comprehend language they read or hear. For those who have difficulty comprehending words, seem to go in one ear and out the other caused by difficulty visualizing language, over 25 years ago Lindamood-Bell asked one of their college students who struggled with spelling but had excellent reading comprehension to describe how he remembered what he read. He thought about it a second and he said, well, I make movies when he read.</p><p/><p>Since then Lindamood-Bell has conducted research and developed programs that teach students to visualize and comprehend language. They have made wonderful, remarkable strides for children with autism. It's a great outfit. Call Lindamood-Bell, best thing you could do. Lindamoodbell.com. Check this outfit out. Come on.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. And more companies are rewarding their shareholders with higher quarterly dividends. McDonald's is hiking its quarterly payoff by ten percent, 77 cents a share. Texas Instruments is boosting its dividend by 24 percent to 21 cents a share. And Covidien is increasing its quarterly dividend by 16 percent to 26 cents a share.</p><p/><p>Here's a quick look at futures. We're seeing green arrows across the board.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: When I was at NBC radio.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And I would say, God I'm starving, you know what he would say, why don't you get something to eat?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Not a bad idea.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I'd say, God, I've got a horrible headache. You ought to take some aspirin. I mean, you do that, by the way.</p><p/><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: What should the answer be?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Nothing. It's just venting. It doesn't require an answer, doesn't require a suggestion.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It doesn't require a comment. Shut up.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Here's the problem.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: If we don't say anything, any of us, what happens, Tony?</p><p/><p>TONY POWELL, COMEDIAN: Don't you bastards care I'm starving?</p><p/><p>IMUS: No, that's not true.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Twenty nine after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Here are as of today, the 2012 Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association world standings in tie-down roping. Justin Moss in first place $137,000. And Tuf Cooper, he's a current world champion, he's at 98,000. The great Cody O. Now that Joe doesn't rope anymore, he's my favorite roper.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Wyatt too. He's third at 96,000. And Hunter Herrin, Cory Solomon, Shane Hanchey, Clint Robinson, Houston Hutko , the great Fred Whitfield, African-American -- one of the great ropers ever, eight-time world champion. And on and on. Blare Burke, 15th place. So, that's where we are.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: If we were going to go to -- Vegas and have it today, those are the 15 guys who would be roping.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Time for a Bernie briefing at 29 after the hour. And here with that is Bernard McGuirk, good morning, B.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, chief. And President Obama sat down with this Univision people yesterday, the Spanish language TV station, and if he thought he was going to get questions like what's your favorite salsa music, or do you like J-Lo or stuff like that, he was in for a big surprise.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh-oh.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: The dude hit him hard, this Jorge Ramos. He was like the Spanish inquisition.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He's a good reporter.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Very good reporter.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, he is.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, it was like the Spanish inquisition. For a little while, anyway, he asked him about changing things in government. And he gave a bad answer. And then Mitt Romney jumped on it, as Connell alluded to earlier. Here's Obama first and then Mitt Romney right afterwards.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: I've learned some lessons over the last four years. And the most important lesson I've learned is that you can't change Washington from the inside. You can only change it from the outside. That's how I got elected. And that's how the big accomplishments like health care got done.</p><p/><p>FMR. GOV. MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The President today threw in the white flag of surrender again. He said he can't change Washington from inside. He can only change it from outside. Well, we're going to give him that chance in November. He's going outside.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: About as animated and funny as Mitt Romney will get, but it wasn't that bad. And the New York Giants, of course on a tear. Right, boss?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Who cares? Tim Tebow, he's on the cover of \"Vogue\" magazine, he's on the cover of \"The New York Post\" this morning.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Putting his physique on display there. And I'm sure that's going to rile up all the Giants this morning.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: But of course, he's a devout Christian and he tells --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Praise God.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, exactly right. He tells \"Vogue\" magazine what he looks for in a woman. And here's his quote. I've been blessed to have an amazing mom and two amazing sisters, so they set a very high standard. I'll stop right there. What I think of -- when I think of a woman, I don't think of my mom and -- God bless them. God rest them, I should say. But anyway, he goes on and that's what makes him a good guy apparently, obviously.</p><p/><p>Obviously looks play a big part. Looks play a big part. Being attracted to someone plays a big part but there is also much more than that. To me, it is about finding someone who is sweet and kind and that has a servant's heart. It's about finding a girl who likes me for me. And not because of what I do or who I am or the name.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, tasty rat covering that servant's heart.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yep. He did add that she's got to have a booty that's high and tight.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>If it ain't tight, it ain't right.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Bu so, you know, the boy's got some feeling.</p><p/><p>IMUS: There has got to be --</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Can see him saying that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, somebody else to talk about.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: He's got to have a booty.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He seems like a nice guy.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: People can't get enough of -- the front page of \"The New York Post.\"</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. I like him --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Don't be a hater now, chief.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I'm not a hater at all, quite the contrary.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: All right. Well, I can conclude on that because Juan Williams is in the bull pen.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes. Don't you have something else?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: I do. Jimmy Fallon, take a listen to him busting on the President I think from last night.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>JIMMY FALLON, HOST, \"LATE NIGHT\": Here's an election news, during a fund-raiser with Jay-Z last night, President Obama said that he and the rapper have a lot in common because their wives are more popular than they are.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>Well, Jay-Z said, they have a lot in common because neither one of them have a plan to fix the economy.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Jimmy Fallon, that's funny, right? He'll be here in about an hour. He's not going to sing. He's going to talk with us.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p/><p>ANNOUNCER: If you're on PC, you're in the wrong place. IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the FOX Business Network. Now, here's Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Hi, everyone. Now that Apple's iPhone 5 is available, we're finding out what exactly makes the smart phone work. The repair firm I-fix got its hands on one and pried it open to find the device uses chips from Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solutions. The iPhone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus, Logic and its Gyroscope which is used to track its orientation was made by STmicroelectronics. So, keep an eye on stocks of those companies and those who didn't make the iPhone 5 to see their reaction today.</p><p/><p>Shares of Oracle were up slightly in extended trading after first quarter results revealed while the company's traditional software business improved, hardware system sales continue to be a problem. Oracle's earnings were up 11 percent from a year ago to 53 cents a share. In line with estimates, revenue of $8.2 billion fell short of the $8.42 billion estimate. The computer hardware segment fell for a sixth straight quarter.</p><p/><p>Here's a look at commodities. Oil and gold are up.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues after we check the weather now with FOX 5 meteorologist Mike Woods.</p><p/><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, everyone. Looks like we have some wet weather out there but not a ton of it for the country here. We've got low pressure still rotating up around the Great Lakes but it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwestern states, the Northern Plains States all the way down to the Central Mississippi valley area. And then back up towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east. Also a few showers are popping up down around Florida.</p><p/><p>Again, southeast slightly risky in terms of showers and storms. Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms, high temp today, 88 degrees. Phoenix, no rain for you. Sunny skies with a high of 103. Seattle partly cloudy skies with a high of 63. Sacramento, California, we've got some sunny skies there today with a high of 91, still warm. I'm Mike Woods from FOX 5 in New York.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. Twenty one until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I lost my phone and I can't call it because I keep it on --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Vibrate or whatever.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Whatever.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I have no idea where it is. I thought I gave it to Carley, but it could be anywhere.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program --</p><p/><p>RUFINO: I'm still getting him.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, you're still getting him.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Yes -- that little phony shoe thing.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Vince Gill is coming up this morning, talk to him about some stuff, the state of country music and the state of Vince Gill.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And then Neil Cavuto, he's going to be in. We'll talk to him about the state of the country, the economy and all that.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, there's big Romney interview.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>contributor Juan Williams. Good morning, Mr. Williams.</p><p/><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CONTRIBUTOR (on the phone): Good morning, Mr. Imus. I was worried for a second you forgot about me. You didn't know my name? What is this? What's going on over there?</p><p/><p>IMUS: I'm thinking about two or three different things.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: You know, what? You're thinking about beautiful women or something. I guess that's on your mind all the time.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Trying to find my phone.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: (LAUGHING)</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know what I'm reading, which is terrific is O'Reilly's \"Killing Kennedy.\"</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Did you read \"Killing Lincoln\"?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I did.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I liked it. You know, he gave me a copy early on, and I gave one to my son because I liked it so much. And I told him, you know, he can be reluctant even to accept praise, but yes, I thought it was pretty good.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. I wasn't a big fan of that. I didn't read it all because \"Killing Kennedy,\" you know, I was talking about it -- do you mind talking about this or no?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: No. Why would I mind talking about it?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, I don't know. The difference is between, say, Walter Isaacson, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Doug Brinkley, and those people. They tell you about, you know, in the story they tell you about the Cuban missile crisis. So, they write about Khrushchev, O'Reilly does. And he describes him as 5'3,\" about 200 pounds, got a big old mole, gap in his teeth, murdering little bastard. But if it is Doris and all those other people, you've got 43 pages about where he grew up, his sister, his brother, his parent, I mean, stuff that maybe I want to know. But here's -- do you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin of Jack Kennedy?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I think he was the lone assassin if you're asking who pulled the trigger, yes, I do. If you're asking were there other people involved who may have been backing Oswald, funding Oswald, you know, did Jack Ruby have any role to play there, I'm very suspicious of that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, here's what they're trying to do in the book which doesn't annoy me, but is they're trying to set Oswald up -- he describes on page 15, does O'Reilly, Oswald as a crack shot. Well, I was in the Marine Corps at the same time Oswald was.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Sure.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I was in from '57 to '59 on a two-year reserve program. Two years active duty and then reserve. He was in from '56 to '59. So, I qualified for the rifle -- in the same program as he did. And I barely qualified as a marksman. Then, there are three categories, marksman, sharpshooter and expert. So, O'Reilly describes Oswald as a sharpshooter. But in May of 1956, he qualified, did Oswald, barely two points into being designated a sharpshooter. In other words, two fewer points and he would have been a marksman, the lowest category. And then -- pardon me?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Hang on. Hang on. But wait a minute. The idea is he was a trained shooter, Imus.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I mean, so, OK, you can get into your gradations of how skilled he was. But I think Bill's point was this guy didn't just pick up a gun and he was, you know, some schlock who was trying out. I mean, he had been trained in how to fire and he had been qualified, I think that makes some compared to me for example who's never fired a gun.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. But don't sell him to me as a crack shot, which he was not. Because when he tried to assassinate General Walker, he missed him. He was 40 feet from him.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I love your point.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And then he qualified again in 1959 just before he got out. And he qualified barely with a score of 191 as a marksman, the lowest designation. Two fewer points and he would not have qualified. So my only point is yes, he could shoot a rifle better than some bozo on the street. But don't try to sell him to me as being this expert crack shot, because he wasn't. So, that's it.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Right. You may know too much on this count. But anyway, your point is well taken. Especially -- but I think that the larger point is to the reader that this is a guy who was trained in how to shoot.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: And as you point out, not only qualified once but qualified twice is the other way to interpret the exact same events that you just said make you doubt, you know, how good -- he was.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Only an idiot like me would get bogged down in the minutia of that. All right. About the president, about Romney. Let me see if you're guy --</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Do you really want to talk about that? Doesn't sound like it?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, talk about what?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: American presidential politics.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, I don't mind.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I know Romney is not doing so well and I figured you're going to be depressed and upset about it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I don't care. My job is to monitor the freak parade. And he's in it. Anyway, now has the President and the Secretary of State and the national security advisor and these other people, Susan Rice and the rest of them, have they decided now what the attack in Libya was? They first tried to sell it that it was the result of this YouTube movie, which every fool on the planet knew that wasn't the case, particularly falling on September 11. And now when the president is reluctant to use the word \"terrorist,\" I don't know if I've ever heard him utter that word, now they're acknowledging that it was a terrorist attack. So my question for you is, were they initially lying, one? Or did they not know, two? Or, three, were they just assuming or guessing? Or, four, were they waiting until they got more information and thought they would throw up a smoke screen to try to hoodwink us?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think that there was a strong sense that this was terrorism. But again, you know, they don't have a sense of Libya and I think the intelligence background necessary to lay things out. But if you're asking about whether or not they were reluctant to call terrorism what it is, I don't think there is any question. This has been a problem throughout the administration. You know, they talk about manmade disasters instead of terrorism.</p><p/><p>I mean, but that has to do with a mind-set that, you know, again, caution about attacking people, especially Muslims and reluctance to embrace the idea that it's terrorism because somehow that would take us back to the Bush years of the war on terror and they don't want to do that. But that has been the mind-set with this folks from the start, I-man.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. Who's the National Security advisor?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: At the moment.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, no. In October of 1922. Yes, at the moment, Juan.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know, it's Keith Alexander. Isn't that right, Bernie?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That is correct.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. So, neither Bernie nor I had any idea who it was.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Right. Well, I couldn't call the name. You got me.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, wouldn't you think we could do better than that dope empty suit Romney or your guy?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: You mean as Americans?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Somebody to run this country?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. That's what I meant, as Americans. Well, you know, what? We've got political structure. And, you know, this is who's been nominated. And gosh, you know, if you look on the republican side, they went through a lot of people to get here, and this was the decision made. Well, I tell you, you know, yesterday's comment by Ann Romney, you know, stop questioning my husband. Stop the doubts. If you think you can do better, get in the ring, I thought some level of frustration over on that side.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Are you a Christian?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I am.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Are you ready to deal with Jesus maybe having a wife?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: You know, I never had any trouble with it. In fact, you know, there's all these questions about whether or not, in the last supper, that drawing, you know, if that is a woman next to him. It seems to me inevitable. I mean, all the talk about not just Mary Magdalene, but I mean, you know, people that were described as prostitutes and outcasts and the like, I think he was, you know, fully human. Let me just say that, in human form.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning everyone. Apple fans around the world are lining up to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves today, including here in New York City where our own Robert Gray is standing by at Apple's Fifth Avenue store. Robert, describe the scene for us.</p><p/><p>ROBERT GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well Diane, you've got several hundred people lined up outside of the Apple store, normally they're open 24 hours a day seven days a week. They closed it last night just for the event, opens at 8:00 a.m.</p><p/><p>And Jared here is kind enough to join us and tell us why you've been in line here all night long here just waiting to get in to buy the iPhone instead of going this afternoon.</p><p/><p>JARED, APPLE CUSTOMER: I mean, it's about being here for the opening. You know it's about -- I made a couple friends in line. It's about being like the best Apple store in the country, you know.</p><p/><p>It's a fun experience. It's a fun event. Everybody is having a good time. The line is starting to move so we're starting to get kind of excited.</p><p/><p>GRAY: Yes you've got about an hour to go now. You've got your Willie Wonka golden ticket here. Are you pretty happy about that? And also you have to wait until 8 a.m. Local time. You just moved here from Tucson. Are you already ribbing your friends back home that you're going to have yours first?</p><p/><p>JARED: Yes I did. I posted it on Facebook I've been kind of poking at them. I have a few friends that are like really Apple fanatics. And it's kind of a -- its kind of a fun jest. So I'm getting them back you know.</p><p/><p>GRAY: Is there any one particular thing about the iPhone 5 that is drawing you to it aside from the fact that it's just the newest, the latest and greatest?</p><p/><p>JARED: I really like what they've done from the body. The aluminum - - the aluminum body looks really sleek, it's going to be really nice. And the wider screen is -- you can't go wrong.</p><p/><p>GRAY: And what about the connector? We've heard a lot of flap about this the new connector. You're going to have to get all new devices and you know the peripherals to go with it, like alarm clock, et cetera. Is that a problem for you?</p><p/><p>JARED: It's not a problem. I mean, you know people try to jab where they can jab. But it's going to be great. I mean, iPhone, the connector has always been proprietary. It just they're better, they're making it better. They're improving. When technology moves, you've got to move with it. And that's just --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>GRAY: All right.</p><p/><p>JARED: -- that's what you do.</p><p/><p>GRAY: All right, Jared we've got to move too. Diane so yes we'll be following all day for you there. The line is starting to move. Several hundred of folks as I mentioned lined up out here to pay anywhere from $200 up for the new iPhone. Back to you.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Robert Gray making friends at the Apple store. Thanks Robert.</p><p/><p>GRAY: Sure.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: And we're getting earnings in from Darden restaurants now, the parent company of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster is reporting a profit of 85 cents a share just beating the estimate for 84 cents.

In Europe the Financial Times is reporting European Union Authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the ECB. Markets there are mixed with London and Paris both down, Frankfurt holding on to green territory by about six points.</p><p/><p>Let's take a closer look now at what's moving the markets with James Hughes, senior market analyst at Alpari over in London. James the Greek government officials are holding another round of negotiations with creditors in hopes of agreeing to almost 12 billion euros worth of cutbacks. How do you expect this to play out?</p><p/><p>JAMES HUGHES, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, ALPARI: I mean, I think we expect it to play out the same way that we've seen it's done in the past. I mean there's been a lot of negativity around what (inaudible). Greece trying to renegotiate these plans and the issue we've had is that they -- that they have an initial plan, initial measures we're put in place that Greece had to -- had to hit but the goal post has been moved so many times now. There always seems to be another renegotiation of -- of austerity or cuts.</p><p/><p>And I mean we're hopeful of course that Greece is going to agree to something. And -- but I think whether they agree or not is not the key point. It's whether they stick to it which is the key point. And that's been an issue for this for a long time now.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right that's James Hughes from Alpari in London. Thanks so much James.</p><p/><p>HUGHES: All right.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Universal Music Group has won approval from EU antitrust regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion after the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record labels.

So Rob Bartlett, who has no idea about cowboy hats, he says to me, man, that's a great-looking hat.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh God.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And that's the key.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: If a civilian can tell a hat's great, then it's great.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: A layman.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: There you go.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And I got it yesterday from the Man's Hat shop out in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

I told Mike we should go --</p><p/><p>IMUS: I woke up in the fourth quarter about -- fourth quarter just started. It was 26-7. The Carolina Panthers were driving. Apparently they didn't drive anywhere.</p><p/><p>WOLF: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: The Giants have put up 10 more.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So --</p><p/><p>WOLF: The backups were great.

And I don't know who that other guy is. Who is that guy Lou?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Marshall Faulk.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Marshall Faulk.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh yes Marshall Faulk.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Now they're all fine but they're dumb. Every single of them picked the Carolina Panthers -- everyone of them.</p><p/><p>This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING incidentally is sponsored by \"The New York Times\" best-selling author, Mitch (inaudible) new book \"The Timekeeper\" the dude has sold 30 million books. That's a lot of money.</p><p/><p>The Bernie Briefing, by the way, which I neglected to mention last hour, is sponsored by Ramsey Fiat, Route 17, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Go to RamseyFiat.com.</p><p/><p>So I did mention that Vince Gill is coming up. We're going to chat with him. And then Neil Cavuto I ran into Neil downstairs and I had my little bottle of oxygen with me because I couldn't breathe.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: I know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So he was like terrified. Why don't you go home? Because I'm a man, that's why I didn't go home.</p><p/><p>Time for the news now at eight minutes after the hour and here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning Connell.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right, good morning, I-Man.</p><p/><p>We'll start with the campaign. President Obama pressed on some of the failures in his first term, immigration and other things at a forum in Florida hosted by the Spanish language station Univision. The President says he's learned a few things over the past four years.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You can't change Washington from the inside.

Good morning, Mr. Gray.</p><p/><p>GRAY: Hey, I-Man. Good morning.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Where are you?</p><p/><p>GRAY: I'm out in front of the Apple store on Fifth Avenue, and 59th Street, it's normally a 24/7 store here I-Man. You may have gone in the middle of the night but they actually closed it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh they did?</p><p/><p>GRAY: So that they could create. Yes they wanted to manufacture a line. And as you know from back in the day, no one manufactures lines like they do here in New York.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes I've actually been in that store a couple of times.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: Really.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: I'll be darned.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Robert.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Say it, Robert. I'll be darned.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do you have something to report, Robert?</p><p/><p>GRAY: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>Yes, we're out here. Look, there are several hundred people lined up waiting for this new iPhone 5 to go on sale. It's coming out 8 a.m. folks will be rolling in. And they could sell as many as -- as many as 10 million of these by the end of this month alone.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Ok we'll it's a very fine report. Thank you for that important information, Robert.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: What a loser parade.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Those idiots have been camped out there for five nights --</p><p/><p>GRAY: Some of these guys have been out here all week.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Morons.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Big Foot.</p><p/><p>TOM BOWMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Yes sir.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Have you lost your mind?</p><p/><p>BOWMAN: What are you kidding? This is a great story today.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But --</p><p/><p>BOWMAN: And you personalized it as always.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do we have a unique situation here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: We have wall-wall-commercials which is how we keep doing this, which I'm happy that we do have.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So we don't have an inordinate amount of time for Warner to go on and on about Yogi Berra or somebody or Miller Huggins or -- and you know I like Robert Gray. But you go to Robert Gray with no information. Well, I'm standing outside the store. Here we've got a few hundred people. Ok good, great.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Robert Gray all the way.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Miller Huggins is waiting --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>IMUS: I like Robert Gray. He is a terrific reporter. He's got a nice sense of humor. But he gave us zero information. We know --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That isn't fair.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Come on he talked about how many iPhones might be sold and that kind of thing.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes why -- why would these idiots camp out and not wait five, ten days and buy it in the store days later on?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Who knows?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Exactly.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well maybe he knows.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do you know why they do it Robert?</p><p/><p>GRAY: Yes I do we've talked to several of these folks I-Man and some of these guys are big tech fans. And they wanted to be a part of the experience here and the first to have it. We just talked to a guy from Tucson. He wants to have it before his buddies. He's posting it on Facebook. He's going to have the newest, latest and greatest.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: There you go.</p><p/><p>GRAY: And these guys like to have the faster processor, bigger screen. Some of the other phones have already had that for six to nine months so the iPhone is playing catch-up here.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right, there you go.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Robert Gray, the Fox Business Network. Live outside the 59th and Fifth at the Apple store.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Good report dude.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well done Robert.</p><p/><p>IMUS: 12 minutes after the hour. Please stop calling people dude, Imus. It's 12 after the hour. Let's do a little new, more news. And here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning Connell.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right, good morning I-Man. Well, the campaign moves to Nevada today where Mitt Romney will be campaigning, in Virginia where President Obama will be holding a rally.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You shut up.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Here are some numbers that are in, Obama leads the \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC News swing state poll. He's up eight in Iowa, five in Wisconsin and Colorado. The Gallup Daily tracking poll though, dead heat, 47 percent a piece around the country for Mitt Romney and President Obama.</p><p/><p>There are protests today taking place in Pakistan. In fact they've -- they've named it a national day of protests there over this anti-Muslim movie that was produced here in the United States. And the government in Pakistan actually disabling cell phone service, some of their major cities are trying to prevent phones from being used in detonating bombs.</p><p/><p>And then in Syria, President Bashar Assad talking tough, an Egyptian magazine reporting that Assad predicts the defeat of the armed opposition that foreign intervention like the one in Libya will not be repeated there, he said. This, as at least 30 are reported dead in the northern part of the country. Government airstrikes reportedly hit a gas station and caused a huge explosion in Syria.</p><p/><p>Then the surge is over in Afghanistan. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says the 33,000 additional troops that were sent a couple of years ago to Afghanistan have now pulled out of the country. He calls it a very important milestone, says the surge accomplished its goals in Afghanistan.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Really.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: And one other thing for you, I-Man. The Emmys this Sunday but Kelsey Grammar not a nominee. Critics and fans of Grammar's stars show \"Boss\" have agreed that he was snubbed when these Emmy nominations were announced. He recently suggested that his conservative political leanings were the reason.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>KELSEY GRAMMER, ACTOR: I did speculate about the fact that maybe I'm a pretty well outed conservative in Hollywood and maybe there's some energy there. But you know I've since come to think that it hasn't gotten out there enough. I don't know.</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: There you go. Well, Kelsey Grammer thinks he was snubbed there I-Man for the Emmys. And those are your --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: No justice, no peace.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: -- exactly, right, your headlines this morning.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right, hey, Big Foot, load up Tony Robbins and Lady Gaga, ok?</p><p/><p>BOWMAN: Yes sir.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Let's do a business report now at 14 after the hour. And here with that, just ahead of Vince Gill and Bernie with a briefing and Warner with sports is Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.</p><p/><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p/><p>Did you know that the new iPhone 5 goes on sale this morning at 8 a.m.? Maybe we could take a live look at the Apple store here in midtown Manhattan for the lines of people.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Don't be mean.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: All those -- you know why those doofuses line up? Because they've got no woman at home and they've got to be one of the first of their friends to get the new iPhone 5.</p><p/><p>IMUS: They either don't have a woman at home or they've got a woman at home like you.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Or the only woman at home is their mom.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh, the I-Man.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: You know what; no truer thing has ever been said.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: I'll wait on this line for four days to get away from her.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Let's go here.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Is that Jonas?</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Well, it's going to set records.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Ok. That big race in New Hampshire, Nascar this weekend? All right, second race with the chase or whatever</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: I do have something though. The iPhone sells like it does because Blackberry stinks to high heaven. And Blackberry service is actually out today in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. So there is justice in this world.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. A quarter after the hour. Let's do some sports. No, first let's go to Tony Robbins who has some thoughts about Lady Gaga. Good morning, Mr. Robbins.</p><p/><p>POWELL: Good morning, Imus. Lady Gaga is having a physical crisis. She recently put on a couple of pounds. Who am I kidding? I saw her in concert with that big hat and those big glasses. I thought she was Cee Lo Green. She's gone from doing well-choreographed routines to the electric slide. Apparently it's not as taxing.</p><p/><p>Gaga claims that she gained weight eating delicious food at her father's Italian restaurant in Manhattan. That's a relief. I'm glad she wasn't eating her dresses. A bacon muumuu has got to be like what -- 50,000 calories. Eating her clothes would certainly qualify as an unhealthy relationship with food.</p><p/><p>Gaga lives, breathes, sleeps and eats music. She's passionate about music and obviously. I told her to combine her loves. She took my advice and started writing her sheet music on sheet cakes. Share your music with the world but share your cakes with friends. That's the out of the box statement that's made her a superstar.</p><p/><p>Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible. Lady Gaga's goals to go from being an unknown artist to being well, the biggest thing in music. I'd say we've got that covered.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Tony Robbins here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p/><p>All right. Let's do sports at 16 minutes after the hour. Just ahead of Vince Gill later on this morning and Neil Cavuto.</p><p/><p>Sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Here with sports, best sportscaster in the country, Warner Wolf. Good morning Warner.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Thank you very much. Good morning I-Man. Thursday night football in Charlotte. The Giants beat the Panthers, 36-7. It was the story of the backups. Running back Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw -- 113 yards, 20 carries, 2 touchdowns; and wide receiver Ramses Barden playing in place of Hakeem Nicks, 9 receptions for 138 yards. Eli, 288 yards, 1 touchdown, no interceptions; Lawrence Tynes kicks 5 field goals.</p><p/><p>Cam Newton trailing 23-0 in the third quarter and obviously thinking a touchdown was worth 23 points, scored on a 1-yard touchdown and then went into his superman celebration.

He's on fire.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And apparently New York is -- well, come on dude.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, they lead by one.

Yes, sure.</p><p/><p>WOLF: The only drawback is when the fight occurs Mayweather will be 36 and Pacquiao 34.</p><p/><p>In golf, you have the top 30 golfers in the world at that FedEx Cup playoff.

The recall affects vehicles from model years 2007 to 2010. The auto maker says the transmission gear position may not match the gear on the shift gear and that causes vehicles to move when drivers think they're in park.

What up, B.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well, President Obama, boss, candidate Barack Obama back in 2008 promised in no uncertain terms that he would pass a comprehensive immigration reform. He had a Democratic Congress for two years. In any case he's on Univision yesterday and host, Jorge Ramos, again, the Spanish inquisition. He hammered the President on this and listen to the President's answer.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>JORGE RAMOS, HOST, UNIVISION: A promise is a promise. And with all due respect you didn't keep that promise.</p><p/><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Here is what I would say Jorge, is that we've had this conversation before. There's a thinking that the President is somebody who is all powerful and can get everything done. In our branch-- in our system of government, I am the head of the executive branch. I'm not the head of the legislature. I'm not the head of the judiciary. We have to have cooperation from all these sources in order to get something done. And so, I am happy to take responsibility for the fact that we didn't get it done, but I didn't make a promise that I would get everything done 100 percent when I was elected as president.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Of course not.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, we can.

And now here's Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p/><p>KB Home is reporting a surprise profit after two quarters of losses as home prices recovered. The fifth largest home builder says it made 4 cents a share in its third quarter. The company was expected to lose 16 cents a share, but revenue came in a little light at $424.5 million. The estimate was for $430 million. KB Home says potential future housing revenue rose to a four year high and home deliveries climbed 7 percent from last year to more than 1,700. Shares are higher in the pre-market.</p><p/><p>More companies, meanwhile, are rewarding their shareholders with higher quarterly dividends. McDonald's is hiking its quarterly payout by 10 percent to 77 cents a share. Texas Instruments is boosting its dividend by 24 percent to 21 cents a share. And Covidien is increasing its quarterly dividend by 16 percent to 26 cents a share.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right after we check the weather now with Fox 5 meteorologist Mike Woods.</p><p/><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, everyone.</p><p/><p>Looks like we have some wet weather out there, but not a ton of it for the country here. We've got an area of low pressure still rotating up around the Great Lakes but it's bringing showers from the upper Midwestern states, the northern plains states, all the way down into the central Mississippi Valley area and then back up toward the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east.</p><p/><p>Also a few showers are popping up down around Florida. Again, the southeast slightly risky in terms of showers and storms. Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms. High temp today 88 degrees. Phoenix, no rain for you. Sunny skies with the high of 103. Seattle, partly cloudy skies with a high of 63. Sacramento, California, you've got sunny skies there today with a high of 91. Still warm.</p><p/><p>I'm Mike Woods from Fox 5 in New York.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's 22 minutes till the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p/><p>Please welcome to the program, I don't want to embarrass him, but one of the great country singers of all time, songwriters, Vince Gill.</p><p/><p>Good morning, Mr. Gill.</p><p/><p>GILL: How you doing, Donny?</p><p/><p>IMUS: I'm fine. How are you?</p><p/><p>GILL: I'm good. Good to see you.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Fine. Fine. Nice to see you. Thanks for coming in.</p><p/><p>GILL: You bet.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So I was talking this morning, not to patronize you, which I wouldn't do, I said there's a few people who sing who I'd have come in just to talk. You're one of them.</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, thanks.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do you like Dwight Yoakam?</p><p/><p>GILL: I do. I always have. He's a good guy.</p><p/><p>IMUS: A smart guy, too.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes. Smart as a whip.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Crazy. Crazy.</p><p/><p>GILL: He's a little bit crazy, but most talented people are just one tick shy of nuts.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, but good crazy.</p><p/><p>GILL: It's a good crazy.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Kinky Friedman, Delbert McClinton.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And -- but like Montgomery Gentry, I love them, but -- man, they can't put two words together.</p><p/><p>GILL: I wouldn't know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know what I've learned --</p><p/><p>GILL: It's a political year. No comment.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, here's the -- I'm the worst kind of country disc jockey. Really that's what I am at heart.</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, you're one of the last people on earth that love music.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: That's why I love coming seeing you. You know, when I got a new record or something's exciting going on, because I know you'll get it and I know you'll, you know, you'll enjoy it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I just got Dwight's new -- do you care if we talk about other artists?</p><p/><p>GILL: No, I don't.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I just got his new record. It is fabulous.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes, I've heard. I haven't heard it yet, but I've heard people raving about it. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Got a song called \"Waterfall\" that's --</p><p/><p>GILL: I heard a little bit of that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's clever, isn't it?</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So -- and -- because Dwight, he's a man who, when he went out with Sharon Stone, you know, she described him as a dirt sandwich.</p><p/><p>GILL: About as much fun as a dirt sandwich.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Hey, have you ever heard of the Christian rock group Striker.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes, I have.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. This is a tedious story. Maybe it's not tedious. But when my brother, God bless him, and -- was working with the railroad as a breakman, his partner was Phil Sweet.</p><p/><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And Fred and Phil wrote a song called \"I Don't Want To Have To Marry You\" when they were working for the railroad.</p><p/><p>GILL: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And they eventually got it cut. And it went to number one and all that stuff. And Phil married a woman named Janice. And he's a great guy. They live in Las Vegas. And they had two sons, Michael and Robert, and they are Striker.</p><p/><p>GILL: Oh, I didn't know that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: That's neat.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And Christian rock, they are.</p><p/><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And then Michael spent the last -- the past two summers going out singing lead for Boston. It's a small world, isn't it?</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes, it is. You know, ever since I married Amy, everybody thinks I know everything about Christian music, but I don't. I wish I did.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, Amy Grant won a -- won the -- everybody in the country had a crush on her when she was --</p><p/><p>GILL: Oh, yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I remember all -- I remember all these disc jockeys over at NBC years ago. I met Frank Reed -- I don't know if you remember his name or not -- he used to tell me -- he said, have you heard Amy Grant? And I said, no. He said, oh, man, come on here.</p><p/><p>So, what's new with you?</p><p/><p>GILL: Not much. After I married Amy, I used to have to fight my way out of the bars. Now I have to fight my way out of the churches being married to her.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Hey, you built a studio at home.</p><p/><p>GILL: I did. Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. Isn't a studio now just pretty much your laptop or no?</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, pretty much. I mean it can be. But I went a little further than that. Not as big as a commercial studio, but enough to track. And it's really fun because we all kind of gather around in a room and play music together instead of sequester each other off in a booth somewhere where you can't see each other and we're all just playing together. And it's been the greatest experience, this new record, the \"Time Jumpers\" record, that -- I started playing with this band about two and a half years ago. And they're a western swing band.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: Me being from Oklahoma, I was crazy -- I've always been crazy for Bob Wills music and that swing stuff and they would ask me to come in and occasionally sit in and fill in and, you know, if a guitar player couldn't make it, they'd call me up and sub. And little by little they grew confidence in me and said, hey, you want to be in the band. A couple guys quit. And I said, sure. It would be fun. So I talked them into making a record at the house and we decided to put it out. I said, man, we could make a record for nothing. It would be a blast. And so away we went.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Talking with Vince Gill here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p/><p>Weren't you originally in Pure Prairie League?</p><p/><p>GILL: A long time ago. Yes, 33 years ago.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And before that?</p><p/><p>GILL: I played with a guy named Byron Berline. A really great fiddle player. Lived in Los Angeles. Was a session player. Played on Rolling Stones' records and Birds records and all kind of great rock records and was the go-to guy for fiddle out on the West Coast forever and ever and ever. And he had an opening and I was 18 or 19. We moved out there as a kid and started out there.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You just played guitar for a long time, right?</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes. Still do.</p><p/><p>IMUS: No, I know you do. But, I mean, I guess you knew you could sing, but nobody else did or did they?</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, a lot of times those gigs I would get would be because I could sing, too, you know, and in those days if you could find somebody that could multi-task, I guess would be a good word for it, and do a bunch of different stuff, you were a better asset to a band. And so I was always able to play a little bit of everything and could fill in whatever was needed.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What's the state of country music in your view?</p><p/><p>GILL: It's interesting.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You like it or no?</p><p/><p>GILL: I'm not crazy about it. But I'm not supposed to. I'm 55 years old and I'm supposed to like, what, you know, my era did and the era before me. I don't -- I don't dislike it, I just don't necessarily believe that it's -- it's -- the term country music fits it so much.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p/><p>GILL: But, you know, they're young kids and they're following their muse, they're do what they love and I've got no -- I've got no bitterness towards them at all.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, I'm 72 and I be loving that \"Pontoon\" record by Little Big Town.</p><p/><p>GILL: Oh, isn't that cool?</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's a good record, man.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I like Jason Aldean. Come on.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes, he's fun.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: You know, they're rocking, they're -- you know, they're kind of -- they're pretty -- pretty brash. They're, you know, party time and all that stuff. That's just, you know, it's not for me. It's not that I don't like it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Jamey Johnson, of course, he's --</p><p/><p>GILL: Great songwriter.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Speaking about being out where the buses don't run. So -- but he's great, isn't he?</p><p/><p>GILL: He is.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p/><p>GILL: He's a great throwback, you know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: How do you really think is great?</p><p/><p>GILL: Oh, well, I like -- I -- actually, there's a lot of people I love. I think Carrie Underwood sings her brains out.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes. She's a great singer.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I just can't take that screaming.</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, she does -- she will sing hard, but that's -- you've got understand, that's what people are -- that's what they're learning. That's what they're singing.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: From \"Star Search\" and \"American Idol.\" All these shows. It's like grandiose and the big finish and, you know, it's --</p><p/><p>IMUS: I listened to something the other day that -- a duet you did with her. It's good.</p><p/><p>GILL: Oh, the \"How Great Thou Art\" thing?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: That was nice.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Are you really religious? I mean --</p><p/><p>GILL: To some degree, I guess. Probably not to the level of probably what the expectation is of me because I'm married to Amy.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: I feel like a novice, you know, because I haven't had a church life in my adult life. I did as a kid, but my adult life was never conducive to it, only because of my work. I was gone every weekend.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But you believe Jesus is the Son of God?</p><p/><p>GILL: I do.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. And like Mojo Nixon says about Elvis, Elvis is everywhere. And I believe Jesus is everywhere. I mean -- I also know, though, however, not that anybody asked me, but I respect all other religions as well. I --</p><p/><p>GILL: Me, too.</p><p/><p>IMUS: See, I don't think there's just one way to get there.</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, I've traveled the world enough to -- you know, it just seems -- it doesn't seem logical that other parts of the world would know this way. You know, maybe I'm wrong. I have been before.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And now are you prepared for this new information that Jesus may have had a wife.</p><p/><p>GILL: I heard. Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: My observation was, if -- wasn't it her job then to come up with a (INAUDIBLE) -- just idiotic.</p><p/><p>GILL: That explains the missing years.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know Billy Joe Shaver?</p><p/><p>GILL: A little bit, yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes. I think he's one of the great songwriters ever.</p><p/><p>GILL: I do too. Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But there's somebody who is certifiably -- but a sweet man. My (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes, that's my -- you know, that's really my era of the people I love were guys like him, Guy Clark, Jerry Jeff and Rodney Crowell and just those really great songwriters from the '60s and '70s, (INAUDIBLE) Van Zant and Emmy Lou was a great, great mentor to me, and teaching me what great songs were like and who great song writers were, so, yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Bill Anderson, one of the great songwriters ever.</p><p/><p>GILL: No question. Most recorded, probably, in the history of country music.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes. I love him.</p><p/><p>GILL: Even more so than Harlan or any of the others. So, I don't know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: God, wasn't he great, Harlan Howard. Oh, my God. Please.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes. We were good buddies. You know, when I first moved to Nashville, we were great friends and I would sing all of his demos for him, $10 a song.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p/><p>GILL: There was tons of demos of Harlan's and we were great friends.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Before he died, he sent me a CD that he cut of all of his songs.</p><p/><p>GILL: Wow.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That he had written. He just dubbed, you know, (INAUDIBLE). I mean, just everything that he did. And, oh, my God, what a great song.</p><p/><p>GILL: He's a great man. You know, when I was first getting started, he pulled me aside and he said, kid, you're one hell of a guitar player. And I said, well, thanks, Harlan. And he says, and you're a pretty good songwriter, but you're one hell of a guitar player, one hell of a singer, and a pretty good song writer. I said, I get what you're saying.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So you have a new record?</p><p/><p>GILL: Not me, the \"Time Jumpers.\"</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p/><p>GILL: This band does. It came out last week.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Maybe I could pay attention.</p><p/><p>GILL: No, that's cool. I mean it's a fun record. You would really love this record if you like Bill Wills and that swing music. It's an 11 piece bad full of arguably some of the best talent that's ever graced instruments in Nashville, Tennessee. All side me. All guys that played for other people. Session players, things like that. All wanted to have fun on Monday night. So we got together and -- years ago, they did, and started playing every Monday night just for the love of it and fun of it. And we still are. We just made a record.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I can take a little bit of Bob Wills, but it's my contention -- and I know I'm right -- that nobody likes blue grass music, including the people who play it.</p><p/><p>GILL: I think you might get a wrestling match over that one.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, I'm sure I will.</p><p/><p>It's great to see you.</p><p/><p>GILL: You too.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's an honor to have you on the program.</p><p/><p>GILL: Thanks.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're one of my favorites. You're one of everybody's favorites, so - -</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, right back at you.</p><p/><p>IMUS: My wife loves you and my 14-year-old kid loves you and a lot of people do.</p><p/><p>GILL: I appreciate it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: The great Vince Gill.</p><p/><p>You know I played that \"Go Rest High on the Mountains\" you wrote for your brother.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And I -- and thanks for the money you sent to the ranch when Fred died. But --</p><p/><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He's been dead a year. It's still hard to talk about him. I try --</p><p/><p>GILL: I know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I played your record. I tried to talk about it and --</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes, my brother's been gone for 20 years. You know, hard to believe. But, you know, that's --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Why do we -- what is it? Is it -- why do we -- why does people dying have that effect on us? It's part of life.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes. It's because you miss them.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Is it?</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes. I do.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, I guess that is. I mean we're not -- yes, I guess that's what it is.</p><p/><p>All right, man, it's great to see you.</p><p/><p>GILL: You too, buddy.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Vince Gill.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p/><p>We have an update on that Blackberry outage. Research In Motion says service has been restored and things are back to normal. The company had reported an outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p><p/><p>Checking the markets now. Stocks in Asia rose as the release of that new iPhone gave the telecom sector a boost. Hong Kong led the way with a 0.7 percent gain. In Europe, the Financial Times is reporting European Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank. Markets there are currently mixed. London still to the downside by about three points, but Paris is back in the green, up almost 10 points and Frankfurt's up by 51.</p><p/><p>Here in the U.S., we've had green arrows across the board all morning. Dow futures are up by 43, the S&amp;P's up by about four, and the Nasdaq's up by seven.</p><p/><p>So now that Apple's iPhone 5 is available, we're also finding out what exactly makes this smartphone work. The repair firmiFixit got its hands on one, pried it open and found that the device uses chips from Qualcomm, Avego Technologies and Skyworks Solutions. The phone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus Logic. And its gyroscope, which is used to track the orientation, was made by STMicroelectronics. You can keep an eye on stocks of those companies and those who didn't contribute to the iPhone 5 to see how they react today.</p><p/><p>Here's a look at commodities now. Oil and gold are to the upside. Oil's up by about 60 cents, around $93 a barrel. Gold's up $6 at $1,776 an ounce.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p/><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: IMUS IN THE MORNING continues here in the next hour with Neil Cavuto from the Fox Business Network. He had a recent interview with Mitt Romney here. So we'll talk to -- the I-man will talk to Neil about all that's going on in the world.</p><p/><p>And this portion of IMUS IN THE MORNING is brought to you by \"A Wanted Man\" by Lee Child, now available in hard cover and e-book from Delacorte. Now five minutes till the hour.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Here with -- with some thoughts on pot --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Is Brian Wilson, on the genius of the Beach Boys.</p><p/><p>Good morning, Mr. Wilson.</p><p/><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Good morning, Opie.</p><p/><p>I hear there's a movement to decriminalize marijuana, which is good, because pot never did anything criminal to anybody, just made them feel good. People say it's a gateway drug, which I guess it is. It's a gateway to a beautiful world of pretty flowers and beautiful music and little bunnies who sing pretty songs and give out candy.</p><p/><p>But it's not like you're going to smoke a doobie and next thing you know you're mainlining smack or anything. Of course it depends on how strong your dope is. Like I just got a lid of northern lights white widow wonder woman. You don't even have to smoke it. You just hold a butt in your hand for 10 minutes and once the oil gets into your pours, you're a bottle rocket, man. I think it also might have been sprayed with PCP and Easy Off, because after I did a half a bong's worth last night, a genie appeared and told me my oven was magically cleaned.</p><p/><p>But legalization would be good for the economy, not just for the tax they could collect on the (INAUDIBLE) itself, but for all the sales of paraphernalia. It'd create jobs making rolling papers, Zip-loc bags, Twinkies. If they had made weed legal, we could balance a budget by 4:20 the next afternoon.</p><p/><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: Nice.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: And I'll be sitting in my sandbox with my KCO keyboard writing a new song for the cute little bunny who gives out the candy.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. Apple fans around the world are lining up to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves around the world today here in New York City.</p><p/><p>The door should be opening sooner, and Robert Gray is standing by at Apple's fifth avenue store. Robert, what is it like out there?</p><p/><p>ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS: Well, Diane, I don't know if you can hear the cheers, they're audible behind me.</p><p/><p>Apple employees are outside, greeting the first of the 500 folks who have been camping out here.</p><p/><p>And the crowd has been swelling as the sun has being rising over Manhattan this morning, waiting to get in to buy the iPhone 5.</p><p/><p>The store behind me is not only open 24 hours, seven days a week, they did close it last night.</p><p/><p>Not opening until 8 a.m., that is the time that each Apple store in each time zone has been opening in local time.</p><p/><p>So, we've had folks here from Arizona, saying that they're facebooking and tweeting their friends back in Arizona.</p><p/><p>Boasting that they're going to get their hands on the iPhone before those guys can. And you can hear the crowd starting to cheer even more there, as I said, some 500 folks here.</p><p/><p>The new iPhone 5 -- sold out two million, pre-selling in an hour's time. It's expected to be the fastest and widest rollout yet for Apple, nine nations have the iPhone selling it.</p><p/><p>That's the most to participate in it and what we've seen and, analysts saying that they've stocked piled as many as 10 million units, that's about $6.4 billion worth of inventory by the way.</p><p/><p>And they're expected according to some analysts to sell as many as 10 million, Ben Stevens saying, they could sell 13 million before the end of this month.</p><p/><p>Now, the new phone does boosts faster, processing speed, it works on the 4 GLTE network where you can get that.</p><p/><p>It also -- it has an enhanced camera, the Siri voice command, it would give you turn-by-turn navigation, you can post to Facebook.</p><p/><p>You can also book reservations on open table but critics point to the mapping features saying that they're incomplete, there's been some errors there, and a lot of hoopla and negative flap about the connectors.</p><p/><p>Which have short meaning that all of those i-gadgets you have there, work with iPhones, you're going to have to go out and buy new ones, although there're some analysts who say we're moving to Bluetooth.</p><p/><p>Anyway, it may not be a big issue, down the line it will be though immediately and Diane, we should also point out a robust secondary market for iPhones.</p><p/><p>If you have an iPhone 4s, still under warranty, there are websites out there, vili.com is one and the CEO telling me, they've seen interest triple in the past week alone.</p><p/><p>You'll get about 260 bucks for your old iPhone 4s, that will about cover the fees, you don't have to pay AT&amp;T to upgrade.</p><p/><p>If you're going to buy one, you can get one, it'll cost you about 300 bucks, but that's still less than the new ones.</p><p/><p>Which started 199 with a two-year contract. Back to you.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Robert Gray outside the Apple store, thanks, Robert.</p><p/><p>GRAY: You're welcome.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: And as Apple focuses on the release of the iPhone 5, Research In Motion is focusing on a blackberry outage.</p><p/><p>The company now says service has been restored and things are back to normal after reporting an earlier outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p><p/><p>Let's look at the markets now, here in the U.S., Futures have been in the green across the board all morning, Dow Futures are now up by about 41 points, the S&amp;P is up by almost four, the Nasdaq is up by eight.</p><p/><p>In Europe, the financial times is reporting European Union Authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p/><p>You can see markets there are currently mixed, and now let's take a closer look at what's moving them with European markets analyst Jan Randolph.</p><p/><p>He's a director of Sovereign Risk at IHS Global Insight. Now Jan, according to this financial times report, Spain and these European authorities that it's talking to, are hoping to unveil this bailout plan possibly in about a week.</p><p/><p>How do you expect investors to respond if that happens?</p><p/><p>JAN RANDOLPH, DIRECTOR, SOVEREIGN RISK, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT: I think positively.</p><p/><p>I think they're expecting it, I think the lower borrowing costs we've seen from Spain, in anticipation of the ECB bond buying and the bailout fund being made available.</p><p/><p>I think it will be a bailout light though, not a fully fledged bailout though, that will be far too much money.</p><p/><p>The trick, you can call it that, is to keep private sector on board in terms of refinancing the Spanish state and to encourage more.</p><p/><p>I think that's the trick and I think the package will be designed for that purpose.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right, we'll see if they can do that. That's Jan Randolph at IHS, thanks so much, Jan.</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: Thank you.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: And Universal Music Group has won approval from EU anti-trust regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion. After the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record labels.</p><p/><p>Universal says the assets to be sold amount to 30 percent of EMI's global sales. Citigroup is selling EMI after they acquired the music group when Vita firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the investment bank.</p><p/><p>Here's a look at commodities now, oil and gold still up, oil is up by about 74 cents around $93 a gallon. Gold is up 6 bucks at 1,776 an ounce.</p><p/><p>Coming up this hour, Imus' guest will be our own Neil Cavuto and now, here's the i-man live on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So big foot says to me, of all the people we've ever had on the program, two of the nicest, perhaps the nicest, Vince Gill --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p/><p>IMUS: And Levon Helm. So, Vince Gill is, that man, that's an American treasure there, I'll tell you that right now.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, here's what I'm trying to understand, Bernard, Connell, anybody. Warner, anybody? Dagen? First, the administration said, regarding the attack on Libya.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That it was all the fault of this hideous movie that was on YouTube and -- then we had people like K.T. McFarland and others on this program say, that they believed the attack was essentially nonsense.</p><p/><p>Although it may have served as a convenient excuse, but the anniversary of 9/11 had a lot more to do with it.</p><p/><p>And now we're being told, I guess, that no, the administration now says, well, it was a terrorist attack.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, here is my question. Did they know that -- did the President use the word terrorist, by the way?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. Has he ever?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Has he ever used the word period?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, does he believe that there's terrorism in the world?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh, yes, he's used --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sure --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: The word certainly --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, OK, all right. Does -- so did they use the movie as a convenient excuse until they could develop all of the facts and find out what really happened? Or as opposed to saying we don't know, which would mean they lied to us.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, sort it out for me, start with you, Bernie?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well, they went out as Susan Rice, the U.N. Ambassador on Sunday, she went, did the tour and proclaimed, pretty much, no uncertain terms, that it was all about the movie.</p><p/><p>And which seemed premature and a lot of people said as John McCain said, you know there was a spontaneous demonstration she said, and John McCain said you don't bring RPG's to a spontaneous demonstration.</p><p/><p>And sure enough, it comes out later, <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>now reporting that there was an al Qaeda guy who was released from Gitmo in 2007.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Who was behind the attacks. And so, it makes you wonder how stupid -- I mean, didn't they know that that would come out? They must have known, or at least should have considered that it might have come out when they put out Susan Rice to say these stupid things.</p><p/><p>And it did come out and now they're backtracking, Jay Carney said, yes, it was an act of terror. And so, they look dead, they shot themselves in the foot --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Once again.</p><p/><p>IMUS: The president's conduct to foreign policy is laughable and then my guy, the suit dummy --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Romney.</p><p/><p>IMUS: His comments in the wake of it were idiotic as well. Shut up until you know something. By the way, just butt out.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, but to mislead the American people --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Or what I said --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Because it would look bad politically, so, you can't --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Say that the GM is alive and Bin Laden is dead sort of puts a monkey wrench into all that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I understand.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: I mean that's sort of insulting --</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's what I wondered, so --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well, that's what the critics are saying that, you know, they're trying to change -- oh, it's much easier for the administration to come out and say what Susan Rice said.</p><p/><p>It's kind of interesting that she was put out there. Right, the President has been very careful on what he's personally said about this.</p><p/><p>Even yesterday, as you said, he didn't use the word terrorism, it was Jay Carney, his spokesman, not him.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, there we are. Neil Cavuto -- I mean, and these are the two guys we've got running.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I mean, it's just -- all right, eight minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p/><p>Neil Cavuto is coming up, I saw him this morning, when I walked in the building and it was before 5:30 a.m.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Wow.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And he looked cute and perky down there in the lobby and he got all exercised hysterical because I had my little oxygen tank with me because I couldn't breathe this morning so --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Got to get by.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What is it you're going to do?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What is it you're going to do? So, all that's going on, and then of course last night's football game, we're going to listen to Warner Wolf and that dope Gunz --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Hey, come on.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Or any of the guys on the pre-game show --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p/><p>IMUS: On the NFL network, which by the way is a disaster.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But Rich Eison and that dope Deion Sanders and Michael Irvin and --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Marshall Faulk?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Marshall Faulk and that dope, that fat dope -- why is the, why is the name calling necessary?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Simply --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Steve Mariucci --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: It's better --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Every single one of these dopes --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Picked the tail out of Panthers across the board. And the Giants won 36 to 7.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Now what?</p><p/><p>WOLF: I told Gunz I'm going to watch out for these reserves --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, God, you're a disgrace.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On that, no --</p><p/><p>IMUS: What are the Yankees doing?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Now, the Yankees lead by one with 13 to play --</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right --</p><p/><p>WOLF: And they all play, Orioles play losers and so do the Yanks.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Is there any other race any place in the country?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, we have a two-game lead in the White Sox and Tigers.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's really it, because --</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Now the A's are four back --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, fine, we don't need to run that --</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's it --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh, OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right, ten minutes after the hour, let's do some news, Bill Clinton is here, going to talk about -- what are you talking about?</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: Monica Lewinsky's new book.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man, I can't wait to read this, come on, dude.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know, Juan Williams is right. I'm probably making too big a deal out of O'Reilly's characterization of Lee Harvey Oswald as a sharpshooter.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I don't know, but it just annoys me, but other than that, the book is great, \"Killing Kennedy\". All right, let's do the news, good morning Connell.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, i-man. Well, we're keeping an eye on Pakistan this morning because there are protesters on the streets over there.</p><p/><p>One of the things they won't be able to use their cell phones because the government blocked cell service in major cities, worried that phones might be used to detonate bombs.</p><p/><p>And speaking of, you know that movie --</p><p/><p>IMUS: People living in mud huts --</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: I mean is it --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Living in dirt and they've got cell phones.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: If these people put this kind of energy into being industrious --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: And you know, building up their -- you know, it's unbelievable. Just relax, man, go to work.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Like a fool, I'm going to have Gunz and Warner pick the games coming up here.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: OK, good --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Right.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well, today is a national day of protest in Pakistan against that movie, that -- you know, you mentioned produced here in the United States.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Listened to Ann Romney for a second, she was on a radio show in Iowa asking Republicans to stop attacking her husband.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you say to your fellow Republicans who are --</p><p/><p>ANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY: Stop it. This is hard, you want to try it, get in the ring.</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: You want to try it, get in the ring, is what she said.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, well, I mean, I mean, I appreciate her depending her husband.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: She's a nice woman and all that, it's just --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's it.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well, let's wait until after November before we start with the second guessing with the critics, I mean, not you chief. But I'm talking about some of these supposed Republican allies.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's right. .</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: We're in a battle here, come on. Whose side you want?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Speaking of which, the polls 47 percent apiece, dead heat in the daily tracking poll from Gallop yesterday, but Romney's problem has been in these swing state polls.</p><p/><p>Another one out from the \"Wall Street Journal\" \"Nbc News\", it's Obama up eight points in Iowa, leading by five points both in Wisconsin and in Colorado.</p><p/><p>Here's the question for you, who do you think had the most watched convention speech? Well, it turns out Joe Biden, the Vice-President. 43.6 million people for what it's worth, President Obama close second followed by Mitt Romney, Bill Clinton and Marco Rubio.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, of course, because we thought it was going to be a car wreck.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: That's right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Tuning in, in case --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Thirteen after the hour, let's do some business news, and here with that is Dagen McDowell.

So --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Seventeen after --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: It's fast --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, terrible --</p><p/><p>WOLF: It's the deal --</p><p/><p>MCSSHANE: All right, Warner.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Seventeen after the hour, I'm coughing like I'm a mental patient.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Bernie has got a briefing coming up, what's there, B?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Got Bill Clinton, Jon Stewart, David Letterman and sexual hijinks at \"Good Morning America\". You're going to like that one --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, sexual hijinks where?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: \"Good morning America\", the \"Abc\" morning show there.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right, baby. All right, please welcome now, speaking of that to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, former president of the United States, Bill Clinton, good morning, Mr. President.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: Well, morning, i-man. Well, it was only a matter of time, but I guess $12 million is $12 million. So Monica Lewinsky is going to publish her memoir with all the gory details.</p><p/><p>Every sleazy, sticky, creepy, crawly bit of nastiness, and once it hits the bestseller list, Bill O'Reilly is going to be able to start writing his next book, \"Killing Clinton\".</p><p/><p>Because Hillary will shoot me. It's bad enough that the love ick on the blue dress was made public for a while there.</p><p/><p>I even thought they were going to put it on display and this masonian next to Lincoln's stovepipe hat.</p><p/><p>But now, Monica is going to reveal all my sex secrets, like my insatiable appetite for three-way sex. Which isn't what you were thinking is, is it just really?</p><p/><p>I only know three ways of doing it, four, if count missionary, but having somebody else in the picture, that's just sick, unless the extra person is A, a woman and B, hot.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: But Monica is also going to reveal my fondness for sex toys. OK, one time I used some legos to build a little garage for my weiner.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>But it wasn't, you know a butt plug the size of a lava lamp.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>But what really hurts is the allegation that she has to do this because she needs to make a living and can't get a job because of me, which is just not true.</p><p/><p>She could get a job tomorrow, in a cigar store --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: Or better yet, a shoe store because you know, she's real good on her knees.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, 19 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. From their brand new album, \"Hillbilly Jedi\", Big and Rich. That was a good record.</p><p/><p>And my baby gone.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know, I never thought about it, about women's hair thinning. I thought only men got bald until I saw a bald-headed woman. And you do not want that in your house, a bald-headed woman, that is not good.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, you can fix that though, because from Chamonix, a good outfit you can trust them.</p><p/><p>They offer a money-back guarantee of all of their products, the Esotique, the T-Gen, the Heart Factors Plus.</p><p/><p>They now have this stuff, this serum called ProVia, p-r-o-v-i-a, it's all natural hair serum from Chamonix, a money-back guarantee, you rub this in your gored there for two or three weeks and whatever.</p><p/><p>And your hair is going to get thicker and will look better.

It is guaranteed to work, if you will call now, they'll throw in a free month supply of this stuff.</p><p/><p>Or you could rub it on your hair until you make yourself insane. 800-754- 6980, call and get it.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Hi, everyone, I'm Diane Macedo.

Good morning Mr. McGuirk.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, Mr. Imus. And the big dawg Bill Clinton was on with your friend Jon Stewart last night and he was boring, he was just flat-out.</p><p/><p>He made Charlie Rose sound like Mad Dog Russo, he was so boring. But, listen to Jon Stewart do his best impersonation of Monica Lewinsky journalistically.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>JON STEWART, COMEDIAN &amp; TELEVISION HOST: Give any good speeches lately or? How was that -- how did that feel at the convention?</p><p/><p>Could you tell that you were crushing it as you were doing it? Did you, did you feel that?</p><p/><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes and no. But -- because I didn't want to talk down to people, I wanted to explain what I thought was going on.</p><p/><p>STEWART: That's what was so stunning, I think. That's why it was such a bracing speech. The phrase you mentioned earlier about getting the facts right, and they would have -- you would attach numbers to them that were real.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>I thought it was a bold choice on your part.</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: I mean he's going to have to send his jackets to the cleaners after that, I mean, just figuratively, it was sort of nauseating. But --</p><p/><p>IMUS: What? There was not any --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: The way he just -- I mean, did he ask him about the memoir that's coming out? --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, no --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Memoir --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Stewart was jerking his chain.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: No, he wasn't.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, he was.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: I saw it. He was --</p><p/><p>IMUS: He wasn't jerking his chain?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Not at all. He was telling him what a great speech you gave and could you put facts out there, unlike Mitt Romney --</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're telling me Stewart wasn't kidding with that?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: No, not at all. That was a straight-up journalistic --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Didn't he sound like he was kidding --</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: I mean, I didn't see it, so, I mean, I was there?</p><p/><p>IMUS: He didn't sound like he was kidding?</p><p/><p>POWELL: Little tongue in cheek to me.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's what he sounded, like a little tongue in cheek. Really?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: No, absolutely not.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, because you're a hater.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: No, because I actually watched it, I saw it. Now, let's move on here, boss, because the clock is ticking and I know you want to get Mr. Cavuto on.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: And we got us a little sex scandal over at \"Good Morning America\".</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: You know, locally here in New York City, you have this news anchor on \"Channel 7\", \"Wabc\" Liz Cho.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, my God, that's a home wrecker there.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well, excuse me. She and this dude, Josh Elliott, who's an anchor on \"Good Morning America\", they're apparently an item. I'm going to read from the \"New York Post\" --</p><p/><p>IMUS: I thought she was married.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well, she was.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: This is what the \"New York Post\" page six writes this morning. \"After we revealed yesterday that 41-year-old beauty Cho, the co-anchor of \"Wabc TV\" in New York, split with her husband and moved out of their Yonkers mansion three months ago.</p><p/><p>She insisted through friends that they're just friends. She's 41, he's 41 and they say \"That this guy Elliott is a regular visitor to Liz's new apartment on west 90th street, baby.</p><p/><p>And he's been spotted leaving the building in the morning. He's even been picked up from Cho's part to head to work at \"Good Morning America\" where he works as a news anchor.</p><p/><p>Good morning Elizabeth. But they insists that the relationship began after she moved out of the Yonkers mansion.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Right, it has to be true, right?</p><p/><p>RUFINO: All right.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, but in any case, you know this guy Josh Elliott, he's sort of in Kris Humphries area, he hosts this unwatchable \"Good Afternoon America\" show --</p><p/><p>IMUS: No, I don't --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: With Lara Spencer. Well, anyway this is blooming over --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Stuff about praising anchor, no, I don't.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: And they're beating the crap out of the \"Today Show\" by the way - -</p><p/><p>IMUS: Not good, I'm happy about that.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's all you got?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well, I do have another piece of David Letterman clip, busting on Jay Leno and Mitt Romney, but --</p><p/><p>IMUS: No, he's a creep --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: We can save it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Thirty minutes after the hour, and here, Cavuto is next.</p><p/><p>One of Neil's favorite songs.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network. And now, here is Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. General Motors is recalling more than 426,000 Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn sedans in the U.S. due to transmission problems. The recall affects vehicles model years 2007 to 2010.</p><p/><p>The automaker says the transmission gear position may not match the gear on the shifter and that could cause the vehicle to move when drivers think they're in park. GM says it's aware of four crashes due to the problem, but no injuries reported as of now.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, the recall news after General Motors announced it has reached an agreement with the Canadian Autoworkers Union over a labor contract. Under the tentative four year deal, GM will add a third shift to its flex line at its Ontario facility.</p><p/><p>The automaker had planned to shutdown that plant three-shift consolidated line next June, but will operate with at least one line until June of 2014. The CAW continues to negotiate a deal with Chrysler after it already reached one with Ford earlier in the week.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues now after we check the weather with Fox 5 meteorologist, Mike Woods.</p><p/><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, everyone. Looks like we have some wet weather out there, but not a ton of it for the country here. We've got an area of low pressure still rotating around the Great Lakes, but it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwest and Central Mississippi Valley area.</p><p/><p>And then back towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east and also a few showers popping up around Florida again, southeast, slightly risky in terms of showers and storms. Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms and high temp today, 88 degrees.</p><p/><p>And Phoenix, no rain for you, sunny skies with a high of 103 and Seattle partly cloudy skies with a high of 63. Sacramento, California, you've got sunny skies there today with a high of 91, still warm. I'm Mike Woods from Fox 5 in New York.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right, it's 36 minutes past the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Please welcome to the program, senior vice president, anchor manager, Fox Business News, <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Channel, a man who sadly calls himself the financial factor, Neil P. Cavuto. What does the P stand for?</p><p/><p>NEIL P. CAVUTO, FOX BUSINESS: Patrick.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Good morning, Mr. Cavuto.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Good morning, Mr. Imus.</p><p/><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It was scary bumping into you this morning.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, I had my little oxygen tank with me.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You kind of looked like Hannibal Lector being driven in on a gurney and I thought, is he up to doing the show today? But here you are, encouragement to all us.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, anaerobic, but I recover quickly and I don't need oxygen just to sit around and talk.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I admire that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Happy birthday tomorrow.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: How did you know that?</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's my job to know those things.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Thank you very much.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, you like the Vince Gill interview?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I liked it very much, I'm a big fan of his and I thought you did a very good job. A lot of people, you know, when you interview stars it's always tough. You do a fawning interview or you do a revealing one particularly like the things about your brother, how tough that is and trying to get a handle on it, very real. I liked it very much.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So I asked you off the air if you liked Romney. Do you?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I do, personally I like him a lot.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It doesn't bother you that he's a dope, right?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: He's not a dope.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK, he's not a good campaigner, is he?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think that remains to be seen. The election hasn't happened yet.</p><p/><p>IMUS: No, sir. Do you think that these leaked videos, these missteps that they've each made, is going to make a difference when people vote?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You don't?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I do not. I think in the end, it always is the economy. I think that's what-- we could have extenuating circumstances, the Middle East explosion, could have the impact, but almost every U.S. election is decided by the economy.</p><p/><p>How good people feel, how maybe not so good people feel and we're always willing to entertain switching horses mid stream when an incumbent is battling a tough economy, but we've really got to see the other horse.</p><p/><p>I think in 1980 when the polls were similarly tight between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. A lot of people liked Jimmy Carter, frustrated with the economy, but they were more than willing to entertain an alternative and along came Ronald Reagan to appeal to alternative.</p><p/><p>IMUS: How many people vote for the person who they like the best?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think it plays a part.</p><p/><p>IMUS: How big a part?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, I do think it helped George Bush, many polls were done on the debate between he and Al Gore and then later on between he and John Kerry. And I think most people said who won the debates?</p><p/><p>And a lot of them said, particularly in 2004, with John Kerry, who do you like more or relate to more? George Bush. I'm not saying that's always the case, but it does help if people feel you're either more approachable or likeable.</p><p/><p>And I think in 1960 from the television critics later who said that Richard Nixon was sweating and detached and John Kennedy looked relaxed and smooth. These things on some level do connect for people.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Talking with Neil Cavuto -- talking with Neil Cavuto here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. It's 5 until the hour, you know what you ought to do here at Fox?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: What's that?</p><p/><p>IMUS: An interesting experiment because my wife mentioned this to me.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: She wants to have sex with you, by the way.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Who doesn't?</p><p/><p>IMUS: I don't. Wants to have sex with you --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And go ahead.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Anyway.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Come on, Don, tell me. Go ahead, please.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, I forgot --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: At least say something, you guys.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Here is what you should do.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Like an interview by Rainman.</p><p/><p>IMUS: When is the first debate, October 1st?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think the 3rd.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's the day he hit the home run. Here is what you should do. Please don't interrupt when I'm talking with Mr. Cavuto, Warner. I'll come over there and beat on you like a rented mule. Just kidding. You should get a group of people.</p><p/><p>Frank -- You should do it. Get a group, have them listen to the audio feed and don't let them watch it and have the group just watch it on television and then poll each group to see who won. Who they think won.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: That's not a bad idea.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It is a good idea isn't it?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It's a very good idea.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Because Deirdre said to me -- don't you hate it when guys quote their wives. You know, that means they're so p-whipped.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And she's insane for putting up with you.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Absolutely. Because you get distracted who looked and --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes, yes. And history bears that out. I mean, people who, I guess, were listened in to the Nixon-Kennedy debate thought Nixon, and Bush and Al Gore. That was a little more debatable than Kerry and Bush.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Should I call Roger and --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Please do, please do. I'm not going to act on this because I actually think the idea is silly.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do you really?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes. I do.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You do?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think 90 percent of people are going to be watching and not listening.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, you're just, I don't know, you're just -- I don't know.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, I just, I think in 1960, it would have been a brilliant idea, but last time I checked --</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's a good idea now just to see. It's 18 until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Did you read \"Killing Lincoln?\"</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I did read it. It's a great book.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But I'll tell you what is a terrific book \"Killing Kennedy.\"</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I haven't -- I know it's out or will be out, but-- I really enjoyed \"Killing Lincoln\", the way he built it up and x number of days to live and I thought when I first opened it, we know what happened in the end.</p><p/><p>But he didn't do a great job and see what the Kennedy book, but I think he's got -- he could a series on his hands. I don't know how you handle Philmore, getting Philmore, but --</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's enormously entertaining and there's no heavy lifting, not a --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think it's a very good point. A lot of the stories, Brinkley, I love dearly and Harry Truman, 900 pages on and on and all great, but you can make this fun and engaging.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And accessible.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It's a way to do it. I didn't see the kids' version that's out but --</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's pretty good, too. It's pretty good, too, so, do you think he writes any of it.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think he does.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What's --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: -- his show.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That doesn't make any difference.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No, it doesn't, but when you say does he write his stuff? Of course, he writes his stuff.</p><p/><p>IMUS: How is that demeaning --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You say does he write the book.</p><p/><p>IMUS: As a journalist, I have a --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Excuse me? Excuse me.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's 17 until the hour here in the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Are you a sports fan?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Not at all.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I heard you guys go through the Sunday games. I guess these are football games? Terrific, no offense guns and Warner but --</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's fine, but do you ever watch sports on television?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I have the attention span of a gnat. I watch the highlights. I said, why can't the games be like the highlights?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do you ever watch Sports Center?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Where do you get the highlights?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Passing around the news or online, but I'm not really -- I'm afraid I'm not really into it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, do you watch television?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I know this is going to sound elitist, but I really don't. I'm just, it's not --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Mr. Cavuto --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I watch you, of course, I mean, that's a staple. Connell and Dagen and flip over --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Mr. Cavuto is on at 4 in the afternoon on the <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Channel and 8 p.m. and do you think that --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I want to come back at you with anger, but I saw you with the oxygen tank and go lightly no need to be mean.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's a quarter until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: This is three times in this hour with this interview, you relay the time. It's always fascinating to me why you do that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I'm doing a radio program.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I know that. I know, but -- like I say there are clocks in those cars, right?</p><p/><p>IMUS: I can stop giving the time.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: OK, more time for me.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Bernie, put a call in to Bob -- anyway do you think Obama is a socialist?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No. I think he likes big government. I think he likes more big government and espouses the view much like FDR in 1932, government the only way to get us out of the mess and a lot more people are beholden to the government as a result of that.</p><p/><p>And he's got a pretty good base of people who would vote for him as a result and I think that probably was what Mitt Romney was inelegantly getting at. But we all remember, you know, but FDR got re-elected in a landslide in 36 even though the economy still, still was pretty bad.</p><p/><p>IMUS: As ours does.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And you would think that one of the things that Romney could get some traction and I think, that you asked, I think --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Your thoughts are very valuable to me.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I think the day that Romney gets elected, the economy is better just by -- he doesn't have to do anything, do you agree with that?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, you have to do something. You're popping up in a different --</p><p/><p>IMUS: That wasn't the question.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You mean, well, it's a stupid point. Sounds like Godzilla, January 20th just by virtue of being Godzilla being in the office because it's not Barack Obama, things are better.</p><p/><p>IMUS: If it makes you feel like a bigger person, which you're --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: OK, you know, I could lose weight, you will always be evil.</p><p/><p>IMUS: To make me feel bad by calling me a list of names, but don't you think the way the markets would react --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It's always fine until --</p><p/><p>IMUS: And the financial community.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That the things would, people would feel better and I know he has do something, your suit dummy candidate and mine, but wouldn't have to do anything, but just get elected and it would be better. Do you think that's true?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I don't, I don't, obviously if the nation turns to the challenger to throw the incumbent out of office. It's hoping what you said. And remember, electing Ronald Reagan in a landslide didn't bring results, in fact, the recession many more years and jobs lost until we had to boom in '82.</p><p/><p>Coming out of that so things take time, I'm not subscribing to the screw that automatically things are better. They're ready to do well if we don't keep what we're doing and stop with a new guy in there. But you have to do stuff.</p><p/><p>You have to put up some initiatives that will change the direction. Ronald Reagan did, and you know, the question would be for Romney administration, if it were to happen, whether it would.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Is there a way now to know -- is there a way for you to know who will win the election?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I have no idea.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do you have a gut sense?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I do, but I'm not going to share that with you. I will say this - -</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're really a creep.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: That's lovely. I only relate this to you. I think I told you this before. When I went to Wisconsin to cover the recall election, polls going into that weekend had dead even. I think it had it dead even and we know at that Walker won by six points.</p><p/><p>Now, I had a theory and I could be very wrong that conservative support is understated in some of the state polls, maybe with unwinding a bit it's beyond the margin of error, but I do think these states apparently Mitt Romney is going to get blown out in, I don't subscribe to that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're going to get to the point eventually, right?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I just told you. And I think the polls in the battle ground state understate Romney's support.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Hope you're right.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And when you say Romney's my man you always say that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But then you disparage him.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Keeping it real.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And for every wonderful interview like Vince Gill and then you do one like you did with Frank Rich.</p><p/><p>IMUS: My job is to keep it real, right, Bernie?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Frank Rich interview, just kept it real.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Keeping it real.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Thank you very much for --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: This is it?</p><p/><p>IMUS: You were on for 12 minutes.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: That's 12 minutes of my life. I'm never getting back.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And so does the audience.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACEOD: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. Let's take a look at the markets. In Europe, the \"Financial Times\" is reporting that European Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p/><p>Markets there are now mixed with London down by about 5 points. Paris is up 10 and Frankfort is up about 64. Here in the U.S., we have seen green arrows across the board all morning. Dow futures are up by 56. The S&amp;P is up by about 5 and the Nasdaq is up by 13.</p><p/><p>Now that Apple's iPhone is available, we're also finding out exactly what makes the smartphone work. The repair firm fix it, got one open and chips from Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solution.</p><p/><p>The iPhone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus Logic and its gyroscope, which is used to track its orientation was made by ST Microelectronics. Keep an eye on those stocks and those are the companies that didn't participate in the iPhone to see the reaction today.</p><p/><p>The world's biggest retailer is looking to do business in India. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reports Wal-Mart hopes to open its first stores in the country within two years. That move comes after the government last week agreed to allow international supermarket chains to enter India through joint ventures.</p><p/><p>Wal-Mart says it hadn't decided yet where or how many stores it would like to have, but the company expects to continue its current partnerships with barky enterprises of India, a chain of 17 cash and carry stores.</p><p/><p>Here's a look at commodities, oil and gold are up.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Good morning, everyone.  Apple  fans are on the world of lining up to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which  hits store shelves around the world today including here in New York City  where our own Robert Gray is standing by at Apple's Fifth Avenue store.   Robert, it is 6:00 in the morning.  What does it look like out there right  now? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Diane.  Good morning.   There are a few hundred folks out here in line behind me.  You can see them  and in fact, the big cube here which this store is famous for, which lead  you to an underground entrance way, the store is normally a 24-7 operation.   They closed it overnight.  It will not open until 8 a.m. local time.  And  of course, that is the roll out plan across nine different nations here.  </p><p/><p>       This is the widest rollout that Apple has had yet for one of their  iPhones.  Now, a key numbers to hit here.  We've seen every iPhone new  version has outsold a combined total of all the previous versions.  This of  course is a law of large numbers.  It is going to be tough to duplicate.   We'll have to wait and see.  Most reviewers out there saying this phone a  little bit more evolutionary than revolutionary.  </p><p/><p>       And of course, there's been a lot of feedback and flak, if you will,  about the new connectors out there.  They are of course shrinking the  connectors down to nine pins from 30.  So, all the products that you have  around the house, connectors et cetera, you'll going to have to go out and  buy some more of those.  So, Apple is expected to make a big hole out of  this as well as of course some of their third party partners out there.   You're going to talk a little bit all morning long.  </p><p/><p>       Of course, we're expecting a faster processor on board, you got the  new ear pods, the camera higher resolution, reportedly better.  As the  phone even now of course, some reviewers out there and analysts that I've  spoken with Diane, saying that as far as the camera goes and processing  speed, they're just now catching up to some of the rivals out there.  But  of course, as you can see, still plenty of Apple fans out here braving the  early morning, though we must say pretty mild here in New York City.  Back  to you.  </p><p/><p>  MACEDO:  All right.  That's Robert Gray live at the Apple store.   Thanks, Robert.</p><p/><p>       GRAY:  You're welcome.</p><p/><p>       MACEDO:  Meanwhile, E.U. anti-trust regulators have cleared universal  music group to buy British record company EMI as recorded music unit for  $1.9 billion after the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's  most valuable record labels.  Universal says, the assets to be sold amounts  to 30 percent of EMI's global sales.  Citigroup is selling EMI having  acquired the music group when buy-out firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans  owed to the investment bank.  </p><p/><p>       Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., futures have been in the  green across the board all morning.  Dow futures are up by about 40 points.   The S&amp;P is up by almost four.  The NASDAQ is up by seven.  </p><p/><p>       In Europe, the Financial Times reports European Union authorities are  working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and  unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.  Markets are currently  mixed.  London was green earlier, now we're seeing it in the red down by  almost nine points.  Paris and Frankfurt still in the green.  </p><p/><p>       Let's take a closer look at what's moving those markets with Josh  Raymond now, chief market strategist at City Index in London.  Now, Josh,  the FT is reporting that Spain is moving closer to a bailout.  Should  investors read that as a negative or should they find some release in  having some more certainty on that front? </p><p/><p>  JOSH RAYMOND, CITY INDEX CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  I think it is a  positive.  And it does provide some certainty.  You know, the markets --  investors have been fairly convinced that more is required.  There has been  political maneuvering going on with Spain saying that they've got austerity  measures in there.  They don't require the fully -- bailout.  But we  already know that they're actually in talks, so we have that -- a few  people of the Spanish government actually recently earlier on this week  say, it will provide a level of certainty.  And I think that would be  reacted positively by the market.  Of course, it depends on the scale which  the (INAUDIBLE) will require, I mean, the ECB through monetary transactions  have an unlimited scope to do so as well.  </p><p/><p>       MACEDO:  And Josh, Mario Monti is holding meetings in Italy with  several leaders today.  What do you expect to come out of them? </p><p/><p>  RAYMOND:  Not much unfortunately.  And we're getting used to all these  meetings taking place and strong rhetoric talking about a fiscal union,  stronger banking regulations, that sort of thing but nothing really comes  of it.  And I think investors are a little bit more wiser to that these  days.  Now, we already have the ECB.  And the main focus for us at the  moment really is the ECB and Spain.  Now, we've obviously got the -- from  the ECB and we're waiting for Spain to confirm or to agree that the terms  towards that fully first bailout.  Those are the key things that we're  looking at.  </p><p/><p>       MACEDO:  OK.  More brain storming for the many results.  We'll see if  it comes out that way.  Thanks, Josh.  That's Josh Raymond from London.</p><p/><p>       K.B. Home meanwhile is reporting a surprise profit this morning.  The  home builder says it made four cents a share in its third quarter.  The  company was expected to lose 16 cents a share but revenue came in light at  $424.5 million.  The estimate was for 430 million.  K.B. Home says, it's  order backlog at the end of August rose 18 percent from a year ago to more  than 3,100 and home deliveries rose seven percent to more than 1,700.  </p><p/><p>       Here's a quick look at commodities.  Oil and gold are both to the  upside.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business.  </p><p/><p>  ANNOUNCER:  Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  All right.  Well, it's going to be a great show.  </p><p/><p>       CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Great show.  Great day in New York today.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yep.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Last day of summer.  Going to be 73 degrees.  Let's do some  sunbathing, baby.  </p><p/><p>       So, anyway, coming up this morning, Juan Williams, FOX News, and the  great Vince Gill.  Now, Vince -- when I say great, I mean great.  He's not  going to sing.  He's coming in to talk.  Now, why would you book somebody  like Vince Gill just to talk?  Because he's worth talking to.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  That's it.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  There's a few of these guys, people who I would talk to.  It  would be him -- who are worth talking to.  Dwight Yoakam.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Smart guy, Yoakam.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Uh-huh!</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Crazy but good crazy.  Delbert, smart guy, funny.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Of course.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Kinky.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes, not many more, right? </p><p/><p>  BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER:  Billy Ray? </p><p/><p>  LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM PRODUCER:  He's one of the nicest guys too, Dwight  Yoakam.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Oh, yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  He is, isn't he?  </p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  Yes, he's really nice guy.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  You know the day I got fired, he called me on my cell phone.   I was on my way to meet the team.  And I was in the car.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Right.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  He's a good man.  He understood what the deal was.  And so,  you know.  You can't say stuff like that, man.  Don't pick on people.  Just  don't do it, whether you're trying to be funny or not.  Come on.  </p><p/><p>       Anyway, and so, and then the big dog's here, Bill Clinton.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Oh, good.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  He's concerned about this book that Monica Lewinsky is going  to do.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  I like that.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  About them sex positions.  And then, Warner? </p><p/><p>  WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  You and Gunz.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes, sir.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  You skunks.  And Steve Mariucci, the pregame show on the NFL  Network, there are two reasons to watch that.  Other than that.</p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  Yes, good bye.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  They suck, Rich Eisen, sucks.  Steve Mariucci, sucks.  Deion  Sanders, moron, Michael Irving moron, and that other guy, moron.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Moron.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Every one of them picked the Carolina Panthers.  What  happened?  The New York Giants put a butt whipping on them.  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Oh, man.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Thirty six-seven.  Come on.  </p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  Pussy riot, come on!</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Start the pussy riot.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  That's right.  Come on.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Oh, man!  Eli got the ball, what did he do?  He marched down  the field and scored a touchdown.  Every time he got the ball.  Come on!</p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Yes.  And the reserves, man, those guys, the regulars better  look over their shoulders.  Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Well, you and the ice cream cone on the forehead, Gunzelman --</p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  Oh, wow!</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Oh, God!</p><p/><p>       IMUS: -- should have anticipated this.  </p><p/><p>       (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p/><p>       I mean, this was an outrage.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  That's right.  </p><p/><p>  RUFINO:  Enjoy that ice cream.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  I will never listen to -- and you're right, Warner, about  these pregame shows.  These people don't know anything.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  No, waste of time.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  That's total waste of time.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Honeymoon is over.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Welcome.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  All right.  We're going to do the news now.  Bernard.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Yo, chief.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Or Connell.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Any of you.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Anybody.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  The Libyan attack on the embassy.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Right.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  The administration initially, the President and the Secretary  of State characterized this as a direct result of this YouTube movie,  right? </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Susan Rice all over the Sunday shows, she did a tour.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  U.N. ambassador.  Yep.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Now, is there any evidence -- and how are they describing it  now, the administration? </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  That there is evidence that the guy who was released from  Guantanamo Bay in 2007 was behind -- an al-Qaeda guy was behind the attack  on the embassy in Libya.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  So, is the President willing to use the word terrorist and  describe this as a terrorist attack? </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Not personally.  Jay Carney used that word yesterday but the  President did not when he was asked about it in the forum in Florida.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Has he ever used the word terrorist? </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Good question.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  OK.  Now, so my question is this then, did they have evidence  that -- did they know better that it was the result of the movie?  Or of  course, not so coincidently falling on September 11th.  Did they not know  that or did they lie about it or did they just assume -- you would think  with our intelligence apparatus they would know better.  But then, we've  had other bunch of other screw ups.  So what happened here?  In other  words, did they lie?  Did they know?  Did they not have the information?   What? </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  They jumped to conclusions.  If they didn't know, they  should have said they didn't know instead of proclaiming definitively that  it was a direct result of the movie.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  They should not have proclaimed that.  They should have  said let's wait and see.  They didn't.  Again, and they still harp on the  movie as though -- and they're conflating two things.  The movie, the  terrorists used the movie perhaps as a cover to get the morons to come out  and cause a riot so that they could use that as cover to go in.  But in  either case, they were misleading, was the administration.  They obviously  don't want it to look like -- they want to say GM is alive and bin Laden is  dead, and that's it.  They can't say that anymore.  And that's why they're,  you know.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I know you can't see it, but do you like my new hat? </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Yes, that's bad.  That's a bad as Johnny Cash.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Look out now.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Do you know who did this?  Stuart Dunlap, Men's hat shop,  Albuquerque.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Nobody but him.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Did he?</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  He did in San Antonio.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  That's the Rango Kidd  hat.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Oh, man, that guy is -- come on.  All right.  Let's do the  news.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  All right.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  You're a disgrace, Warner.  Don't you be yucking it up over  there.  This is unbelievable.  The country singer Josh Turner is  downstairs.  That boy is pretty good.  He's on FOX and Fiends.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  I guess people, there's an 80-plus demographic by records,  right?  Here's Connell with the news.  Good morning, Connell.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Good morning, I-man.  Protesters are actually in the streets  today in Pakistan.  They won't be able to use their cell phones.  Though,  the government there is blocking cell service, major cities, so the phones  can't be used to detonate bombs.  It's a national day of protest against  that movie we were talking about, the anti-Muslim film produced here in the  United States.  The surge in Afghanistan meantime is over according to the  Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta who says in his view it worked.  </p><p/><p>       The 33,000 additional troops sent to Afghanistan a couple of years  ago now pulled out of the country.  The latest Gallup daily tracking poll  has the race for the White House a dead heat.  Forty seven percent a piece.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  I'll be darned.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Mitt Romney and President Obama.  But Romney is still  hurting in some of these key swing states.  \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC  numbers, Obama is up eight points in Ohio.  Leading by five both in  Wisconsin and Colorado.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  You know, we are at a state in this country where this is the  best we can do?  A suit dummy and the president? </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  That's the choice you have.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I mean, I know a bunch of smart guys.  So, do you?  I mean, we  all do.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Right.  You mean like business leaders and that type of  thing and --   </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Really smart people.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Can't get them to run.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Well, I was going to say, it's hard to get people to run.   Absolutely.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  I don't know.</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Be vetted and everything else.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Twelve minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  Juan Williams, Vince Gill.  Neil Cavuto.  That's a pretty good  lineup.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes, it is.  Connell continues.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  We got some comments from Ann Romney here in a second but  first, the campaign has turned to comments not by either Romney but by the  President saying yesterday, \"Washington cannot be changed from the inside.\"   Big things, he says, get done when people pressure politicians from the  outside.  So, Romney was all over that saying that Obama's thrown in the  white flag of surrender on the economy.  Now, here's Ann Romney.  She was  on a radio show in Iowa asking Republicans to stop attacking her husband.  </p><p/><p>       (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       ANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY:  What do you say to your fellow  Republicans?  Sure.  Stop it.  This is hard.  You want to try it, get in  the ring.  This is hard.  It's an important thing that we're doing right  now, and it's an important election.  </p><p/><p>       (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes.  Today, the President -- </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Her husband is a moron.  He'll do better than this guy.  Having  said all that -- I mean, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.  Those  of you who know me know I probably don't.  But I'm going to vote for him.   And I'm going to tell you that the day he gets elected, the economy is  better.  He doesn't have to do anything.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  You just think confidence is going to improve? </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  That's one of the argument he made in that video that came  out.  Romney will be in Nevada today.  Obama campaigning in Virginia.  Some  American airliners frequent fliers worried after hearing about the  company's intentions to lay off thousands of workers and then reduce  flights.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN:  I'm pretty loyal to them.  Because I do travel  and get my miles with them.  I have really not had too many problems.  </p><p/><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Had a number of flights, so they've been canceled this  week, American announcing more than 1,000 employees could lose their jobs.   They're going through bankruptcy reorganization.  </p><p/><p>       And Fast and Furious, lawmakers analyzing this new report that's come  in on the botch, ATF gun walking operation, it's a report from the  inspector general from the Justice Department.  They found the Attorney  General Eric Holder was not aware of the operation until it came out in the  media and other places.  Here's California republican Congressman Darrell  Issa says the report the raises an important question.  </p><p/><p>       (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA:  There is clearly a question not  of did he know, because he said he didn't know.  The question is why in the  world did key lieutenants keep it from him and of course why is that  something that we should -- </p><p/><p>       (SCREAMING SHUT UP)</p><p/><p>       (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Sounds like a car alarm going off.  Did the guy invented those  Bernie or Connell?  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Please step away from the  car.  That's his --</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Yes.  Please step away from the car.  Please step away from  your mouth.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Oh my God!</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Sick of hearing about this.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  All right.  Enough is enough.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Come on.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Well --  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Let's just get the problems of this country solved.  Bernard  McGuirk is going to be a guest on O'Reilly tonight at 8 p.m. on the FOX  News Channel.  Bernard McGuirk and Greg Gutfeld in a segment called what  the hell just happened or something.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Something like that.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  And it's good and they're good.  A quarter after the hour.   Let's do some business news.  Here with that is Dagen McDowell.  Good  morning, Dagen.  </p><p/><p>  MCDOWELL:  Good morning, sir.  Yesterday, the Dow was up a paltry  almost 19 points and the futures are higher this morning.  And OK, all  these ding-a-lings are lined up for the new iPhone 5.  It goes on sale this  morning at 8 a.m. Local Time in stores in nine countries.  I'm sure it's  going to have record sales.  But here's what we care about even more than  that, that Apple has fallen flat on its face with this new mapping software  that it released.  It's on this new phone.  It's also in the new software,  the IOS-6.  It replaced Google maps, kicked Google maps off the phone, and  it's a disaster.  It sucks.  That's how bad it is.  Basically like  businesses wind up in the middle of rivers.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  So, I told Dagen I used map quest.  She said, that's so 90's.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Map quest.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  I said, well, the place I'm going hasn't moved.  They'll tell  you how to get there.  What the hell do I care? </p><p/><p>  MCDOWELL:  You could do so much better than that.  That's the issue.   You could do so much better than that.  It's like saying I've got like a  Xerox typewriter, like, you know, IBM Selectric or something like that  before I curse.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Like what?  What's better? </p><p/><p>  MCDOWELL:  Right.  No, all this.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  What's the matter?  </p><p/><p>       MCDOWELL:  Google maps is better.  Google maps is far and above  better than map quest, and particularly this new Apple.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Old weird Dave Patterson from Texas, he just updated my iPhone  iOS 6 last night.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       MCDOWELL:  Well, you lost your Google maps and if you want to look  for the Hoover dam on the 3D imaging, on this Apple mapping software, it  looks like a -- roller coaster.  That's how lousy it is.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I know where the Hoover dam is.  Right outside of Las Vegas.   Let's go look at it.  Come on, dude.</p><p/><p>  MCDOWELL:  Can't do it on that Apple mapping -- </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Oh, come on.  Get a life.  </p><p/><p>  MCDOWELL:  Don't we love when some giant, the biggest company in the  world screws up? </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  First of all, all you ever care about is a bunch of red-neck  goobers driving around in a circle and who knows where they're going to  race this weekend, the NASCAR dopes.  Where is the race? </p><p/><p>  MCDOWELL:  Well, in New Hampshire actually.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  That's pretty good track, so.  So, they don't need a map.  I  tell you what they do need.  </p><p/><p>       (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  That's right.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  They need a clue.  All right.  Eighteen after the hour here on  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Have you done sports yet, Warner? </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  No.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  OK.  Don't wear me out but here's Warner with sports.  Go  ahead.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  All right, I-man.  Thursday night football in Charlotte, now  the Giants even with four offensive injuries beat the Panthers 36 to seven.   Just like Gunzelman and myself called it.  Backup running back Andre Brown  playing for the injured Ahmad Bradshaw, 113 yards and 20 carries and two  touchdowns.  </p><p/><p>       And then reserved wide receiver Ramses Barden playing in place of a  Hakeem Nicks caught nine passes for 138 yards.  Eli 27 for 35, 288 yards, a  touchdown, no interceptions.  And Lawrence Tynes kicked five field goals.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Wow!</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Now, here was Cam Newton who, by the way, I don't know if you  saw this, after he scored a touchdown to make it cut it to 23 to seven, he  went into his superman celebration.  Pretty good timing for that.  So, here  was Newton only 16 for 30 intercepted three times and ran the ball six  times for only six yards.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       CAM NEWTON, CAROLINA PANTHERS:  Who wants to support something that  puts on a performance of embarrassment.  That's what that was tonight.  If  I was a fan of the Carolina Panthers, I would be holding my head down and  ashamed of the product that was out there today.  </p><p/><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Yes.  He was awful.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Stop your stupid end zone celebrations, OK?  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Yes.  How about that?  </p><p/><p>       (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  What a dope.  </p><p/><p>  RUFINO:  You have been killed.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  You have been murdered.</p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  Why do that? </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Oh, man!</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Yankees beat the Jays 10-seven, sweep the series.  Ichiro by  the way, a homerun and a double, he's not nine for his last 12.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  That guy is crazy.  </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Oh, man!</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  On fire?</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  On fire.  So, Yankees lead the Orioles by one with 13 to play.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  OK.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  And this is embarrassing, I-man.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  What?</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  At City Field, the Phillies scored eight in the first, seven  in the ninth and beat the Mets 16 to one.  Here was Met Manager Terry  Collins was asked after the game -- </p><p/><p>  RUFINO:  There was nobody there.  </p><p/><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  That's right.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  They were addressing these empty seats.  Here was Mets manager  Terry Collins asked after the game if he was embarrassed.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       TERRY COLLINS, METS MANAGER:  I am.  </p><p/><p>       UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  Does his team quit?  </p><p/><p>       COLLINS:  You'll have to ask them.  </p><p/><p>       UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  What do you think?</p><p/><p>       COLLINS:  You'll have to ask them.  I have my own opinion.  I'm not  going to express it publicly.  </p><p/><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  That's horrible.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Oh, man.  They got to get rid of him.  All right.  Twenty  minutes after the hour.  Do you have anything else, Warner? </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Well, real quick.  Tiger Woods and Justin Rose share the lead  of that FedEx cup playoff.  Roy McElroy is three back.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  All right.  Coming up on 21 after the hour here on the IMUS IN  THE MORNING program.  Juan Williams, Vince Gill, Neil Cavuto, Bill Clinton,  and Tony Robbins are all coming up.  Bernie's got a briefing too.  What's  there, B? </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  That's a more fiery Obama versus Romney.  Jimmy Fallon bust  on the President.  And Tim Tebow tells the world what kind of woman he  wants.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  All right, baby.  What kind of woman do you want?  So, Dwight  Yoakam's new album is called \"Three Pears.\"  There's not a bad cut on it.   It's the number-two country album on I-tunes.  Dwight Yoakam, number two,  come on here.

He thought about  it a second and he said, well, I make movies when he read.  </p><p/><p>       Since then Lindamood-Bell has conducted research and developed  programs that teach students to visualize and comprehend language.

You ought to take  some aspirin.  I mean, you do that, by the way.  </p><p/><p>  ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN:  What should the answer be? </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Nothing.  It's just venting.  It doesn't require an answer,  doesn't require a suggestion.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  It doesn't require a comment.

And Tuf Cooper, he's a current world champion, he's at 98,000.   The great Cody O.  Now that Joe doesn't rope anymore, he's my favorite  roper.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  OK.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Wyatt too.  He's third at 96,000.  And Hunter Herrin, Cory  Solomon, Shane Hanchey, Clint Robinson, Houston Hutko , the great Fred  Whitfield, African-American -- one of the great ropers ever, eight-time  world champion.

And here  with that is Bernard McGuirk, good morning, B.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Good morning, chief.  And President Obama sat down with this  Univision people yesterday, the Spanish language TV station, and if he  thought he was going to get questions like what's your favorite salsa  music, or do you like J-Lo or stuff like that, he was in for a big  surprise.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Oh-oh.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  The dude hit him hard, this Jorge Ramos.  He was like the  Spanish inquisition.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  He's a good reporter.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Very good reporter.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Yes, he is.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Yes, it was like the Spanish inquisition.  For a little  while, anyway, he asked him about changing things in government.  And he  gave a bad answer.  And then Mitt Romney jumped on it, as Connell alluded  to earlier.  Here's Obama first and then Mitt Romney right afterwards.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES:  I've learned some lessons  over the last four years.  And the most important lesson I've learned is  that you can't change Washington from the inside.  You can only change it  from the outside.  That's how I got elected.  And that's how the big  accomplishments like health care got done.  </p><p/><p>  FMR. GOV. MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The President  today threw in the white flag of surrender again.  He said he can't change  Washington from inside.  He can only change it from outside.  Well, we're  going to give him that chance in November.  He's going outside.  </p><p/><p>       (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>       (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  About as animated and funny as Mitt Romney will get, but it  wasn't that bad.  And the New York Giants, of course on a tear.  Right,  boss?  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Who cares?  Tim Tebow, he's on the cover of \"Vogue\"  magazine, he's on the cover of \"The New York Post\" this morning.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Sure.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Putting his physique on display there.  And I'm sure that's  going to rile up all the Giants this morning.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  But of course, he's a devout Christian and he tells -- </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Praise God.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Yes, exactly right.  He tells \"Vogue\" magazine what he looks  for in a woman.  And here's his quote.  I've been blessed to have an  amazing mom and two amazing sisters, so they set a very high standard.   I'll stop right there.  What I think of -- when I think of a woman, I don't  think of my mom and -- God bless them.  God rest them, I should say.  But  anyway, he goes on and that's what makes him a good guy apparently,  obviously.  </p><p/><p>       Obviously looks play a big part.  Looks play a big part.  Being  attracted to someone plays a big part but there is also much more than  that.  To me, it is about finding someone who is sweet and kind and that  has a servant's heart.  It's about finding a girl who likes me for me.  And  not because of what I do or who I am or the name.  </p><p/><p>       MCDOWELL:  Yes, tasty rat covering that servant's heart.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  Yep.  He did add that she's got to have a booty that's high  and tight.  </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> If it ain't tight, it ain't right.  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Bu so, you know, the boy's got some feeling.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  There has got to be -- </p><p/><p>  RUFINO:  Can see him saying that.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes, somebody else to talk about.  </p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  He's got to have a booty.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  He seems like a nice guy.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  People can't get enough of -- the front page of \"The New  York Post.\"</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  OK.  I like him -- </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Don't be a hater now, chief.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I'm not a hater at all, quite the contrary.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  All right.  Well, I can conclude on that because Juan  Williams is in the bull pen.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes.  Don't you have something else? </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  I do.  Jimmy Fallon, take a listen to him busting on the  President I think from last night.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       JIMMY FALLON, HOST, \"LATE NIGHT\":  Here's an election news, during a  fund-raiser with Jay-Z last night, President Obama said that he and the  rapper have a lot in common because their wives are more popular than they  are.  </p><p/><p>       (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>       Well, Jay-Z said, they have a lot in common because neither one of  them have a plan to fix the economy.  </p><p/><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>       (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Jimmy Fallon, that's funny, right?  He'll be here in about an  hour.  He's not going to sing.  He's going to talk with us.  </p><p/><p>       (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p/><p>       ANNOUNCER:  If you're on PC, you're in the wrong place.  IMUS IN THE  MORNING. </p><p/><p>       (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the FOX Business  Network.  Now, here's Diane Macedo.  </p><p/><p>       MACEDO:  Hi, everyone.  Now that Apple's iPhone 5 is available, we're  finding out what exactly makes the smart phone work.  The repair firm I-fix  got its hands on one and pried it open to find the device uses chips from  Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solutions.  The iPhone also  includes an audio chip made by Cirrus, Logic and its Gyroscope which is  used to track its orientation was made by STmicroelectronics.  So, keep an  eye on stocks of those companies and those who didn't make the iPhone 5 to  see their reaction today.  </p><p/><p>       Shares of Oracle were up slightly in extended trading after first  quarter results revealed while the company's traditional software business  improved, hardware system sales continue to be a problem.  Oracle's  earnings were up 11 percent from a year ago to 53 cents a share.  In line  with estimates, revenue of $8.2 billion fell short of the $8.42 billion  estimate.  The computer hardware segment fell for a sixth straight quarter.  </p><p/><p>       Here's a look at commodities.  Oil and gold are up.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS IN THE MORNING continues after we check the weather now with FOX  5 meteorologist Mike Woods.  </p><p/><p>  MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST:  Good morning, everyone.  Looks like  we have some wet weather out there but not a ton of it for the country  here.  We've got low pressure still rotating up around the Great Lakes but  it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwestern states, the Northern Plains  States all the way down to the Central Mississippi valley area.  And then  back up towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east.  Also a few  showers are popping up down around Florida.  </p><p/><p>       Again, southeast slightly risky in terms of showers and storms.   Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms, high temp today, 88 degrees.   Phoenix, no rain for you.  Sunny skies with a high of 103.  Seattle partly  cloudy skies with a high of 63.  Sacramento, California, we've got some  sunny skies there today with a high of 91, still warm.  I'm Mike Woods from  FOX 5 in New York.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  All right.  Twenty one until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE  MORNING program.  I lost my phone and I can't call it because I keep it on  -- </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Vibrate or whatever.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Whatever.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  All right.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  I have no idea where it is.  I thought I gave it to Carley,  but it could be anywhere.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  All right.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  All right.  Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program -- </p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  I'm still getting him.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Oh, you're still getting him.</p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  Yes -- that little phony shoe thing.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Vince Gill is coming up this morning, talk to him about some  stuff, the state of country music and the state of Vince Gill.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  That's it.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  And then Neil Cavuto, he's going to be in.  We'll talk to him  about the state of the country, the economy and all that.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes, there's big Romney interview.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, FOX  News contributor Juan Williams.  Good morning, Mr. Williams.  </p><p/><p>  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR (on the phone):  Good morning, Mr.  Imus.  I was worried for a second you forgot about me.  You didn't know my  name?  What is this?  What's going on over there? </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I'm thinking about two or three different things.  </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  You know, what?  You're thinking about beautiful women or  something.  I guess that's on your mind all the time.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Trying to find my phone.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       WILLIAMS:  (LAUGHING)</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  You know what I'm reading, which is terrific is O'Reilly's  \"Killing Kennedy.\"  </p><p/><p>       WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Did you read \"Killing Lincoln\"? </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  I did.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  And? </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  I liked it.  You know, he gave me a copy early on, and I  gave one to my son because I liked it so much.  And I told him, you know,  he can be reluctant even to accept praise, but yes, I thought it was pretty  good.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  All right.  I wasn't a big fan of that.  I didn't read it all  because \"Killing Kennedy,\" you know, I was talking about it -- do you mind  talking about this or no? </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  No.  Why would I mind talking about it? </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Well, I don't know.  The difference is between, say, Walter  Isaacson, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Doug Brinkley, and those people.  They tell  you about, you know, in the story they tell you about the Cuban missile  crisis.  So, they write about Khrushchev, O'Reilly does.  And he describes  him as 5'3,\" about 200 pounds, got a big old mole, gap in his teeth,  murdering little bastard.  But if it is Doris and all those other people,  you've got 43 pages about where he grew up, his sister, his brother, his  parent, I mean, stuff that maybe I want to know.  But here's -- do you  believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin of Jack Kennedy? </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  I think he was the lone assassin if you're asking who  pulled the trigger, yes, I do.  If you're asking were there other people  involved who may have been backing Oswald, funding Oswald, you know, did  Jack Ruby have any role to play there, I'm very suspicious of that.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Well, here's what they're trying to do in the book which  doesn't annoy me, but is they're trying to set Oswald up -- he describes on  page 15, does O'Reilly, Oswald as a crack shot.  Well, I was in the Marine  Corps at the same time Oswald was.  </p><p/><p>       WILLIAMS:  Sure.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  I was in from '57 to '59 on a two-year reserve program.  Two  years active duty and then reserve.  He was in from '56 to '59.  So, I  qualified for the rifle -- in the same program as he did.  And I barely  qualified as a marksman.  Then, there are three categories, marksman,  sharpshooter and expert.  So, O'Reilly describes Oswald as a sharpshooter.   But in May of 1956, he qualified, did Oswald, barely two points into being  designated a sharpshooter.  In other words, two fewer points and he would  have been a marksman, the lowest category.  And then -- pardon me?</p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  Hang on.  Hang on.  But wait a minute.  The idea is he was  a trained shooter, Imus.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       WILLIAMS:  I mean, so, OK, you can get into your gradations of how  skilled he was.  But I think Bill's point was this guy didn't just pick up  a gun and he was, you know, some schlock who was trying out.  I mean, he  had been trained in how to fire and he had been qualified, I think that  makes some compared to me for example who's never fired a gun.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>       WILLIAMS:  OK.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  OK.  But don't sell him to me as a crack shot, which he was  not.  Because when he tried to assassinate General Walker, he missed him.   He was 40 feet from him.  </p><p/><p>       WILLIAMS:  I love your point.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  And then he qualified again in 1959 just before he got out.   And he qualified barely with a score of 191 as a marksman, the lowest  designation.  Two fewer points and he would not have qualified.  So my only  point is yes, he could shoot a rifle better than some bozo on the street.   But don't try to sell him to me as being this expert crack shot, because he  wasn't.  So, that's it.  </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  Right.  You may know too much on this count.  But anyway,  your point is well taken.  Especially -- but I think that the larger point  is to the reader that this is a guy who was trained in how to shoot.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       WILLIAMS:  And as you point out, not only qualified once but  qualified twice is the other way to interpret the exact same events that  you just said make you doubt, you know, how good -- he was.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Only an idiot like me would get bogged down in the minutia of  that.  All right.  About the president, about Romney.  Let me see if you're  guy --  </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  Do you really want to talk about that?  Doesn't sound like  it?  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Well, talk about what? </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  American presidential politics.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes, I don't mind.  </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  I know Romney is not doing so well and I figured you're  going to be depressed and upset about it.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I don't care.  My job is to monitor the freak parade.  And he's  in it.  Anyway, now has the President and the Secretary of State and the  national security advisor and these other people, Susan Rice and the rest  of them, have they decided now what the attack in Libya was?  They first  tried to sell it that it was the result of this YouTube movie, which every  fool on the planet knew that wasn't the case, particularly falling on  September 11.  And now when the president is reluctant to use the word  \"terrorist,\" I don't know if I've ever heard him utter that word, now  they're acknowledging that it was a terrorist attack.  So my question for  you is, were they initially lying, one?  Or did they not know, two?  Or,  three, were they just assuming or guessing?  Or, four, were they waiting  until they got more information and thought they would throw up a smoke  screen to try to hoodwink us? </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  Well, I think that there was a strong sense that this was  terrorism.  But again, you know, they don't have a sense of Libya and I  think the intelligence background necessary to lay things out.  But if  you're asking about whether or not they were reluctant to call terrorism  what it is, I don't think there is any question.  This has been a problem  throughout the administration.  You know, they talk about manmade disasters  instead of terrorism.  </p><p/><p>       I mean, but that has to do with a mind-set that, you know, again,  caution about attacking people, especially Muslims and reluctance to  embrace the idea that it's terrorism because somehow that would take us  back to the Bush years of the war on terror and they don't want to do that.   But that has been the mind-set with this folks from the start, I-man.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  OK.  Who's the National Security advisor? </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  At the moment.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Well, no.  In October of 1922.  Yes, at the moment, Juan.  </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  I don't know.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  You know, it's Keith Alexander.  Isn't that right, Bernie? </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  That is correct.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  OK.  So, neither Bernie nor I had any idea who it was.  </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  Right.  Well, I couldn't call the name.  You got me.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Well, wouldn't you think we could do better than that dope  empty suit Romney or your guy? </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  You mean as Americans? </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Somebody to run this country? </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  Oh, yes.  That's what I meant, as Americans.  Well, you  know, what?  We've got political structure.  And, you know, this is who's  been nominated.  And gosh, you know, if you look on the republican side,  they went through a lot of people to get here, and this was the decision  made.  Well, I tell you, you know, yesterday's comment by Ann Romney, you  know, stop questioning my husband.  Stop the doubts.  If you think you can  do better, get in the ring, I thought some level of frustration over on  that side.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Are you a Christian? </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  I am.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Are you ready to deal with Jesus maybe having a wife? </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  You know, I never had any trouble with it.  In fact, you  know, there's all these questions about whether or not, in the last supper,  that drawing, you know, if that is a woman next to him.  It seems to me  inevitable.  I mean, all the talk about not just Mary Magdalene, but I  mean, you know, people that were described as prostitutes and outcasts and  the like, I think he was, you know, fully human.  Let me just say that, in  human form.  And I just think that part of being human is your sexuality.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I got punked by Jesus the other day.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       WILLIAMS:  Now this is interesting.  What happened to you? </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Well, I tore my rotator cuff and then suddenly it stopped  hurting.  And I thought thank you, God!  Jesus!  And then it started  hurting again.  </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  Oh no.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  So I got punked by Jesus.  </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  Well, you know, you think you had some good times there for  a minute.  I mean, thank God you got some relief.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes.  Well, now I'm OK, so.  </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  Yes, well, I'm glad to hear that.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Behave yourself, Mr. Williams.  I always love having you on.  </p><p/><p>  WILLIAMS:  I appreciate it.  I appreciate it.  And I'm going to just  burn Tom Donilon's name into my head again.  You know what I mean, I don't  know why I forgot that name.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  He is the national security advisor to the President.  The  director of the agency is the guy named General Keith Alexander.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  The NSA, right.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  OK.</p><p/><p>       WILLIAMS:  OK.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Thanks, you guys.  Eleven until the hour.  </p><p/><p>       ANNOUNCER:  IMUS IN THE MORNING.  </p><p/><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>       MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo.

The automaker had planned to shut down that plant's three shifts  consolidated line next June but it will operate with at least one line  until June of 2014.  That consolidated line was a key issue in talks as it  employs about 2,000 workers.  Nearly a quarter of the CAW work force at GM.   GM also agreed to create 100 positions that is St. Catharines, Ontario  facility.  The CAW continues to negotiate a deal with Chrysler after  reaching one with Ford earlier in the week.  </p><p/><p>       Blackberry is reporting an outage affecting users in Europe, the  Middle East and Africa.

How about this one from Bob from Oak Ridge, in New  Jersey.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  OK.</p><p/><p>       SHIMKUS:  Bob says, \"You need to have Heather Childers sit on a stool  with the red dress she had on this morning and your ratings will go through  the roof.\"  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Where was Heather?  Was she on the FOX News Channel? </p><p/><p>  SHIMKUS:  Yes.  She was on the 5 a.m. show.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  That's not going to happen with us, Bob.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  So, anything else? </p><p/><p>  SHIMKUS:  It was a try.  How about this one from Bubba from Ohio.  </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  OK.  Bubba has a suggestion.  </p><p/><p>       MCSHANE:  Sure.</p><p/><p>       SHIMKUS:  Bubba says, \"I have a suggestion for a new segment on IMUS  IN THE MORNING.  How about a Friday segment of mud wrestling featuring  Dagen and Carley possibly with an occasional guest wrestler like Deirdre,  Diane Macedo or Gerri Willis or Connell and Dagen.  Please give this  suggestion serious consideration.\"  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  OK.  Is anybody on the program willing to mud wrestle? </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Elvis, I think.  </p><p/><p>  SHIMKUS:  This program?  No.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  OK.  Carley is not.  Dagen is not, right? </p><p/><p>  MCDOWELL:  No.  I'm glad they threw Connell in with all the other  women.  </p><p/><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Connell, will you and Gunz wrestle in your panties on the  program? </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes, we'll do it.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.  </p><p/><p> MACEDO:  Good morning everyone.  Apple fans around the world are lining up  to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves today,  including here in New York City where our own Robert Gray is standing by at  Apple's Fifth Avenue store.  Robert, describe the scene for us.  </p><p/><p>  ROBERT GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well Diane, you've got several  hundred people lined up outside of the Apple store, normally they're open  24 hours a day seven days a week.  They closed it last night just for the  event, opens at 8:00 a.m.</p><p/><p>       And Jared here is kind enough to join us and tell us why you've been  in line here all night long here just waiting to get in to buy the iPhone  instead of going this afternoon.  </p><p/><p>  JARED, APPLE CUSTOMER:  I mean, it's about being here for the opening.   You know it's about -- I made a couple friends in line.  It's about being  like the best Apple store in the country, you know.</p><p/><p>       It's a fun experience.  It's a fun event.  Everybody is having a good  time.  The line is starting to move so we're starting to get kind of  excited.  </p><p/><p>  GRAY:  Yes you've got about an hour to go now.  You've got your Willie  Wonka golden ticket here.  Are you pretty happy about that?  And also you  have to wait until 8 a.m. Local time.  You just moved here from Tucson.   Are you already ribbing your friends back home that you're going to have  yours first?  </p><p/><p>  JARED:  Yes I did.  I posted it on Facebook I've been kind of poking  at them.  I have a few friends that are like really Apple fanatics.  And  it's kind of a -- its kind of a fun jest.  So I'm getting them back you  know.</p><p/><p>  GRAY:  Is there any one particular thing about the iPhone 5 that is  drawing you to it aside from the fact that it's just the newest, the latest  and greatest?  </p><p/><p>  JARED:  I really like what they've done from the body.  The aluminum - - the aluminum body looks really sleek, it's going to be really nice.  And  the wider screen is -- you can't go wrong.  </p><p/><p>  GRAY:  And what about the connector?  We've heard a lot of flap about  this the new connector.  You're going to have to get all new devices and  you know the peripherals to go with it, like alarm clock, et cetera.  Is  that a problem for you?  </p><p/><p>  JARED:  It's not a problem.  I mean, you know people try to jab where  they can jab.  But it's going to be great.  I mean, iPhone, the connector  has always been proprietary.  It just they're better, they're making it  better.  They're improving.  When technology moves, you've got to move with  it.  And that's just -- </p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  GRAY:  All right.</p><p/><p>  JARED:  -- that's what you do.  </p><p/><p>  GRAY:  All right, Jared we've got to move too.  Diane so yes we'll be  following all day for you there.  The line is starting to move.  Several  hundred of folks as I mentioned lined up out here to pay anywhere from $200  up for the new iPhone.  Back to you.</p><p/><p>  MACEDO:  All right, that's Robert Gray making friends at the Apple  store.  Thanks Robert.</p><p/><p>  GRAY:  Sure.</p><p/><p>  MACEDO:  And we're getting earnings in from Darden restaurants now,  the parent company of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster is reporting a  profit of 85 cents a share just beating the estimate for 84 cents.  Revenue  came in at $2.03 billion.  And that was right in line with what we were  expecting.  </p><p/><p>  Now on the day of the iPhone release, Blackberry is reporting an  outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Blackberry  announced the issue and postings on Facebook and Twitter and says it is  urgently working to fix the problem.  </p><p/><p>  Checking markets this morning here in the U.S. futures are up across  the board, Dow futures are up by 30, the S&amp;P is up by about two, the NASDAQ  is up by five.  In Europe the Financial Times is reporting European Union  Authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a  bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the ECB.  Markets there are mixed  with London and Paris both down, Frankfurt holding on to green territory by  about six points.  </p><p/><p>  Let's take a closer look now at what's moving the markets with James  Hughes, senior market analyst at Alpari over in London.  James the Greek  government officials are holding another round of negotiations with  creditors in hopes of agreeing to almost 12 billion euros worth of  cutbacks.  How do you expect this to play out?  </p><p/><p>  JAMES HUGHES, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, ALPARI:  I mean, I think we  expect it to play out the same way that we've seen it's done in the past.   I mean there's been a lot of negativity around what (inaudible).  Greece  trying to renegotiate these plans and the issue we've had is that they --  that they have an initial plan, initial measures we're put in place that  Greece had to -- had to hit but the goal post has been moved so many times  now.  There always seems to be another renegotiation of -- of austerity or  cuts.  </p><p/><p>  And I mean we're hopeful of course that Greece is going to agree to  something.  And -- but I think whether they agree or not is not the key  point.  It's whether they stick to it which is the key point.  And that's  been an issue for this for a long time now.  </p><p/><p>  MACEDO:  All right that's James Hughes from Alpari in London.  Thanks  so much James.</p><p/><p>HUGHES:  All right.</p><p/><p>  MACEDO:  Universal Music Group has won approval from EU antitrust  regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion after the  Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record  labels.  Universal says the assets to be sold announced that 30 percent of  EMI's global sales, Citigroup is selling EMI after it acquires the Music  Group when buyout firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the  investment bank.  </p><p/><p>  Here's a look at commodities now oil and gold are both to the upside,  oil is up by about 70 cents trading around $93 dollars a barrel.  Gold is  up almost $6 at $1,776 an ounce.  </p><p/><p>  Coming up this hour, Imus's guest will be musician Vince Gill.

(inaudible)</p><p/><p>  Hey, you know, regular civilians can't tell the difference in cowboy  hats, like -- like Lupica, he has no idea whether a hat is good or not.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Civilians.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  What?  So Rob Bartlett, who has no idea about cowboy hats, he  says to me, man, that's a great-looking hat.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Oh God.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  And that's the key.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  If a civilian can tell a hat's great, then it's great.  </p><p/><p>  RUFINO:  A layman.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  There you go.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  And I got it yesterday from the Man's Hat shop out in  Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Why am I plugging them?  I'm not.  How many hats  can they sell?  I mean hello?  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes hello.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  But -- well, Stuart bought it for me and (inaudible) it out to  the I-Man.  Come on dude.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Old Stuart.</p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  All right, he's shaking the ladies off your leg stepping out  of the building.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Well the dude can make a hat.  Vince Gill is coming up we're  going to talk to him.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Neil Cavuto is here.  So is Bill Clinton.  Bill, how are you?  </p><p/><p>  BARTLETT:  I'm all right, I-Man.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Mr. President I'm sorry.</p><p/><p>  BARTLETT:  It's a good looking hat.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  And Tony Robbins, how are you?  </p><p/><p>  POWELL:  Good morning, Imus.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Tony's here and Dagen and Carley and Lou Rufino and Bernard  McGuirk and Warner Wolf and Gunz.  What a couple of dopes.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Come on.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Oh God.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  We like the Carolina Panthers.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  The Giants went down there and put a butt whipping on them 36- 7, 36-7 -- I woke up.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  That's right.  I told Mike we should go -- </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I woke up in the fourth quarter about -- fourth quarter just  started.  It was 26-7.  The Carolina Panthers were driving.  Apparently  they didn't drive anywhere.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  No.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  The Giants have put up 10 more.  </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  So -- </p><p/><p>  WOLF:  The backups were great.  That was the key.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Oh you and Gunz should have anticipated that.</p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Yes, we should have.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Right.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  In fairness to you, those guys on the pregame show on the NFL  network, Steve Mariucci, Rich Eisen, that dope Deion Sanders, that other  dope Michael Irving.  And I don't know who that other guy is.  Who is that  guy Lou?</p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Marshall Faulk.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Marshall Faulk.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Oh yes Marshall Faulk.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Now they're all fine but they're dumb.  Every single of them  picked the Carolina Panthers -- everyone of them.  </p><p/><p>  This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING incidentally is sponsored by  \"The New York Times\" best-selling author, Mitch (inaudible) new book \"The  Timekeeper\" the dude has sold 30 million books.  That's a lot of money.  </p><p/><p>  The Bernie Briefing, by the way, which I neglected to mention last  hour, is sponsored by Ramsey Fiat, Route 17, Upper Saddle River, New  Jersey.  Go to RamseyFiat.com.</p><p/><p>  So I did mention that Vince Gill is coming up.  We're going to chat  with him.  And then Neil Cavuto I ran into Neil downstairs and I had my  little bottle of oxygen with me because I couldn't breathe.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  I know.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  So he was like terrified.  Why don't you go home?  Because I'm  a man, that's why I didn't go home.  </p><p/><p>  Time for the news now at eight minutes after the hour and here with  that is Connell McShane.  Good morning Connell.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  All right, good morning, I-Man.  </p><p/><p>  We'll start with the campaign.  President Obama pressed on some of the  failures in his first term, immigration and other things at a forum in  Florida hosted by the Spanish language station Univision.  The President  says he's learned a few things over the past four years.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You can't change  Washington from the inside.  You can only change it from the outside.   That's how I got elected.  And that's how the big accomplishments like  health care got done.</p><p/><p>  (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I'm going to go to Robert Gray now.  Do you care?</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  No not really.  Was that you screaming by the way?</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes do you have something else you want to say?  </p><p/><p>  RUFINO:  You have to ask.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Romney campaigning across Florida real quick.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  The President has already  thrown in the white flag of surrender.  </p><p/><p>  (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Suit dummy.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  That's all I have.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  All right, from Fox Business News, here's Robert Gray.  Good  morning, Mr. Gray.  </p><p/><p>  GRAY:  Hey, I-Man.  Good morning.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Where are you?  </p><p/><p>  GRAY:  I'm out in front of the Apple store on Fifth Avenue, and 59th  Street, it's normally a 24/7 store here I-Man.  You may have gone in the  middle of the night but they actually closed it.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Oh they did?  </p><p/><p>  GRAY:  So that they could create.  Yes they wanted to manufacture a  line.  And as you know from back in the day, no one manufactures lines like  they do here in New York.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Yes I've actually been in that store a couple of times.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  BARTLETT:  Really.</p><p/><p>  RUFINO:  I'll be darned.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Robert.  </p><p/><p>  RUFINO:  Say it, Robert.  I'll be darned.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Do you have something to report, Robert?  </p><p/><p>  GRAY:  Absolutely.  </p><p/><p>  Yes, we're out here.  Look, there are several hundred people lined up  waiting for this new iPhone 5 to go on sale.  It's coming out 8 a.m. folks  will be rolling in.  And they could sell as many as -- as many as 10  million of these by the end of this month alone.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Ok we'll it's a very fine report.  Thank you for that important  information, Robert.  </p><p/><p>  RUFINO:  What a loser parade.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Those idiots have been camped out there for five nights -- </p><p/><p>  GRAY:  Some of these guys have been out here all week.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Morons.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Big Foot.</p><p/><p>  TOM BOWMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Yes sir.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Have you lost your mind?  </p><p/><p>  BOWMAN:  What are you kidding?  This is a great story today.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  But -- </p><p/><p>  BOWMAN:  And you personalized it as always.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Do we have a unique situation here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program?  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  We have wall-wall-commercials which is how we keep doing this,  which I'm happy that we do have.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  So we don't have an inordinate amount of time for Warner to go  on and on about Yogi Berra or somebody or Miller Huggins or -- and you know  I like Robert Gray.  But you go to Robert Gray with no information.  Well,  I'm standing outside the store.  Here we've got a few hundred people.  Ok  good, great.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Robert Gray all the way.</p><p/><p>  RUFINO:  Miller Huggins is waiting -- </p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I like Robert Gray.  He is a terrific reporter.  He's got a  nice sense of humor.  But he gave us zero information.  We know -- </p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  That isn't fair.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Come on he talked about how many iPhones might be sold and  that kind of thing.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Yes why -- why would these idiots camp out and not wait  five, ten days and buy it in the store days later on?  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Who knows?  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Exactly.</p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Well maybe he knows.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Do you know why they do it Robert?  </p><p/><p>  GRAY:  Yes I do we've talked to several of these folks I-Man and some  of these guys are big tech fans.  And they wanted to be a part of the  experience here and the first to have it.  We just talked to a guy from  Tucson.  He wants to have it before his buddies.  He's posting it on  Facebook.  He's going to have the newest, latest and greatest.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  There you go.</p><p/><p>  GRAY:  And these guys like to have the faster processor, bigger  screen.  Some of the other phones have already had that for six to nine  months so the iPhone is playing catch-up here.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Right, there you go.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Robert Gray, the Fox Business Network.  Live outside the 59th  and Fifth at the Apple store.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Good report dude.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Well done Robert.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  12 minutes after the hour.  Please stop calling people dude,  Imus.  It's 12 after the hour.  Let's do a little new, more news.  And here  with that is Connell McShane.  Good morning Connell.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  All right, good morning I-Man.  Well, the campaign moves to  Nevada today where Mitt Romney will be campaigning, in Virginia where  President Obama will be holding a rally.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  You shut up.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Here are some numbers that are in, Obama leads the \"Wall  Street Journal\"/NBC News swing state poll.  He's up eight in Iowa, five in  Wisconsin and Colorado.  The Gallup Daily tracking poll though, dead heat,  47 percent a piece around the country for Mitt Romney and President Obama.  </p><p/><p>  There are protests today taking place in Pakistan.  In fact they've --  they've named it a national day of protests there over this anti-Muslim  movie that was produced here in the United States.  And the government in  Pakistan actually disabling cell phone service, some of their major cities  are trying to prevent phones from being used in detonating bombs.  </p><p/><p>  And then in Syria, President Bashar Assad talking tough, an Egyptian  magazine reporting that Assad predicts the defeat of the armed opposition  that foreign intervention like the one in Libya will not be repeated there,  he said.  This, as at least 30 are reported dead in the northern part of  the country.  Government airstrikes reportedly hit a gas station and caused  a huge explosion in Syria.  </p><p/><p>  Then the surge is over in Afghanistan.  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta  says the 33,000 additional troops that were sent a couple of years ago to  Afghanistan have now pulled out of the country.  He calls it a very  important milestone, says the surge accomplished its goals in Afghanistan.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Really.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  And one other thing for you, I-Man.  The Emmys this Sunday  but Kelsey Grammar not a nominee.  Critics and fans of Grammar's stars show  \"Boss\" have agreed that he was snubbed when these Emmy nominations were  announced.  He recently suggested that his conservative political leanings  were the reason.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  KELSEY GRAMMER, ACTOR:  I did speculate about the fact that maybe I'm  a pretty well outed conservative in Hollywood and maybe there's some energy  there.  But you know I've since come to think that it hasn't gotten out  there enough.  I don't know.  </p><p/><p>  (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  There you go.  Well, Kelsey Grammer thinks he was snubbed  there I-Man for the Emmys.  And those are your -- </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  No justice, no peace.</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  -- exactly, right, your headlines this morning.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  All right, hey, Big Foot, load up Tony Robbins and Lady Gaga,  ok?  </p><p/><p>  BOWMAN:  Yes sir.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Let's do a business report now at 14 after the hour.  And here  with that, just ahead of Vince Gill and Bernie with a briefing and Warner  with sports is Dagen McDowell.  Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p/><p>  DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, sir.  </p><p/><p>  Did you know that the new iPhone 5 goes on sale this morning at 8  a.m.?  Maybe we could take a live look at the Apple store here in midtown  Manhattan for the lines of people.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Don't be mean.  </p><p/><p>  MCDOWELL:  All those -- you know why those doofuses line up?  Because  they've got no woman at home and they've got to be one of the first of  their friends to get the new iPhone 5.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  They either don't have a woman at home or they've got a woman  at home like you. </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Or the only woman at home is their mom.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Oh, the I-Man.</p><p/><p>  MCDOWELL:  You know what; no truer thing has ever been said.  </p><p/><p>  RUFINO:  I'll wait on this line for four days to get away from her.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Let's go here.  </p><p/><p>  RUFINO:  Is that Jonas?</p><p/><p>  MCDOWELL:  Well, it's going to set records.  </p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Ok.  That big race in New Hampshire, Nascar this weekend?  All  right, second race with the chase or whatever</p><p/><p>  MCDOWELL:  I do have something though.  The iPhone sells like it does  because Blackberry stinks to high heaven.  And Blackberry service is  actually out today in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  So  there is justice in this world.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  All right.  A quarter after the hour.  Let's do some sports.   No, first let's go to Tony Robbins who has some thoughts about Lady Gaga.   Good morning, Mr. Robbins.  </p><p/><p>  POWELL:  Good morning, Imus.  Lady Gaga is having a physical crisis.   She recently put on a couple of pounds.  Who am I kidding?  I saw her in  concert with that big hat and those big glasses.  I thought she was Cee Lo  Green.  She's gone from doing well-choreographed routines to the electric  slide.  Apparently it's not as taxing.</p><p/><p>       Gaga claims that she gained weight eating delicious food at her  father's Italian restaurant in Manhattan.  That's a relief.  I'm glad she  wasn't eating her dresses.  A bacon muumuu has got to be like what --  50,000 calories.  Eating her clothes would certainly qualify as an  unhealthy relationship with food.</p><p/><p>       Gaga lives, breathes, sleeps and eats music.  She's passionate about  music and obviously.  I told her to combine her loves.  She took my advice  and started writing her sheet music on sheet cakes.  Share your music with  the world but share your cakes with friends.  That's the out of the box  statement that's made her a superstar.</p><p/><p>       Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the  visible.  Lady Gaga's goals to go from being an unknown artist to being  well, the biggest thing in music.  I'd say we've got that covered.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Tony Robbins here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p/><p>       All right.  Let's do sports at 16 minutes after the hour.  Just ahead  of Vince Gill later on this morning and Neil Cavuto.</p><p/><p>       Sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers.  Here with sports, best  sportscaster in the country, Warner Wolf.  Good morning Warner.</p><p/><p>  WOLF:  Thank you very much.  Good morning I-Man. Thursday night  football in Charlotte.  The Giants beat the Panthers, 36-7.  It was the  story of the backups.  Running back Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw  -- 113 yards, 20 carries, 2 touchdowns; and wide receiver Ramses Barden  playing in place of Hakeem Nicks, 9 receptions for 138 yards.  Eli, 288  yards, 1 touchdown, no interceptions; Lawrence Tynes kicks 5 field goals.</p><p/><p> Cam Newton trailing 23-0 in the third quarter and obviously thinking a  touchdown was worth 23 points, scored on a 1-yard touchdown and then went  into his superman celebration.  Come on, Cam.</p><p/><p>       Baseball: Yankees beat the Jays -- </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  I tell Wyatt that all the time.  You put up an 8 in roping,  don't throw your hat.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Right.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Act like you've been there before.</p><p/><p>  WOLF:  That's right.  That's what Tom Landry said, right.</p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  What an idiot.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  What a dope.</p><p/><p>       RUFINO:  Oh God.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Yanks sweep the Jays.  Ichiro, a home run, a double, he's 9  for his last 12.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  That guy is great.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Oh man.  He's on fire.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  And apparently New York is -- well, come on dude.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Well, they lead by one.  Both have 13 to play. </p><p/><p>       And before a bogus announced crowd of 20,000 at City Field, the  Phillies scored 8 in the first, 9 -- 7 in the 9th and beat the Mets 16-1.   The Mets are only 4 in 25 at home since the all-star break.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Wow.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Boise state beat BYU, 7-6.  BYU scored a touchdown, three and  a half minutes left, went for the 2-point conversion and missed.  </p><p/><p>       Wait a minute.  Stop the music.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  All right.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Finally there may be a long-awaited Floyd Mayweather-Manny  Pacquiao fight.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Wow.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  Pacquiao who, by the way, has to fight Juan Manuel Marquez for  the fourth time -- </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Yes, fourth time.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  -- has agreed, number one, to give Mayweather -- </p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Want to have more time -- they're ruining marriages . </p><p/><p>       WOLF:  He's agreed to give Mayweather a 55-45 split, Mayweather  getting the 55 rather than the 50-50.</p><p/><p>       Number two, Pacquiao says he will agree to Mayweather's demand that  he take the Olympic-style drug test which includes the blood test.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  All right.  Yes, sure.</p><p/><p>       WOLF:  The only drawback is when the fight occurs Mayweather will be  36 and Pacquiao 34.</p><p/><p>       In golf, you have the top 30 golfers in the world at that FedEx Cup  playoff.  Tiger Woods and Justin Rose share the lead, 4 under 66.</p><p/><p>       And finally, I-Man, our old friend Jerry Jones agrees with Buccaneers  coach Greg Schiano that it's ok for a team to go for the ball when the  other team is kneeling down to run out the clock.  Jones says the kneel- down is a wasted play, should be outlawed.  And if a team doesn't run a  play, they should be penalized.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  We're trying to win.  When we're out there on the field, out  there -- we're trying to win.  And we're the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p/><p>  We didn't win in Seattle, and that sucked.  So I went to the  (inaudible) bar.  What are you going to do?</p><p/><p>       It's 20 minutes after the hour.  Thank you very much, Warner.   There's a briefing coming up.  What's there, B?  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  President Obama grilled by this Spanish language TV station  host.</p><p/><p>       And another secret Paris Hilton tape revealed.  We have the tape.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  One of the great songs Vince Gill ever wrote or recorded.  It  was a huge hit for the boy.  It was a huge hit -- \"Pocket Full of Gold\",  about a guy, he's married and goes in the bar somewhere and he takes that  ring off his finger. </p><p/><p>       I do that when I go to the titty bar.  I have a pocket full of gold.</p><p/><p>       (MUSIC)</p><p/><p>       (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>  MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>       And General Motors is recalling more than 426,000 ChevroletPontiac  and Saturn sedans in the U.S. due to a transmission problem.  The recall  affects vehicles from model years 2007 to 2010.  The auto maker says the  transmission gear position may not match the gear on the shift gear and  that causes vehicles to move when drivers think they're in park.  GM says  it's aware of four crashes due to the problem, but no injuries reported so  far.</p><p/><p>       Here's a look at futures now, we are seeing them up across the board;  Dow futures up by 38, the S&amp;P is up by 3 and the Nasdaq is up about 6.   Commodities are also to the upside.</p><p/><p>       IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Jesus had a ball and chain.  Jesus had a ball and chain.  You  know, they found this.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  This historian of early Christianity up there at Harvard  Divinity School, the girl found a scrap of march weed or whatever the hell  it was papyrus -- is that what we call it?</p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  yes.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Written in the fourth century containing the phrase that we've  never seen in any piece of scripture and it's Jesus, and he said unto them,  \"My wife\".  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Whoa.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  What up, girl?  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  Wow.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Anyway, so that that.  And man -- what's that, godfather?  </p><p/><p>  BARTLETT:  I need the Christ to come on over for coffee tonight.  </p><p/><p>  POWELL:  I wonder whose name she called out when they were making  love.  </p><p/><p>  MCSHANE:  No, no.</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Anyway.</p><p/><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  All right.  28 after the hour; we'll talk to Vince Gill in a  couple of minutes.</p><p/><p>  First, this Bernie Briefing is sponsored by Ramsey Fiat, Route 17,  Upper Saddle River, New Jersey.  Go to RamseyFiat.com.  Here's Bernard  McGuirk.  What up, B.</p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Well, President Obama, boss, candidate Barack Obama back in  2008 promised in no uncertain terms that he would pass a comprehensive  immigration reform.  He had a Democratic Congress for two years.  In any  case he's on Univision yesterday and host, Jorge Ramos, again, the Spanish  inquisition.  He hammered the President on this and listen to the  President's answer.  </p><p/><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  JORGE RAMOS, HOST, UNIVISION:  A promise is a promise.  And with all  due respect you didn't keep that promise.  </p><p/><p>  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Here is what I would  say Jorge, is that we've had this conversation before.  There's a thinking  that the President is somebody who is all powerful and can get everything  done.  In our branch-- in our system of government, I am the head of the  executive branch.  I'm not the head of the legislature.  I'm not the head  of the judiciary.  We have to have cooperation from all these sources in  order to get something done.  And so, I am happy to take responsibility for  the fact that we didn't get it done, but I didn't make a promise that I  would get everything done 100 percent when I was elected as president.  </p><p/><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Of course not.</p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Yes, we can.  No, we can't.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  Come on here.  </p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  Anyway, there's another secret tape scandal out here boss.   This time -- first it was Mitt Romney.  Now it's your girl, Paris Hilton.  </p><p/><p>  IMUS:  My girl?</p><p/><p>  MCGUIRK:  everybody's girl, come on.</p><p/><p>       IMUS:  Ok.</p><p/><p>       MCGUIRK:  You know you love that tape, the first one she was in. Now,  she was in a taxi back during fashion week here in Manhattan and this cab  driver actually taped her and her gay friend -- the gay friend was telling  her about a guy he know who has AIDS and has unprotected sex, this, that  and the other. And she said some stuff that's getting her into a little bit  of trouble. Take a listen to it. </p><p/><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): You know if you want to (EXPLETIVE DELETED)  and you might be able to like just stick you (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p> PARIS HILTON (voice-over): Eww.</p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>HILTON: Eww. You guys are the horniest people in the world.</p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>HILTON: Eww. They're disgustingly (INAUDIBLE) (EXPLETIVE DELETED).</p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like, listen, my (EXPLETIVE DELETED).</p><p/><p>HILTON: Eww. (INAUDIBLE) AIDS.</p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>HILTON: I would be so scared about (INAUDIBLE). You know like (INAUDIBLE).  Eww.</p><p/><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p> IMUS: OK. What is she saying, Berne? </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK: She said gay guys are the horniest people in the world. They're  disgusting. Dude, most of them probably have AIDS.</p><p/><p> IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p> MCGUIRK: She said in the taxi that --</p><p/><p> IMUS: That's not good.</p><p/><p> MCGUIRK: Some dude was, you know, Mohammad  there was rolling on while she  had the conversation. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Just don't be hating on everybody, baby. All right.</p><p/><p> Anything else, Bernie? </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK: No, I'm done. </p><p/><p> IMUS: It's 30 minutes past the hour.</p><p/><p> I was talking to Kinky Friedman yesterday. Kinky refuses to use a computer.  Won't text. Won't e-mail. So there's no way to stay in touch with him. I  mean, you can call him. But we were talking about Dwight Yoakam's new  record. So, I said, have you heard \"Waterfall\"? And Kinky said, I love it  to death. It's just -- all right. </p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network.  And now here's Diane Macedo. </p><p/><p> MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p/><p>KB Home is reporting a surprise profit after two quarters of losses as home  prices recovered. The fifth largest home builder says it made 4 cents a  share in its third quarter. The company was expected to lose 16 cents a  share, but revenue came in a little light at $424.5 million. The estimate  was for $430 million. KB Home says potential future housing revenue rose to  a four year high and home deliveries climbed 7 percent from last year to  more than 1,700. Shares are higher in the pre-market. </p><p/><p> More companies, meanwhile, are rewarding their shareholders with higher  quarterly dividends. McDonald's is hiking its quarterly payout by 10  percent to 77 cents a share. Texas Instruments is boosting its dividend by  24 percent to 21 cents a share. And Covidien is increasing its quarterly  dividend by 16 percent to 26 cents a share.</p><p/><p> IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right after we check the weather now with Fox  5 meteorologist Mike Woods. </p><p/><p> MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, everyone.</p><p/><p> Looks like we have some wet weather out there, but not a ton of it for the  country here. We've got an area of low pressure still rotating up around  the Great Lakes but it's bringing showers from the upper Midwestern states,  the northern plains states, all the way down into the central Mississippi  Valley area and then back up toward the rest of the Great Lakes over to the  east. </p><p/><p> Also a few showers are popping up down around Florida. Again, the southeast  slightly risky in terms of showers and storms. Tampa, you'll see a few  scattered storms. High temp today 88 degrees. Phoenix, no rain for you.  Sunny skies with the high of 103. Seattle, partly cloudy skies with a high  of 63. Sacramento, California, you've got sunny skies there today with a  high of 91. Still warm. </p><p/><p> I'm Mike Woods from Fox 5 in New York. </p><p/><p> IMUS: It's 22 minutes till the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program. </p><p/><p> Please welcome to the program, I don't want to embarrass him, but one of  the great country singers of all time, songwriters, Vince Gill. </p><p/><p> Good morning, Mr. Gill.</p><p/><p> GILL: How you doing, Donny?</p><p/><p> IMUS: I'm fine. How are you?</p><p/><p> GILL: I'm good. Good to see you.</p><p/><p> IMUS: Fine. Fine. Nice to see you. Thanks for coming in.</p><p/><p> GILL: You bet.</p><p/><p> IMUS: So I was talking this morning, not to patronize you, which I wouldn't  do, I said there's a few people who sing who I'd have come in just to talk.  You're one of them.</p><p/><p> GILL: Well, thanks.</p><p/><p> IMUS: Do you like Dwight Yoakam? </p><p/><p> GILL: I do. I always have. He's a good guy. </p><p/><p> IMUS: A smart guy, too. </p><p/><p> GILL: Yes. Smart as a whip. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Crazy. Crazy.</p><p/><p> GILL: He's a little bit crazy, but most talented people are just one tick  shy of nuts. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Yes, but good crazy. </p><p/><p> GILL: It's a good crazy.</p><p/><p> IMUS: Kinky Friedman, Delbert McClinton.</p><p/><p> GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p> IMUS: And -- but like Montgomery Gentry, I love them, but -- man, they  can't put two words together. </p><p/><p> GILL: I wouldn't know. </p><p/><p> IMUS: You know what I've learned --</p><p/><p> GILL: It's a political year. No comment. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Well, here's the -- I'm the worst kind of country disc jockey. Really  that's what I am at heart. </p><p/><p> GILL: Well, you're one of the last people on earth that love music. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p> GILL: That's why I love coming seeing you. You know, when I got a new  record or something's exciting going on, because I know you'll get it and I  know you'll, you know, you'll enjoy it. </p><p/><p> IMUS: I just got Dwight's new -- do you care if we talk about other  artists? </p><p/><p> GILL: No, I don't.</p><p/><p> IMUS: I just got his new record. It is fabulous. </p><p/><p> GILL: Yes, I've heard. I haven't heard it yet, but I've heard people raving  about it. (INAUDIBLE) </p><p/><p> IMUS: Got a song called \"Waterfall\" that's --</p><p/><p> GILL: I heard a little bit of that. </p><p/><p> IMUS: That's clever, isn't it?</p><p/><p> GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p> IMUS: So -- and -- because Dwight, he's a man who, when he went out with  Sharon Stone, you know, she described him as a dirt sandwich. </p><p/><p> GILL: About as much fun as a dirt sandwich. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Hey, have you ever heard of the Christian rock group Striker. </p><p/><p> GILL: Yes, I have. </p><p/><p> IMUS: OK. This is a tedious story. Maybe it's not tedious. But when my  brother, God bless him, and -- was working with the railroad as a breakman,  his partner was Phil Sweet. </p><p/><p> GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p/><p> IMUS: And Fred and Phil wrote a song called \"I Don't Want To Have To Marry  You\" when they were working for the railroad.</p><p/><p> GILL: Right.</p><p/><p> IMUS: And they eventually got it cut. And it went to number one and all  that stuff. And Phil married a woman named Janice. And he's a great guy.  They live in Las Vegas. And they had two sons, Michael and Robert, and they  are Striker. </p><p/><p> GILL: Oh, I didn't know that. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p> GILL: That's neat. </p><p/><p> IMUS: And Christian rock, they are. </p><p/><p> GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p/><p> IMUS: And then Michael spent the last -- the past two summers going out  singing lead for Boston. It's a small world, isn't it? </p><p/><p> GILL: Yes, it is. You know, ever since I married Amy, everybody thinks I  know everything about Christian music, but I don't. I wish I did.</p><p/><p> IMUS: Well, Amy Grant won a -- won the -- everybody in the country had a  crush on her when she was --</p><p/><p> GILL: Oh, yes.</p><p/><p> IMUS: I remember all -- I remember all these disc jockeys over at NBC years  ago. I met Frank Reed  -- I don't know if you remember his name or not --  he used to tell me -- he said, have you heard Amy Grant? And I said, no. He  said, oh, man, come on here. </p><p/><p> So, what's new with you?</p><p/><p> GILL: Not much. After I married Amy, I used to have to fight my way out of  the bars. Now I have to fight my way out of the churches being married to  her. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Hey, you built a studio at home. </p><p/><p> GILL: I did. Yes.</p><p/><p> IMUS: All right. Isn't a studio now just pretty much your laptop or no?</p><p/><p> GILL: Well, pretty much. I mean it can be. But I went a little further than  that. Not as big as a commercial studio, but enough to track. And it's  really fun because we all kind of gather around in a room and play music  together instead of sequester each other off in a booth somewhere where you  can't see each other and we're all just playing together. And it's been the  greatest experience, this new record, the \"Time Jumpers\" record, that -- I  started playing with this band about two and a half years ago. And they're  a western swing band.</p><p/><p> IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p> GILL: Me being from Oklahoma, I was crazy -- I've always been crazy for Bob  Wills music and that swing stuff and they would ask me to come in and  occasionally sit in and fill in and, you know, if a guitar player couldn't  make it, they'd call me up and sub. And little by little they grew  confidence in me and said, hey, you want to be in the band. A couple guys  quit. And I said, sure. It would be fun. So I talked them into making a  record at the house and we decided to put it out. I said, man, we could  make a record for nothing. It would be a blast. And so away we went. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Talking with Vince Gill here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p/><p> Weren't you originally in Pure Prairie League? </p><p/><p> GILL: A long time ago. Yes, 33 years ago. </p><p/><p> IMUS: And before that? </p><p/><p> GILL: I played with a guy named Byron Berline. A really great fiddle  player. Lived in Los Angeles. Was a session player. Played on Rolling  Stones' records and Birds  records and all kind of great rock records and  was the go-to guy for fiddle out on the West Coast forever and ever and  ever. And he had an opening and I was 18 or 19. We moved out there as a kid  and started out there. </p><p/><p> IMUS: You just played guitar for a long time, right? </p><p/><p> GILL: Yes. Still do. </p><p/><p> IMUS: No, I know you do. But, I mean, I guess you knew you could sing, but  nobody else did or did they? </p><p/><p> GILL: Well, a lot of times those gigs I would get would be because I could  sing, too, you know, and in those days if you could find somebody that  could multi-task, I guess would be a good word for it, and do a bunch of  different stuff, you were a better asset to a band. And so I was always  able to play a little bit of everything and could fill in whatever was  needed. </p><p/><p> IMUS: What's the state of country music in your view? </p><p/><p> GILL: It's interesting. </p><p/><p> IMUS: You like it or no? </p><p/><p> GILL: I'm not crazy about it. But I'm not supposed to. I'm 55 years old and  I'm supposed to like, what, you know, my era did and the era before me. I  don't -- I don't dislike it, I just don't necessarily believe that it's --  it's -- the term country music fits it so much.</p><p/><p> IMUS: Right.</p><p/><p> GILL: But, you know, they're young kids and they're following their muse,  they're do what they love and I've got no -- I've got no bitterness towards  them at all. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Well, I'm 72 and I be loving that \"Pontoon\" record by Little Big  Town. </p><p/><p> GILL: Oh, isn't that cool? </p><p/><p> IMUS: That's a good record, man. </p><p/><p> GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p> IMUS: I like Jason Aldean. Come on. </p><p/><p> GILL: Yes, he's fun. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p> GILL: You know, they're rocking, they're -- you know, they're kind of --  they're pretty -- pretty brash. They're, you know, party time and all that  stuff. That's just, you know, it's not for me. It's not that I don't like  it. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Jamey Johnson, of course, he's --</p><p/><p> GILL: Great songwriter.</p><p/><p> IMUS: Speaking about being out where the buses don't run. So -- but he's  great, isn't he?</p><p/><p> GILL: He is. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p/><p> GILL: He's a great throwback, you know. </p><p/><p> IMUS: How do you really think is great? </p><p/><p> GILL: Oh, well, I like -- I -- actually, there's a lot of people I love. I  think Carrie Underwood sings her brains out. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Really?</p><p/><p> GILL: Yes. She's a great singer.</p><p/><p> IMUS: I just can't take that screaming. </p><p/><p> GILL: Well, she does -- she will sing hard, but that's -- you've got  understand, that's what people are -- that's what they're learning. That's  what they're singing.</p><p/><p> IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p> GILL: From \"Star Search\" and \"American Idol.\" All these shows. It's like  grandiose and the big finish and, you know, it's -- </p><p/><p> IMUS: I listened to something the other day that -- a duet you did with  her. It's good.</p><p/><p> GILL: Oh, the \"How Great Thou Art\" thing?</p><p/><p> IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p> GILL: That was nice. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Are you really religious? I mean --</p><p/><p> GILL: To some degree, I guess. Probably not to the level of probably what  the expectation is of me because I'm married to Amy. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p> GILL: I feel like a novice, you know, because I haven't had a church life  in my adult life. I did as a kid, but my adult life was never conducive to  it, only because of my work. I was gone every weekend. </p><p/><p> IMUS: But you believe Jesus is the Son of God? </p><p/><p> GILL: I do. </p><p/><p> IMUS: OK. And like Mojo Nixon says about Elvis, Elvis is everywhere. And I  believe Jesus is everywhere. I mean -- I also know, though, however, not  that anybody asked me, but I respect all other religions as well. I --</p><p/><p> GILL: Me, too. </p><p/><p> IMUS: See, I don't think there's just one way to get there. </p><p/><p> GILL: Well, I've traveled the world enough to -- you know, it just seems --  it doesn't seem logical that other parts of the world would know this way.  You know, maybe I'm wrong. I have been before.</p><p/><p> IMUS: And now  are you prepared for this new information that Jesus may  have had a wife. </p><p/><p> GILL: I heard. Yes.</p><p/><p> IMUS: My observation was, if -- wasn't it her job then to come up with a  (INAUDIBLE) -- just idiotic.</p><p/><p> GILL: That explains the missing years.</p><p/><p> IMUS: You know Billy Joe Shaver? </p><p/><p> GILL: A little bit, yes. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Yes. I think he's one of the great songwriters ever. </p><p/><p> GILL: I do too. Yes. </p><p/><p> IMUS: But there's somebody who is certifiably -- but a sweet man. My  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p> GILL: Yes, that's my -- you know, that's really my era of the people I love  were guys like him, Guy Clark, Jerry Jeff and Rodney Crowell and just those  really great songwriters from the '60s and '70s, (INAUDIBLE) Van Zant and  Emmy Lou was a great, great mentor to me, and teaching me what great songs  were like and who great song writers were, so, yes. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Bill Anderson, one of the great songwriters ever. </p><p/><p> GILL: No question. Most recorded, probably, in the history of country  music.</p><p/><p> IMUS: Yes. I love him.</p><p/><p> GILL: Even more so than Harlan or any of the others. So, I don't know.</p><p/><p> IMUS: God, wasn't he great, Harlan Howard. Oh, my God. Please.</p><p/><p> GILL: Yes.  We were good buddies. You know, when I first moved to  Nashville, we were great friends and I  would sing all of his demos for  him, $10 a song. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Really? </p><p/><p> GILL: Yes. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p/><p> GILL: There was tons of demos of Harlan's and we were great friends. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Before he died, he sent me a CD that he cut of all of his songs. </p><p/><p> GILL: Wow. </p><p/><p> IMUS: That he had written. He just dubbed, you know, (INAUDIBLE). I mean,  just everything that he did. And, oh, my God, what a great song. </p><p/><p> GILL: He's a great man. You know, when I was first getting started, he  pulled me aside and he said, kid, you're one hell of a guitar player. And I  said, well, thanks, Harlan. And he says, and you're a pretty good  songwriter, but you're one hell of a guitar player, one hell of a singer,  and a pretty good song writer. I said, I get what you're saying. </p><p/><p> IMUS: So you have a new record? </p><p/><p> GILL: Not me, the \"Time Jumpers.\"</p><p/><p> IMUS: OK.</p><p/><p> GILL: This band does. It came out last week.</p><p/><p> IMUS: Maybe I could pay attention.</p><p/><p> GILL: No, that's cool. I mean it's a fun record. You would really love this  record if you like Bill Wills and that swing music. It's an 11 piece bad  full of arguably some of the best talent that's ever graced instruments in  Nashville, Tennessee. All side me. All guys that played for other people.  Session players, things like that. All wanted to have fun on Monday night.  So we got together and -- years ago, they did, and started playing every  Monday night just for the love of it and fun of it. And we still are. We  just made a record. </p><p/><p> IMUS: I can take a little bit of Bob Wills, but it's my contention -- and I  know I'm right -- that nobody likes blue grass music, including the people  who play it. </p><p/><p> GILL: I think you might get a wrestling match over that one. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Oh, I'm sure I will. </p><p/><p> It's great to see you.</p><p/><p> GILL: You too.</p><p/><p> IMUS: It's an honor to have you on the program.</p><p/><p> GILL: Thanks.</p><p/><p> IMUS: You're one of my favorites. You're one of everybody's favorites, so - -</p><p/><p> GILL: Well, right back at you.</p><p/><p> IMUS: My wife loves you and my 14-year-old kid loves you and a lot of  people do. </p><p/><p> GILL: I appreciate it.</p><p/><p> IMUS: The great Vince Gill. </p><p/><p> You know I played that \"Go Rest High on the Mountains\" you wrote for your  brother.</p><p/><p> GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p> IMUS: And I -- and thanks for the money you sent to the ranch when Fred  died. But -- </p><p/><p> GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p/><p> IMUS: He's been dead a year. It's still hard to talk about him. I try --</p><p/><p> GILL: I know.</p><p/><p> IMUS: I played your record. I tried to talk about it and --</p><p/><p> GILL: Yes, my brother's been gone for 20 years. You know, hard to believe.  But, you know, that's -- </p><p/><p> IMUS: Why do we -- what is it? Is it -- why do we -- why does people dying  have that effect on us? It's part of life. </p><p/><p> GILL: Yes. It's because you miss them. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Is it?</p><p/><p> GILL: Yes. I do. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Yes, I guess that is. I mean we're not -- yes, I guess that's what it  is. </p><p/><p> All right, man, it's great to see you. </p><p/><p> GILL: You too, buddy. </p><p/><p> IMUS: Vince Gill. </p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p/><p> We have an update on that Blackberry outage. Research In Motion says  service has been restored and things are back to normal. The company had  reported an outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. </p><p/><p> Checking the markets now. Stocks in Asia rose as the release of that new  iPhone gave the telecom sector a boost. Hong Kong led the way with a 0.7  percent gain. In Europe, the Financial Times is reporting European Union  authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a  bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.  Markets there are currently mixed. London still to the downside by about  three points, but Paris is back in the green, up almost 10 points and  Frankfurt's up by 51. </p><p/><p> Here in the U.S., we've had green arrows across the board all morning. Dow  futures are up by 43, the S&amp;P's up by about four, and the Nasdaq's up by  seven. </p><p/><p> So now that Apple's iPhone 5 is available, we're also finding out what  exactly makes this smartphone work. The repair firm iFixit got its hands on  one, pried it open and found that the device uses chips from Qualcomm,  Avego Technologies and Skyworks Solutions. The phone also includes an audio  chip made by Cirrus Logic. And its gyroscope, which is used to track the  orientation, was made by STMicroelectronics. You can keep an eye on stocks  of those companies and those who didn't contribute to the iPhone 5 to see  how they react today.</p><p/><p> Here's a look at commodities now. Oil and gold are to the upside. Oil's up  by about 60 cents, around $93 a barrel. Gold's up $6 at $1,776 an ounce.</p><p/><p> IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the  power to prosper.</p><p/><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: IMUS IN THE MORNING continues here in  the next hour with Neil Cavuto from the Fox Business Network. He had a  recent interview with Mitt Romney here. So we'll talk to -- the I-man will  talk to Neil about all that's going on in the world. </p><p/><p> And this portion of IMUS IN THE MORNING is brought to you by \"A Wanted Man\"  by Lee Child, now available in hard cover and e-book from Delacorte. Now  five minutes till the hour.</p><p/><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p> IMUS: Here with -- with some thoughts on pot --</p><p/><p> MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p> IMUS: Is Brian Wilson, on the genius of the Beach Boys. </p><p/><p> Good morning, Mr. Wilson. </p><p/><p> ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Good morning, Opie.</p><p/><p> I hear there's a movement to decriminalize marijuana, which is good,  because pot never did anything criminal to anybody, just made them feel  good. People say it's a gateway drug, which I guess it is. It's a gateway  to a beautiful world of pretty flowers and beautiful music and little  bunnies who sing pretty songs and give out candy. </p><p/><p> But it's not like you're going to smoke a doobie and next thing you know  you're mainlining smack or anything. Of course it depends on how strong  your dope is. Like I just got a lid of northern lights white widow wonder  woman. You don't even have to smoke it. You just hold a butt in your hand  for 10 minutes and once the oil gets into your pours, you're a bottle  rocket, man. I think it also might have been sprayed with PCP and Easy Off,  because after I did a half a bong's worth last night, a genie appeared and  told me my oven was magically cleaned. </p><p/><p> But legalization would be good for the economy, not just for the tax they  could collect on the (INAUDIBLE) itself, but for all the sales of  paraphernalia. It'd create jobs making rolling papers, Zip-loc bags,  Twinkies. If they had made weed legal, we could balance a budget by 4:20  the next afternoon.</p><p/><p> LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: Nice.</p><p/><p> BARTLETT: And I'll be sitting in my sandbox with my KCO  keyboard writing a  new song for the cute little bunny who gives out the candy. </p><p/><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network.</p><p/><p> MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  Apple fans around the world are lining up  to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves around the  world today here in New York City.  </p><p/><p> The door should be opening sooner, and Robert Gray is standing by at  Apple's fifth avenue store.  Robert, what is it like out there? </p><p/><p> ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS:  Well, Diane, I don't know if you can hear the  cheers, they're audible behind me. </p><p/><p>Apple employees are outside, greeting the first of the 500 folks who have  been camping out here.</p><p/><p> And the crowd has been swelling as the sun has being rising over Manhattan  this morning, waiting to get in to buy the iPhone 5.  </p><p/><p> The store behind me is not only open 24 hours, seven days a week, they did  close it last night.  </p><p/><p> Not opening until 8 a.m., that is the time that each Apple store in each  time zone has been opening in local time.  </p><p/><p> So, we've had folks here from Arizona, saying that they're facebooking and  tweeting their friends back in Arizona.</p><p/><p> Boasting that they're going to get their hands on the iPhone before those  guys can.  And you can hear the crowd starting to cheer even more there, as  I said, some 500 folks here. </p><p/><p> The new iPhone 5 -- sold out two million, pre-selling in an hour's time.   It's expected to be the fastest and widest rollout yet for Apple, nine  nations have the iPhone selling it.  </p><p/><p> That's the most to participate in it and what we've seen and, analysts  saying that they've stocked piled as many as 10 million units, that's about  $6.4 billion worth of inventory by the way.</p><p/><p> And they're expected according to some analysts to sell as many as 10  million, Ben Stevens saying, they could sell 13 million before the end of  this month.  </p><p/><p> Now, the new phone does boosts faster, processing speed, it works on the 4  GLTE network where you can get that. </p><p/><p>  It also -- it has an enhanced camera, the Siri voice command, it would  give you turn-by-turn navigation, you can post to Facebook.</p><p/><p> You can also book reservations on open table but critics point to the  mapping features saying that they're incomplete, there's been some errors  there, and a lot of hoopla and negative flap about the connectors.</p><p/><p> Which have short meaning that all of those i-gadgets you have there, work  with iPhones, you're going to have to go out and buy new ones, although  there're some analysts who say we're moving to Bluetooth.</p><p/><p> Anyway, it may not be a big issue, down the line it will be though  immediately and Diane, we should also point out a robust secondary market  for iPhones.  </p><p/><p> If you have an iPhone 4s, still under warranty, there are websites out  there, vili.com is one and the CEO telling me, they've seen interest triple  in the past week alone.  </p><p/><p> You'll get about 260 bucks for your old iPhone 4s, that will about cover  the fees, you don't have to pay AT&amp;T to upgrade.  </p><p/><p> If you're going to buy one, you can get one, it'll cost you about 300  bucks, but that's still less than the new ones. </p><p/><p> Which started 199 with a two-year contract.  Back to you. </p><p/><p> MACEDO:  All right, that's Robert Gray outside the Apple store, thanks,  Robert. </p><p/><p> GRAY:  You're welcome. </p><p/><p> MACEDO:  And as Apple focuses on the release of the iPhone 5, Research In  Motion is focusing on a blackberry outage.  </p><p/><p> The company now says service has been restored and things are back to  normal after reporting an earlier outage affecting users in Europe, the  Middle East and Africa.  </p><p/><p> Let's look at the markets now, here in the U.S., Futures have been in the  green across the board all morning, Dow Futures are now up by about 41  points, the S&amp;P is up by almost four, the Nasdaq is up by eight.  </p><p/><p> In Europe, the financial times is reporting European Union Authorities are  working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and  unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p/><p> You can see markets there are currently mixed, and now let's take a closer  look at what's moving them with European markets analyst Jan Randolph.  </p><p/><p> He's a director of Sovereign Risk at IHS Global Insight.  Now Jan,  according to this financial times report, Spain and these European  authorities that it's talking to, are hoping to unveil this bailout plan  possibly in about a week.  </p><p/><p> How do you expect investors to respond if that happens?</p><p/><p> JAN RANDOLPH, DIRECTOR, SOVEREIGN RISK, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT:  I think  positively.  </p><p/><p> I think they're expecting it, I think the lower borrowing costs we've seen  from Spain, in anticipation of the ECB bond buying and the bailout fund  being made available. </p><p/><p> I think it will be a bailout light though, not a fully fledged bailout  though, that will be far too much money.  </p><p/><p> The trick, you can call it that, is to keep private sector on board in  terms of refinancing the Spanish state and to encourage more.  </p><p/><p> I think that's the trick and I think the package will be designed for that  purpose. </p><p/><p> MACEDO:  All right, we'll see if they can do that.  That's Jan Randolph at  IHS, thanks so much, Jan.  </p><p/><p> RANDOLPH:  Thank you.  </p><p/><p> MACEDO:  And Universal Music Group has won approval from EU anti-trust  regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion.  After the  Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record  labels.  </p><p/><p>Universal says the assets to be sold amount to 30 percent of EMI's global  sales.  Citigroup is selling EMI after they acquired the music group when  Vita firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the investment bank. </p><p/><p> Here's a look at commodities now, oil and gold still up, oil is up by about  74 cents around $93 a gallon.  Gold is up 6 bucks at 1,776 an ounce.  </p><p/><p> Coming up this hour, Imus' guest will be our own Neil Cavuto and now,  here's the i-man live on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  So big foot says to me, of all the people we've ever had on the  program, two of the nicest, perhaps the nicest, Vince Gill -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  And Levon Helm.  So, Vince Gill is, that man, that's an American  treasure there, I'll tell you that right now.  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.   </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, here's what I'm trying to understand, Bernard, Connell,  anybody.  Warner, anybody?  Dagen? First, the administration said,  regarding the attack on Libya.</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  That it was all the fault of this hideous movie that was on YouTube  and -- then we had people like K.T. McFarland and others on this program  say, that they believed the attack was essentially nonsense.</p><p/><p> Although it may have served as a convenient excuse, but the anniversary of  9/11 had a lot more to do with it.  </p><p/><p> And now we're being told, I guess, that no, the administration now says,  well, it was a terrorist attack. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.   </p><p/><p> IMUS:  So, here is my question.  Did they know that -- did the President  use the word terrorist, by the way? </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  No.   </p><p/><p> IMUS:  OK.  Has he ever? </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Has he ever used the word period? </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes, does he believe that there's terrorism in the world?</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Oh, yes, he's used -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Sure -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  The word certainly --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes, OK, all right.  Does -- so did they use the movie as a  convenient excuse until they could develop all of the facts and find out  what really happened? Or as opposed to saying we don't know, which would  mean they lied to us. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Right. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  So, sort it out for me, start with you, Bernie? </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Well, they went out as Susan Rice, the U.N. Ambassador on Sunday,  she went, did the tour and proclaimed, pretty much, no uncertain terms,  that it was all about the movie.  </p><p/><p> And which seemed premature and a lot of people said as John McCain said,  you know there was a spontaneous demonstration she said, and John McCain  said you don't bring RPG's to a spontaneous demonstration.</p><p/><p> And sure enough, it comes out later, Fox News now reporting that there was  an al Qaeda guy who was released from Gitmo in 2007.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Who was behind the attacks.  And so, it makes you wonder how  stupid -- I mean, didn't they know that that would come out?  They must  have known, or at least should have considered that it might have come out  when they put out Susan Rice to say these stupid things.</p><p/><p> And it did come out and now they're backtracking, Jay Carney said, yes, it  was an act of terror.  And so, they look dead, they shot themselves in the  foot --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well -- </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Once again.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  The president's conduct to foreign policy is laughable and then my  guy, the suit dummy --  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Romney. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  His comments in the wake of it were idiotic as well.  Shut up until  you know something.  By the way, just butt out. </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Yes, but to mislead the American people -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Or what I said -- </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Because it would look bad politically, so, you can't -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Say that the GM is alive and Bin Laden is dead sort of puts a  monkey wrench into all that. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  I understand.  </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  I mean that's sort of insulting -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  That's what I wondered, so --  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Well, that's what the critics are saying that, you know, they're  trying to change -- oh, it's much easier for the administration to come out  and say what Susan Rice said.  </p><p/><p> It's kind of interesting that she was put out there.  Right, the President  has been very careful on what he's personally said about this.  </p><p/><p> Even yesterday, as you said, he didn't use the word terrorism, it was Jay  Carney, his spokesman, not him.   </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, there we are.  Neil Cavuto -- I mean, and these are the two  guys we've got running. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.   </p><p/><p> IMUS:  I mean, it's just -- all right, eight minutes after the hour here on  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  </p><p/><p> Neil Cavuto is coming up, I saw him this morning, when I walked in the  building and it was before 5:30 a.m. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Wow. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  And he looked cute and perky down there in the lobby and he got all  exercised hysterical because I had my little oxygen tank with me because I  couldn't breathe this morning so -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Got to get by.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  What is it you're going to do?</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  That's right. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  What is it you're going to do? So, all that's going on, and then of  course last night's football game, we're going to listen to Warner Wolf and  that dope Gunz -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Hey, come on.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Or any of the guys on the pre-game show -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  On the NFL network, which by the way is a disaster. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  But Rich Eison and that dope Deion Sanders and Michael Irvin and --  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Marshall Faulk?  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Marshall Faulk and that dope, that fat dope -- why is the, why is  the name calling necessary?  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Simply -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Steve Mariucci -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  It's better -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Every single one of these dopes -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Right -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Picked the tail out of Panthers across the board.  And the Giants  won 36 to 7.  </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Well -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Now what?  </p><p/><p> WOLF:  I told Gunz I'm going to watch out for these reserves --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh, God, you're a disgrace. </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On that, no -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  What are the Yankees doing? </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Now, the Yankees lead by one with 13 to play -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  All right -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  And they all play, Orioles play losers and so do the Yanks. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Is there any other race any place in the country?   </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Well, we have a two-game lead in the White Sox and Tigers.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Right.  </p><p/><p> WOLF:  That's really it, because -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  OK -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Now the A's are four back --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes, fine, we don't need to run that -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  That's it -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Oh, OK.    </p><p/><p> IMUS:  All right, ten minutes after the hour, let's do some news, Bill  Clinton is here, going to talk about -- what are you talking about? </p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  Monica Lewinsky's new book. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh, man, I can't wait to read this, come on, dude.  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  You know, Juan Williams is right.  I'm probably making too big a  deal out of O'Reilly's characterization of Lee Harvey Oswald as a  sharpshooter. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Right.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  I don't know, but it just annoys me, but other than that, the book  is great, \"Killing Kennedy\".  All right, let's do the news, good morning  Connell. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Good morning, i-man.  Well, we're keeping an eye on Pakistan this  morning because there are protesters on the streets over there.  </p><p/><p> One of the things they won't be able to use their cell phones because the  government blocked cell service in major cities, worried that phones might  be used to detonate bombs. </p><p/><p> And speaking of, you know that movie -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  People living in mud huts -- </p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  I mean is it -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Living in dirt and they've got cell phones. </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  If these people put this kind of energy into being industrious -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  And you know, building up their -- you know, it's unbelievable.   Just relax, man, go to work. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Like a fool, I'm going to have Gunz and Warner pick the games coming  up here. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  OK, good --   </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Right. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Well, today is a national day of protest in Pakistan against that  movie, that -- you know, you mentioned produced here in the United States.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Listened to Ann Romney for a second, she was on a radio show in  Iowa asking Republicans to stop attacking her husband. </p><p/><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What do you say to your fellow Republicans who are -- </p><p/><p> ANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY:  Stop it.  This is hard, you want to try  it, get in the ring.  </p><p/><p> (END AUDIO CLIP) </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  You want to try it, get in the ring, is what she said. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh, well, I mean, I mean, I appreciate her depending her husband. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Yes. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  She's a nice woman and all that, it's just --  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  That's it. </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Well, let's wait until after November before we start with the  second guessing with the critics, I mean, not you chief.  But I'm talking  about some of these supposed Republican allies. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  That's right.  . </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  We're in a battle here, come on.  Whose side you want?    </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Speaking of which, the polls 47 percent apiece, dead heat in the  daily tracking poll from Gallop yesterday, but Romney's problem has been in  these swing state polls.</p><p/><p> Another one out from the \"Wall Street Journal\" \"Nbc News\", it's Obama up  eight points in Iowa, leading by five points both in Wisconsin and in  Colorado.</p><p/><p> Here's the question for you, who do you think had the most watched  convention speech? Well, it turns out Joe Biden, the Vice-President.  43.6  million people for what it's worth, President Obama close second followed  by Mitt Romney, Bill Clinton and Marco Rubio. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, of course, because we thought it was going to be a car wreck.  </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  That's right.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Absolutely.  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Tuning in, in case -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Thirteen after the hour, let's do some business news, and here with  that is Dagen McDowell.  Good morning, Dagen. </p><p/><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, sir.  The Dow Futures are up about 44 points right  now. </p><p/><p>  And Apple iPhone is on sale in New York City, 8 a.m. local time is when  this thing goes on sale.</p><p/><p> And according to reports from my producers on the ground, Apple employees  were outside clapping, high-fiving people, they were all excited, yes,  happy times.  </p><p/><p> Anyway, Blackberry, I told you about that outage last hour in Europe, the  Middle East and Africa, service has been restored.  </p><p/><p> Thankfully, but it's a joke and a black eye for blackberry on the day that  iPhone 5 launches, that's it.   </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Thirteen after the hour, you use blackberry you're a dingleberry,  that's what -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Well -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  They test on -- </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Excuse me -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Dingleberry -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Thirteen after the hour, it's time for sports, and sports is  sponsored by Peerless Boilers.  But before we do sports, of course, the  Giants won last night, big. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Put a butt whipping on the tail of the Panthers.  Let's pick the  games, each time we start first with you, Gunz and then you Warner. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  OK.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Jets-Dolphins? </p><p/><p> MICHAEL GUNZELMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Dolphins, come on now, let's go  Dolphins, screw -- I'm not picking the Jets for the rest of the year.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Warner -- </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  There's no way -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  No, I like the Jets in this one.  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  That's right --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  OK, Bears-Rams? </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  I got the Rams actually in this one. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  How about you, Warner?</p><p/><p> WOLF:  No, I have the Bears. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Dallas Cowboys -- </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> And they're playing the Buccaneers, who do you like there? </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  I've got the Bucs on this one. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Oh, man, I have the Cowboys.</p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right --     </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Cowboys favored by 7 1/2, Gunz. </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  Well, yes. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  OK, 49ers and the Vikings?</p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  I got the '9ers, yes, definitely the '9ers, yes.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  OK, Lions-Titans, or who do you have Warner?  </p><p/><p> WOLF:  The Lions. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  OK, you know 49ers and the Vikings? </p><p/><p> WOLF:  49ers. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  OK, Lions-Titans? </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  I got the Lions. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Redskin -- how about you Warner? </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Yes, Lions, right.   </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Or Redskins-Bengals?  </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  Skins.  </p><p/><p> WOLF:  No, I think the Bengals will win.   </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Saints-Chiefs? </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  I have the Saints on this one, the Saints need a win.  They  desperately need a win.    </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Saints win, yes.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  OK, Bills-Browns? </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  Bills on this one. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  No, I think the Browns, they haven't played bad.  I think --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Warner bored me, he made me watch that.</p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  No chance.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Colts-Jaguars? </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  Actually I have the Jags on this one. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Wow. </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  I'm over Andrew Luck. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  No, he's good, I like the Colts. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Eagles-Cardinals?</p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  I'll never go for the Eagles, let's go Cardinals. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  I'll take the Eagles. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Wow.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  You're a disgrace, you must not have a pet.  So, Chargers-Falcons? </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  I have the -- this one is kind of a tossup either one --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  God, who would watch that? --  </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  Chargers, yes, exactly, I got the Chargers though, it's a  tossup.   </p><p/><p> WOLF:  No, I like the Falcons. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Texans-Broncos? </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  I'm actually, because you made fun of me earlier, I'm going  with the Broncos, I'm over the Texans, because they're your team. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Although I like Peyton Manning -- </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  Yes -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  But my Texans are going to win.  </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  They'll probably --  </p><p/><p> WOLF:  I like the -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Steelers-Raiders, who do you like Warner? </p><p/><p> WOLF:  I like the Broncos. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Steelers-Raiders? We don't have all the time here, come on --  </p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  Steelers. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Yes, Steelers.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  And finally, the Ravens and the Patriots?</p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  Ravens. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Ravens, yes --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh, really?</p><p/><p> GUNZELMAN:  All of them, yes.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  It's not good, all right, quickly sports. </p><p/><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right, quick.  </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Yes, all right, quickly, as you said earlier, the Giants win 36 to  7, and the story with the two backups.</p><p/><p> Andre Brown, 113 yards, 20 carries.  And the wide receiver Ramses Barden, a  138 yards and receptions on 9 catches.  </p><p/><p> And Cam Newton was horrible.  Yanks win and they lead the idle Orioles by  one.  Ichiro a home run, a double, he's now nine for his last 12.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Wow.  </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Yes, the Phillies had 21 hits and beat the Mets 16 to 1.  In golf,  Tiger Woods and Justin Rose share the lead of that FedEx cup playoff.  </p><p/><p> And finally, i-man, 62-year-old Carolina coach Roy Williams was released  from a hospital after removal of a tumor in his right kidney.</p><p/><p> And whether the tumor is malignant or benign will help determine if  Williams needs another tumor removed from his left kidney. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh, man, that's not good. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  No.  Not good at all.  So --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Seventeen after -- </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  It's fast -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes, terrible --   </p><p/><p> WOLF:  It's the deal -- </p><p/><p> MCSSHANE:  All right, Warner.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Seventeen after the hour, I'm coughing like I'm a mental patient. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Well -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Bernie has got a briefing coming up, what's there, B?  </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Got Bill Clinton, Jon Stewart, David Letterman and sexual hijinks  at \"Good Morning America\".  You're going to like that one -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, sexual hijinks where? </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  \"Good morning America\", the \"Abc\" morning show there. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  All right, baby.  All right, please welcome now, speaking of that to  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, former president of the United States,  Bill Clinton, good morning, Mr. President.   </p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  Well, morning, i-man.  Well, it was only a matter of time, but I  guess $12 million is $12 million.  So Monica Lewinsky is going to publish  her memoir with all the gory details.</p><p/><p> Every sleazy, sticky, creepy, crawly bit of nastiness, and once it hits the  bestseller list, Bill O'Reilly is going to be able to start writing his  next book, \"Killing Clinton\".</p><p/><p> Because Hillary will shoot me.  It's bad enough that the love ick on the  blue dress was made public for a while there.</p><p/><p> I even thought they were going to put it on display and this masonian next  to Lincoln's stovepipe hat. </p><p/><p> But now, Monica is going to reveal all my sex secrets, like my insatiable  appetite for three-way sex.  Which isn't what you were thinking is, is it  just really?</p><p/><p> I only know three ways of doing it, four, if count missionary, but having  somebody else in the picture, that's just sick, unless the extra person is  A, a woman and B, hot.  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  But Monica is also going to reveal my fondness for sex toys.   OK, one time I used some legos to build a little garage for my weiner. </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> But it wasn't, you know a butt plug the size of a lava lamp.  </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> But what really hurts is the allegation that she has to do this because she  needs to make a living and can't get a job because of me, which is just not  true.  </p><p/><p> She could get a job tomorrow, in a cigar store -- </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  Or better yet, a shoe store because you know, she's real good on  her knees. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  So, 19 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  From  their brand new album, \"Hillbilly Jedi\", Big and Rich.  That was a good  record.  </p><p/><p> And my baby gone.  </p><p/><p> (MUSIC) </p><p/><p> IMUS:  You know, I never thought about it, about women's hair thinning.  I  thought only men got bald until I saw a bald-headed woman.  And you do not  want that in your house, a bald-headed woman, that is not good. </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  No.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, you can fix that though, because from Chamonix, a good outfit  you can trust them.  </p><p/><p> They offer a money-back guarantee of all of their products, the Esotique,  the T-Gen, the Heart Factors Plus.</p><p/><p> They now have this stuff, this serum called ProVia, p-r-o-v-i-a, it's all  natural hair serum from Chamonix, a money-back guarantee, you rub this in  your gored there for two or three weeks and whatever.  </p><p/><p> And your hair is going to get thicker and will look better.  So it's not  falling on the floor there, you don't need that.  So, call 800-754-6980.  </p><p/><p> ProVia fights follicle aging and improves scalp microcirculation all at the  same time.  It is guaranteed to work, if you will call now, they'll throw  in a free month supply of this stuff.  </p><p/><p> Or you could rub it on your hair until you make yourself insane.  800-754- 6980, call and get it.  </p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> MACEDO:  Hi, everyone, I'm Diane Macedo.

They were a one point favorite, now  the four regulars are out.  Carolina is a one point favorite. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh.   </p><p/><p> WOLF:  Here was Cam Newton on tonight's game. </p><p/><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p> CAM NEWTON, QUARTERBACK, CAROLINA PANTHERS:  I'm a football player at the  end of the day.  If they want me to run, I'll run, if they want me to  throw, I'll throw.  </p><p/><p> If they want me to block, I'm going to block, if they want me to go get  some water to better the team, I'm going to do it. </p><p/><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p> IMUS:  I wonder what he is at the beginning of the day?</p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> TONY POWELL, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  Or cares about the mid part of the day. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Or at noon.  </p><p/><p> POWELL:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Or the middle part of that day. </p><p/><p> WOLF:  That's a good question. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  At the end of the day -- </p><p/><p> WOLF:  That's right.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  He's a football player.  </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> So, what is he at the beginning of the day, a runway model? </p><p/><p> WOLF:  That's good.  </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> IMUS:  It is 25 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program,  this portion of the program is sponsored by My Pillow, the official online  sponsor of \"Wabc Radio\".</p><p/><p> Enter a promo code Imus for your 25 percent discount and these fools are  giving this stuff away.  </p><p/><p> All right, time for a Bernie briefing here now, and with that is Bernard  McGuirk.  Good morning Mr. McGuirk.   </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Good morning, Mr. Imus.  And the big dawg Bill Clinton was on  with your friend Jon Stewart last night and he was boring, he was just  flat-out.  </p><p/><p> He made Charlie Rose sound like Mad Dog Russo, he was so boring.  But,  listen to Jon Stewart do his best impersonation of Monica Lewinsky  journalistically. </p><p/><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p> JON STEWART, COMEDIAN &amp; TELEVISION HOST:  Give any good speeches lately or?  How was that -- how did that feel at the convention? </p><p/><p> Could you tell that you were crushing it as you were doing it? Did you, did  you feel that? </p><p/><p> BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Yes and no.  But --  because I didn't want to talk down to people, I wanted to explain what I  thought was going on. </p><p/><p> STEWART:  That's what was so stunning, I think.  That's why it was such a  bracing speech.  The phrase you mentioned earlier about getting the facts  right, and they would have -- you would attach numbers to them that were  real.  </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> I thought it was a bold choice on your part. </p><p/><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  I mean he's going to have to send his jackets to the cleaners  after that, I mean, just figuratively, it was sort of nauseating.  But --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  What? There was not any --  </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  The way he just -- I mean, did he ask him about the memoir that's  coming out? --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh, no -- </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Memoir --</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Stewart was jerking his chain. </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  No, he wasn't. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes, he was. </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  I saw it.  He was --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  He wasn't jerking his chain?   </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Not at all.  He was telling him what a great speech you gave and  could you put facts out there, unlike Mitt Romney -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  You're telling me Stewart wasn't kidding with that? </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  No, not at all.  That was a straight-up journalistic -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Didn't he sound like he was kidding -- </p><p/><p> BARTLETT:  I mean, I didn't see it, so, I mean, I was there?  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  He didn't sound like he was kidding? </p><p/><p> POWELL:  Little tongue in cheek to me.   </p><p/><p> IMUS:  That's what he sounded, like a little tongue in cheek.  Really? </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  No, absolutely not.   </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, because you're a hater. </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  No, because I actually watched it, I saw it.  Now, let's move on  here, boss, because the clock is ticking and I know you want to get Mr.  Cavuto on.  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  And we got us a little sex scandal over at \"Good Morning  America\". </p><p/><p> IMUS:  All right. </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  You know, locally here in New York City, you have this news  anchor on \"Channel 7\", \"Wabc\" Liz Cho. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh, my God, that's a home wrecker there. </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Well, excuse me.  She and this dude, Josh Elliott, who's an  anchor on \"Good Morning America\", they're apparently an item.  I'm going to  read from the \"New York Post\" --  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  I thought she was married. </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Well, she was.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Oh -- </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  This is what the \"New York Post\" page six writes this morning.   \"After we revealed yesterday that 41-year-old beauty Cho, the co-anchor of  \"Wabc TV\" in New York, split with her husband and moved out of their  Yonkers mansion three months ago.  </p><p/><p> She insisted through friends that they're just friends.  She's 41, he's 41  and they say \"That this guy Elliott is a regular visitor to Liz's new  apartment on west 90th street, baby.</p><p/><p> And he's been spotted leaving the building in the morning.  He's even been  picked up from Cho's part to head to work at \"Good Morning America\" where  he works as a news anchor.</p><p/><p> Good morning Elizabeth.  But they insists that the relationship began after  she moved out of the Yonkers mansion. </p><p/><p> IMUS:  OK.   </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Right, it has to be true, right?  </p><p/><p> RUFINO:  All right.  </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Yes, but in any case, you know this guy Josh Elliott, he's sort  of in Kris Humphries area, he hosts this unwatchable \"Good Afternoon  America\" show -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  No, I don't --   </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  With Lara Spencer.  Well, anyway this is blooming over -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Stuff about praising anchor, no, I don't.   </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  And they're beating the crap out of the \"Today Show\" by the way - - </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Not good, I'm happy about that.  </p><p/><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Yes.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  That's all you got? </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  Well, I do have another piece of David Letterman clip, busting on  Jay Leno and Mitt Romney, but --   </p><p/><p> IMUS:  No, he's a creep -- </p><p/><p> MCGUIRK:  We can save it.  </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Thirty minutes after the hour, and here, Cavuto is next.  </p><p/><p> One of Neil's favorite songs.</p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network.   And now, here is Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p> MACEDO:  Good morning, everyone.  General Motors is recalling more than  426,000 Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn sedans in the U.S. due to  transmission problems.  The recall affects vehicles model years 2007 to  2010.</p><p/><p>        The automaker says the transmission gear position may not match the  gear on the shifter and that could cause the vehicle to move when drivers  think they're in park.  GM says it's aware of four crashes due to the  problem, but no injuries reported as of now.</p><p/><p>        Meanwhile, the recall news after General Motors announced it has  reached an agreement with the Canadian Autoworkers Union over a labor  contract.  Under the tentative four year deal, GM will add a third shift to  its flex line at its Ontario facility.</p><p/><p>        The automaker had planned to shutdown that plant three-shift  consolidated line next June, but will operate with at least one line until  June of 2014.  The CAW continues to negotiate a deal with Chrysler after it  already reached one with Ford earlier in the week.</p><p/><p>        IMUS IN THE MORNING continues now after we check the weather with  Fox 5 meteorologist, Mike Woods.</p><p/><p> MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST:  Good morning, everyone.  Looks like we  have some wet weather out there, but not a ton of it for the country here.   We've got an area of low pressure still rotating around the Great Lakes,  but it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwest and Central Mississippi  Valley area.</p><p/><p>        And then back towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east  and also a few showers popping up around Florida again, southeast, slightly  risky in terms of showers and storms.  Tampa, you'll see a few scattered  storms and high temp today, 88 degrees.</p><p/><p>        And Phoenix, no rain for you, sunny skies with a high of 103 and  Seattle partly cloudy skies with a high of 63.  Sacramento, California,  you've got sunny skies there today with a high of 91, still warm.  I'm Mike  Woods from Fox 5 in New York.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  All right, it's 36 minutes past the hour here on the IMUS IN THE  MORNING program.  Please welcome to the program, senior vice president,  anchor manager, Fox Business News, Fox News Channel, a man who sadly calls  himself the financial factor, Neil P. Cavuto.  What does the P stand for?</p><p/><p> NEIL P. CAVUTO, FOX BUSINESS:  Patrick.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Good morning, Mr. Cavuto.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Good morning, Mr. Imus.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  How are you?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  It was scary bumping into you this morning.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, I had my little oxygen tank with me.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  You kind of looked like Hannibal Lector being driven in on a  gurney and I thought, is he up to doing the show today?  But here you are,  encouragement to all us.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, anaerobic, but I recover quickly and I don't need oxygen just  to sit around and talk.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I admire that.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Happy birthday tomorrow.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  How did you know that?</p><p/><p> IMUS:  It's my job to know those things.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Thank you very much.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  So, you like the Vince Gill interview?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I liked it very much, I'm a big fan of his and I thought you did a  very good job.  A lot of people, you know, when you interview stars it's  always tough.  You do a fawning interview or you do a revealing one  particularly like the things about your brother, how tough that is and  trying to get a handle on it, very real.  I liked it very much.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  So I asked you off the air if you liked Romney.  Do you?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I do, personally I like him a lot.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  It doesn't bother you that he's a dope, right?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  He's not a dope.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  OK, he's not a good campaigner, is he?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I think that remains to be seen.  The election hasn't happened  yet.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  No, sir.  Do you think that these leaked videos, these missteps that  they've each made, is going to make a difference when people vote?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  No.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  You don't?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I do not.  I think in the end, it always is the economy.  I think  that's what-- we could have extenuating circumstances, the Middle East  explosion, could have the impact, but almost every U.S. election is decided  by the economy.</p><p/><p>        How good people feel, how maybe not so good people feel and we're  always willing to entertain switching horses mid stream when an incumbent  is battling a tough economy, but we've really got to see the other horse.</p><p/><p>        I think in 1980 when the polls were similarly tight between Jimmy  Carter and Ronald Reagan.  A lot of people liked Jimmy Carter, frustrated  with the economy, but they were more than willing to entertain an  alternative and along came Ronald Reagan to appeal to alternative.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  How many people vote for the person who they like the best?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I think it plays a part.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  How big a part?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I do think it helped George Bush, many polls were done on  the debate between he and Al Gore and then later on between he and John  Kerry.  And I think most people said who won the debates?</p><p/><p>        And a lot of them said, particularly in 2004, with John Kerry, who  do you like more or relate to more?  George Bush.  I'm not saying that's  always the case, but it does help if people feel you're either more  approachable or likeable.</p><p/><p>        And I think in 1960 from the television critics later who said that  Richard Nixon was sweating and detached and John Kennedy looked relaxed and  smooth.  These things on some level do connect for people.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Talking with Neil Cavuto -- talking with Neil Cavuto here on the  IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  It's 5 until the hour, you know what you  ought to do here at Fox?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  What's that?</p><p/><p> IMUS:  An interesting experiment because my wife mentioned this to me.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  She wants to have sex with you, by the way.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Who doesn't?</p><p/><p> IMUS:  I don't.  Wants to have sex with you -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  And go ahead.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Anyway.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Come on, Don, tell me.  Go ahead, please.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, I forgot -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  At least say something, you guys.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Here is what you should do.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Like an interview by Rainman.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  When is the first debate, October 1st?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I think the 3rd.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  It's the day he hit the home run.  Here is what you should do.   Please don't interrupt when I'm talking with Mr. Cavuto, Warner.  I'll come  over there and beat on you like a rented mule.  Just kidding.  You should  get a group of people.</p><p/><p>        Frank -- You should do it.  Get a group, have them listen to the  audio feed and don't let them watch it and have the group just watch it on  television and then poll each group to see who won.  Who they think won.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  That's not a bad idea.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  It is a good idea isn't it?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  It's a very good idea.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Because Deirdre said to me -- don't you hate it when guys quote  their wives.  You know, that means they're so p-whipped.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  And she's insane for putting up with you.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Absolutely.  Because you get distracted who looked and -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Yes, yes.  And history bears that out.  I mean, people who, I  guess, were listened in to the Nixon-Kennedy debate thought Nixon, and Bush  and Al Gore.  That was a little more debatable than Kerry and Bush.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Should I call Roger and -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Please do, please do.  I'm not going to act on this because I  actually think the idea is silly.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Do you really?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  I do.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  You do?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I think 90 percent of people are going to be watching and not  listening.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Well, you're just, I don't know, you're just -- I don't know.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I just, I think in 1960, it would have been a brilliant  idea, but last time I checked -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  It's a good idea now just to see.  It's 18 until the hour here on  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Did you read \"Killing Lincoln?\"</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I did read it.  It's a great book.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  But I'll tell you what is a terrific book \"Killing Kennedy.\"</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I haven't -- I know it's out or will be out, but-- I really  enjoyed \"Killing Lincoln\", the way he built it up and x number of days to  live and I thought when I first opened it, we know what happened in the  end.</p><p/><p>        But he didn't do a great job and see what the Kennedy book, but I  think he's got -- he could a series on his hands.  I don't know how you  handle Philmore, getting Philmore, but -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  It's enormously entertaining and there's no heavy lifting, not a -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I think it's a very good point.  A lot of the stories, Brinkley, I  love dearly and Harry Truman, 900 pages on and on and all great, but you  can make this fun and engaging.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  And accessible.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  It's a way to do it.  I didn't see the kids' version that's out  but -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  That's pretty good, too.  It's pretty good, too, so, do you think he  writes any of it.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I think he does.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  What's -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  -- his show.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  That doesn't make any difference.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  No, it doesn't, but when you say does he write his stuff?  Of  course, he writes his stuff.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  How is that demeaning -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  You say does he write the book.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  As a journalist, I have a -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Excuse me?  Excuse me.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  It's 17 until the hour here in the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Are  you a sports fan?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  No.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Not at all.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I heard you guys go through the Sunday games.  I guess these are  football games?  Terrific, no offense guns and Warner but -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  That's fine, but do you ever watch sports on television?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I have the attention span of a gnat.  I watch the highlights.  I  said, why can't the games be like the highlights?</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Do you ever watch Sports Center?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  No.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Where do you get the highlights?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Passing around the news or online, but I'm not really -- I'm  afraid I'm not really into it.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  So, do you watch television?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I know this is going to sound elitist, but I really don't.  I'm  just, it's not -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Mr. Cavuto -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I watch you, of course, I mean, that's a staple.  Connell and  Dagen and flip over -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  Mr. Cavuto is on at 4 in the afternoon on the Fox News Channel and 8  p.m. and do you think that -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I want to come back at you with anger, but I saw you with the  oxygen tank and go lightly no need to be mean.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  It's a quarter until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  This is three times in this hour with this interview, you relay  the time.  It's always fascinating to me why you do that.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  I'm doing a radio program.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I know that.  I know, but -- like I say there are clocks in those  cars, right?</p><p/><p> IMUS:  I can stop giving the time.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  OK, more time for me.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Bernie, put a call in to Bob -- anyway do you think Obama is a  socialist?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  No.  I think he likes big government.  I think he likes more big  government and espouses the view much like FDR in 1932, government the only  way to get us out of the mess and a lot more people are beholden to the  government as a result of that.</p><p/><p>        And he's got a pretty good base of people who would vote for him as  a result and I think that probably was what Mitt Romney was inelegantly  getting at.  But we all remember, you know, but FDR got re-elected in a  landslide in 36 even though the economy still, still was pretty bad.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  As ours does.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  And you would think that one of the things that Romney could get  some traction and I think, that you asked, I think -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Your thoughts are very valuable to me.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  I think the day that Romney gets elected, the economy is better just  by -- he doesn't have to do anything, do you agree with that?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Well, you have to do something.  You're popping up in a different  -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  That wasn't the question.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  You mean, well, it's a stupid point.  Sounds like Godzilla,  January 20th just by virtue of being Godzilla being in the office because  it's not Barack Obama, things are better.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  If it makes you feel like a bigger person, which you're -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  OK, you know, I could lose weight, you will always be evil.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  To make me feel bad by calling me a list of names, but don't you  think the way the markets would react -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  It's always fine until -- </p><p/><p> IMUS:  And the financial community.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  That the things would, people would feel better and I know he has do  something, your suit dummy candidate and mine, but wouldn't have to do  anything, but just get elected and it would be better.  Do you think that's  true?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I don't, I don't, obviously if the nation turns to the challenger  to throw the incumbent out of office.  It's hoping what you said.  And  remember, electing Ronald Reagan in a landslide didn't bring results, in  fact, the recession many more years and jobs lost until we had to boom in  '82.</p><p/><p>        Coming out of that so things take time, I'm not subscribing to the  screw that automatically things are better.  They're ready to do well if we  don't keep what we're doing and stop with a new guy in there.  But you have  to do stuff.</p><p/><p>        You have to put up some initiatives that will change the direction.   Ronald Reagan did, and you know, the question would be for Romney  administration, if it were to happen, whether it would.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Is there a way now to know -- is there a way for you to know who  will win the election?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I have no idea.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Do you have a gut sense?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I do, but I'm not going to share that with you.  I will say this - - </p><p/><p> IMUS:  You're really a creep.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  That's lovely.  I only relate this to you.  I think I told you  this before.  When I went to Wisconsin to cover the recall election, polls  going into that weekend had dead even.  I think it had it dead even and we  know at that Walker won by six points.</p><p/><p>        Now, I had a theory and I could be very wrong that conservative  support is understated in some of the state polls, maybe with unwinding a  bit it's beyond the margin of error, but I do think these states apparently  Mitt Romney is going to get blown out in, I don't subscribe to that.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  You're going to get to the point eventually, right?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  I just told you.  And I think the polls in the battle ground state  understate Romney's support.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Hope you're right.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  And when you say Romney's my man you always say that.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  But then you disparage him.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Keeping it real.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  And for every wonderful interview like Vince Gill and then you do  one like you did with Frank Rich.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  My job is to keep it real, right, Bernie?</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  Frank Rich interview, just kept it real.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Keeping it real.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  OK.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  Thank you very much for -- </p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  This is it? </p><p/><p> IMUS:  You were on for 12 minutes.</p><p/><p> CAVUTO:  That's 12 minutes of my life.  I'm never getting back.</p><p/><p> IMUS:  And so does the audience.</p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> MACEOD:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Diane Macedo.  Let's take a look at  the markets.  In Europe, the \"Financial Times\" is reporting that European  Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a  bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p/><p>        Markets there are now mixed with London down by about 5 points.   Paris is up 10 and Frankfort is up about 64.  Here in the U.S., we have  seen green arrows across the board all morning.  Dow futures are up by 56.   The S&amp;P is up by about 5 and the Nasdaq is up by 13.</p><p/><p>        Now that Apple's iPhone is available, we're also finding out exactly  what makes the smartphone work.  The repair firm fix it, got one open and  chips from Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solution.</p><p/><p>        The iPhone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus Logic and its  gyroscope, which is used to track its orientation was made by ST  Microelectronics.  Keep an eye on those stocks and those are the companies  that didn't participate in the iPhone to see the reaction today.</p><p/><p>        The world's biggest retailer is looking to do business in India.   The \"Wall Street Journal\" reports Wal-Mart hopes to open its first stores  in the country within two years.  That move comes after the government last  week agreed to allow international supermarket chains to enter India  through joint ventures.</p><p/><p>Wal-Mart says it hadn't decided yet where or how many stores it  would like to have, but the company expects to continue its current  partnerships with barky enterprises of India, a chain of 17 cash and carry  stores.</p><p/><p>        Here's a look at commodities, oil and gold are up.  IMUS IN THE  MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.</p><p/><p> (IMUS EXTRA SEGMENTS)</p><p/><p> END</p><p/><p> END</p><p/><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone. Apple fans are on the world of lining up to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves around the world today including here in New York City where our own Robert Gray is standing by at Apple's Fifth Avenue store. Robert, it is 6:00 in the morning. What does it look like out there right now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Diane. Good morning. There are a few hundred folks out here in line behind me. You can see them and in fact, the big cube here which this store is famous for, which lead you to an underground entrance way, the store is normally a 24-7 operation. They closed it overnight. It will not open until 8 a.m. local time. And of course, that is the roll out plan across nine different nations here.</p><p>This is the widest rollout that Apple has had yet for one of their iPhones. Now, a key numbers to hit here. We've seen every iPhone new version has outsold a combined total of all the previous versions. This of course is a law of large numbers. It is going to be tough to duplicate. We'll have to wait and see. Most reviewers out there saying this phone a little bit more evolutionary than revolutionary.</p><p>And of course, there's been a lot of feedback and flak, if you will, about the new connectors out there. They are of course shrinking the connectors down to nine pins from 30. So, all the products that you have around the house, connectors et cetera, you'll going to have to go out and buy some more of those. So, Apple is expected to make a big hole out of this as well as of course some of their third party partners out there. You're going to talk a little bit all morning long.</p><p>Of course, we're expecting a faster processor on board, you got the new ear pods, the camera higher resolution, reportedly better. As the phone even now of course, some reviewers out there and analysts that I've spoken with Diane, saying that as far as the camera goes and processing speed, they're just now catching up to some of the rivals out there. But of course, as you can see, still plenty of Apple fans out here braving the early morning, though we must say pretty mild here in New York City. Back to you.</p><p>MACEDO: All right. That's Robert Gray live at the Apple store. Thanks, Robert.</p><p>GRAY: You're welcome.</p><p>MACEDO: Meanwhile, E.U. anti-trust regulators have cleared universal music group to buy British record company EMI as recorded music unit for $1.9 billion after the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record labels. Universal says, the assets to be sold amounts to 30 percent of EMI's global sales. Citigroup is selling EMI having acquired the music group when buy-out firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the investment bank.</p><p>Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., futures have been in the green across the board all morning. Dow futures are up by about 40 points. The S&amp;P is up by almost four. The NASDAQ is up by seven.</p><p>In Europe, the Financial Times reports European Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank. Markets are currently mixed. London was green earlier, now we're seeing it in the red down by almost nine points. Paris and Frankfurt still in the green.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at what's moving those markets with Josh Raymond now, chief market strategist at City Index in London. Now, Josh, the FT is reporting that Spain is moving closer to a bailout. Should investors read that as a negative or should they find some release in having some more certainty on that front?</p><p>JOSH RAYMOND, CITY INDEX CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: I think it is a positive. And it does provide some certainty. You know, the markets -- investors have been fairly convinced that more is required. There has been political maneuvering going on with Spain saying that they've got austerity measures in there. They don't require the fully -- bailout. But we already know that they're actually in talks, so we have that -- a few people of the Spanish government actually recently earlier on this week say, it will provide a level of certainty. And I think that would be reacted positively by the market. Of course, it depends on the scale which the (INAUDIBLE) will require, I mean, the ECB through monetary transactions have an unlimited scope to do so as well.</p><p>MACEDO: And Josh, Mario Monti is holding meetings in Italy with several leaders today. What do you expect to come out of them?</p><p>RAYMOND: Not much unfortunately. And we're getting used to all these meetings taking place and strong rhetoric talking about a fiscal union, stronger banking regulations, that sort of thing but nothing really comes of it. And I think investors are a little bit more wiser to that these days. Now, we already have the ECB. And the main focus for us at the moment really is the ECB and Spain. Now, we've obviously got the -- from the ECB and we're waiting for Spain to confirm or to agree that the terms towards that fully first bailout. Those are the key things that we're looking at.</p><p>MACEDO: OK. More brain storming for the many results. We'll see if it comes out that way. Thanks, Josh. That's Josh Raymond from London.</p><p>K.B. Home meanwhile is reporting a surprise profit this morning. The home builder says it made four cents a share in its third quarter.

Oil and gold are both to the upside.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Well, it's going to be a great show.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Great show. Great day in New York today.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yep.</p><p>IMUS: Last day of summer. Going to be 73 degrees. Let's do some sunbathing, baby.</p><p>So, anyway, coming up this morning, Juan Williams, <person><nameText>FOX News, </nameText></person>and the great Vince Gill. Now, Vince -- when I say great, I mean great. He's not going to sing. He's coming in to talk. Now, why would you book somebody like Vince Gill just to talk? Because he's worth talking to.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's it.</p><p>IMUS: There's a few of these guys, people who I would talk to. It would be him -- who are worth talking to. Dwight Yoakam.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Smart guy, Yoakam.</p><p>MCSHANE: Uh-huh!</p><p>IMUS: Crazy but good crazy. Delbert, smart guy, funny.</p><p>MCSHANE: Of course.</p><p>IMUS: Kinky.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, not many more, right?</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: Billy Ray?</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM PRODUCER: He's one of the nicest guys too, Dwight Yoakam.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, yes.</p><p>IMUS: He is, isn't he?</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, he's really nice guy.</p><p>IMUS: You know the day I got fired, he called me on my cell phone. I was on my way to meet the team. And I was in the car.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: He's a good man. He understood what the deal was. And so, you know. You can't say stuff like that, man. Don't pick on people. Just don't do it, whether you're trying to be funny or not. Come on.</p><p>Anyway, and so, and then the big dog's here, Bill Clinton.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, good.</p><p>IMUS: He's concerned about this book that Monica Lewinsky is going to do.</p><p>MCSHANE: I like that.</p><p>IMUS: About them sex positions. And then, Warner?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: You and Gunz.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, sir.</p><p>IMUS: You skunks. And Steve Mariucci, the pregame show on the NFL Network, there are two reasons to watch that. Other than that.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, good bye.</p><p>IMUS: They suck, Rich Eisen, sucks. Steve Mariucci, sucks. Deion Sanders, moron, Michael Irving moron, and that other guy, moron.</p><p>MCSHANE: Moron.</p><p>IMUS: Every one of them picked the Carolina Panthers. What happened? The New York Giants put a butt whipping on them.</p><p>WOLF: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: Thirty six-seven. Come on.</p><p>RUFINO: Pussy riot, come on!</p><p>IMUS: Start the pussy riot.</p><p>WOLF: That's right. Come on.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man! Eli got the ball, what did he do? He marched down the field and scored a touchdown. Every time he got the ball. Come on!</p><p>WOLF: Yes. And the reserves, man, those guys, the regulars better look over their shoulders. Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you and the ice cream cone on the forehead, Gunzelman --</p><p>RUFINO: Oh, wow!</p><p>WOLF: Oh, God!</p><p>IMUS: -- should have anticipated this.</p><p>(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p>I mean, this was an outrage.</p><p>WOLF: That's right.</p><p>RUFINO: Enjoy that ice cream.</p><p>IMUS: I will never listen to -- and you're right, Warner, about these pregame shows. These people don't know anything.</p><p>WOLF: No, waste of time.</p><p>IMUS: That's total waste of time.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>RUFINO: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Honeymoon is over.</p><p>MCSHANE: Welcome.</p><p>IMUS: All right. We're going to do the news now. Bernard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yo, chief.</p><p>IMUS: Or Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Any of you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Anybody.</p><p>IMUS: The Libyan attack on the embassy.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: The administration initially, the President and the Secretary of State characterized this as a direct result of this YouTube movie, right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Susan Rice all over the Sunday shows, she did a tour.</p><p>MCSHANE: U.N. ambassador. Yep.</p><p>IMUS: Now, is there any evidence -- and how are they describing it now, the administration?</p><p>MCGUIRK: That there is evidence that the guy who was released from Guantanamo Bay in 2007 was behind -- an al-Qaeda guy was behind the attack on the embassy in Libya.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: So, is the President willing to use the word terrorist and describe this as a terrorist attack?</p><p>MCSHANE: Not personally. Jay Carney used that word yesterday but the President did not when he was asked about it in the forum in Florida.</p><p>IMUS: Has he ever used the word terrorist?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Good question.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Now, so my question is this then, did they have evidence that -- did they know better that it was the result of the movie? Or of course, not so coincidently falling on September 11th. Did they not know that or did they lie about it or did they just assume -- you would think with our intelligence apparatus they would know better. But then, we've had other bunch of other screw ups. So what happened here? In other words, did they lie? Did they know? Did they not have the information? What?</p><p>MCGUIRK: They jumped to conclusions. If they didn't know, they should have said they didn't know instead of proclaiming definitively that it was a direct result of the movie.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: They should not have proclaimed that. They should have said let's wait and see. They didn't. Again, and they still harp on the movie as though -- and they're conflating two things. The movie, the terrorists used the movie perhaps as a cover to get the morons to come out and cause a riot so that they could use that as cover to go in. But in either case, they were misleading, was the administration. They obviously don't want it to look like -- they want to say GM is alive and bin Laden is dead, and that's it. They can't say that anymore. And that's why they're, you know.</p><p>IMUS: I know you can't see it, but do you like my new hat?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, that's bad. That's a bad as Johnny Cash.</p><p>MCSHANE: Look out now.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know who did this? Stuart Dunlap, Men's hat shop, Albuquerque.</p><p>MCSHANE: Nobody but him.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Did he?</p><p>IMUS: He did in San Antonio.</p><p>WOLF: That's the Rango Kidd hat.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man, that guy is -- come on. All right. Let's do the news.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p>IMUS: You're a disgrace, Warner. Don't you be yucking it up over there. This is unbelievable. The country singer Josh Turner is downstairs. That boy is pretty good. He's on FOX and Fiends.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p>IMUS: I guess people, there's an 80-plus demographic by records, right? Here's Connell with the news. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man. Protesters are actually in the streets today in Pakistan. They won't be able to use their cell phones. Though, the government there is blocking cell service, major cities, so the phones can't be used to detonate bombs. It's a national day of protest against that movie we were talking about, the anti-Muslim film produced here in the United States. The surge in Afghanistan meantime is over according to the Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta who says in his view it worked.</p><p>The 33,000 additional troops sent to Afghanistan a couple of years ago now pulled out of the country. The latest Gallup daily tracking poll has the race for the White House a dead heat. Forty seven percent a piece.</p><p>IMUS: I'll be darned.</p><p>MCSHANE: Mitt Romney and President Obama. But Romney is still hurting in some of these key swing states. \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC numbers, Obama is up eight points in Ohio. Leading by five both in Wisconsin and Colorado.</p><p>IMUS: You know, we are at a state in this country where this is the best we can do? A suit dummy and the president?</p><p>MCSHANE: That's the choice you have.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, I know a bunch of smart guys. So, do you? I mean, we all do.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right. You mean like business leaders and that type of thing and --</p><p>IMUS: Really smart people.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Can't get them to run.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, I was going to say, it's hard to get people to run. Absolutely.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know.</p><p>MCSHANE: Be vetted and everything else.</p><p>IMUS: Twelve minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Juan Williams, Vince Gill. Neil Cavuto. That's a pretty good lineup.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, it is. Connell continues.</p><p>IMUS: We got some comments from Ann Romney here in a second but first, the campaign has turned to comments not by either Romney but by the President saying yesterday, \"Washington cannot be changed from the inside.\" Big things, he says, get done when people pressure politicians from the outside. So, Romney was all over that saying that Obama's thrown in the white flag of surrender on the economy. Now, here's Ann Romney. She was on a radio show in Iowa asking Republicans to stop attacking her husband.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY: What do you say to your fellow Republicans? Sure. Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it, get in the ring. This is hard. It's an important thing that we're doing right now, and it's an important election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. Today, the President --</p><p>IMUS: Her husband is a moron. He'll do better than this guy. Having said all that -- I mean, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. Those of you who know me know I probably don't. But I'm going to vote for him. And I'm going to tell you that the day he gets elected, the economy is better. He doesn't have to do anything.</p><p>MCSHANE: You just think confidence is going to improve?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's one of the argument he made in that video that came out. Romney will be in Nevada today. Obama campaigning in Virginia. Some American airliners frequent fliers worried after hearing about the company's intentions to lay off thousands of workers and then reduce flights.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I'm pretty loyal to them. Because I do travel and get my miles with them. I have really not had too many problems.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Had a number of flights, so they've been canceled this week, American announcing more than 1,000 employees could lose their jobs. They're going through bankruptcy reorganization.</p><p>And Fast and Furious, lawmakers analyzing this new report that's come in on the botch, ATF gun walking operation, it's a report from the inspector general from the Justice Department. They found the Attorney General Eric Holder was not aware of the operation until it came out in the media and other places. Here's California republican Congressman Darrell Issa says the report the raises an important question.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: There is clearly a question not of did he know, because he said he didn't know. The question is why in the world did key lieutenants keep it from him and of course why is that something that we should --</p><p>(SCREAMING SHUT UP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Sounds like a car alarm going off. Did the guy invented those Bernie or Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Please step away from the car. That's his --</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Please step away from the car. Please step away from your mouth.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh my God!</p><p>IMUS: Sick of hearing about this.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Enough is enough.</p><p>IMUS: Come on.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well --</p><p>IMUS: Let's just get the problems of this country solved. Bernard McGuirk is going to be a guest on O'Reilly tonight at 8 p.m. on the <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>Channel. Bernard McGuirk and Greg Gutfeld in a segment called what the hell just happened or something.</p><p>MCSHANE: Something like that.</p><p>IMUS: And it's good and they're good. A quarter after the hour. Let's do some business news. Here with that is Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, sir. Yesterday, the Dow was up a paltry almost 19 points and the futures are higher this morning. And OK, all these ding-a-lings are lined up for the new iPhone 5. It goes on sale this morning at 8 a.m. Local Time in stores in nine countries. I'm sure it's going to have record sales. But here's what we care about even more than that, that Apple has fallen flat on its face with this new mapping software that it released. It's on this new phone. It's also in the new software, the IOS-6. It replaced Google maps, kicked Google maps off the phone, and it's a disaster. It sucks. That's how bad it is. Basically like businesses wind up in the middle of rivers.</p><p>IMUS: So, I told Dagen I used map quest. She said, that's so 90's.</p><p>MCSHANE: Map quest.</p><p>IMUS: I said, well, the place I'm going hasn't moved. They'll tell you how to get there. What the hell do I care?</p><p>MCDOWELL: You could do so much better than that. That's the issue. You could do so much better than that. It's like saying I've got like a Xerox typewriter, like, you know, IBM Selectric or something like that before I curse.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Like what? What's better?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. No, all this.</p><p>IMUS: What's the matter?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Google maps is better. Google maps is far and above better than map quest, and particularly this new Apple.</p><p>IMUS: Old weird Dave Patterson from Texas, he just updated my iPhone iOS 6 last night.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you lost your Google maps and if you want to look for the Hoover dam on the 3D imaging, on this Apple mapping software, it looks like a -- roller coaster. That's how lousy it is.</p><p>IMUS: I know where the Hoover dam is. Right outside of Las Vegas. Let's go look at it. Come on, dude.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can't do it on that Apple mapping --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, come on. Get a life.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Don't we love when some giant, the biggest company in the world screws up?</p><p>IMUS: First of all, all you ever care about is a bunch of red-neck goobers driving around in a circle and who knows where they're going to race this weekend, the NASCAR dopes. Where is the race?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, in New Hampshire actually.</p><p>IMUS: That's pretty good track, so. So, they don't need a map. I tell you what they do need.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: They need a clue. All right. Eighteen after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Have you done sports yet, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Don't wear me out but here's Warner with sports. Go ahead.</p><p>WOLF: All right, I-man. Thursday night football in Charlotte, now the Giants even with four offensive injuries beat the Panthers 36 to seven. Just like Gunzelman and myself called it. Backup running back Andre Brown playing for the injured Ahmad Bradshaw, 113 yards and 20 carries and two touchdowns.</p><p>And then reserved wide receiver Ramses Barden playing in place of a Hakeem Nicks caught nine passes for 138 yards. Eli 27 for 35, 288 yards, a touchdown, no interceptions. And Lawrence Tynes kicked five field goals.</p><p>IMUS: Wow!</p><p>WOLF: Now, here was Cam Newton who, by the way, I don't know if you saw this, after he scored a touchdown to make it cut it to 23 to seven, he went into his superman celebration. Pretty good timing for that. So, here was Newton only 16 for 30 intercepted three times and ran the ball six times for only six yards.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAM NEWTON, CAROLINA PANTHERS: Who wants to support something that puts on a performance of embarrassment. That's what that was tonight. If I was a fan of the Carolina Panthers, I would be holding my head down and ashamed of the product that was out there today.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Yes. He was awful.</p><p>IMUS: Stop your stupid end zone celebrations, OK?</p><p>WOLF: Yes. How about that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: What a dope.</p><p>RUFINO: You have been killed.</p><p>IMUS: You have been murdered.</p><p>RUFINO: Why do that?</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man!</p><p>WOLF: Yankees beat the Jays 10-seven, sweep the series. Ichiro by the way, a homerun and a double, he's not nine for his last 12.</p><p>IMUS: That guy is crazy.</p><p>WOLF: Oh, man!</p><p>IMUS: On fire?</p><p>WOLF: On fire. So, Yankees lead the Orioles by one with 13 to play.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>WOLF: And this is embarrassing, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>WOLF: At City Field, the Phillies scored eight in the first, seven in the ninth and beat the Mets 16 to one. Here was Met Manager Terry Collins was asked after the game --</p><p>RUFINO: There was nobody there.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's right.</p><p>WOLF: They were addressing these empty seats. Here was Mets manager Terry Collins asked after the game if he was embarrassed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TERRY COLLINS, METS MANAGER: I am.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Does his team quit?</p><p>COLLINS: You'll have to ask them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: What do you think?</p><p>COLLINS: You'll have to ask them. I have my own opinion. I'm not going to express it publicly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: That's horrible.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man. They got to get rid of him. All right. Twenty minutes after the hour. Do you have anything else, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: Well, real quick. Tiger Woods and Justin Rose share the lead of that FedEx cup playoff. Roy McElroy is three back.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Coming up on 21 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Juan Williams, Vince Gill, Neil Cavuto, Bill Clinton, and Tony Robbins are all coming up. Bernie's got a briefing too. What's there, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's a more fiery Obama versus Romney. Jimmy Fallon bust on the President. And Tim Tebow tells the world what kind of woman he wants.</p><p>IMUS: All right, baby. What kind of woman do you want? So, Dwight Yoakam's new album is called \"Three Pears.\" There's not a bad cut on it. It's the number-two country album on I-tunes. Dwight Yoakam, number two, come on here. It's a great record. Here's one of the better songs on it.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: Well, Lindamood-Bell teaches children and adults to read words and comprehend language.

McDonald's is hiking its quarterly payoff by ten percent, 77 cents a share. Texas Instruments is boosting its dividend by 24 percent to 21 cents a share.

You ought to take some aspirin. I mean, you do that, by the way.</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: What should the answer be?</p><p>IMUS: Nothing. It's just venting. It doesn't require an answer, doesn't require a suggestion.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: It doesn't require a comment. Shut up.</p><p>MCSHANE: Here's the problem.</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>MCSHANE: If we don't say anything, any of us, what happens, Tony?</p><p>TONY POWELL, COMEDIAN: Don't you bastards care I'm starving?</p><p>IMUS: No, that's not true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Twenty nine after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Here are as of today, the 2012 Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association world standings in tie-down roping. Justin Moss in first place $137,000. And Tuf Cooper, he's a current world champion, he's at 98,000. The great Cody O. Now that Joe doesn't rope anymore, he's my favorite roper.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Wyatt too. He's third at 96,000. And Hunter Herrin, Cory Solomon, Shane Hanchey, Clint Robinson, Houston Hutko , the great Fred Whitfield, African-American -- one of the great ropers ever, eight-time world champion. And on and on. Blare Burke, 15th place. So, that's where we are.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p>IMUS: If we were going to go to -- Vegas and have it today, those are the 15 guys who would be roping.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Time for a Bernie briefing at 29 after the hour. And here with that is Bernard McGuirk, good morning, B.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, chief. And President Obama sat down with this Univision people yesterday, the Spanish language TV station, and if he thought he was going to get questions like what's your favorite salsa music, or do you like J-Lo or stuff like that, he was in for a big surprise.</p><p>IMUS: Oh-oh.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The dude hit him hard, this Jorge Ramos. He was like the Spanish inquisition.</p><p>IMUS: He's a good reporter.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Very good reporter.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, he is.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, it was like the Spanish inquisition. For a little while, anyway, he asked him about changing things in government. And he gave a bad answer. And then Mitt Romney jumped on it, as Connell alluded to earlier. Here's Obama first and then Mitt Romney right afterwards.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: I've learned some lessons over the last four years. And the most important lesson I've learned is that you can't change Washington from the inside. You can only change it from the outside. That's how I got elected. And that's how the big accomplishments like health care got done.</p><p>FMR. GOV. MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The President today threw in the white flag of surrender again. He said he can't change Washington from inside. He can only change it from outside. Well, we're going to give him that chance in November. He's going outside.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: About as animated and funny as Mitt Romney will get, but it wasn't that bad. And the New York Giants, of course on a tear. Right, boss?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Who cares? Tim Tebow, he's on the cover of \"Vogue\" magazine, he's on the cover of \"The New York Post\" this morning.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Putting his physique on display there. And I'm sure that's going to rile up all the Giants this morning.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But of course, he's a devout Christian and he tells --</p><p>IMUS: Praise God.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, exactly right. He tells \"Vogue\" magazine what he looks for in a woman. And here's his quote. I've been blessed to have an amazing mom and two amazing sisters, so they set a very high standard. I'll stop right there. What I think of -- when I think of a woman, I don't think of my mom and -- God bless them. God rest them, I should say. But anyway, he goes on and that's what makes him a good guy apparently, obviously.</p><p>Obviously looks play a big part. Looks play a big part. Being attracted to someone plays a big part but there is also much more than that. To me, it is about finding someone who is sweet and kind and that has a servant's heart. It's about finding a girl who likes me for me. And not because of what I do or who I am or the name.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, tasty rat covering that servant's heart.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yep. He did add that she's got to have a booty that's high and tight.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>If it ain't tight, it ain't right.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Bu so, you know, the boy's got some feeling.</p><p>IMUS: There has got to be --</p><p>RUFINO: Can see him saying that.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, somebody else to talk about.</p><p>RUFINO: He's got to have a booty.</p><p>IMUS: He seems like a nice guy.</p><p>MCGUIRK: People can't get enough of -- the front page of \"The New York Post.\"</p><p>IMUS: OK. I like him --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Don't be a hater now, chief.</p><p>IMUS: I'm not a hater at all, quite the contrary.</p><p>MCGUIRK: All right. Well, I can conclude on that because Juan Williams is in the bull pen.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Don't you have something else?</p><p>MCGUIRK: I do.

Now that Apple's iPhone 5 is available, we're finding out what exactly makes the smart phone work. The repair firm I-fix got its hands on one and pried it open to find the device uses chips from Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solutions. The iPhone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus, Logic and its Gyroscope which is used to track its orientation was made by STmicroelectronics. So, keep an eye on stocks of those companies and those who didn't make the iPhone 5 to see their reaction today.</p><p>Shares of Oracle were up slightly in extended trading after first quarter results revealed while the company's traditional software business improved, hardware system sales continue to be a problem.

We've got low pressure still rotating up around the Great Lakes but it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwestern states, the Northern Plains States all the way down to the Central Mississippi valley area. And then back up towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east. Also a few showers are popping up down around Florida.</p><p>Again, southeast slightly risky in terms of showers and storms. Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms, high temp today, 88 degrees. Phoenix, no rain for you. Sunny skies with a high of 103. Seattle partly cloudy skies with a high of 63. Sacramento, California, we've got some sunny skies there today with a high of 91, still warm. I'm Mike Woods from FOX 5 in New York.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Twenty one until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I lost my phone and I can't call it because I keep it on --</p><p>MCSHANE: Vibrate or whatever.</p><p>IMUS: Whatever.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p>IMUS: I have no idea where it is. I thought I gave it to Carley, but it could be anywhere.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program --</p><p>RUFINO: I'm still getting him.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you're still getting him.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes -- that little phony shoe thing.</p><p>IMUS: Vince Gill is coming up this morning, talk to him about some stuff, the state of country music and the state of Vince Gill.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's it.</p><p>IMUS: And then Neil Cavuto, he's going to be in. We'll talk to him about the state of the country, the economy and all that.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, there's big Romney interview.</p><p>IMUS: Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>contributor Juan Williams. Good morning, Mr. Williams.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CONTRIBUTOR (on the phone): Good morning, Mr. Imus. I was worried for a second you forgot about me. You didn't know my name? What is this? What's going on over there?</p><p>IMUS: I'm thinking about two or three different things.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, what? You're thinking about beautiful women or something. I guess that's on your mind all the time.</p><p>IMUS: Trying to find my phone.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: (LAUGHING)</p><p>IMUS: You know what I'm reading, which is terrific is O'Reilly's \"Killing Kennedy.\"</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Did you read \"Killing Lincoln\"?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I did.</p><p>IMUS: And?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I liked it. You know, he gave me a copy early on, and I gave one to my son because I liked it so much. And I told him, you know, he can be reluctant even to accept praise, but yes, I thought it was pretty good.</p><p>IMUS: All right. I wasn't a big fan of that. I didn't read it all because \"Killing Kennedy,\" you know, I was talking about it -- do you mind talking about this or no?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No. Why would I mind talking about it?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't know. The difference is between, say, Walter Isaacson, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Doug Brinkley, and those people. They tell you about, you know, in the story they tell you about the Cuban missile crisis. So, they write about Khrushchev, O'Reilly does. And he describes him as 5'3,\" about 200 pounds, got a big old mole, gap in his teeth, murdering little bastard. But if it is Doris and all those other people, you've got 43 pages about where he grew up, his sister, his brother, his parent, I mean, stuff that maybe I want to know. But here's -- do you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin of Jack Kennedy?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think he was the lone assassin if you're asking who pulled the trigger, yes, I do. If you're asking were there other people involved who may have been backing Oswald, funding Oswald, you know, did Jack Ruby have any role to play there, I'm very suspicious of that.</p><p>IMUS: Well, here's what they're trying to do in the book which doesn't annoy me, but is they're trying to set Oswald up -- he describes on page 15, does O'Reilly, Oswald as a crack shot. Well, I was in the Marine Corps at the same time Oswald was.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: I was in from '57 to '59 on a two-year reserve program. Two years active duty and then reserve. He was in from '56 to '59. So, I qualified for the rifle -- in the same program as he did. And I barely qualified as a marksman. Then, there are three categories, marksman, sharpshooter and expert. So, O'Reilly describes Oswald as a sharpshooter. But in May of 1956, he qualified, did Oswald, barely two points into being designated a sharpshooter. In other words, two fewer points and he would have been a marksman, the lowest category. And then -- pardon me?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Hang on. Hang on. But wait a minute. The idea is he was a trained shooter, Imus.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I mean, so, OK, you can get into your gradations of how skilled he was. But I think Bill's point was this guy didn't just pick up a gun and he was, you know, some schlock who was trying out. I mean, he had been trained in how to fire and he had been qualified, I think that makes some compared to me for example who's never fired a gun.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK.</p><p>IMUS: OK. But don't sell him to me as a crack shot, which he was not. Because when he tried to assassinate General Walker, he missed him. He was 40 feet from him.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I love your point.</p><p>IMUS: And then he qualified again in 1959 just before he got out. And he qualified barely with a score of 191 as a marksman, the lowest designation. Two fewer points and he would not have qualified. So my only point is yes, he could shoot a rifle better than some bozo on the street. But don't try to sell him to me as being this expert crack shot, because he wasn't. So, that's it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right. You may know too much on this count. But anyway, your point is well taken. Especially -- but I think that the larger point is to the reader that this is a guy who was trained in how to shoot.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And as you point out, not only qualified once but qualified twice is the other way to interpret the exact same events that you just said make you doubt, you know, how good -- he was.</p><p>IMUS: Only an idiot like me would get bogged down in the minutia of that. All right. About the president, about Romney. Let me see if you're guy --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Do you really want to talk about that? Doesn't sound like it?</p><p>IMUS: Well, talk about what?</p><p>WILLIAMS: American presidential politics.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, I don't mind.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I know Romney is not doing so well and I figured you're going to be depressed and upset about it.</p><p>IMUS: I don't care. My job is to monitor the freak parade. And he's in it. Anyway, now has the President and the Secretary of State and the national security advisor and these other people, Susan Rice and the rest of them, have they decided now what the attack in Libya was? They first tried to sell it that it was the result of this YouTube movie, which every fool on the planet knew that wasn't the case, particularly falling on September 11. And now when the president is reluctant to use the word \"terrorist,\" I don't know if I've ever heard him utter that word, now they're acknowledging that it was a terrorist attack. So my question for you is, were they initially lying, one? Or did they not know, two? Or, three, were they just assuming or guessing? Or, four, were they waiting until they got more information and thought they would throw up a smoke screen to try to hoodwink us?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think that there was a strong sense that this was terrorism. But again, you know, they don't have a sense of Libya and I think the intelligence background necessary to lay things out. But if you're asking about whether or not they were reluctant to call terrorism what it is, I don't think there is any question. This has been a problem throughout the administration. You know, they talk about manmade disasters instead of terrorism.</p><p>I mean, but that has to do with a mind-set that, you know, again, caution about attacking people, especially Muslims and reluctance to embrace the idea that it's terrorism because somehow that would take us back to the Bush years of the war on terror and they don't want to do that. But that has been the mind-set with this folks from the start, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Who's the National Security advisor?</p><p>WILLIAMS: At the moment.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no. In October of 1922. Yes, at the moment, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: You know, it's Keith Alexander. Isn't that right, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: That is correct.</p><p>IMUS: OK. So, neither Bernie nor I had any idea who it was.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right. Well, I couldn't call the name. You got me.</p><p>IMUS: Well, wouldn't you think we could do better than that dope empty suit Romney or your guy?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You mean as Americans?</p><p>IMUS: Somebody to run this country?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. That's what I meant, as Americans. Well, you know, what? We've got political structure. And, you know, this is who's been nominated. And gosh, you know, if you look on the republican side, they went through a lot of people to get here, and this was the decision made. Well, I tell you, you know, yesterday's comment by Ann Romney, you know, stop questioning my husband. Stop the doubts. If you think you can do better, get in the ring, I thought some level of frustration over on that side.</p><p>IMUS: Are you a Christian?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I am.</p><p>IMUS: Are you ready to deal with Jesus maybe having a wife?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, I never had any trouble with it. In fact, you know, there's all these questions about whether or not, in the last supper, that drawing, you know, if that is a woman next to him. It seems to me inevitable. I mean, all the talk about not just Mary Magdalene, but I mean, you know, people that were described as prostitutes and outcasts and the like, I think he was, you know, fully human. Let me just say that, in human form. And I just think that part of being human is your sexuality.</p><p>IMUS: I got punked by Jesus the other day.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Now this is interesting. What happened to you?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I tore my rotator cuff and then suddenly it stopped hurting. And I thought thank you, God! Jesus! And then it started hurting again.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh no.</p><p>IMUS: So I got punked by Jesus.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, you know, you think you had some good times there for a minute. I mean, thank God you got some relief.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Well, now I'm OK, so.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, well, I'm glad to hear that.</p><p>IMUS: Behave yourself, Mr. Williams. I always love having you on.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I appreciate it. I appreciate it. And I'm going to just burn Tom Donilon's name into my head again. You know what I mean, I don't know why I forgot that name.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He is the national security advisor to the President. The director of the agency is the guy named General Keith Alexander.</p><p>MCSHANE: The NSA, right.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Thanks, you guys.

Apple fans around the world are lining up to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves today, including here in New York City where our own Robert Gray is standing by at Apple's Fifth Avenue store. Robert, describe the scene for us.</p><p>ROBERT GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well Diane, you've got several hundred people lined up outside of the Apple store, normally they're open 24 hours a day seven days a week. They closed it last night just for the event, opens at 8:00 a.m.</p><p>And Jared here is kind enough to join us and tell us why you've been in line here all night long here just waiting to get in to buy the iPhone instead of going this afternoon.</p><p>JARED, APPLE CUSTOMER: I mean, it's about being here for the opening. You know it's about -- I made a couple friends in line. It's about being like the best Apple store in the country, you know.</p><p>It's a fun experience. It's a fun event. Everybody is having a good time. The line is starting to move so we're starting to get kind of excited.</p><p>GRAY: Yes you've got about an hour to go now. You've got your Willie Wonka golden ticket here. Are you pretty happy about that? And also you have to wait until 8 a.m. Local time. You just moved here from Tucson. Are you already ribbing your friends back home that you're going to have yours first?</p><p>JARED: Yes I did. I posted it on Facebook I've been kind of poking at them. I have a few friends that are like really Apple fanatics. And it's kind of a -- its kind of a fun jest. So I'm getting them back you know.</p><p>GRAY: Is there any one particular thing about the iPhone 5 that is drawing you to it aside from the fact that it's just the newest, the latest and greatest?</p><p>JARED: I really like what they've done from the body. The aluminum - - the aluminum body looks really sleek, it's going to be really nice. And the wider screen is -- you can't go wrong.</p><p>GRAY: And what about the connector? We've heard a lot of flap about this the new connector. You're going to have to get all new devices and you know the peripherals to go with it, like alarm clock, et cetera. Is that a problem for you?</p><p>JARED: It's not a problem. I mean, you know people try to jab where they can jab. But it's going to be great. I mean, iPhone, the connector has always been proprietary. It just they're better, they're making it better. They're improving. When technology moves, you've got to move with it. And that's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GRAY: All right.</p><p>JARED: -- that's what you do.</p><p>GRAY: All right, Jared we've got to move too. Diane so yes we'll be following all day for you there. The line is starting to move. Several hundred of folks as I mentioned lined up out here to pay anywhere from $200 up for the new iPhone.

James the Greek government officials are holding another round of negotiations with creditors in hopes of agreeing to almost 12 billion euros worth of cutbacks. How do you expect this to play out?</p><p>JAMES HUGHES, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, ALPARI: I mean, I think we expect it to play out the same way that we've seen it's done in the past. I mean there's been a lot of negativity around what (inaudible). Greece trying to renegotiate these plans and the issue we've had is that they -- that they have an initial plan, initial measures we're put in place that Greece had to -- had to hit but the goal post has been moved so many times now. There always seems to be another renegotiation of -- of austerity or cuts.</p><p>And I mean we're hopeful of course that Greece is going to agree to something. And -- but I think whether they agree or not is not the key point. It's whether they stick to it which is the key point. And that's been an issue for this for a long time now.</p><p>MACEDO: All right that's James Hughes from Alpari in London. Thanks so much James.</p><p>HUGHES: All right.</p><p>MACEDO: Universal Music Group has won approval from EU antitrust regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion after the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record labels.

Good morning, Mr. Gray.</p><p>GRAY: Hey, I-Man. Good morning.</p><p>IMUS: Where are you?</p><p>GRAY: I'm out in front of the Apple store on Fifth Avenue, and 59th Street, it's normally a 24/7 store here I-Man. You may have gone in the middle of the night but they actually closed it.</p><p>IMUS: Oh they did?</p><p>GRAY: So that they could create. Yes they wanted to manufacture a line. And as you know from back in the day, no one manufactures lines like they do here in New York.</p><p>IMUS: Yes I've actually been in that store a couple of times.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>BARTLETT: Really.</p><p>RUFINO: I'll be darned.</p><p>MCSHANE: Robert.</p><p>RUFINO: Say it, Robert. I'll be darned.</p><p>IMUS: Do you have something to report, Robert?</p><p>GRAY: Absolutely.</p><p>Yes, we're out here. Look, there are several hundred people lined up waiting for this new iPhone 5 to go on sale. It's coming out 8 a.m. folks will be rolling in. And they could sell as many as -- as many as 10 million of these by the end of this month alone.</p><p>IMUS: Ok we'll it's a very fine report. Thank you for that important information, Robert.</p><p>RUFINO: What a loser parade.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Those idiots have been camped out there for five nights --</p><p>GRAY: Some of these guys have been out here all week.</p><p>MCSHANE: Morons.</p><p>IMUS: Big Foot.</p><p>TOM BOWMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Yes sir.</p><p>IMUS: Have you lost your mind?</p><p>BOWMAN: What are you kidding? This is a great story today.</p><p>IMUS: But --</p><p>BOWMAN: And you personalized it as always.</p><p>IMUS: Do we have a unique situation here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program?</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: We have wall-wall-commercials which is how we keep doing this, which I'm happy that we do have.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: So we don't have an inordinate amount of time for Warner to go on and on about Yogi Berra or somebody or Miller Huggins or -- and you know I like Robert Gray. But you go to Robert Gray with no information. Well, I'm standing outside the store. Here we've got a few hundred people. Ok good, great.</p><p>MCSHANE: Robert Gray all the way.</p><p>RUFINO: Miller Huggins is waiting --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: I like Robert Gray. He is a terrific reporter. He's got a nice sense of humor. But he gave us zero information. We know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGUIRK: That isn't fair.</p><p>MCSHANE: Come on he talked about how many iPhones might be sold and that kind of thing.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes why -- why would these idiots camp out and not wait five, ten days and buy it in the store days later on?</p><p>IMUS: Who knows?</p><p>MCSHANE: Exactly.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well maybe he knows.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know why they do it Robert?</p><p>GRAY: Yes I do we've talked to several of these folks I-Man and some of these guys are big tech fans. And they wanted to be a part of the experience here and the first to have it. We just talked to a guy from Tucson. He wants to have it before his buddies. He's posting it on Facebook. He's going to have the newest, latest and greatest.</p><p>MCSHANE: There you go.</p><p>GRAY: And these guys like to have the faster processor, bigger screen. Some of the other phones have already had that for six to nine months so the iPhone is playing catch-up here.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right, there you go.</p><p>IMUS: Robert Gray, the Fox Business Network. Live outside the 59th and Fifth at the Apple store.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Good report dude.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well done Robert.</p><p>IMUS: 12 minutes after the hour. Please stop calling people dude, Imus. It's 12 after the hour. Let's do a little new, more news. And here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, good morning I-Man. Well, the campaign moves to Nevada today where Mitt Romney will be campaigning, in Virginia where President Obama will be holding a rally.</p><p>IMUS: You shut up.</p><p>MCSHANE: Here are some numbers that are in, Obama leads the \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC News swing state poll. He's up eight in Iowa, five in Wisconsin and Colorado. The Gallup Daily tracking poll though, dead heat, 47 percent a piece around the country for Mitt Romney and President Obama.</p><p>There are protests today taking place in Pakistan. In fact they've -- they've named it a national day of protests there over this anti-Muslim movie that was produced here in the United States. And the government in Pakistan actually disabling cell phone service, some of their major cities are trying to prevent phones from being used in detonating bombs.</p><p>And then in Syria, President Bashar Assad talking tough, an Egyptian magazine reporting that Assad predicts the defeat of the armed opposition that foreign intervention like the one in Libya will not be repeated there, he said. This, as at least 30 are reported dead in the northern part of the country. Government airstrikes reportedly hit a gas station and caused a huge explosion in Syria.</p><p>Then the surge is over in Afghanistan. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says the 33,000 additional troops that were sent a couple of years ago to Afghanistan have now pulled out of the country. He calls it a very important milestone, says the surge accomplished its goals in Afghanistan.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Really.</p><p>MCSHANE: And one other thing for you, I-Man. The Emmys this Sunday but Kelsey Grammar not a nominee. Critics and fans of Grammar's stars show \"Boss\" have agreed that he was snubbed when these Emmy nominations were announced. He recently suggested that his conservative political leanings were the reason.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>KELSEY GRAMMER, ACTOR: I did speculate about the fact that maybe I'm a pretty well outed conservative in Hollywood and maybe there's some energy there. But you know I've since come to think that it hasn't gotten out there enough. I don't know.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: There you go. Well, Kelsey Grammer thinks he was snubbed there I-Man for the Emmys. And those are your --</p><p>MCGUIRK: No justice, no peace.</p><p>MCSHANE: -- exactly, right, your headlines this morning.</p><p>IMUS: All right, hey, Big Foot, load up Tony Robbins and Lady Gaga, ok?</p><p>BOWMAN: Yes sir.</p><p>IMUS: Let's do a business report now at 14 after the hour. And here with that, just ahead of Vince Gill and Bernie with a briefing and Warner with sports is Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p>Did you know that the new iPhone 5 goes on sale this morning at 8 a.m.? Maybe we could take a live look at the Apple store here in midtown Manhattan for the lines of people.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Don't be mean.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All those -- you know why those doofuses line up? Because they've got no woman at home and they've got to be one of the first of their friends to get the new iPhone 5.</p><p>IMUS: They either don't have a woman at home or they've got a woman at home like you.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Or the only woman at home is their mom.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, the I-Man.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what; no truer thing has ever been said.</p><p>RUFINO: I'll wait on this line for four days to get away from her.</p><p>IMUS: Let's go here.</p><p>RUFINO: Is that Jonas?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, it's going to set records.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Ok. That big race in New Hampshire, Nascar this weekend? All right, second race with the chase or whatever</p><p>MCDOWELL: I do have something though. The iPhone sells like it does because Blackberry stinks to high heaven. And Blackberry service is actually out today in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. So there is justice in this world.</p><p>IMUS: All right. A quarter after the hour. Let's do some sports. No, first let's go to Tony Robbins who has some thoughts about Lady Gaga. Good morning, Mr. Robbins.</p><p>POWELL: Good morning, Imus. Lady Gaga is having a physical crisis. She recently put on a couple of pounds. Who am I kidding? I saw her in concert with that big hat and those big glasses. I thought she was Cee Lo Green. She's gone from doing well-choreographed routines to the electric slide. Apparently it's not as taxing.</p><p>Gaga claims that she gained weight eating delicious food at her father's Italian restaurant in Manhattan. That's a relief. I'm glad she wasn't eating her dresses. A bacon muumuu has got to be like what -- 50,000 calories. Eating her clothes would certainly qualify as an unhealthy relationship with food.</p><p>Gaga lives, breathes, sleeps and eats music. She's passionate about music and obviously. I told her to combine her loves. She took my advice and started writing her sheet music on sheet cakes. Share your music with the world but share your cakes with friends. That's the out of the box statement that's made her a superstar.</p><p>Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible. Lady Gaga's goals to go from being an unknown artist to being well, the biggest thing in music. I'd say we've got that covered.</p><p>IMUS: Tony Robbins here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>All right. Let's do sports at 16 minutes after the hour. Just ahead of Vince Gill later on this morning and Neil Cavuto.</p><p>Sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Here with sports, best sportscaster in the country, Warner Wolf. Good morning Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Thank you very much. Good morning I-Man. Thursday night football in Charlotte. The Giants beat the Panthers, 36-7. It was the story of the backups. Running back Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw -- 113 yards, 20 carries, 2 touchdowns; and wide receiver Ramses Barden playing in place of Hakeem Nicks, 9 receptions for 138 yards. Eli, 288 yards, 1 touchdown, no interceptions; Lawrence Tynes kicks 5 field goals.</p><p>Cam Newton trailing 23-0 in the third quarter and obviously thinking a touchdown was worth 23 points, scored on a 1-yard touchdown and then went into his superman celebration. Come on, Cam.</p><p>Baseball: Yankees beat the Jays --</p><p>IMUS: I tell Wyatt that all the time. You put up an 8 in roping, don't throw your hat.</p><p>WOLF: Right.</p><p>IMUS: Act like you've been there before.</p><p>WOLF: That's right. That's what Tom Landry said, right.</p><p>RUFINO: What an idiot.</p><p>IMUS: What a dope.</p><p>RUFINO: Oh God.</p><p>WOLF: Yanks sweep the Jays. Ichiro, a home run, a double, he's 9 for his last 12.</p><p>IMUS: That guy is great.</p><p>WOLF: Oh man. He's on fire.</p><p>IMUS: And apparently New York is -- well, come on dude.</p><p>WOLF: Well, they lead by one. Both have 13 to play.</p><p>And before a bogus announced crowd of 20,000 at City Field, the Phillies scored 8 in the first, 9 -- 7 in the 9th and beat the Mets 16-1. The Mets are only 4 in 25 at home since the all-star break.</p><p>IMUS: Wow.</p><p>WOLF: Boise state beat BYU, 7-6. BYU scored a touchdown, three and a half minutes left, went for the 2-point conversion and missed.</p><p>Wait a minute. Stop the music.</p><p>IMUS: All right.</p><p>WOLF: Finally there may be a long-awaited Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao fight.</p><p>IMUS: Wow.</p><p>WOLF: Pacquiao who, by the way, has to fight Juan Manuel Marquez for the fourth time --</p><p>IMUS: Yes, fourth time.</p><p>WOLF: -- has agreed, number one, to give Mayweather --</p><p>IMUS: Want to have more time -- they're ruining marriages .</p><p>WOLF: He's agreed to give Mayweather a 55-45 split, Mayweather getting the 55 rather than the 50-50.</p><p>Number two, Pacquiao says he will agree to Mayweather's demand that he take the Olympic-style drug test which includes the blood test.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Yes, sure.</p><p>WOLF: The only drawback is when the fight occurs Mayweather will be 36 and Pacquiao 34.</p><p>In golf, you have the top 30 golfers in the world at that FedEx Cup playoff. Tiger Woods and Justin Rose share the lead, 4 under 66.</p><p>And finally, I-Man, our old friend Jerry Jones agrees with Buccaneers coach Greg Schiano that it's ok for a team to go for the ball when the other team is kneeling down to run out the clock. Jones says the kneel- down is a wasted play, should be outlawed. And if a team doesn't run a play, they should be penalized.</p><p>IMUS: We're trying to win. When we're out there on the field, out there -- we're trying to win. And we're the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>We didn't win in Seattle, and that sucked. So I went to the (inaudible) bar. What are you going to do?</p><p>It's 20 minutes after the hour. Thank you very much, Warner. There's a briefing coming up. What's there, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: President Obama grilled by this Spanish language TV station host.</p><p>And another secret Paris Hilton tape revealed. We have the tape.</p><p>IMUS: One of the great songs Vince Gill ever wrote or recorded. It was a huge hit for the boy. It was a huge hit -- \"Pocket Full of Gold\", about a guy, he's married and goes in the bar somewhere and he takes that ring off his finger.</p><p>I do that when I go to the titty bar. I have a pocket full of gold.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo.</p><p>And General Motors is recalling more than 426,000 ChevroletPontiac and Saturn sedans in the U.S. due to a transmission problem. The recall affects vehicles from model years 2007 to 2010. The auto maker says the transmission gear position may not match the gear on the shift gear and that causes vehicles to move when drivers think they're in park. GM says it's aware of four crashes due to the problem, but no injuries reported so far.</p><p>Here's a look at futures now, we are seeing them up across the board; Dow futures up by 38, the S&amp;P is up by 3 and the Nasdaq is up about 6. Commodities are also to the upside.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Jesus had a ball and chain. Jesus had a ball and chain. You know, they found this.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: This historian of early Christianity up there at Harvard Divinity School, the girl found a scrap of march weed or whatever the hell it was papyrus -- is that what we call it?</p><p>MCSHANE: yes.</p><p>IMUS: Written in the fourth century containing the phrase that we've never seen in any piece of scripture and it's Jesus, and he said unto them, \"My wife\".</p><p>MCSHANE: Whoa.</p><p>IMUS: What up, girl?</p><p>MCSHANE: Wow.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, so that that. And man -- what's that, godfather?</p><p>BARTLETT: I need the Christ to come on over for coffee tonight.</p><p>POWELL: I wonder whose name she called out when they were making love.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, no.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: All right. 28 after the hour; we'll talk to Vince Gill in a couple of minutes.</p><p>First, this Bernie Briefing is sponsored by Ramsey Fiat, Route 17, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Go to RamseyFiat.com. Here's Bernard McGuirk. What up, B.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, President Obama, boss, candidate Barack Obama back in 2008 promised in no uncertain terms that he would pass a comprehensive immigration reform. He had a Democratic Congress for two years. In any case he's on Univision yesterday and host, Jorge Ramos, again, the Spanish inquisition. He hammered the President on this and listen to the President's answer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JORGE RAMOS, HOST, UNIVISION: A promise is a promise. And with all due respect you didn't keep that promise.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Here is what I would say Jorge, is that we've had this conversation before. There's a thinking that the President is somebody who is all powerful and can get everything done. In our branch-- in our system of government, I am the head of the executive branch. I'm not the head of the legislature. I'm not the head of the judiciary. We have to have cooperation from all these sources in order to get something done. And so, I am happy to take responsibility for the fact that we didn't get it done, but I didn't make a promise that I would get everything done 100 percent when I was elected as president.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Of course not.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, we can. No, we can't.</p><p>IMUS: Come on here.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Anyway, there's another secret tape scandal out here boss. This time -- first it was Mitt Romney. Now it's your girl, Paris Hilton.</p><p>IMUS: My girl?</p><p>MCGUIRK: everybody's girl, come on.</p><p>IMUS: Ok.</p><p>MCGUIRK: You know you love that tape, the first one she was in. Now, she was in a taxi back during fashion week here in Manhattan and this cab driver actually taped her and her gay friend -- the gay friend was telling her about a guy he know who has AIDS and has unprotected sex, this, that and the other. And she said some stuff that's getting her into a little bit of trouble. Take a listen to it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): You know if you want to (EXPLETIVE DELETED) and you might be able to like just stick you (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>PARIS HILTON (voice-over): Eww.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>HILTON: Eww. You guys are the horniest people in the world.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>HILTON: Eww. They're disgustingly (INAUDIBLE) (EXPLETIVE DELETED).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like, listen, my (EXPLETIVE DELETED).</p><p>HILTON: Eww. (INAUDIBLE) AIDS.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>HILTON: I would be so scared about (INAUDIBLE). You know like (INAUDIBLE). Eww.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: OK. What is she saying, Berne?</p><p>MCGUIRK: She said gay guys are the horniest people in the world. They're disgusting. Dude, most of them probably have AIDS.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: She said in the taxi that --</p><p>IMUS: That's not good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Some dude was, you know, Mohammad there was rolling on while she had the conversation.</p><p>IMUS: Just don't be hating on everybody, baby. All right.</p><p>Anything else, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, I'm done.</p><p>IMUS: It's 30 minutes past the hour.</p><p>I was talking to Kinky Friedman yesterday. Kinky refuses to use a computer. Won't text. Won't e-mail. So there's no way to stay in touch with him. I mean, you can call him. But we were talking about Dwight Yoakam's new record. So, I said, have you heard \"Waterfall\"? And Kinky said, I love it to death. It's just -- all right.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network. And now here's Diane Macedo.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>KB Home is reporting a surprise profit after two quarters of losses as home prices recovered. The fifth largest home builder says it made 4 cents a share in its third quarter. The company was expected to lose 16 cents a share, but revenue came in a little light at $424.5 million. The estimate was for $430 million. KB Home says potential future housing revenue rose to a four year high and home deliveries climbed 7 percent from last year to more than 1,700. Shares are higher in the pre-market.</p><p>More companies, meanwhile, are rewarding their shareholders with higher quarterly dividends. McDonald's is hiking its quarterly payout by 10 percent to 77 cents a share. Texas Instruments is boosting its dividend by 24 percent to 21 cents a share. And Covidien is increasing its quarterly dividend by 16 percent to 26 cents a share.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right after we check the weather now with Fox 5 meteorologist Mike Woods.</p><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>Looks like we have some wet weather out there, but not a ton of it for the country here. We've got an area of low pressure still rotating up around the Great Lakes but it's bringing showers from the upper Midwestern states, the northern plains states, all the way down into the central Mississippi Valley area and then back up toward the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east.</p><p>Also a few showers are popping up down around Florida. Again, the southeast slightly risky in terms of showers and storms. Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms. High temp today 88 degrees. Phoenix, no rain for you. Sunny skies with the high of 103. Seattle, partly cloudy skies with a high of 63. Sacramento, California, you've got sunny skies there today with a high of 91. Still warm.</p><p>I'm Mike Woods from Fox 5 in New York.</p><p>IMUS: It's 22 minutes till the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Please welcome to the program, I don't want to embarrass him, but one of the great country singers of all time, songwriters, Vince Gill.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Gill.</p><p>GILL: How you doing, Donny?</p><p>IMUS: I'm fine. How are you?</p><p>GILL: I'm good. Good to see you.</p><p>IMUS: Fine. Fine. Nice to see you. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>GILL: You bet.</p><p>IMUS: So I was talking this morning, not to patronize you, which I wouldn't do, I said there's a few people who sing who I'd have come in just to talk. You're one of them.</p><p>GILL: Well, thanks.</p><p>IMUS: Do you like Dwight Yoakam?</p><p>GILL: I do. I always have. He's a good guy.</p><p>IMUS: A smart guy, too.</p><p>GILL: Yes. Smart as a whip.</p><p>IMUS: Crazy. Crazy.</p><p>GILL: He's a little bit crazy, but most talented people are just one tick shy of nuts.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, but good crazy.</p><p>GILL: It's a good crazy.</p><p>IMUS: Kinky Friedman, Delbert McClinton.</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And -- but like Montgomery Gentry, I love them, but -- man, they can't put two words together.</p><p>GILL: I wouldn't know.</p><p>IMUS: You know what I've learned --</p><p>GILL: It's a political year. No comment.</p><p>IMUS: Well, here's the -- I'm the worst kind of country disc jockey. Really that's what I am at heart.</p><p>GILL: Well, you're one of the last people on earth that love music.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: That's why I love coming seeing you. You know, when I got a new record or something's exciting going on, because I know you'll get it and I know you'll, you know, you'll enjoy it.</p><p>IMUS: I just got Dwight's new -- do you care if we talk about other artists?</p><p>GILL: No, I don't.</p><p>IMUS: I just got his new record. It is fabulous.</p><p>GILL: Yes, I've heard. I haven't heard it yet, but I've heard people raving about it. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>IMUS: Got a song called \"Waterfall\" that's --</p><p>GILL: I heard a little bit of that.</p><p>IMUS: That's clever, isn't it?</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So -- and -- because Dwight, he's a man who, when he went out with Sharon Stone, you know, she described him as a dirt sandwich.</p><p>GILL: About as much fun as a dirt sandwich.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, have you ever heard of the Christian rock group Striker.</p><p>GILL: Yes, I have.</p><p>IMUS: OK. This is a tedious story. Maybe it's not tedious. But when my brother, God bless him, and -- was working with the railroad as a breakman, his partner was Phil Sweet.</p><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: And Fred and Phil wrote a song called \"I Don't Want To Have To Marry You\" when they were working for the railroad.</p><p>GILL: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And they eventually got it cut. And it went to number one and all that stuff. And Phil married a woman named Janice. And he's a great guy. They live in Las Vegas. And they had two sons, Michael and Robert, and they are Striker.</p><p>GILL: Oh, I didn't know that.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: That's neat.</p><p>IMUS: And Christian rock, they are.</p><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: And then Michael spent the last -- the past two summers going out singing lead for Boston. It's a small world, isn't it?</p><p>GILL: Yes, it is. You know, ever since I married Amy, everybody thinks I know everything about Christian music, but I don't. I wish I did.</p><p>IMUS: Well, Amy Grant won a -- won the -- everybody in the country had a crush on her when she was --</p><p>GILL: Oh, yes.</p><p>IMUS: I remember all -- I remember all these disc jockeys over at NBC years ago. I met Frank Reed -- I don't know if you remember his name or not -- he used to tell me -- he said, have you heard Amy Grant? And I said, no. He said, oh, man, come on here.</p><p>So, what's new with you?</p><p>GILL: Not much. After I married Amy, I used to have to fight my way out of the bars. Now I have to fight my way out of the churches being married to her.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, you built a studio at home.</p><p>GILL: I did. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Isn't a studio now just pretty much your laptop or no?</p><p>GILL: Well, pretty much. I mean it can be. But I went a little further than that. Not as big as a commercial studio, but enough to track. And it's really fun because we all kind of gather around in a room and play music together instead of sequester each other off in a booth somewhere where you can't see each other and we're all just playing together. And it's been the greatest experience, this new record, the \"Time Jumpers\" record, that -- I started playing with this band about two and a half years ago. And they're a western swing band.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: Me being from Oklahoma, I was crazy -- I've always been crazy for Bob Wills music and that swing stuff and they would ask me to come in and occasionally sit in and fill in and, you know, if a guitar player couldn't make it, they'd call me up and sub. And little by little they grew confidence in me and said, hey, you want to be in the band. A couple guys quit. And I said, sure. It would be fun. So I talked them into making a record at the house and we decided to put it out. I said, man, we could make a record for nothing. It would be a blast. And so away we went.</p><p>IMUS: Talking with Vince Gill here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Weren't you originally in Pure Prairie League?</p><p>GILL: A long time ago. Yes, 33 years ago.</p><p>IMUS: And before that?</p><p>GILL: I played with a guy named Byron Berline. A really great fiddle player. Lived in Los Angeles. Was a session player. Played on Rolling Stones' records and Birds records and all kind of great rock records and was the go-to guy for fiddle out on the West Coast forever and ever and ever. And he had an opening and I was 18 or 19. We moved out there as a kid and started out there.</p><p>IMUS: You just played guitar for a long time, right?</p><p>GILL: Yes. Still do.</p><p>IMUS: No, I know you do. But, I mean, I guess you knew you could sing, but nobody else did or did they?</p><p>GILL: Well, a lot of times those gigs I would get would be because I could sing, too, you know, and in those days if you could find somebody that could multi-task, I guess would be a good word for it, and do a bunch of different stuff, you were a better asset to a band. And so I was always able to play a little bit of everything and could fill in whatever was needed.</p><p>IMUS: What's the state of country music in your view?</p><p>GILL: It's interesting.</p><p>IMUS: You like it or no?</p><p>GILL: I'm not crazy about it. But I'm not supposed to. I'm 55 years old and I'm supposed to like, what, you know, my era did and the era before me. I don't -- I don't dislike it, I just don't necessarily believe that it's -- it's -- the term country music fits it so much.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>GILL: But, you know, they're young kids and they're following their muse, they're do what they love and I've got no -- I've got no bitterness towards them at all.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm 72 and I be loving that \"Pontoon\" record by Little Big Town.</p><p>GILL: Oh, isn't that cool?</p><p>IMUS: That's a good record, man.</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I like Jason Aldean. Come on.</p><p>GILL: Yes, he's fun.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: You know, they're rocking, they're -- you know, they're kind of -- they're pretty -- pretty brash. They're, you know, party time and all that stuff. That's just, you know, it's not for me. It's not that I don't like it.</p><p>IMUS: Jamey Johnson, of course, he's --</p><p>GILL: Great songwriter.</p><p>IMUS: Speaking about being out where the buses don't run. So -- but he's great, isn't he?</p><p>GILL: He is.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p>GILL: He's a great throwback, you know.</p><p>IMUS: How do you really think is great?</p><p>GILL: Oh, well, I like -- I -- actually, there's a lot of people I love. I think Carrie Underwood sings her brains out.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>GILL: Yes. She's a great singer.</p><p>IMUS: I just can't take that screaming.</p><p>GILL: Well, she does -- she will sing hard, but that's -- you've got understand, that's what people are -- that's what they're learning. That's what they're singing.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: From \"Star Search\" and \"American Idol.\" All these shows. It's like grandiose and the big finish and, you know, it's --</p><p>IMUS: I listened to something the other day that -- a duet you did with her. It's good.</p><p>GILL: Oh, the \"How Great Thou Art\" thing?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: That was nice.</p><p>IMUS: Are you really religious? I mean --</p><p>GILL: To some degree, I guess. Probably not to the level of probably what the expectation is of me because I'm married to Amy.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: I feel like a novice, you know, because I haven't had a church life in my adult life. I did as a kid, but my adult life was never conducive to it, only because of my work. I was gone every weekend.</p><p>IMUS: But you believe Jesus is the Son of God?</p><p>GILL: I do.</p><p>IMUS: OK. And like Mojo Nixon says about Elvis, Elvis is everywhere. And I believe Jesus is everywhere. I mean -- I also know, though, however, not that anybody asked me, but I respect all other religions as well. I --</p><p>GILL: Me, too.</p><p>IMUS: See, I don't think there's just one way to get there.</p><p>GILL: Well, I've traveled the world enough to -- you know, it just seems -- it doesn't seem logical that other parts of the world would know this way. You know, maybe I'm wrong. I have been before.</p><p>IMUS: And now are you prepared for this new information that Jesus may have had a wife.</p><p>GILL: I heard. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: My observation was, if -- wasn't it her job then to come up with a (INAUDIBLE) -- just idiotic.</p><p>GILL: That explains the missing years.</p><p>IMUS: You know Billy Joe Shaver?</p><p>GILL: A little bit, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. I think he's one of the great songwriters ever.</p><p>GILL: I do too. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But there's somebody who is certifiably -- but a sweet man. My (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>GILL: Yes, that's my -- you know, that's really my era of the people I love were guys like him, Guy Clark, Jerry Jeff and Rodney Crowell and just those really great songwriters from the '60s and '70s, (INAUDIBLE) Van Zant and Emmy Lou was a great, great mentor to me, and teaching me what great songs were like and who great song writers were, so, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Bill Anderson, one of the great songwriters ever.</p><p>GILL: No question. Most recorded, probably, in the history of country music.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. I love him.</p><p>GILL: Even more so than Harlan or any of the others. So, I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: God, wasn't he great, Harlan Howard. Oh, my God. Please.</p><p>GILL: Yes. We were good buddies. You know, when I first moved to Nashville, we were great friends and I would sing all of his demos for him, $10 a song.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p>GILL: There was tons of demos of Harlan's and we were great friends.</p><p>IMUS: Before he died, he sent me a CD that he cut of all of his songs.</p><p>GILL: Wow.</p><p>IMUS: That he had written. He just dubbed, you know, (INAUDIBLE). I mean, just everything that he did. And, oh, my God, what a great song.</p><p>GILL: He's a great man. You know, when I was first getting started, he pulled me aside and he said, kid, you're one hell of a guitar player. And I said, well, thanks, Harlan. And he says, and you're a pretty good songwriter, but you're one hell of a guitar player, one hell of a singer, and a pretty good song writer. I said, I get what you're saying.</p><p>IMUS: So you have a new record?</p><p>GILL: Not me, the \"Time Jumpers.\"</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>GILL: This band does. It came out last week.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe I could pay attention.</p><p>GILL: No, that's cool. I mean it's a fun record. You would really love this record if you like Bill Wills and that swing music. It's an 11 piece bad full of arguably some of the best talent that's ever graced instruments in Nashville, Tennessee. All side me. All guys that played for other people. Session players, things like that. All wanted to have fun on Monday night. So we got together and -- years ago, they did, and started playing every Monday night just for the love of it and fun of it. And we still are. We just made a record.</p><p>IMUS: I can take a little bit of Bob Wills, but it's my contention -- and I know I'm right -- that nobody likes blue grass music, including the people who play it.</p><p>GILL: I think you might get a wrestling match over that one.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, I'm sure I will.</p><p>It's great to see you.</p><p>GILL: You too.</p><p>IMUS: It's an honor to have you on the program.</p><p>GILL: Thanks.</p><p>IMUS: You're one of my favorites. You're one of everybody's favorites, so - -</p><p>GILL: Well, right back at you.</p><p>IMUS: My wife loves you and my 14-year-old kid loves you and a lot of people do.</p><p>GILL: I appreciate it.</p><p>IMUS: The great Vince Gill.</p><p>You know I played that \"Go Rest High on the Mountains\" you wrote for your brother.</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I -- and thanks for the money you sent to the ranch when Fred died. But --</p><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: He's been dead a year. It's still hard to talk about him. I try --</p><p>GILL: I know.</p><p>IMUS: I played your record. I tried to talk about it and --</p><p>GILL: Yes, my brother's been gone for 20 years. You know, hard to believe. But, you know, that's --</p><p>IMUS: Why do we -- what is it? Is it -- why do we -- why does people dying have that effect on us? It's part of life.</p><p>GILL: Yes. It's because you miss them.</p><p>IMUS: Is it?</p><p>GILL: Yes. I do.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, I guess that is. I mean we're not -- yes, I guess that's what it is.</p><p>All right, man, it's great to see you.</p><p>GILL: You too, buddy.</p><p>IMUS: Vince Gill.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>We have an update on that Blackberry outage. Research In Motion says service has been restored and things are back to normal. The company had reported an outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p><p>Checking the markets now. Stocks in Asia rose as the release of that new iPhone gave the telecom sector a boost. Hong Kong led the way with a 0.7 percent gain. In Europe, the Financial Times is reporting European Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank. Markets there are currently mixed. London still to the downside by about three points, but Paris is back in the green, up almost 10 points and Frankfurt's up by 51.</p><p>Here in the U.S., we've had green arrows across the board all morning. Dow futures are up by 43, the S&amp;P's up by about four, and the Nasdaq's up by seven.</p><p>So now that Apple's iPhone 5 is available, we're also finding out what exactly makes this smartphone work. The repair firmiFixit got its hands on one, pried it open and found that the device uses chips from Qualcomm, Avego Technologies and Skyworks Solutions. The phone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus Logic. And its gyroscope, which is used to track the orientation, was made by STMicroelectronics. You can keep an eye on stocks of those companies and those who didn't contribute to the iPhone 5 to see how they react today.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities now. Oil and gold are to the upside. Oil's up by about 60 cents, around $93 a barrel. Gold's up $6 at $1,776 an ounce.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: IMUS IN THE MORNING continues here in the next hour with Neil Cavuto from the Fox Business Network. He had a recent interview with Mitt Romney here. So we'll talk to -- the I-man will talk to Neil about all that's going on in the world.</p><p>And this portion of IMUS IN THE MORNING is brought to you by \"A Wanted Man\" by Lee Child, now available in hard cover and e-book from Delacorte. Now five minutes till the hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Here with -- with some thoughts on pot --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Is Brian Wilson, on the genius of the Beach Boys.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Wilson.</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Good morning, Opie.</p><p>I hear there's a movement to decriminalize marijuana, which is good, because pot never did anything criminal to anybody, just made them feel good. People say it's a gateway drug, which I guess it is. It's a gateway to a beautiful world of pretty flowers and beautiful music and little bunnies who sing pretty songs and give out candy.</p><p>But it's not like you're going to smoke a doobie and next thing you know you're mainlining smack or anything. Of course it depends on how strong your dope is. Like I just got a lid of northern lights white widow wonder woman. You don't even have to smoke it. You just hold a butt in your hand for 10 minutes and once the oil gets into your pours, you're a bottle rocket, man. I think it also might have been sprayed with PCP and Easy Off, because after I did a half a bong's worth last night, a genie appeared and told me my oven was magically cleaned.</p><p>But legalization would be good for the economy, not just for the tax they could collect on the (INAUDIBLE) itself, but for all the sales of paraphernalia. It'd create jobs making rolling papers, Zip-loc bags, Twinkies. If they had made weed legal, we could balance a budget by 4:20 the next afternoon.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: Nice.</p><p>BARTLETT: And I'll be sitting in my sandbox with my KCO keyboard writing a new song for the cute little bunny who gives out the candy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. Apple fans around the world are lining up to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves around the world today here in New York City.</p><p>The door should be opening sooner, and Robert Gray is standing by at Apple's fifth avenue store. Robert, what is it like out there?</p><p>ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS: Well, Diane, I don't know if you can hear the cheers, they're audible behind me.</p><p>Apple employees are outside, greeting the first of the 500 folks who have been camping out here.</p><p>And the crowd has been swelling as the sun has being rising over Manhattan this morning, waiting to get in to buy the iPhone 5.</p><p>The store behind me is not only open 24 hours, seven days a week, they did close it last night.</p><p>Not opening until 8 a.m., that is the time that each Apple store in each time zone has been opening in local time.</p><p>So, we've had folks here from Arizona, saying that they're facebooking and tweeting their friends back in Arizona.</p><p>Boasting that they're going to get their hands on the iPhone before those guys can. And you can hear the crowd starting to cheer even more there, as I said, some 500 folks here.</p><p>The new iPhone 5 -- sold out two million, pre-selling in an hour's time. It's expected to be the fastest and widest rollout yet for Apple, nine nations have the iPhone selling it.</p><p>That's the most to participate in it and what we've seen and, analysts saying that they've stocked piled as many as 10 million units, that's about $6.4 billion worth of inventory by the way.</p><p>And they're expected according to some analysts to sell as many as 10 million, Ben Stevens saying, they could sell 13 million before the end of this month.</p><p>Now, the new phone does boosts faster, processing speed, it works on the 4 GLTE network where you can get that.</p><p>It also -- it has an enhanced camera, the Siri voice command, it would give you turn-by-turn navigation, you can post to Facebook.</p><p>You can also book reservations on open table but critics point to the mapping features saying that they're incomplete, there's been some errors there, and a lot of hoopla and negative flap about the connectors.</p><p>Which have short meaning that all of those i-gadgets you have there, work with iPhones, you're going to have to go out and buy new ones, although there're some analysts who say we're moving to Bluetooth.</p><p>Anyway, it may not be a big issue, down the line it will be though immediately and Diane, we should also point out a robust secondary market for iPhones.</p><p>If you have an iPhone 4s, still under warranty, there are websites out there, vili.com is one and the CEO telling me, they've seen interest triple in the past week alone.</p><p>You'll get about 260 bucks for your old iPhone 4s, that will about cover the fees, you don't have to pay AT&amp;T to upgrade.</p><p>If you're going to buy one, you can get one, it'll cost you about 300 bucks, but that's still less than the new ones.</p><p>Which started 199 with a two-year contract. Back to you.</p><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Robert Gray outside the Apple store, thanks, Robert.</p><p>GRAY: You're welcome.</p><p>MACEDO: And as Apple focuses on the release of the iPhone 5, Research In Motion is focusing on a blackberry outage.</p><p>The company now says service has been restored and things are back to normal after reporting an earlier outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p><p>Let's look at the markets now, here in the U.S., Futures have been in the green across the board all morning, Dow Futures are now up by about 41 points, the S&amp;P is up by almost four, the Nasdaq is up by eight.</p><p>In Europe, the financial times is reporting European Union Authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p>You can see markets there are currently mixed, and now let's take a closer look at what's moving them with European markets analyst Jan Randolph.</p><p>He's a director of Sovereign Risk at IHS Global Insight. Now Jan, according to this financial times report, Spain and these European authorities that it's talking to, are hoping to unveil this bailout plan possibly in about a week.</p><p>How do you expect investors to respond if that happens?</p><p>JAN RANDOLPH, DIRECTOR, SOVEREIGN RISK, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT: I think positively.</p><p>I think they're expecting it, I think the lower borrowing costs we've seen from Spain, in anticipation of the ECB bond buying and the bailout fund being made available.</p><p>I think it will be a bailout light though, not a fully fledged bailout though, that will be far too much money.</p><p>The trick, you can call it that, is to keep private sector on board in terms of refinancing the Spanish state and to encourage more.</p><p>I think that's the trick and I think the package will be designed for that purpose.</p><p>MACEDO: All right, we'll see if they can do that. That's Jan Randolph at IHS, thanks so much, Jan.</p><p>RANDOLPH: Thank you.</p><p>MACEDO: And Universal Music Group has won approval from EU anti-trust regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion. After the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record labels.</p><p>Universal says the assets to be sold amount to 30 percent of EMI's global sales. Citigroup is selling EMI after they acquired the music group when Vita firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the investment bank.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities now, oil and gold still up, oil is up by about 74 cents around $93 a gallon. Gold is up 6 bucks at 1,776 an ounce.</p><p>Coming up this hour, Imus' guest will be our own Neil Cavuto and now, here's the i-man live on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: So big foot says to me, of all the people we've ever had on the program, two of the nicest, perhaps the nicest, Vince Gill --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: And Levon Helm. So, Vince Gill is, that man, that's an American treasure there, I'll tell you that right now.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, here's what I'm trying to understand, Bernard, Connell, anybody. Warner, anybody? Dagen? First, the administration said, regarding the attack on Libya.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: That it was all the fault of this hideous movie that was on YouTube and -- then we had people like K.T. McFarland and others on this program say, that they believed the attack was essentially nonsense.</p><p>Although it may have served as a convenient excuse, but the anniversary of 9/11 had a lot more to do with it.</p><p>And now we're being told, I guess, that no, the administration now says, well, it was a terrorist attack.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, here is my question. Did they know that -- did the President use the word terrorist, by the way?</p><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Has he ever?</p><p>MCSHANE: Has he ever used the word period?</p><p>IMUS: Yes, does he believe that there's terrorism in the world?</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, yes, he's used --</p><p>IMUS: Sure --</p><p>MCSHANE: The word certainly --</p><p>IMUS: Yes, OK, all right. Does -- so did they use the movie as a convenient excuse until they could develop all of the facts and find out what really happened? Or as opposed to saying we don't know, which would mean they lied to us.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: So, sort it out for me, start with you, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, they went out as Susan Rice, the U.N. Ambassador on Sunday, she went, did the tour and proclaimed, pretty much, no uncertain terms, that it was all about the movie.</p><p>And which seemed premature and a lot of people said as John McCain said, you know there was a spontaneous demonstration she said, and John McCain said you don't bring RPG's to a spontaneous demonstration.</p><p>And sure enough, it comes out later, <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>now reporting that there was an al Qaeda guy who was released from Gitmo in 2007.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Who was behind the attacks. And so, it makes you wonder how stupid -- I mean, didn't they know that that would come out? They must have known, or at least should have considered that it might have come out when they put out Susan Rice to say these stupid things.</p><p>And it did come out and now they're backtracking, Jay Carney said, yes, it was an act of terror. And so, they look dead, they shot themselves in the foot --</p><p>IMUS: Well --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Once again.</p><p>IMUS: The president's conduct to foreign policy is laughable and then my guy, the suit dummy --</p><p>MCSHANE: Romney.</p><p>IMUS: His comments in the wake of it were idiotic as well. Shut up until you know something. By the way, just butt out.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, but to mislead the American people --</p><p>IMUS: Or what I said --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Because it would look bad politically, so, you can't --</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Say that the GM is alive and Bin Laden is dead sort of puts a monkey wrench into all that.</p><p>IMUS: I understand.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I mean that's sort of insulting --</p><p>IMUS: That's what I wondered, so --</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, that's what the critics are saying that, you know, they're trying to change -- oh, it's much easier for the administration to come out and say what Susan Rice said.</p><p>It's kind of interesting that she was put out there. Right, the President has been very careful on what he's personally said about this.</p><p>Even yesterday, as you said, he didn't use the word terrorism, it was Jay Carney, his spokesman, not him.</p><p>IMUS: Well, there we are. Neil Cavuto -- I mean, and these are the two guys we've got running.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, it's just -- all right, eight minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Neil Cavuto is coming up, I saw him this morning, when I walked in the building and it was before 5:30 a.m.</p><p>MCSHANE: Wow.</p><p>IMUS: And he looked cute and perky down there in the lobby and he got all exercised hysterical because I had my little oxygen tank with me because I couldn't breathe this morning so --</p><p>MCSHANE: Got to get by.</p><p>IMUS: What is it you're going to do?</p><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: What is it you're going to do? So, all that's going on, and then of course last night's football game, we're going to listen to Warner Wolf and that dope Gunz --</p><p>WOLF: Hey, come on.</p><p>IMUS: Or any of the guys on the pre-game show --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: On the NFL network, which by the way is a disaster.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But Rich Eison and that dope Deion Sanders and Michael Irvin and --</p><p>MCSHANE: Marshall Faulk?</p><p>IMUS: Marshall Faulk and that dope, that fat dope -- why is the, why is the name calling necessary?</p><p>MCSHANE: Simply --</p><p>IMUS: Steve Mariucci --</p><p>MCSHANE: It's better --</p><p>IMUS: Every single one of these dopes --</p><p>MCSHANE: Right --</p><p>IMUS: Picked the tail out of Panthers across the board. And the Giants won 36 to 7.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well --</p><p>IMUS: Now what?</p><p>WOLF: I told Gunz I'm going to watch out for these reserves --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, God, you're a disgrace.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On that, no --</p><p>IMUS: What are the Yankees doing?</p><p>WOLF: Now, the Yankees lead by one with 13 to play --</p><p>IMUS: All right --</p><p>WOLF: And they all play, Orioles play losers and so do the Yanks.</p><p>IMUS: Is there any other race any place in the country?</p><p>WOLF: Well, we have a two-game lead in the White Sox and Tigers.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>WOLF: That's really it, because --</p><p>IMUS: OK --</p><p>WOLF: Now the A's are four back --</p><p>IMUS: Yes, fine, we don't need to run that --</p><p>WOLF: That's it --</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, OK.</p><p>IMUS: All right, ten minutes after the hour, let's do some news, Bill Clinton is here, going to talk about -- what are you talking about?</p><p>BARTLETT: Monica Lewinsky's new book.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man, I can't wait to read this, come on, dude.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: You know, Juan Williams is right. I'm probably making too big a deal out of O'Reilly's characterization of Lee Harvey Oswald as a sharpshooter.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know, but it just annoys me, but other than that, the book is great, \"Killing Kennedy\". All right, let's do the news, good morning Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, i-man. Well, we're keeping an eye on Pakistan this morning because there are protesters on the streets over there.</p><p>One of the things they won't be able to use their cell phones because the government blocked cell service in major cities, worried that phones might be used to detonate bombs.</p><p>And speaking of, you know that movie --</p><p>IMUS: People living in mud huts --</p><p>BARTLETT: I mean is it --</p><p>IMUS: Living in dirt and they've got cell phones.</p><p>MCGUIRK: If these people put this kind of energy into being industrious --</p><p>IMUS: Yes --</p><p>MCGUIRK: And you know, building up their -- you know, it's unbelievable. Just relax, man, go to work.</p><p>IMUS: Like a fool, I'm going to have Gunz and Warner pick the games coming up here.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK, good --</p><p>WOLF: Right.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, today is a national day of protest in Pakistan against that movie, that -- you know, you mentioned produced here in the United States.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: Listened to Ann Romney for a second, she was on a radio show in Iowa asking Republicans to stop attacking her husband.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you say to your fellow Republicans who are --</p><p>ANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY: Stop it. This is hard, you want to try it, get in the ring.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: You want to try it, get in the ring, is what she said.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, well, I mean, I mean, I appreciate her depending her husband.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: She's a nice woman and all that, it's just --</p><p>MCSHANE: That's it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, let's wait until after November before we start with the second guessing with the critics, I mean, not you chief. But I'm talking about some of these supposed Republican allies.</p><p>IMUS: That's right. .</p><p>MCGUIRK: We're in a battle here, come on. Whose side you want?</p><p>MCSHANE: Speaking of which, the polls 47 percent apiece, dead heat in the daily tracking poll from Gallop yesterday, but Romney's problem has been in these swing state polls.</p><p>Another one out from the \"Wall Street Journal\" \"Nbc News\", it's Obama up eight points in Iowa, leading by five points both in Wisconsin and in Colorado.</p><p>Here's the question for you, who do you think had the most watched convention speech? Well, it turns out Joe Biden, the Vice-President. 43.6 million people for what it's worth, President Obama close second followed by Mitt Romney, Bill Clinton and Marco Rubio.</p><p>IMUS: Well, of course, because we thought it was going to be a car wreck.</p><p>RUFINO: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: Absolutely.</p><p>MCSHANE: Tuning in, in case --</p><p>IMUS: Thirteen after the hour, let's do some business news, and here with that is Dagen McDowell.

All right, please welcome now, speaking of that to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, former president of the United States, Bill Clinton, good morning, Mr. President.</p><p>BARTLETT: Well, morning, i-man. Well, it was only a matter of time, but I guess $12 million is $12 million. So Monica Lewinsky is going to publish her memoir with all the gory details.</p><p>Every sleazy, sticky, creepy, crawly bit of nastiness, and once it hits the bestseller list, Bill O'Reilly is going to be able to start writing his next book, \"Killing Clinton\".</p><p>Because Hillary will shoot me. It's bad enough that the love ick on the blue dress was made public for a while there.</p><p>I even thought they were going to put it on display and this masonian next to Lincoln's stovepipe hat.</p><p>But now, Monica is going to reveal all my sex secrets, like my insatiable appetite for three-way sex. Which isn't what you were thinking is, is it just really?</p><p>I only know three ways of doing it, four, if count missionary, but having somebody else in the picture, that's just sick, unless the extra person is A, a woman and B, hot.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>BARTLETT: But Monica is also going to reveal my fondness for sex toys. OK, one time I used some legos to build a little garage for my weiner.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But it wasn't, you know a butt plug the size of a lava lamp.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But what really hurts is the allegation that she has to do this because she needs to make a living and can't get a job because of me, which is just not true.</p><p>She could get a job tomorrow, in a cigar store --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>BARTLETT: Or better yet, a shoe store because you know, she's real good on her knees.</p><p>IMUS: So, 19 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. From their brand new album, \"Hillbilly Jedi\", Big and Rich. That was a good record.</p><p>And my baby gone.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: You know, I never thought about it, about women's hair thinning. I thought only men got bald until I saw a bald-headed woman.

Good morning Mr. McGuirk.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, Mr. Imus. And the big dawg Bill Clinton was on with your friend Jon Stewart last night and he was boring, he was just flat-out.</p><p>He made Charlie Rose sound like Mad Dog Russo, he was so boring. But, listen to Jon Stewart do his best impersonation of Monica Lewinsky journalistically.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>JON STEWART, COMEDIAN &amp; TELEVISION HOST: Give any good speeches lately or? How was that -- how did that feel at the convention?</p><p>Could you tell that you were crushing it as you were doing it? Did you, did you feel that?</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes and no. But -- because I didn't want to talk down to people, I wanted to explain what I thought was going on.</p><p>STEWART: That's what was so stunning, I think. That's why it was such a bracing speech. The phrase you mentioned earlier about getting the facts right, and they would have -- you would attach numbers to them that were real.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I thought it was a bold choice on your part.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: I mean he's going to have to send his jackets to the cleaners after that, I mean, just figuratively, it was sort of nauseating. But --</p><p>IMUS: What? There was not any --</p><p>MCGUIRK: The way he just -- I mean, did he ask him about the memoir that's coming out? --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, no --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Memoir --</p><p>IMUS: Stewart was jerking his chain.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, he wasn't.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, he was.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I saw it. He was --</p><p>IMUS: He wasn't jerking his chain?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Not at all. He was telling him what a great speech you gave and could you put facts out there, unlike Mitt Romney --</p><p>IMUS: You're telling me Stewart wasn't kidding with that?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, not at all. That was a straight-up journalistic --</p><p>IMUS: Didn't he sound like he was kidding --</p><p>BARTLETT: I mean, I didn't see it, so, I mean, I was there?</p><p>IMUS: He didn't sound like he was kidding?</p><p>POWELL: Little tongue in cheek to me.</p><p>IMUS: That's what he sounded, like a little tongue in cheek. Really?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, absolutely not.</p><p>IMUS: Well, because you're a hater.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, because I actually watched it, I saw it. Now, let's move on here, boss, because the clock is ticking and I know you want to get Mr. Cavuto on.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And we got us a little sex scandal over at \"Good Morning America\".</p><p>IMUS: All right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: You know, locally here in New York City, you have this news anchor on \"Channel 7\", \"Wabc\" Liz Cho.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, my God, that's a home wrecker there.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, excuse me. She and this dude, Josh Elliott, who's an anchor on \"Good Morning America\", they're apparently an item. I'm going to read from the \"New York Post\" --</p><p>IMUS: I thought she was married.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, she was.</p><p>IMUS: Oh --</p><p>MCGUIRK: This is what the \"New York Post\" page six writes this morning. \"After we revealed yesterday that 41-year-old beauty Cho, the co-anchor of \"Wabc TV\" in New York, split with her husband and moved out of their Yonkers mansion three months ago.</p><p>She insisted through friends that they're just friends. She's 41, he's 41 and they say \"That this guy Elliott is a regular visitor to Liz's new apartment on west 90th street, baby.</p><p>And he's been spotted leaving the building in the morning. He's even been picked up from Cho's part to head to work at \"Good Morning America\" where he works as a news anchor.</p><p>Good morning Elizabeth. But they insists that the relationship began after she moved out of the Yonkers mansion.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right, it has to be true, right?</p><p>RUFINO: All right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, but in any case, you know this guy Josh Elliott, he's sort of in Kris Humphries area, he hosts this unwatchable \"Good Afternoon America\" show --</p><p>IMUS: No, I don't --</p><p>MCGUIRK: With Lara Spencer. Well, anyway this is blooming over --</p><p>IMUS: Stuff about praising anchor, no, I don't.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And they're beating the crap out of the \"Today Show\" by the way - -</p><p>IMUS: Not good, I'm happy about that.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: That's all you got?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, I do have another piece of David Letterman clip, busting on Jay Leno and Mitt Romney, but --</p><p>IMUS: No, he's a creep --</p><p>MCGUIRK: We can save it.</p><p>IMUS: Thirty minutes after the hour, and here, Cavuto is next.</p><p>One of Neil's favorite songs.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network. And now, here is Diane Macedo.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. General Motors is recalling more than 426,000 Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn sedans in the U.S. due to transmission problems. The recall affects vehicles model years 2007 to 2010.</p><p>The automaker says the transmission gear position may not match the gear on the shifter and that could cause the vehicle to move when drivers think they're in park. GM says it's aware of four crashes due to the problem, but no injuries reported as of now.</p><p>Meanwhile, the recall news after General Motors announced it has reached an agreement with the Canadian Autoworkers Union over a labor contract. Under the tentative four year deal, GM will add a third shift to its flex line at its Ontario facility.</p><p>The automaker had planned to shutdown that plant three-shift consolidated line next June, but will operate with at least one line until June of 2014. The CAW continues to negotiate a deal with Chrysler after it already reached one with Ford earlier in the week.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues now after we check the weather with Fox 5 meteorologist, Mike Woods.</p><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, everyone. Looks like we have some wet weather out there, but not a ton of it for the country here. We've got an area of low pressure still rotating around the Great Lakes, but it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwest and Central Mississippi Valley area.</p><p>And then back towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east and also a few showers popping up around Florida again, southeast, slightly risky in terms of showers and storms. Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms and high temp today, 88 degrees.</p><p>And Phoenix, no rain for you, sunny skies with a high of 103 and Seattle partly cloudy skies with a high of 63. Sacramento, California, you've got sunny skies there today with a high of 91, still warm. I'm Mike Woods from Fox 5 in New York.</p><p>IMUS: All right, it's 36 minutes past the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Please welcome to the program, senior vice president, anchor manager, Fox Business News, <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Channel, a man who sadly calls himself the financial factor, Neil P. Cavuto. What does the P stand for?</p><p>NEIL P. CAVUTO, FOX BUSINESS: Patrick.</p><p>IMUS: Good morning, Mr. Cavuto.</p><p>CAVUTO: Good morning, Mr. Imus.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>CAVUTO: It was scary bumping into you this morning.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I had my little oxygen tank with me.</p><p>CAVUTO: You kind of looked like Hannibal Lector being driven in on a gurney and I thought, is he up to doing the show today? But here you are, encouragement to all us.</p><p>IMUS: Well, anaerobic, but I recover quickly and I don't need oxygen just to sit around and talk.</p><p>CAVUTO: I admire that.</p><p>IMUS: Happy birthday tomorrow.</p><p>CAVUTO: How did you know that?</p><p>IMUS: It's my job to know those things.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you very much.</p><p>IMUS: So, you like the Vince Gill interview?</p><p>CAVUTO: I liked it very much, I'm a big fan of his and I thought you did a very good job. A lot of people, you know, when you interview stars it's always tough. You do a fawning interview or you do a revealing one particularly like the things about your brother, how tough that is and trying to get a handle on it, very real. I liked it very much.</p><p>IMUS: So I asked you off the air if you liked Romney. Do you?</p><p>CAVUTO: I do, personally I like him a lot.</p><p>IMUS: It doesn't bother you that he's a dope, right?</p><p>CAVUTO: He's not a dope.</p><p>IMUS: OK, he's not a good campaigner, is he?</p><p>CAVUTO: I think that remains to be seen. The election hasn't happened yet.</p><p>IMUS: No, sir. Do you think that these leaked videos, these missteps that they've each made, is going to make a difference when people vote?</p><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p>IMUS: You don't?</p><p>CAVUTO: I do not. I think in the end, it always is the economy. I think that's what-- we could have extenuating circumstances, the Middle East explosion, could have the impact, but almost every U.S. election is decided by the economy.</p><p>How good people feel, how maybe not so good people feel and we're always willing to entertain switching horses mid stream when an incumbent is battling a tough economy, but we've really got to see the other horse.</p><p>I think in 1980 when the polls were similarly tight between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. A lot of people liked Jimmy Carter, frustrated with the economy, but they were more than willing to entertain an alternative and along came Ronald Reagan to appeal to alternative.</p><p>IMUS: How many people vote for the person who they like the best?</p><p>CAVUTO: I think it plays a part.</p><p>IMUS: How big a part?</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I do think it helped George Bush, many polls were done on the debate between he and Al Gore and then later on between he and John Kerry. And I think most people said who won the debates?</p><p>And a lot of them said, particularly in 2004, with John Kerry, who do you like more or relate to more? George Bush. I'm not saying that's always the case, but it does help if people feel you're either more approachable or likeable.</p><p>And I think in 1960 from the television critics later who said that Richard Nixon was sweating and detached and John Kennedy looked relaxed and smooth. These things on some level do connect for people.</p><p>IMUS: Talking with Neil Cavuto -- talking with Neil Cavuto here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. It's 5 until the hour, you know what you ought to do here at Fox?</p><p>CAVUTO: What's that?</p><p>IMUS: An interesting experiment because my wife mentioned this to me.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: She wants to have sex with you, by the way.</p><p>CAVUTO: Who doesn't?</p><p>IMUS: I don't. Wants to have sex with you --</p><p>CAVUTO: And go ahead.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway.</p><p>CAVUTO: Come on, Don, tell me. Go ahead, please.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I forgot --</p><p>CAVUTO: At least say something, you guys.</p><p>IMUS: Here is what you should do.</p><p>CAVUTO: Like an interview by Rainman.</p><p>IMUS: When is the first debate, October 1st?</p><p>CAVUTO: I think the 3rd.</p><p>IMUS: It's the day he hit the home run. Here is what you should do. Please don't interrupt when I'm talking with Mr. Cavuto, Warner. I'll come over there and beat on you like a rented mule. Just kidding. You should get a group of people.</p><p>Frank -- You should do it. Get a group, have them listen to the audio feed and don't let them watch it and have the group just watch it on television and then poll each group to see who won. Who they think won.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's not a bad idea.</p><p>IMUS: It is a good idea isn't it?</p><p>CAVUTO: It's a very good idea.</p><p>IMUS: Because Deirdre said to me -- don't you hate it when guys quote their wives. You know, that means they're so p-whipped.</p><p>CAVUTO: And she's insane for putting up with you.</p><p>IMUS: Absolutely. Because you get distracted who looked and --</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, yes. And history bears that out. I mean, people who, I guess, were listened in to the Nixon-Kennedy debate thought Nixon, and Bush and Al Gore. That was a little more debatable than Kerry and Bush.</p><p>IMUS: Should I call Roger and --</p><p>CAVUTO: Please do, please do. I'm not going to act on this because I actually think the idea is silly.</p><p>IMUS: Do you really?</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. I do.</p><p>IMUS: You do?</p><p>CAVUTO: I think 90 percent of people are going to be watching and not listening.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you're just, I don't know, you're just -- I don't know.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I just, I think in 1960, it would have been a brilliant idea, but last time I checked --</p><p>IMUS: It's a good idea now just to see. It's 18 until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Did you read \"Killing Lincoln?\"</p><p>CAVUTO: I did read it. It's a great book.</p><p>IMUS: But I'll tell you what is a terrific book \"Killing Kennedy.\"</p><p>CAVUTO: I haven't -- I know it's out or will be out, but-- I really enjoyed \"Killing Lincoln\", the way he built it up and x number of days to live and I thought when I first opened it, we know what happened in the end.</p><p>But he didn't do a great job and see what the Kennedy book, but I think he's got -- he could a series on his hands. I don't know how you handle Philmore, getting Philmore, but --</p><p>IMUS: It's enormously entertaining and there's no heavy lifting, not a --</p><p>CAVUTO: I think it's a very good point. A lot of the stories, Brinkley, I love dearly and Harry Truman, 900 pages on and on and all great, but you can make this fun and engaging.</p><p>IMUS: And accessible.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's a way to do it. I didn't see the kids' version that's out but --</p><p>IMUS: That's pretty good, too. It's pretty good, too, so, do you think he writes any of it.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think he does.</p><p>IMUS: What's --</p><p>CAVUTO: -- his show.</p><p>IMUS: That doesn't make any difference.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, it doesn't, but when you say does he write his stuff? Of course, he writes his stuff.</p><p>IMUS: How is that demeaning --</p><p>CAVUTO: You say does he write the book.</p><p>IMUS: As a journalist, I have a --</p><p>CAVUTO: Excuse me? Excuse me.</p><p>IMUS: It's 17 until the hour here in the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Are you a sports fan?</p><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p>IMUS: Not at all.</p><p>CAVUTO: I heard you guys go through the Sunday games. I guess these are football games? Terrific, no offense guns and Warner but --</p><p>IMUS: That's fine, but do you ever watch sports on television?</p><p>CAVUTO: I have the attention span of a gnat. I watch the highlights. I said, why can't the games be like the highlights?</p><p>IMUS: Do you ever watch Sports Center?</p><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p>IMUS: Where do you get the highlights?</p><p>CAVUTO: Passing around the news or online, but I'm not really -- I'm afraid I'm not really into it.</p><p>IMUS: So, do you watch television?</p><p>CAVUTO: I know this is going to sound elitist, but I really don't. I'm just, it's not --</p><p>IMUS: Mr. Cavuto --</p><p>CAVUTO: I watch you, of course, I mean, that's a staple. Connell and Dagen and flip over --</p><p>IMUS: Mr. Cavuto is on at 4 in the afternoon on the <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Channel and 8 p.m. and do you think that --</p><p>CAVUTO: I want to come back at you with anger, but I saw you with the oxygen tank and go lightly no need to be mean.</p><p>IMUS: It's a quarter until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>CAVUTO: This is three times in this hour with this interview, you relay the time. It's always fascinating to me why you do that.</p><p>IMUS: I'm doing a radio program.</p><p>CAVUTO: I know that. I know, but -- like I say there are clocks in those cars, right?</p><p>IMUS: I can stop giving the time.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, more time for me.</p><p>IMUS: Bernie, put a call in to Bob -- anyway do you think Obama is a socialist?</p><p>CAVUTO: No. I think he likes big government. I think he likes more big government and espouses the view much like FDR in 1932, government the only way to get us out of the mess and a lot more people are beholden to the government as a result of that.</p><p>And he's got a pretty good base of people who would vote for him as a result and I think that probably was what Mitt Romney was inelegantly getting at. But we all remember, you know, but FDR got re-elected in a landslide in 36 even though the economy still, still was pretty bad.</p><p>IMUS: As ours does.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And you would think that one of the things that Romney could get some traction and I think, that you asked, I think --</p><p>CAVUTO: Your thoughts are very valuable to me.</p><p>IMUS: I think the day that Romney gets elected, the economy is better just by -- he doesn't have to do anything, do you agree with that?</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you have to do something. You're popping up in a different --</p><p>IMUS: That wasn't the question.</p><p>CAVUTO: You mean, well, it's a stupid point. Sounds like Godzilla, January 20th just by virtue of being Godzilla being in the office because it's not Barack Obama, things are better.</p><p>IMUS: If it makes you feel like a bigger person, which you're --</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, you know, I could lose weight, you will always be evil.</p><p>IMUS: To make me feel bad by calling me a list of names, but don't you think the way the markets would react --</p><p>CAVUTO: It's always fine until --</p><p>IMUS: And the financial community.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: That the things would, people would feel better and I know he has do something, your suit dummy candidate and mine, but wouldn't have to do anything, but just get elected and it would be better. Do you think that's true?</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't, I don't, obviously if the nation turns to the challenger to throw the incumbent out of office. It's hoping what you said. And remember, electing Ronald Reagan in a landslide didn't bring results, in fact, the recession many more years and jobs lost until we had to boom in '82.</p><p>Coming out of that so things take time, I'm not subscribing to the screw that automatically things are better. They're ready to do well if we don't keep what we're doing and stop with a new guy in there. But you have to do stuff.</p><p>You have to put up some initiatives that will change the direction. Ronald Reagan did, and you know, the question would be for Romney administration, if it were to happen, whether it would.</p><p>IMUS: Is there a way now to know -- is there a way for you to know who will win the election?</p><p>CAVUTO: I have no idea.</p><p>IMUS: Do you have a gut sense?</p><p>CAVUTO: I do, but I'm not going to share that with you. I will say this - -</p><p>IMUS: You're really a creep.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's lovely. I only relate this to you. I think I told you this before. When I went to Wisconsin to cover the recall election, polls going into that weekend had dead even. I think it had it dead even and we know at that Walker won by six points.</p><p>Now, I had a theory and I could be very wrong that conservative support is understated in some of the state polls, maybe with unwinding a bit it's beyond the margin of error, but I do think these states apparently Mitt Romney is going to get blown out in, I don't subscribe to that.</p><p>IMUS: You're going to get to the point eventually, right?</p><p>CAVUTO: I just told you. And I think the polls in the battle ground state understate Romney's support.</p><p>IMUS: Hope you're right.</p><p>CAVUTO: And when you say Romney's my man you always say that.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: But then you disparage him.</p><p>IMUS: Keeping it real.</p><p>CAVUTO: And for every wonderful interview like Vince Gill and then you do one like you did with Frank Rich.</p><p>IMUS: My job is to keep it real, right, Bernie?</p><p>CAVUTO: Frank Rich interview, just kept it real.</p><p>IMUS: Keeping it real.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Thank you very much for --</p><p>CAVUTO: This is it?</p><p>IMUS: You were on for 12 minutes.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's 12 minutes of my life. I'm never getting back.</p><p>IMUS: And so does the audience.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACEOD: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. Let's take a look at the markets. In Europe, the \"Financial Times\" is reporting that European Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p>Markets there are now mixed with London down by about 5 points. Paris is up 10 and Frankfort is up about 64. Here in the U.S., we have seen green arrows across the board all morning. Dow futures are up by 56. The S&amp;P is up by about 5 and the Nasdaq is up by 13.</p><p>Now that Apple's iPhone is available, we're also finding out exactly what makes the smartphone work. The repair firm fix it, got one open and chips from Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solution.</p><p>The iPhone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus Logic and its gyroscope, which is used to track its orientation was made by ST Microelectronics. Keep an eye on those stocks and those are the companies that didn't participate in the iPhone to see the reaction today.</p><p>The world's biggest retailer is looking to do business in India. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reports Wal-Mart hopes to open its first stores in the country within two years. That move comes after the government last week agreed to allow international supermarket chains to enter India through joint ventures.</p><p>Wal-Mart says it hadn't decided yet where or how many stores it would like to have, but the company expects to continue its current partnerships with barky enterprises of India, a chain of 17 cash and carry stores.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities, oil and gold are up.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone. Apple fans are on the world of lining up to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves around the world today including here in New York City where our own Robert Gray is standing by at Apple's Fifth Avenue store. Robert, it is 6:00 in the morning. What does it look like out there right now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Diane. Good morning. There are a few hundred folks out here in line behind me. You can see them and in fact, the big cube here which this store is famous for, which lead you to an underground entrance way, the store is normally a 24-7 operation. They closed it overnight. It will not open until 8 a.m. local time. And of course, that is the roll out plan across nine different nations here.</p><p/><p>This is the widest rollout that Apple has had yet for one of their iPhones. Now, a key numbers to hit here. We've seen every iPhone new version has outsold a combined total of all the previous versions. This of course is a law of large numbers. It is going to be tough to duplicate. We'll have to wait and see. Most reviewers out there saying this phone a little bit more evolutionary than revolutionary.</p><p/><p>And of course, there's been a lot of feedback and flak, if you will, about the new connectors out there. They are of course shrinking the connectors down to nine pins from 30. So, all the products that you have around the house, connectors et cetera, you'll going to have to go out and buy some more of those. So, Apple is expected to make a big hole out of this as well as of course some of their third party partners out there. You're going to talk a little bit all morning long.</p><p/><p>Of course, we're expecting a faster processor on board, you got the new ear pods, the camera higher resolution, reportedly better. As the phone even now of course, some reviewers out there and analysts that I've spoken with Diane, saying that as far as the camera goes and processing speed, they're just now catching up to some of the rivals out there. But of course, as you can see, still plenty of Apple fans out here braving the early morning, though we must say pretty mild here in New York City. Back to you.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right. That's Robert Gray live at the Apple store. Thanks, Robert.</p><p/><p>GRAY: You're welcome.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Meanwhile, E.U. anti-trust regulators have cleared universal music group to buy British record company EMI as recorded music unit for $1.9 billion after the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record labels. Universal says, the assets to be sold amounts to 30 percent of EMI's global sales. Citigroup is selling EMI having acquired the music group when buy-out firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the investment bank.</p><p/><p>Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., futures have been in the green across the board all morning. Dow futures are up by about 40 points. The S&amp;P is up by almost four. The NASDAQ is up by seven.</p><p/><p>In Europe, the Financial Times reports European Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank. Markets are currently mixed. London was green earlier, now we're seeing it in the red down by almost nine points. Paris and Frankfurt still in the green.</p><p/><p>Let's take a closer look at what's moving those markets with Josh Raymond now, chief market strategist at City Index in London. Now, Josh, the FT is reporting that Spain is moving closer to a bailout. Should investors read that as a negative or should they find some release in having some more certainty on that front?</p><p/><p>JOSH RAYMOND, CITY INDEX CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: I think it is a positive. And it does provide some certainty. You know, the markets -- investors have been fairly convinced that more is required. There has been political maneuvering going on with Spain saying that they've got austerity measures in there. They don't require the fully -- bailout. But we already know that they're actually in talks, so we have that -- a few people of the Spanish government actually recently earlier on this week say, it will provide a level of certainty. And I think that would be reacted positively by the market. Of course, it depends on the scale which the (INAUDIBLE) will require, I mean, the ECB through monetary transactions have an unlimited scope to do so as well.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: And Josh, Mario Monti is holding meetings in Italy with several leaders today. What do you expect to come out of them?</p><p/><p>RAYMOND: Not much unfortunately. And we're getting used to all these meetings taking place and strong rhetoric talking about a fiscal union, stronger banking regulations, that sort of thing but nothing really comes of it. And I think investors are a little bit more wiser to that these days. Now, we already have the ECB. And the main focus for us at the moment really is the ECB and Spain. Now, we've obviously got the -- from the ECB and we're waiting for Spain to confirm or to agree that the terms towards that fully first bailout. Those are the key things that we're looking at.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: OK. More brain storming for the many results. We'll see if it comes out that way. Thanks, Josh. That's Josh Raymond from London.</p><p/><p>K.B. Home meanwhile is reporting a surprise profit this morning. The home builder says it made four cents a share in its third quarter. The company was expected to lose 16 cents a share but revenue came in light at $424.5 million. The estimate was for 430 million. K.B. Home says, it's order backlog at the end of August rose 18 percent from a year ago to more than 3,100 and home deliveries rose seven percent to more than 1,700.</p><p/><p>Here's a quick look at commodities. Oil and gold are both to the upside.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business.</p><p/><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. Well, it's going to be a great show.</p><p/><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Great show. Great day in New York today.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yep.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Last day of summer. Going to be 73 degrees. Let's do some sunbathing, baby.</p><p/><p>So, anyway, coming up this morning, Juan Williams, FOX News, and the great Vince Gill. Now, Vince -- when I say great, I mean great. He's not going to sing. He's coming in to talk. Now, why would you book somebody like Vince Gill just to talk? Because he's worth talking to.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: There's a few of these guys, people who I would talk to. It would be him -- who are worth talking to. Dwight Yoakam.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Smart guy, Yoakam.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Uh-huh!</p><p/><p>IMUS: Crazy but good crazy. Delbert, smart guy, funny.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Of course.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Kinky.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, not many more, right?</p><p/><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: Billy Ray?</p><p/><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM PRODUCER: He's one of the nicest guys too, Dwight Yoakam.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He is, isn't he?</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Yes, he's really nice guy.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know the day I got fired, he called me on my cell phone. I was on my way to meet the team. And I was in the car.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He's a good man. He understood what the deal was. And so, you know. You can't say stuff like that, man. Don't pick on people. Just don't do it, whether you're trying to be funny or not. Come on.</p><p/><p>Anyway, and so, and then the big dog's here, Bill Clinton.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh, good.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He's concerned about this book that Monica Lewinsky is going to do.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: I like that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: About them sex positions. And then, Warner?</p><p/><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You and Gunz.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, sir.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You skunks. And Steve Mariucci, the pregame show on the NFL Network, there are two reasons to watch that. Other than that.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Yes, good bye.</p><p/><p>IMUS: They suck, Rich Eisen, sucks. Steve Mariucci, sucks. Deion Sanders, moron, Michael Irving moron, and that other guy, moron.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Moron.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Every one of them picked the Carolina Panthers. What happened? The New York Giants put a butt whipping on them.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Oh, man.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Thirty six-seven. Come on.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Pussy riot, come on!</p><p/><p>IMUS: Start the pussy riot.</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's right. Come on.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man! Eli got the ball, what did he do? He marched down the field and scored a touchdown. Every time he got the ball. Come on!</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes. And the reserves, man, those guys, the regulars better look over their shoulders. Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, you and the ice cream cone on the forehead, Gunzelman --</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Oh, wow!</p><p/><p>WOLF: Oh, God!</p><p/><p>IMUS: -- should have anticipated this.</p><p/><p>(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p/><p>I mean, this was an outrage.</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's right.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Enjoy that ice cream.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I will never listen to -- and you're right, Warner, about these pregame shows. These people don't know anything.</p><p/><p>WOLF: No, waste of time.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's total waste of time.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Honeymoon is over.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Welcome.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. We're going to do the news now. Bernard.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yo, chief.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Or Connell.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Any of you.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Anybody.</p><p/><p>IMUS: The Libyan attack on the embassy.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: The administration initially, the President and the Secretary of State characterized this as a direct result of this YouTube movie, right?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Susan Rice all over the Sunday shows, she did a tour.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: U.N. ambassador. Yep.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Now, is there any evidence -- and how are they describing it now, the administration?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That there is evidence that the guy who was released from Guantanamo Bay in 2007 was behind -- an al-Qaeda guy was behind the attack on the embassy in Libya.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, is the President willing to use the word terrorist and describe this as a terrorist attack?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Not personally. Jay Carney used that word yesterday but the President did not when he was asked about it in the forum in Florida.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Has he ever used the word terrorist?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Good question.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. Now, so my question is this then, did they have evidence that -- did they know better that it was the result of the movie? Or of course, not so coincidently falling on September 11th. Did they not know that or did they lie about it or did they just assume -- you would think with our intelligence apparatus they would know better. But then, we've had other bunch of other screw ups. So what happened here? In other words, did they lie? Did they know? Did they not have the information? What?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: They jumped to conclusions. If they didn't know, they should have said they didn't know instead of proclaiming definitively that it was a direct result of the movie.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: They should not have proclaimed that. They should have said let's wait and see. They didn't. Again, and they still harp on the movie as though -- and they're conflating two things. The movie, the terrorists used the movie perhaps as a cover to get the morons to come out and cause a riot so that they could use that as cover to go in. But in either case, they were misleading, was the administration. They obviously don't want it to look like -- they want to say GM is alive and bin Laden is dead, and that's it. They can't say that anymore. And that's why they're, you know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I know you can't see it, but do you like my new hat?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, that's bad. That's a bad as Johnny Cash.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Look out now.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do you know who did this? Stuart Dunlap, Men's hat shop, Albuquerque.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Nobody but him.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Did he?</p><p/><p>IMUS: He did in San Antonio.</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's the Rango Kidd hat.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man, that guy is -- come on. All right. Let's do the news.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're a disgrace, Warner. Don't you be yucking it up over there. This is unbelievable. The country singer Josh Turner is downstairs. That boy is pretty good. He's on FOX and Fiends.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I guess people, there's an 80-plus demographic by records, right? Here's Connell with the news. Good morning, Connell.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man. Protesters are actually in the streets today in Pakistan. They won't be able to use their cell phones. Though, the government there is blocking cell service, major cities, so the phones can't be used to detonate bombs. It's a national day of protest against that movie we were talking about, the anti-Muslim film produced here in the United States. The surge in Afghanistan meantime is over according to the Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta who says in his view it worked.</p><p/><p>The 33,000 additional troops sent to Afghanistan a couple of years ago now pulled out of the country. The latest Gallup daily tracking poll has the race for the White House a dead heat. Forty seven percent a piece.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I'll be darned.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Mitt Romney and President Obama. But Romney is still hurting in some of these key swing states. \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC numbers, Obama is up eight points in Ohio. Leading by five both in Wisconsin and Colorado.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know, we are at a state in this country where this is the best we can do? A suit dummy and the president?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's the choice you have.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I mean, I know a bunch of smart guys. So, do you? I mean, we all do.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right. You mean like business leaders and that type of thing and --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Really smart people.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Can't get them to run.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well, I was going to say, it's hard to get people to run. Absolutely.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I don't know.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Be vetted and everything else.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Twelve minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Juan Williams, Vince Gill. Neil Cavuto. That's a pretty good lineup.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, it is. Connell continues.</p><p/><p>IMUS: We got some comments from Ann Romney here in a second but first, the campaign has turned to comments not by either Romney but by the President saying yesterday, \"Washington cannot be changed from the inside.\" Big things, he says, get done when people pressure politicians from the outside. So, Romney was all over that saying that Obama's thrown in the white flag of surrender on the economy. Now, here's Ann Romney. She was on a radio show in Iowa asking Republicans to stop attacking her husband.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>ANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY: What do you say to your fellow Republicans? Sure. Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it, get in the ring. This is hard. It's an important thing that we're doing right now, and it's an important election.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes. Today, the President --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Her husband is a moron. He'll do better than this guy. Having said all that -- I mean, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. Those of you who know me know I probably don't. But I'm going to vote for him. And I'm going to tell you that the day he gets elected, the economy is better. He doesn't have to do anything.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: You just think confidence is going to improve?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's one of the argument he made in that video that came out. Romney will be in Nevada today. Obama campaigning in Virginia. Some American airliners frequent fliers worried after hearing about the company's intentions to lay off thousands of workers and then reduce flights.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I'm pretty loyal to them. Because I do travel and get my miles with them. I have really not had too many problems.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Had a number of flights, so they've been canceled this week, American announcing more than 1,000 employees could lose their jobs. They're going through bankruptcy reorganization.</p><p/><p>And Fast and Furious, lawmakers analyzing this new report that's come in on the botch, ATF gun walking operation, it's a report from the inspector general from the Justice Department. They found the Attorney General Eric Holder was not aware of the operation until it came out in the media and other places. Here's California republican Congressman Darrell Issa says the report the raises an important question.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: There is clearly a question not of did he know, because he said he didn't know. The question is why in the world did key lieutenants keep it from him and of course why is that something that we should --</p><p/><p>(SCREAMING SHUT UP)</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sounds like a car alarm going off. Did the guy invented those Bernie or Connell?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Please step away from the car. That's his --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes. Please step away from the car. Please step away from your mouth.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh my God!</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sick of hearing about this.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right. Enough is enough.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Come on.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Let's just get the problems of this country solved. Bernard McGuirk is going to be a guest on O'Reilly tonight at 8 p.m. on the FOX NewsChannel. Bernard McGuirk and Greg Gutfeld in a segment called what the hell just happened or something.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Something like that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And it's good and they're good. A quarter after the hour. Let's do some business news. Here with that is Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, sir. Yesterday, the Dow was up a paltry almost 19 points and the futures are higher this morning. And OK, all these ding-a-lings are lined up for the new iPhone 5. It goes on sale this morning at 8 a.m. Local Time in stores in nine countries. I'm sure it's going to have record sales. But here's what we care about even more than that, that Apple has fallen flat on its face with this new mapping software that it released. It's on this new phone. It's also in the new software, the IOS-6. It replaced Google maps, kicked Google maps off the phone, and it's a disaster. It sucks. That's how bad it is. Basically like businesses wind up in the middle of rivers.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, I told Dagen I used map quest. She said, that's so 90's.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Map quest.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I said, well, the place I'm going hasn't moved. They'll tell you how to get there. What the hell do I care?</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: You could do so much better than that. That's the issue. You could do so much better than that. It's like saying I've got like a Xerox typewriter, like, you know, IBM Selectric or something like that before I curse.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Like what? What's better?</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Right. No, all this.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What's the matter?</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Google maps is better. Google maps is far and above better than map quest, and particularly this new Apple.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Old weird Dave Patterson from Texas, he just updated my iPhone iOS 6 last night.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you lost your Google maps and if you want to look for the Hoover dam on the 3D imaging, on this Apple mapping software, it looks like a -- roller coaster. That's how lousy it is.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I know where the Hoover dam is. Right outside of Las Vegas. Let's go look at it. Come on, dude.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Can't do it on that Apple mapping --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, come on. Get a life.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Don't we love when some giant, the biggest company in the world screws up?</p><p/><p>IMUS: First of all, all you ever care about is a bunch of red-neck goobers driving around in a circle and who knows where they're going to race this weekend, the NASCAR dopes. Where is the race?</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Well, in New Hampshire actually.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's pretty good track, so. So, they don't need a map. I tell you what they do need.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: They need a clue. All right. Eighteen after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Have you done sports yet, Warner?</p><p/><p>WOLF: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. Don't wear me out but here's Warner with sports. Go ahead.</p><p/><p>WOLF: All right, I-man. Thursday night football in Charlotte, now the Giants even with four offensive injuries beat the Panthers 36 to seven. Just like Gunzelman and myself called it. Backup running back Andre Brown playing for the injured Ahmad Bradshaw, 113 yards and 20 carries and two touchdowns.</p><p/><p>And then reserved wide receiver Ramses Barden playing in place of a Hakeem Nicks caught nine passes for 138 yards. Eli 27 for 35, 288 yards, a touchdown, no interceptions. And Lawrence Tynes kicked five field goals.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Wow!</p><p/><p>WOLF: Now, here was Cam Newton who, by the way, I don't know if you saw this, after he scored a touchdown to make it cut it to 23 to seven, he went into his superman celebration. Pretty good timing for that. So, here was Newton only 16 for 30 intercepted three times and ran the ball six times for only six yards.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CAM NEWTON, CAROLINA PANTHERS: Who wants to support something that puts on a performance of embarrassment. That's what that was tonight. If I was a fan of the Carolina Panthers, I would be holding my head down and ashamed of the product that was out there today.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes. He was awful.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Stop your stupid end zone celebrations, OK?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes. How about that?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>IMUS: What a dope.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: You have been killed.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You have been murdered.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Why do that?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man!</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yankees beat the Jays 10-seven, sweep the series. Ichiro by the way, a homerun and a double, he's not nine for his last 12.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That guy is crazy.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Oh, man!</p><p/><p>IMUS: On fire?</p><p/><p>WOLF: On fire. So, Yankees lead the Orioles by one with 13 to play.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p/><p>WOLF: And this is embarrassing, I-man.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What?</p><p/><p>WOLF: At City Field, the Phillies scored eight in the first, seven in the ninth and beat the Mets 16 to one. Here was Met Manager Terry Collins was asked after the game --</p><p/><p>RUFINO: There was nobody there.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That's right.</p><p/><p>WOLF: They were addressing these empty seats. Here was Mets manager Terry Collins asked after the game if he was embarrassed.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>TERRY COLLINS, METS MANAGER: I am.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Does his team quit?</p><p/><p>COLLINS: You'll have to ask them.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: What do you think?</p><p/><p>COLLINS: You'll have to ask them. I have my own opinion. I'm not going to express it publicly.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's horrible.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man. They got to get rid of him. All right. Twenty minutes after the hour. Do you have anything else, Warner?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, real quick. Tiger Woods and Justin Rose share the lead of that FedEx cup playoff. Roy McElroy is three back.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. Coming up on 21 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Juan Williams, Vince Gill, Neil Cavuto, Bill Clinton, and Tony Robbins are all coming up. Bernie's got a briefing too. What's there, B?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That's a more fiery Obama versus Romney. Jimmy Fallon bust on the President. And Tim Tebow tells the world what kind of woman he wants.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right, baby. What kind of woman do you want? So, Dwight Yoakam's new album is called \"Three Pears.\" There's not a bad cut on it. It's the number-two country album on I-tunes. Dwight Yoakam, number two, come on here. It's a great record.

You ought to take some aspirin. I mean, you do that, by the way.</p><p/><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: What should the answer be?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Nothing. It's just venting. It doesn't require an answer, doesn't require a suggestion.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It doesn't require a comment. Shut up.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Here's the problem.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: If we don't say anything, any of us, what happens, Tony?</p><p/><p>TONY POWELL, COMEDIAN: Don't you bastards care I'm starving?</p><p/><p>IMUS: No, that's not true.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Twenty nine after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.

And here with that is Bernard McGuirk, good morning, B.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, chief. And President Obama sat down with this Univision people yesterday, the Spanish language TV station, and if he thought he was going to get questions like what's your favorite salsa music, or do you like J-Lo or stuff like that, he was in for a big surprise.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh-oh.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: The dude hit him hard, this Jorge Ramos. He was like the Spanish inquisition.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He's a good reporter.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Very good reporter.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, he is.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, it was like the Spanish inquisition. For a little while, anyway, he asked him about changing things in government. And he gave a bad answer. And then Mitt Romney jumped on it, as Connell alluded to earlier. Here's Obama first and then Mitt Romney right afterwards.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: I've learned some lessons over the last four years. And the most important lesson I've learned is that you can't change Washington from the inside. You can only change it from the outside. That's how I got elected. And that's how the big accomplishments like health care got done.</p><p/><p>FMR. GOV. MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The President today threw in the white flag of surrender again.

He's going outside.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: About as animated and funny as Mitt Romney will get, but it wasn't that bad.

Tim Tebow, he's on the cover of \"Vogue\" magazine, he's on the cover of \"The New York Post\" this morning.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Putting his physique on display there. And I'm sure that's going to rile up all the Giants this morning.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: But of course, he's a devout Christian and he tells --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Praise God.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, exactly right. He tells \"Vogue\" magazine what he looks for in a woman. And here's his quote. I've been blessed to have an amazing mom and two amazing sisters, so they set a very high standard. I'll stop right there. What I think of -- when I think of a woman, I don't think of my mom and -- God bless them. God rest them, I should say. But anyway, he goes on and that's what makes him a good guy apparently, obviously.</p><p/><p>Obviously looks play a big part. Looks play a big part. Being attracted to someone plays a big part but there is also much more than that. To me, it is about finding someone who is sweet and kind and that has a servant's heart. It's about finding a girl who likes me for me. And not because of what I do or who I am or the name.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, tasty rat covering that servant's heart.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yep.

Now that Apple's iPhone 5 is available, we're finding out what exactly makes the smart phone work. The repair firm I-fix got its hands on one and pried it open to find the device uses chips from Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solutions. The iPhone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus, Logic and its Gyroscope which is used to track its orientation was made by STmicroelectronics. So, keep an eye on stocks of those companies and those who didn't make the iPhone 5 to see their reaction today.</p><p/><p>Shares of Oracle were up slightly in extended trading after first quarter results revealed while the company's traditional software business improved, hardware system sales continue to be a problem. Oracle's earnings were up 11 percent from a year ago to 53 cents a share. In line with estimates, revenue of $8.2 billion fell short of the $8.42 billion estimate.

We've got low pressure still rotating up around the Great Lakes but it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwestern states, the Northern Plains States all the way down to the Central Mississippi valley area. And then back up towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east. Also a few showers are popping up down around Florida.</p><p/><p>Again, southeast slightly risky in terms of showers and storms. Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms, high temp today, 88 degrees. Phoenix, no rain for you. Sunny skies with a high of 103. Seattle partly cloudy skies with a high of 63.

I thought I gave it to Carley, but it could be anywhere.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program --</p><p/><p>RUFINO: I'm still getting him.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, you're still getting him.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Yes -- that little phony shoe thing.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Vince Gill is coming up this morning, talk to him about some stuff, the state of country music and the state of Vince Gill.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And then Neil Cavuto, he's going to be in. We'll talk to him about the state of the country, the economy and all that.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes, there's big Romney interview.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, FOX Newscontributor Juan Williams. Good morning, Mr. Williams.</p><p/><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWSCONTRIBUTOR (on the phone): Good morning, Mr. Imus. I was worried for a second you forgot about me. You didn't know my name? What is this? What's going on over there?</p><p/><p>IMUS: I'm thinking about two or three different things.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: You know, what? You're thinking about beautiful women or something. I guess that's on your mind all the time.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Trying to find my phone.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: (LAUGHING)</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know what I'm reading, which is terrific is O'Reilly's \"Killing Kennedy.\"</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Did you read \"Killing Lincoln\"?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I did.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I liked it. You know, he gave me a copy early on, and I gave one to my son because I liked it so much. And I told him, you know, he can be reluctant even to accept praise, but yes, I thought it was pretty good.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. I wasn't a big fan of that. I didn't read it all because \"Killing Kennedy,\" you know, I was talking about it -- do you mind talking about this or no?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: No. Why would I mind talking about it?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, I don't know. The difference is between, say, Walter Isaacson, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Doug Brinkley, and those people. They tell you about, you know, in the story they tell you about the Cuban missile crisis. So, they write about Khrushchev, O'Reilly does. And he describes him as 5'3,\" about 200 pounds, got a big old mole, gap in his teeth, murdering little bastard. But if it is Doris and all those other people, you've got 43 pages about where he grew up, his sister, his brother, his parent, I mean, stuff that maybe I want to know. But here's -- do you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin of Jack Kennedy?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I think he was the lone assassin if you're asking who pulled the trigger, yes, I do. If you're asking were there other people involved who may have been backing Oswald, funding Oswald, you know, did Jack Ruby have any role to play there, I'm very suspicious of that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, here's what they're trying to do in the book which doesn't annoy me, but is they're trying to set Oswald up -- he describes on page 15, does O'Reilly, Oswald as a crack shot. Well, I was in the Marine Corps at the same time Oswald was.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Sure.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I was in from '57 to '59 on a two-year reserve program. Two years active duty and then reserve. He was in from '56 to '59. So, I qualified for the rifle -- in the same program as he did. And I barely qualified as a marksman. Then, there are three categories, marksman, sharpshooter and expert. So, O'Reilly describes Oswald as a sharpshooter. But in May of 1956, he qualified, did Oswald, barely two points into being designated a sharpshooter. In other words, two fewer points and he would have been a marksman, the lowest category. And then -- pardon me?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Hang on. Hang on. But wait a minute. The idea is he was a trained shooter, Imus.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I mean, so, OK, you can get into your gradations of how skilled he was. But I think Bill's point was this guy didn't just pick up a gun and he was, you know, some schlock who was trying out. I mean, he had been trained in how to fire and he had been qualified, I think that makes some compared to me for example who's never fired a gun.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. But don't sell him to me as a crack shot, which he was not. Because when he tried to assassinate General Walker, he missed him. He was 40 feet from him.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I love your point.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And then he qualified again in 1959 just before he got out. And he qualified barely with a score of 191 as a marksman, the lowest designation. Two fewer points and he would not have qualified. So my only point is yes, he could shoot a rifle better than some bozo on the street. But don't try to sell him to me as being this expert crack shot, because he wasn't. So, that's it.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Right. You may know too much on this count. But anyway, your point is well taken. Especially -- but I think that the larger point is to the reader that this is a guy who was trained in how to shoot.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: And as you point out, not only qualified once but qualified twice is the other way to interpret the exact same events that you just said make you doubt, you know, how good -- he was.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Only an idiot like me would get bogged down in the minutia of that. All right. About the president, about Romney. Let me see if you're guy --</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Do you really want to talk about that? Doesn't sound like it?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, talk about what?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: American presidential politics.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, I don't mind.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I know Romney is not doing so well and I figured you're going to be depressed and upset about it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I don't care. My job is to monitor the freak parade. And he's in it. Anyway, now has the President and the Secretary of State and the national security advisor and these other people, Susan Rice and the rest of them, have they decided now what the attack in Libya was? They first tried to sell it that it was the result of this YouTube movie, which every fool on the planet knew that wasn't the case, particularly falling on September 11. And now when the president is reluctant to use the word \"terrorist,\" I don't know if I've ever heard him utter that word, now they're acknowledging that it was a terrorist attack. So my question for you is, were they initially lying, one? Or did they not know, two? Or, three, were they just assuming or guessing? Or, four, were they waiting until they got more information and thought they would throw up a smoke screen to try to hoodwink us?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think that there was a strong sense that this was terrorism. But again, you know, they don't have a sense of Libya and I think the intelligence background necessary to lay things out. But if you're asking about whether or not they were reluctant to call terrorism what it is, I don't think there is any question. This has been a problem throughout the administration. You know, they talk about manmade disasters instead of terrorism.</p><p/><p>I mean, but that has to do with a mind-set that, you know, again, caution about attacking people, especially Muslims and reluctance to embrace the idea that it's terrorism because somehow that would take us back to the Bush years of the war on terror and they don't want to do that. But that has been the mind-set with this folks from the start, I-man.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. Who's the National Security advisor?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: At the moment.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, no. In October of 1922. Yes, at the moment, Juan.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know, it's Keith Alexander. Isn't that right, Bernie?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That is correct.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. So, neither Bernie nor I had any idea who it was.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Right. Well, I couldn't call the name. You got me.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, wouldn't you think we could do better than that dope empty suit Romney or your guy?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: You mean as Americans?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Somebody to run this country?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. That's what I meant, as Americans. Well, you know, what? We've got political structure. And, you know, this is who's been nominated. And gosh, you know, if you look on the republican side, they went through a lot of people to get here, and this was the decision made. Well, I tell you, you know, yesterday's comment by Ann Romney, you know, stop questioning my husband. Stop the doubts. If you think you can do better, get in the ring, I thought some level of frustration over on that side.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Are you a Christian?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I am.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Are you ready to deal with Jesus maybe having a wife?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: You know, I never had any trouble with it. In fact, you know, there's all these questions about whether or not, in the last supper, that drawing, you know, if that is a woman next to him. It seems to me inevitable. I mean, all the talk about not just Mary Magdalene, but I mean, you know, people that were described as prostitutes and outcasts and the like, I think he was, you know, fully human. Let me just say that, in human form. And I just think that part of being human is your sexuality.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I got punked by Jesus the other day.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Now this is interesting. What happened to you?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, I tore my rotator cuff and then suddenly it stopped hurting. And I thought thank you, God! Jesus! And then it started hurting again.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Oh no.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So I got punked by Jesus.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Well, you know, you think you had some good times there for a minute. I mean, thank God you got some relief.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes. Well, now I'm OK, so.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, well, I'm glad to hear that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Behave yourself, Mr. Williams. I always love having you on.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: I appreciate it. I appreciate it. And I'm going to just burn Tom Donilon's name into my head again. You know what I mean, I don't know why I forgot that name.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: He is the national security advisor to the President. The director of the agency is the guy named General Keith Alexander.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: The NSA, right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Thanks, you guys. Eleven until the hour.</p><p/><p>ANNOUNCER: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. And it's time to check the markets.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning everyone. Apple fans around the world are lining up to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves today, including here in New York City where our own Robert Gray is standing by at Apple's Fifth Avenue store. Robert, describe the scene for us.</p><p/><p>ROBERT GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well Diane, you've got several hundred people lined up outside of the Apple store, normally they're open 24 hours a day seven days a week. They closed it last night just for the event, opens at 8:00 a.m.</p><p/><p>And Jared here is kind enough to join us and tell us why you've been in line here all night long here just waiting to get in to buy the iPhone instead of going this afternoon.</p><p/><p>JARED, APPLE CUSTOMER: I mean, it's about being here for the opening. You know it's about -- I made a couple friends in line. It's about being like the best Apple store in the country, you know.</p><p/><p>It's a fun experience. It's a fun event. Everybody is having a good time. The line is starting to move so we're starting to get kind of excited.</p><p/><p>GRAY: Yes you've got about an hour to go now. You've got your Willie Wonka golden ticket here. Are you pretty happy about that? And also you have to wait until 8 a.m. Local time. You just moved here from Tucson. Are you already ribbing your friends back home that you're going to have yours first?</p><p/><p>JARED: Yes I did. I posted it on Facebook I've been kind of poking at them. I have a few friends that are like really Apple fanatics. And it's kind of a -- its kind of a fun jest. So I'm getting them back you know.</p><p/><p>GRAY: Is there any one particular thing about the iPhone 5 that is drawing you to it aside from the fact that it's just the newest, the latest and greatest?</p><p/><p>JARED: I really like what they've done from the body. The aluminum - - the aluminum body looks really sleek, it's going to be really nice. And the wider screen is -- you can't go wrong.</p><p/><p>GRAY: And what about the connector? We've heard a lot of flap about this the new connector. You're going to have to get all new devices and you know the peripherals to go with it, like alarm clock, et cetera. Is that a problem for you?</p><p/><p>JARED: It's not a problem. I mean, you know people try to jab where they can jab. But it's going to be great. I mean, iPhone, the connector has always been proprietary. It just they're better, they're making it better. They're improving. When technology moves, you've got to move with it. And that's just --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>GRAY: All right.</p><p/><p>JARED: -- that's what you do.</p><p/><p>GRAY: All right, Jared we've got to move too. Diane so yes we'll be following all day for you there. The line is starting to move. Several hundred of folks as I mentioned lined up out here to pay anywhere from $200 up for the new iPhone. Back to you.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Robert Gray making friends at the Apple store.

James the Greek government officials are holding another round of negotiations with creditors in hopes of agreeing to almost 12 billion euros worth of cutbacks. How do you expect this to play out?</p><p/><p>JAMES HUGHES, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, ALPARI: I mean, I think we expect it to play out the same way that we've seen it's done in the past. I mean there's been a lot of negativity around what (inaudible). Greece trying to renegotiate these plans and the issue we've had is that they -- that they have an initial plan, initial measures we're put in place that Greece had to -- had to hit but the goal post has been moved so many times now. There always seems to be another renegotiation of -- of austerity or cuts.</p><p/><p>And I mean we're hopeful of course that Greece is going to agree to something. And -- but I think whether they agree or not is not the key point. It's whether they stick to it which is the key point. And that's been an issue for this for a long time now.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right that's James Hughes from Alpari in London. Thanks so much James.</p><p/><p>HUGHES: All right.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Universal Music Group has won approval from EU antitrust regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion after the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record labels.

And they could sell as many as -- as many as 10 million of these by the end of this month alone.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Ok we'll it's a very fine report. Thank you for that important information, Robert.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: What a loser parade.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Those idiots have been camped out there for five nights --</p><p/><p>GRAY: Some of these guys have been out here all week.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Morons.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Big Foot.</p><p/><p>TOM BOWMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Yes sir.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Have you lost your mind?</p><p/><p>BOWMAN: What are you kidding? This is a great story today.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But --</p><p/><p>BOWMAN: And you personalized it as always.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do we have a unique situation here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: We have wall-wall-commercials which is how we keep doing this, which I'm happy that we do have.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So we don't have an inordinate amount of time for Warner to go on and on about Yogi Berra or somebody or Miller Huggins or -- and you know I like Robert Gray. But you go to Robert Gray with no information. Well, I'm standing outside the store. Here we've got a few hundred people. Ok good, great.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Robert Gray all the way.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Miller Huggins is waiting --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>IMUS: I like Robert Gray. He is a terrific reporter. He's got a nice sense of humor. But he gave us zero information. We know --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: That isn't fair.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Come on he talked about how many iPhones might be sold and that kind of thing.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes why -- why would these idiots camp out and not wait five, ten days and buy it in the store days later on?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Who knows?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Exactly.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well maybe he knows.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do you know why they do it Robert?</p><p/><p>GRAY: Yes I do we've talked to several of these folks I-Man and some of these guys are big tech fans. And they wanted to be a part of the experience here and the first to have it. We just talked to a guy from Tucson. He wants to have it before his buddies. He's posting it on Facebook. He's going to have the newest, latest and greatest.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: There you go.</p><p/><p>GRAY: And these guys like to have the faster processor, bigger screen. Some of the other phones have already had that for six to nine months so the iPhone is playing catch-up here.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right, there you go.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Robert Gray, the Fox Business Network. Live outside the 59th and Fifth at the Apple store.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Good report dude.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well done Robert.</p><p/><p>IMUS: 12 minutes after the hour. Please stop calling people dude, Imus. It's 12 after the hour. Let's do a little new, more news. And here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning Connell.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: All right, good morning I-Man. Well, the campaign moves to Nevada today where Mitt Romney will be campaigning, in Virginia where President Obama will be holding a rally.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You shut up.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Here are some numbers that are in, Obama leads the \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC News swing state poll. He's up eight in Iowa, five in Wisconsin and Colorado. The Gallup Daily tracking poll though, dead heat, 47 percent a piece around the country for Mitt Romney and President Obama.</p><p/><p>There are protests today taking place in Pakistan. In fact they've -- they've named it a national day of protests there over this anti-Muslim movie that was produced here in the United States. And the government in Pakistan actually disabling cell phone service, some of their major cities are trying to prevent phones from being used in detonating bombs.</p><p/><p>And then in Syria, President Bashar Assad talking tough, an Egyptian magazine reporting that Assad predicts the defeat of the armed opposition that foreign intervention like the one in Libya will not be repeated there, he said. This, as at least 30 are reported dead in the northern part of the country. Government airstrikes reportedly hit a gas station and caused a huge explosion in Syria.</p><p/><p>Then the surge is over in Afghanistan. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says the 33,000 additional troops that were sent a couple of years ago to Afghanistan have now pulled out of the country. He calls it a very important milestone, says the surge accomplished its goals in Afghanistan.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Really.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: And one other thing for you, I-Man. The Emmys this Sunday but Kelsey Grammar not a nominee. Critics and fans of Grammar's stars show \"Boss\" have agreed that he was snubbed when these Emmy nominations were announced. He recently suggested that his conservative political leanings were the reason.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>KELSEY GRAMMER, ACTOR: I did speculate about the fact that maybe I'm a pretty well outed conservative in Hollywood and maybe there's some energy there. But you know I've since come to think that it hasn't gotten out there enough. I don't know.</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: There you go. Well, Kelsey Grammer thinks he was snubbed there I-Man for the Emmys. And those are your --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: No justice, no peace.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: -- exactly, right, your headlines this morning.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right, hey, Big Foot, load up Tony Robbins and Lady Gaga, ok?</p><p/><p>BOWMAN: Yes sir.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Let's do a business report now at 14 after the hour. And here with that, just ahead of Vince Gill and Bernie with a briefing and Warner with sports is Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.</p><p/><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p/><p>Did you know that the new iPhone 5 goes on sale this morning at 8 a.m.? Maybe we could take a live look at the Apple store here in midtown Manhattan for the lines of people.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Don't be mean.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: All those -- you know why those doofuses line up? Because they've got no woman at home and they've got to be one of the first of their friends to get the new iPhone 5.</p><p/><p>IMUS: They either don't have a woman at home or they've got a woman at home like you.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Or the only woman at home is their mom.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh, the I-Man.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: You know what; no truer thing has ever been said.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: I'll wait on this line for four days to get away from her.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Let's go here.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Is that Jonas?</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Well, it's going to set records.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Ok. That big race in New Hampshire, Nascar this weekend? All right, second race with the chase or whatever</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: I do have something though. The iPhone sells like it does because Blackberry stinks to high heaven. And Blackberry service is actually out today in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. So there is justice in this world.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. A quarter after the hour. Let's do some sports. No, first let's go to Tony Robbins who has some thoughts about Lady Gaga. Good morning, Mr. Robbins.</p><p/><p>POWELL: Good morning, Imus. Lady Gaga is having a physical crisis. She recently put on a couple of pounds. Who am I kidding? I saw her in concert with that big hat and those big glasses. I thought she was Cee Lo Green. She's gone from doing well-choreographed routines to the electric slide. Apparently it's not as taxing.</p><p/><p>Gaga claims that she gained weight eating delicious food at her father's Italian restaurant in Manhattan. That's a relief. I'm glad she wasn't eating her dresses. A bacon muumuu has got to be like what -- 50,000 calories. Eating her clothes would certainly qualify as an unhealthy relationship with food.</p><p/><p>Gaga lives, breathes, sleeps and eats music. She's passionate about music and obviously. I told her to combine her loves. She took my advice and started writing her sheet music on sheet cakes. Share your music with the world but share your cakes with friends. That's the out of the box statement that's made her a superstar.</p><p/><p>Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible. Lady Gaga's goals to go from being an unknown artist to being well, the biggest thing in music. I'd say we've got that covered.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Tony Robbins here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p/><p>All right. Let's do sports at 16 minutes after the hour. Just ahead of Vince Gill later on this morning and Neil Cavuto.</p><p/><p>Sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Here with sports, best sportscaster in the country, Warner Wolf. Good morning Warner.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Thank you very much. Good morning I-Man. Thursday night football in Charlotte. The Giants beat the Panthers, 36-7. It was the story of the backups. Running back Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw -- 113 yards, 20 carries, 2 touchdowns; and wide receiver Ramses Barden playing in place of Hakeem Nicks, 9 receptions for 138 yards. Eli, 288 yards, 1 touchdown, no interceptions; Lawrence Tynes kicks 5 field goals.</p><p/><p>Cam Newton trailing 23-0 in the third quarter and obviously thinking a touchdown was worth 23 points, scored on a 1-yard touchdown and then went into his superman celebration. Come on, Cam.</p><p/><p>Baseball: Yankees beat the Jays --</p><p/><p>IMUS: I tell Wyatt that all the time. You put up an 8 in roping, don't throw your hat.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Act like you've been there before.</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's right. That's what Tom Landry said, right.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: What an idiot.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What a dope.</p><p/><p>RUFINO: Oh God.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yanks sweep the Jays. Ichiro, a home run, a double, he's 9 for his last 12.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That guy is great.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Oh man. He's on fire.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And apparently New York is -- well, come on dude.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, they lead by one. Both have 13 to play.</p><p/><p>And before a bogus announced crowd of 20,000 at City Field, the Phillies scored 8 in the first, 9 -- 7 in the 9th and beat the Mets 16-1. The Mets are only 4 in 25 at home since the all-star break.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Wow.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Boise state beat BYU, 7-6. BYU scored a touchdown, three and a half minutes left, went for the 2-point conversion and missed.</p><p/><p>Wait a minute. Stop the music.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Finally there may be a long-awaited Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao fight.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Wow.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Pacquiao who, by the way, has to fight Juan Manuel Marquez for the fourth time --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, fourth time.</p><p/><p>WOLF: -- has agreed, number one, to give Mayweather --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Want to have more time -- they're ruining marriages .</p><p/><p>WOLF: He's agreed to give Mayweather a 55-45 split, Mayweather getting the 55 rather than the 50-50.</p><p/><p>Number two, Pacquiao says he will agree to Mayweather's demand that he take the Olympic-style drug test which includes the blood test.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. Yes, sure.</p><p/><p>WOLF: The only drawback is when the fight occurs Mayweather will be 36 and Pacquiao 34.</p><p/><p>In golf, you have the top 30 golfers in the world at that FedEx Cup playoff. Tiger Woods and Justin Rose share the lead, 4 under 66.</p><p/><p>And finally, I-Man, our old friend Jerry Jones agrees with Buccaneers coach Greg Schiano that it's ok for a team to go for the ball when the other team is kneeling down to run out the clock. Jones says the kneel- down is a wasted play, should be outlawed. And if a team doesn't run a play, they should be penalized.</p><p/><p>IMUS: We're trying to win. When we're out there on the field, out there -- we're trying to win. And we're the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p/><p>We didn't win in Seattle, and that sucked. So I went to the (inaudible) bar. What are you going to do?</p><p/><p>It's 20 minutes after the hour. Thank you very much, Warner. There's a briefing coming up. What's there, B?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: President Obama grilled by this Spanish language TV station host.</p><p/><p>And another secret Paris Hilton tape revealed. We have the tape.</p><p/><p>IMUS: One of the great songs Vince Gill ever wrote or recorded. It was a huge hit for the boy. It was a huge hit -- \"Pocket Full of Gold\", about a guy, he's married and goes in the bar somewhere and he takes that ring off his finger.</p><p/><p>I do that when I go to the titty bar. I have a pocket full of gold.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>And General Motors is recalling more than 426,000 ChevroletPontiac and Saturn sedans in the U.S. due to a transmission problem. The recall affects vehicles from model years 2007 to 2010. The auto maker says the transmission gear position may not match the gear on the shift gear and that causes vehicles to move when drivers think they're in park. GM says it's aware of four crashes due to the problem, but no injuries reported so far.</p><p/><p>Here's a look at futures now, we are seeing them up across the board; Dow futures up by 38, the S&amp;P is up by 3 and the Nasdaq is up about 6. Commodities are also to the upside.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Jesus had a ball and chain. Jesus had a ball and chain. You know, they found this.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: This historian of early Christianity up there at Harvard Divinity School, the girl found a scrap of march weed or whatever the hell it was papyrus -- is that what we call it?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Written in the fourth century containing the phrase that we've never seen in any piece of scripture and it's Jesus, and he said unto them, \"My wife\".</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Whoa.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What up, girl?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Wow.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Anyway, so that that. And man -- what's that, godfather?</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: I need the Christ to come on over for coffee tonight.</p><p/><p>POWELL: I wonder whose name she called out when they were making love.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: No, no.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Anyway.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. 28 after the hour; we'll talk to Vince Gill in a couple of minutes.</p><p/><p>First, this Bernie Briefing is sponsored by Ramsey Fiat, Route 17, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Go to RamseyFiat.com. Here's Bernard McGuirk. What up, B.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well, President Obama, boss, candidate Barack Obama back in 2008 promised in no uncertain terms that he would pass a comprehensive immigration reform. He had a Democratic Congress for two years. In any case he's on Univision yesterday and host, Jorge Ramos, again, the Spanish inquisition. He hammered the President on this and listen to the President's answer.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>JORGE RAMOS, HOST, UNIVISION: A promise is a promise. And with all due respect you didn't keep that promise.</p><p/><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Here is what I would say Jorge, is that we've had this conversation before. There's a thinking that the President is somebody who is all powerful and can get everything done. In our branch-- in our system of government, I am the head of the executive branch. I'm not the head of the legislature. I'm not the head of the judiciary. We have to have cooperation from all these sources in order to get something done. And so, I am happy to take responsibility for the fact that we didn't get it done, but I didn't make a promise that I would get everything done 100 percent when I was elected as president.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Of course not.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, we can. No, we can't.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Come on here.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Anyway, there's another secret tape scandal out here boss. This time -- first it was Mitt Romney. Now it's your girl, Paris Hilton.</p><p/><p>IMUS: My girl?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: everybody's girl, come on.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Ok.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: You know you love that tape, the first one she was in. Now, she was in a taxi back during fashion week here in Manhattan and this cab driver actually taped her and her gay friend -- the gay friend was telling her about a guy he know who has AIDS and has unprotected sex, this, that and the other. And she said some stuff that's getting her into a little bit of trouble. Take a listen to it.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): You know if you want to (EXPLETIVE DELETED) and you might be able to like just stick you (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>PARIS HILTON (voice-over): Eww.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>HILTON: Eww. You guys are the horniest people in the world.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>HILTON: Eww. They're disgustingly (INAUDIBLE) (EXPLETIVE DELETED).</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like, listen, my (EXPLETIVE DELETED).</p><p/><p>HILTON: Eww. (INAUDIBLE) AIDS.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>HILTON: I would be so scared about (INAUDIBLE). You know like (INAUDIBLE). Eww.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. What is she saying, Berne?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: She said gay guys are the horniest people in the world. They're disgusting. Dude, most of them probably have AIDS.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: She said in the taxi that --</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's not good.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Some dude was, you know, Mohammad there was rolling on while she had the conversation.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Just don't be hating on everybody, baby. All right.</p><p/><p>Anything else, Bernie?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: No, I'm done.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's 30 minutes past the hour.</p><p/><p>I was talking to Kinky Friedman yesterday. Kinky refuses to use a computer. Won't text. Won't e-mail. So there's no way to stay in touch with him. I mean, you can call him. But we were talking about Dwight Yoakam's new record. So, I said, have you heard \"Waterfall\"? And Kinky said, I love it to death. It's just -- all right.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network. And now here's Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p/><p>KB Home is reporting a surprise profit after two quarters of losses as home prices recovered. The fifth largest home builder says it made 4 cents a share in its third quarter. The company was expected to lose 16 cents a share, but revenue came in a little light at $424.5 million. The estimate was for $430 million. KB Home says potential future housing revenue rose to a four year high and home deliveries climbed 7 percent from last year to more than 1,700. Shares are higher in the pre-market.</p><p/><p>More companies, meanwhile, are rewarding their shareholders with higher quarterly dividends. McDonald's is hiking its quarterly payout by 10 percent to 77 cents a share. Texas Instruments is boosting its dividend by 24 percent to 21 cents a share. And Covidien is increasing its quarterly dividend by 16 percent to 26 cents a share.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right after we check the weather now with Fox 5 meteorologist Mike Woods.</p><p/><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, everyone.</p><p/><p>Looks like we have some wet weather out there, but not a ton of it for the country here. We've got an area of low pressure still rotating up around the Great Lakes but it's bringing showers from the upper Midwestern states, the northern plains states, all the way down into the central Mississippi Valley area and then back up toward the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east.</p><p/><p>Also a few showers are popping up down around Florida. Again, the southeast slightly risky in terms of showers and storms. Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms. High temp today 88 degrees. Phoenix, no rain for you. Sunny skies with the high of 103. Seattle, partly cloudy skies with a high of 63. Sacramento, California, you've got sunny skies there today with a high of 91. Still warm.</p><p/><p>I'm Mike Woods from Fox 5 in New York.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's 22 minutes till the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p/><p>Please welcome to the program, I don't want to embarrass him, but one of the great country singers of all time, songwriters, Vince Gill.</p><p/><p>Good morning, Mr. Gill.</p><p/><p>GILL: How you doing, Donny?</p><p/><p>IMUS: I'm fine. How are you?</p><p/><p>GILL: I'm good. Good to see you.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Fine. Fine. Nice to see you. Thanks for coming in.</p><p/><p>GILL: You bet.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So I was talking this morning, not to patronize you, which I wouldn't do, I said there's a few people who sing who I'd have come in just to talk. You're one of them.</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, thanks.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do you like Dwight Yoakam?</p><p/><p>GILL: I do. I always have. He's a good guy.</p><p/><p>IMUS: A smart guy, too.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes. Smart as a whip.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Crazy. Crazy.</p><p/><p>GILL: He's a little bit crazy, but most talented people are just one tick shy of nuts.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, but good crazy.</p><p/><p>GILL: It's a good crazy.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Kinky Friedman, Delbert McClinton.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And -- but like Montgomery Gentry, I love them, but -- man, they can't put two words together.</p><p/><p>GILL: I wouldn't know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know what I've learned --</p><p/><p>GILL: It's a political year. No comment.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, here's the -- I'm the worst kind of country disc jockey. Really that's what I am at heart.</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, you're one of the last people on earth that love music.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: That's why I love coming seeing you. You know, when I got a new record or something's exciting going on, because I know you'll get it and I know you'll, you know, you'll enjoy it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I just got Dwight's new -- do you care if we talk about other artists?</p><p/><p>GILL: No, I don't.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I just got his new record. It is fabulous.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes, I've heard. I haven't heard it yet, but I've heard people raving about it. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Got a song called \"Waterfall\" that's --</p><p/><p>GILL: I heard a little bit of that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's clever, isn't it?</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So -- and -- because Dwight, he's a man who, when he went out with Sharon Stone, you know, she described him as a dirt sandwich.</p><p/><p>GILL: About as much fun as a dirt sandwich.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Hey, have you ever heard of the Christian rock group Striker.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes, I have.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. This is a tedious story. Maybe it's not tedious. But when my brother, God bless him, and -- was working with the railroad as a breakman, his partner was Phil Sweet.</p><p/><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And Fred and Phil wrote a song called \"I Don't Want To Have To Marry You\" when they were working for the railroad.</p><p/><p>GILL: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And they eventually got it cut. And it went to number one and all that stuff. And Phil married a woman named Janice. And he's a great guy. They live in Las Vegas. And they had two sons, Michael and Robert, and they are Striker.</p><p/><p>GILL: Oh, I didn't know that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: That's neat.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And Christian rock, they are.</p><p/><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And then Michael spent the last -- the past two summers going out singing lead for Boston. It's a small world, isn't it?</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes, it is. You know, ever since I married Amy, everybody thinks I know everything about Christian music, but I don't. I wish I did.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, Amy Grant won a -- won the -- everybody in the country had a crush on her when she was --</p><p/><p>GILL: Oh, yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I remember all -- I remember all these disc jockeys over at NBC years ago. I met Frank Reed -- I don't know if you remember his name or not -- he used to tell me -- he said, have you heard Amy Grant? And I said, no. He said, oh, man, come on here.</p><p/><p>So, what's new with you?</p><p/><p>GILL: Not much. After I married Amy, I used to have to fight my way out of the bars. Now I have to fight my way out of the churches being married to her.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Hey, you built a studio at home.</p><p/><p>GILL: I did. Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right. Isn't a studio now just pretty much your laptop or no?</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, pretty much. I mean it can be. But I went a little further than that. Not as big as a commercial studio, but enough to track. And it's really fun because we all kind of gather around in a room and play music together instead of sequester each other off in a booth somewhere where you can't see each other and we're all just playing together. And it's been the greatest experience, this new record, the \"Time Jumpers\" record, that -- I started playing with this band about two and a half years ago. And they're a western swing band.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: Me being from Oklahoma, I was crazy -- I've always been crazy for Bob Wills music and that swing stuff and they would ask me to come in and occasionally sit in and fill in and, you know, if a guitar player couldn't make it, they'd call me up and sub. And little by little they grew confidence in me and said, hey, you want to be in the band. A couple guys quit. And I said, sure. It would be fun. So I talked them into making a record at the house and we decided to put it out. I said, man, we could make a record for nothing. It would be a blast. And so away we went.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Talking with Vince Gill here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p/><p>Weren't you originally in Pure Prairie League?</p><p/><p>GILL: A long time ago. Yes, 33 years ago.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And before that?</p><p/><p>GILL: I played with a guy named Byron Berline. A really great fiddle player. Lived in Los Angeles. Was a session player. Played on Rolling Stones' records and Birds records and all kind of great rock records and was the go-to guy for fiddle out on the West Coast forever and ever and ever. And he had an opening and I was 18 or 19. We moved out there as a kid and started out there.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You just played guitar for a long time, right?</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes. Still do.</p><p/><p>IMUS: No, I know you do. But, I mean, I guess you knew you could sing, but nobody else did or did they?</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, a lot of times those gigs I would get would be because I could sing, too, you know, and in those days if you could find somebody that could multi-task, I guess would be a good word for it, and do a bunch of different stuff, you were a better asset to a band. And so I was always able to play a little bit of everything and could fill in whatever was needed.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What's the state of country music in your view?</p><p/><p>GILL: It's interesting.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You like it or no?</p><p/><p>GILL: I'm not crazy about it. But I'm not supposed to. I'm 55 years old and I'm supposed to like, what, you know, my era did and the era before me. I don't -- I don't dislike it, I just don't necessarily believe that it's -- it's -- the term country music fits it so much.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p/><p>GILL: But, you know, they're young kids and they're following their muse, they're do what they love and I've got no -- I've got no bitterness towards them at all.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, I'm 72 and I be loving that \"Pontoon\" record by Little Big Town.</p><p/><p>GILL: Oh, isn't that cool?</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's a good record, man.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I like Jason Aldean. Come on.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes, he's fun.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: You know, they're rocking, they're -- you know, they're kind of -- they're pretty -- pretty brash. They're, you know, party time and all that stuff. That's just, you know, it's not for me. It's not that I don't like it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Jamey Johnson, of course, he's --</p><p/><p>GILL: Great songwriter.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Speaking about being out where the buses don't run. So -- but he's great, isn't he?</p><p/><p>GILL: He is.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p/><p>GILL: He's a great throwback, you know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: How do you really think is great?</p><p/><p>GILL: Oh, well, I like -- I -- actually, there's a lot of people I love. I think Carrie Underwood sings her brains out.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes. She's a great singer.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I just can't take that screaming.</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, she does -- she will sing hard, but that's -- you've got understand, that's what people are -- that's what they're learning. That's what they're singing.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: From \"Star Search\" and \"American Idol.\" All these shows. It's like grandiose and the big finish and, you know, it's --</p><p/><p>IMUS: I listened to something the other day that -- a duet you did with her. It's good.</p><p/><p>GILL: Oh, the \"How Great Thou Art\" thing?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: That was nice.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Are you really religious? I mean --</p><p/><p>GILL: To some degree, I guess. Probably not to the level of probably what the expectation is of me because I'm married to Amy.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GILL: I feel like a novice, you know, because I haven't had a church life in my adult life. I did as a kid, but my adult life was never conducive to it, only because of my work. I was gone every weekend.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But you believe Jesus is the Son of God?</p><p/><p>GILL: I do.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. And like Mojo Nixon says about Elvis, Elvis is everywhere. And I believe Jesus is everywhere. I mean -- I also know, though, however, not that anybody asked me, but I respect all other religions as well. I --</p><p/><p>GILL: Me, too.</p><p/><p>IMUS: See, I don't think there's just one way to get there.</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, I've traveled the world enough to -- you know, it just seems -- it doesn't seem logical that other parts of the world would know this way. You know, maybe I'm wrong. I have been before.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And now are you prepared for this new information that Jesus may have had a wife.</p><p/><p>GILL: I heard. Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: My observation was, if -- wasn't it her job then to come up with a (INAUDIBLE) -- just idiotic.</p><p/><p>GILL: That explains the missing years.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know Billy Joe Shaver?</p><p/><p>GILL: A little bit, yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes. I think he's one of the great songwriters ever.</p><p/><p>GILL: I do too. Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But there's somebody who is certifiably -- but a sweet man. My (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes, that's my -- you know, that's really my era of the people I love were guys like him, Guy Clark, Jerry Jeff and Rodney Crowell and just those really great songwriters from the '60s and '70s, (INAUDIBLE) Van Zant and Emmy Lou was a great, great mentor to me, and teaching me what great songs were like and who great song writers were, so, yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Bill Anderson, one of the great songwriters ever.</p><p/><p>GILL: No question. Most recorded, probably, in the history of country music.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes. I love him.</p><p/><p>GILL: Even more so than Harlan or any of the others. So, I don't know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: God, wasn't he great, Harlan Howard. Oh, my God. Please.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes. We were good buddies. You know, when I first moved to Nashville, we were great friends and I would sing all of his demos for him, $10 a song.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p/><p>GILL: There was tons of demos of Harlan's and we were great friends.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Before he died, he sent me a CD that he cut of all of his songs.</p><p/><p>GILL: Wow.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That he had written. He just dubbed, you know, (INAUDIBLE). I mean, just everything that he did. And, oh, my God, what a great song.</p><p/><p>GILL: He's a great man. You know, when I was first getting started, he pulled me aside and he said, kid, you're one hell of a guitar player. And I said, well, thanks, Harlan. And he says, and you're a pretty good songwriter, but you're one hell of a guitar player, one hell of a singer, and a pretty good song writer. I said, I get what you're saying.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So you have a new record?</p><p/><p>GILL: Not me, the \"Time Jumpers.\"</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p/><p>GILL: This band does. It came out last week.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Maybe I could pay attention.</p><p/><p>GILL: No, that's cool. I mean it's a fun record. You would really love this record if you like Bill Wills and that swing music. It's an 11 piece bad full of arguably some of the best talent that's ever graced instruments in Nashville, Tennessee. All side me. All guys that played for other people. Session players, things like that. All wanted to have fun on Monday night. So we got together and -- years ago, they did, and started playing every Monday night just for the love of it and fun of it. And we still are. We just made a record.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I can take a little bit of Bob Wills, but it's my contention -- and I know I'm right -- that nobody likes blue grass music, including the people who play it.</p><p/><p>GILL: I think you might get a wrestling match over that one.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, I'm sure I will.</p><p/><p>It's great to see you.</p><p/><p>GILL: You too.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's an honor to have you on the program.</p><p/><p>GILL: Thanks.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're one of my favorites. You're one of everybody's favorites, so - -</p><p/><p>GILL: Well, right back at you.</p><p/><p>IMUS: My wife loves you and my 14-year-old kid loves you and a lot of people do.</p><p/><p>GILL: I appreciate it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: The great Vince Gill.</p><p/><p>You know I played that \"Go Rest High on the Mountains\" you wrote for your brother.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And I -- and thanks for the money you sent to the ranch when Fred died. But --</p><p/><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p/><p>IMUS: He's been dead a year. It's still hard to talk about him. I try --</p><p/><p>GILL: I know.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I played your record. I tried to talk about it and --</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes, my brother's been gone for 20 years. You know, hard to believe. But, you know, that's --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Why do we -- what is it? Is it -- why do we -- why does people dying have that effect on us? It's part of life.</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes. It's because you miss them.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Is it?</p><p/><p>GILL: Yes. I do.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, I guess that is. I mean we're not -- yes, I guess that's what it is.</p><p/><p>All right, man, it's great to see you.</p><p/><p>GILL: You too, buddy.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Vince Gill.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p/><p>We have an update on that Blackberry outage. Research In Motion says service has been restored and things are back to normal. The company had reported an outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p><p/><p>Checking the markets now. Stocks in Asia rose as the release of that new iPhone gave the telecom sector a boost. Hong Kong led the way with a 0.7 percent gain. In Europe, the Financial Times is reporting European Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank. Markets there are currently mixed. London still to the downside by about three points, but Paris is back in the green, up almost 10 points and Frankfurt's up by 51.</p><p/><p>Here in the U.S., we've had green arrows across the board all morning. Dow futures are up by 43, the S&amp;P's up by about four, and the Nasdaq's up by seven.</p><p/><p>So now that Apple's iPhone 5 is available, we're also finding out what exactly makes this smartphone work. The repair firm iFixit got its hands on one, pried it open and found that the device uses chips from Qualcomm, Avego Technologies and Skyworks Solutions. The phone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus Logic. And its gyroscope, which is used to track the orientation, was made by STMicroelectronics. You can keep an eye on stocks of those companies and those who didn't contribute to the iPhone 5 to see how they react today.</p><p/><p>Here's a look at commodities now. Oil and gold are to the upside. Oil's up by about 60 cents, around $93 a barrel. Gold's up $6 at $1,776 an ounce.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p/><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: IMUS IN THE MORNING continues here in the next hour with Neil Cavuto from the Fox Business Network. He had a recent interview with Mitt Romney here. So we'll talk to -- the I-man will talk to Neil about all that's going on in the world.</p><p/><p>And this portion of IMUS IN THE MORNING is brought to you by \"A Wanted Man\" by Lee Child, now available in hard cover and e-book from Delacorte. Now five minutes till the hour.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>IMUS: Here with -- with some thoughts on pot --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Is Brian Wilson, on the genius of the Beach Boys.</p><p/><p>Good morning, Mr. Wilson.</p><p/><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Good morning, Opie.</p><p/><p>I hear there's a movement to decriminalize marijuana, which is good, because pot never did anything criminal to anybody, just made them feel good. People say it's a gateway drug, which I guess it is. It's a gateway to a beautiful world of pretty flowers and beautiful music and little bunnies who sing pretty songs and give out candy.</p><p/><p>But it's not like you're going to smoke a doobie and next thing you know you're mainlining smack or anything. Of course it depends on how strong your dope is. Like I just got a lid of northern lights white widow wonder woman. You don't even have to smoke it. You just hold a butt in your hand for 10 minutes and once the oil gets into your pours, you're a bottle rocket, man. I think it also might have been sprayed with PCP and Easy Off, because after I did a half a bong's worth last night, a genie appeared and told me my oven was magically cleaned.</p><p/><p>But legalization would be good for the economy, not just for the tax they could collect on the (INAUDIBLE) itself, but for all the sales of paraphernalia. It'd create jobs making rolling papers, Zip-loc bags, Twinkies. If they had made weed legal, we could balance a budget by 4:20 the next afternoon.</p><p/><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: Nice.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: And I'll be sitting in my sandbox with my KCO keyboard writing a new song for the cute little bunny who gives out the candy.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. Apple fans around the world are lining up to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves around the world today here in New York City.</p><p/><p>The door should be opening sooner, and Robert Gray is standing by at Apple's fifth avenue store. Robert, what is it like out there?</p><p/><p>ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS: Well, Diane, I don't know if you can hear the cheers, they're audible behind me.</p><p/><p>Apple employees are outside, greeting the first of the 500 folks who have been camping out here.</p><p/><p>And the crowd has been swelling as the sun has being rising over Manhattan this morning, waiting to get in to buy the iPhone 5.</p><p/><p>The store behind me is not only open 24 hours, seven days a week, they did close it last night.</p><p/><p>Not opening until 8 a.m., that is the time that each Apple store in each time zone has been opening in local time.</p><p/><p>So, we've had folks here from Arizona, saying that they're facebooking and tweeting their friends back in Arizona.</p><p/><p>Boasting that they're going to get their hands on the iPhone before those guys can. And you can hear the crowd starting to cheer even more there, as I said, some 500 folks here.</p><p/><p>The new iPhone 5 -- sold out two million, pre-selling in an hour's time. It's expected to be the fastest and widest rollout yet for Apple, nine nations have the iPhone selling it.</p><p/><p>That's the most to participate in it and what we've seen and, analysts saying that they've stocked piled as many as 10 million units, that's about $6.4 billion worth of inventory by the way.</p><p/><p>And they're expected according to some analysts to sell as many as 10 million, Ben Stevens saying, they could sell 13 million before the end of this month.</p><p/><p>Now, the new phone does boosts faster, processing speed, it works on the 4 GLTE network where you can get that.</p><p/><p>It also -- it has an enhanced camera, the Siri voice command, it would give you turn-by-turn navigation, you can post to Facebook.</p><p/><p>You can also book reservations on open table but critics point to the mapping features saying that they're incomplete, there's been some errors there, and a lot of hoopla and negative flap about the connectors.</p><p/><p>Which have short meaning that all of those i-gadgets you have there, work with iPhones, you're going to have to go out and buy new ones, although there're some analysts who say we're moving to Bluetooth.</p><p/><p>Anyway, it may not be a big issue, down the line it will be though immediately and Diane, we should also point out a robust secondary market for iPhones.</p><p/><p>If you have an iPhone 4s, still under warranty, there are websites out there, vili.com is one and the CEO telling me, they've seen interest triple in the past week alone.</p><p/><p>You'll get about 260 bucks for your old iPhone 4s, that will about cover the fees, you don't have to pay AT&amp;T to upgrade.</p><p/><p>If you're going to buy one, you can get one, it'll cost you about 300 bucks, but that's still less than the new ones.</p><p/><p>Which started 199 with a two-year contract. Back to you.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Robert Gray outside the Apple store, thanks, Robert.</p><p/><p>GRAY: You're welcome.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: And as Apple focuses on the release of the iPhone 5, Research In Motion is focusing on a blackberry outage.</p><p/><p>The company now says service has been restored and things are back to normal after reporting an earlier outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p><p/><p>Let's look at the markets now, here in the U.S., Futures have been in the green across the board all morning, Dow Futures are now up by about 41 points, the S&amp;P is up by almost four, the Nasdaq is up by eight.</p><p/><p>In Europe, the financial times is reporting European Union Authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p/><p>You can see markets there are currently mixed, and now let's take a closer look at what's moving them with European markets analyst Jan Randolph.</p><p/><p>He's a director of Sovereign Risk at IHS Global Insight. Now Jan, according to this financial times report, Spain and these European authorities that it's talking to, are hoping to unveil this bailout plan possibly in about a week.</p><p/><p>How do you expect investors to respond if that happens?</p><p/><p>JAN RANDOLPH, DIRECTOR, SOVEREIGN RISK, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT: I think positively.</p><p/><p>I think they're expecting it, I think the lower borrowing costs we've seen from Spain, in anticipation of the ECB bond buying and the bailout fund being made available.</p><p/><p>I think it will be a bailout light though, not a fully fledged bailout though, that will be far too much money.</p><p/><p>The trick, you can call it that, is to keep private sector on board in terms of refinancing the Spanish state and to encourage more.</p><p/><p>I think that's the trick and I think the package will be designed for that purpose.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: All right, we'll see if they can do that. That's Jan Randolph at IHS, thanks so much, Jan.</p><p/><p>RANDOLPH: Thank you.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: And Universal Music Group has won approval from EU anti-trust regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion. After the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record labels.</p><p/><p>Universal says the assets to be sold amount to 30 percent of EMI's global sales. Citigroup is selling EMI after they acquired the music group when Vita firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the investment bank.</p><p/><p>Here's a look at commodities now, oil and gold still up, oil is up by about 74 cents around $93 a gallon. Gold is up 6 bucks at 1,776 an ounce.</p><p/><p>Coming up this hour, Imus' guest will be our own Neil Cavuto and now, here's the i-man live on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So big foot says to me, of all the people we've ever had on the program, two of the nicest, perhaps the nicest, Vince Gill --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p/><p>IMUS: And Levon Helm. So, Vince Gill is, that man, that's an American treasure there, I'll tell you that right now.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, here's what I'm trying to understand, Bernard, Connell, anybody. Warner, anybody? Dagen? First, the administration said, regarding the attack on Libya.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That it was all the fault of this hideous movie that was on YouTube and -- then we had people like K.T. McFarland and others on this program say, that they believed the attack was essentially nonsense.</p><p/><p>Although it may have served as a convenient excuse, but the anniversary of 9/11 had a lot more to do with it.</p><p/><p>And now we're being told, I guess, that no, the administration now says, well, it was a terrorist attack.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, here is my question. Did they know that -- did the President use the word terrorist, by the way?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK. Has he ever?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Has he ever used the word period?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, does he believe that there's terrorism in the world?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh, yes, he's used --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Sure --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: The word certainly --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, OK, all right. Does -- so did they use the movie as a convenient excuse until they could develop all of the facts and find out what really happened? Or as opposed to saying we don't know, which would mean they lied to us.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, sort it out for me, start with you, Bernie?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well, they went out as Susan Rice, the U.N. Ambassador on Sunday, she went, did the tour and proclaimed, pretty much, no uncertain terms, that it was all about the movie.</p><p/><p>And which seemed premature and a lot of people said as John McCain said, you know there was a spontaneous demonstration she said, and John McCain said you don't bring RPG's to a spontaneous demonstration.</p><p/><p>And sure enough, it comes out later, Fox Newsnow reporting that there was an al Qaeda guy who was released from Gitmo in 2007.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Who was behind the attacks. And so, it makes you wonder how stupid -- I mean, didn't they know that that would come out? They must have known, or at least should have considered that it might have come out when they put out Susan Rice to say these stupid things.</p><p/><p>And it did come out and now they're backtracking, Jay Carney said, yes, it was an act of terror. And so, they look dead, they shot themselves in the foot --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Once again.</p><p/><p>IMUS: The president's conduct to foreign policy is laughable and then my guy, the suit dummy --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Romney.</p><p/><p>IMUS: His comments in the wake of it were idiotic as well. Shut up until you know something. By the way, just butt out.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, but to mislead the American people --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Or what I said --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Because it would look bad politically, so, you can't --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Say that the GM is alive and Bin Laden is dead sort of puts a monkey wrench into all that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I understand.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: I mean that's sort of insulting --</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's what I wondered, so --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well, that's what the critics are saying that, you know, they're trying to change -- oh, it's much easier for the administration to come out and say what Susan Rice said.</p><p/><p>It's kind of interesting that she was put out there. Right, the President has been very careful on what he's personally said about this.</p><p/><p>Even yesterday, as you said, he didn't use the word terrorism, it was Jay Carney, his spokesman, not him.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, there we are. Neil Cavuto -- I mean, and these are the two guys we've got running.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I mean, it's just -- all right, eight minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p/><p>Neil Cavuto is coming up, I saw him this morning, when I walked in the building and it was before 5:30 a.m.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Wow.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And he looked cute and perky down there in the lobby and he got all exercised hysterical because I had my little oxygen tank with me because I couldn't breathe this morning so --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Got to get by.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What is it you're going to do?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What is it you're going to do? So, all that's going on, and then of course last night's football game, we're going to listen to Warner Wolf and that dope Gunz --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Hey, come on.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Or any of the guys on the pre-game show --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p/><p>IMUS: On the NFL network, which by the way is a disaster.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But Rich Eison and that dope Deion Sanders and Michael Irvin and --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Marshall Faulk?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Marshall Faulk and that dope, that fat dope -- why is the, why is the name calling necessary?</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Simply --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Steve Mariucci --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: It's better --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Every single one of these dopes --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Picked the tail out of Panthers across the board. And the Giants won 36 to 7.</p><p/><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Well --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Now what?</p><p/><p>WOLF: I told Gunz I'm going to watch out for these reserves --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, God, you're a disgrace.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On that, no --</p><p/><p>IMUS: What are the Yankees doing?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Now, the Yankees lead by one with 13 to play --</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right --</p><p/><p>WOLF: And they all play, Orioles play losers and so do the Yanks.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Is there any other race any place in the country?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Well, we have a two-game lead in the White Sox and Tigers.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's really it, because --</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK --</p><p/><p>WOLF: Now the A's are four back --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, fine, we don't need to run that --</p><p/><p>WOLF: That's it --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Oh, OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right, ten minutes after the hour, let's do some news, Bill Clinton is here, going to talk about -- what are you talking about?</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: Monica Lewinsky's new book.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, man, I can't wait to read this, come on, dude.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know, Juan Williams is right. I'm probably making too big a deal out of O'Reilly's characterization of Lee Harvey Oswald as a sharpshooter.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I don't know, but it just annoys me, but other than that, the book is great, \"Killing Kennedy\". All right, let's do the news, good morning Connell.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, i-man.

All right, please welcome now, speaking of that to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, former president of the United States, Bill Clinton, good morning, Mr. President.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: Well, morning, i-man. Well, it was only a matter of time, but I guess $12 million is $12 million. So Monica Lewinsky is going to publish her memoir with all the gory details.</p><p/><p>Every sleazy, sticky, creepy, crawly bit of nastiness, and once it hits the bestseller list, Bill O'Reilly is going to be able to start writing his next book, \"Killing Clinton\".</p><p/><p>Because Hillary will shoot me. It's bad enough that the love ick on the blue dress was made public for a while there.</p><p/><p>I even thought they were going to put it on display and this masonian next to Lincoln's stovepipe hat.</p><p/><p>But now, Monica is going to reveal all my sex secrets, like my insatiable appetite for three-way sex. Which isn't what you were thinking is, is it just really?</p><p/><p>I only know three ways of doing it, four, if count missionary, but having somebody else in the picture, that's just sick, unless the extra person is A, a woman and B, hot.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: But Monica is also going to reveal my fondness for sex toys. OK, one time I used some legos to build a little garage for my weiner.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>But it wasn't, you know a butt plug the size of a lava lamp.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>But what really hurts is the allegation that she has to do this because she needs to make a living and can't get a job because of me, which is just not true.</p><p/><p>She could get a job tomorrow, in a cigar store --</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: Or better yet, a shoe store because you know, she's real good on her knees.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, 19 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. From their brand new album, \"Hillbilly Jedi\", Big and Rich. That was a good record.</p><p/><p>And my baby gone.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>IMUS: You know, I never thought about it, about women's hair thinning. I thought only men got bald until I saw a bald-headed woman. And you do not want that in your house, a bald-headed woman, that is not good.</p><p/><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, you can fix that though, because from Chamonix, a good outfit you can trust them.</p><p/><p>They offer a money-back guarantee of all of their products, the Esotique, the T-Gen, the Heart Factors Plus.</p><p/><p>They now have this stuff, this serum called ProVia, p-r-o-v-i-a, it's all natural hair serum from Chamonix, a money-back guarantee, you rub this in your gored there for two or three weeks and whatever.</p><p/><p>And your hair is going to get thicker and will look better.

Good morning Mr. McGuirk.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Good morning, Mr. Imus. And the big dawg Bill Clinton was on with your friend Jon Stewart last night and he was boring, he was just flat-out.</p><p/><p>He made Charlie Rose sound like Mad Dog Russo, he was so boring. But, listen to Jon Stewart do his best impersonation of Monica Lewinsky journalistically.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>JON STEWART, COMEDIAN &amp; TELEVISION HOST: Give any good speeches lately or? How was that -- how did that feel at the convention?</p><p/><p>Could you tell that you were crushing it as you were doing it? Did you, did you feel that?</p><p/><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes and no. But -- because I didn't want to talk down to people, I wanted to explain what I thought was going on.</p><p/><p>STEWART: That's what was so stunning, I think. That's why it was such a bracing speech. The phrase you mentioned earlier about getting the facts right, and they would have -- you would attach numbers to them that were real.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>I thought it was a bold choice on your part.</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: I mean he's going to have to send his jackets to the cleaners after that, I mean, just figuratively, it was sort of nauseating. But --</p><p/><p>IMUS: What? There was not any --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: The way he just -- I mean, did he ask him about the memoir that's coming out? --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh, no --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Memoir --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Stewart was jerking his chain.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: No, he wasn't.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes, he was.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: I saw it. He was --</p><p/><p>IMUS: He wasn't jerking his chain?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Not at all. He was telling him what a great speech you gave and could you put facts out there, unlike Mitt Romney --</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're telling me Stewart wasn't kidding with that?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: No, not at all. That was a straight-up journalistic --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Didn't he sound like he was kidding --</p><p/><p>BARTLETT: I mean, I didn't see it, so, I mean, I was there?</p><p/><p>IMUS: He didn't sound like he was kidding?</p><p/><p>POWELL: Little tongue in cheek to me.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's what he sounded, like a little tongue in cheek. Really?</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: No, absolutely not.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, because you're a hater.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: No, because I actually watched it, I saw it.

She and this dude, Josh Elliott, who's an anchor on \"Good Morning America\", they're apparently an item. I'm going to read from the \"New York Post\" --</p><p/><p>IMUS: I thought she was married.</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: Well, she was.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Oh --</p><p/><p>MCGUIRK: This is what the \"New York Post\" page six writes this morning. \"After we revealed yesterday that 41-year-old beauty Cho, the co-anchor of \"Wabc TV\" in New York, split with her husband and moved out of their Yonkers mansion three months ago.</p><p/><p>She insisted through friends that they're just friends.

He's even been picked up from Cho's part to head to work at \"Good Morning America\" where he works as a news anchor.</p><p/><p>Good morning Elizabeth.

And now, here is Diane Macedo.</p><p/><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. General Motors is recalling more than 426,000 Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn sedans in the U.S. due to transmission problems. The recall affects vehicles model years 2007 to 2010.</p><p/><p>The automaker says the transmission gear position may not match the gear on the shifter and that could cause the vehicle to move when drivers think they're in park. GM says it's aware of four crashes due to the problem, but no injuries reported as of now.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, the recall news after General Motors announced it has reached an agreement with the Canadian Autoworkers Union over a labor contract. Under the tentative four year deal, GM will add a third shift to its flex line at its Ontario facility.</p><p/><p>The automaker had planned to shutdown that plant three-shift consolidated line next June, but will operate with at least one line until June of 2014. The CAW continues to negotiate a deal with Chrysler after it already reached one with Ford earlier in the week.</p><p/><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues now after we check the weather with Fox 5 meteorologist, Mike Woods.</p><p/><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, everyone. Looks like we have some wet weather out there, but not a ton of it for the country here. We've got an area of low pressure still rotating around the Great Lakes, but it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwest and Central Mississippi Valley area.</p><p/><p>And then back towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east and also a few showers popping up around Florida again, southeast, slightly risky in terms of showers and storms. Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms and high temp today, 88 degrees.</p><p/><p>And Phoenix, no rain for you, sunny skies with a high of 103 and Seattle partly cloudy skies with a high of 63. Sacramento, California, you've got sunny skies there today with a high of 91, still warm. I'm Mike Woods from Fox 5 in New York.</p><p/><p>IMUS: All right, it's 36 minutes past the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Please welcome to the program, senior vice president, anchor manager, Fox Business News, Fox NewsChannel, a man who sadly calls himself the financial factor, Neil P. Cavuto. What does the P stand for?</p><p/><p>NEIL P. CAVUTO, FOX BUSINESS: Patrick.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Good morning, Mr. Cavuto.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Good morning, Mr. Imus.</p><p/><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It was scary bumping into you this morning.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, I had my little oxygen tank with me.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You kind of looked like Hannibal Lector being driven in on a gurney and I thought, is he up to doing the show today? But here you are, encouragement to all us.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, anaerobic, but I recover quickly and I don't need oxygen just to sit around and talk.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I admire that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Happy birthday tomorrow.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: How did you know that?</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's my job to know those things.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Thank you very much.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, you like the Vince Gill interview?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I liked it very much, I'm a big fan of his and I thought you did a very good job. A lot of people, you know, when you interview stars it's always tough. You do a fawning interview or you do a revealing one particularly like the things about your brother, how tough that is and trying to get a handle on it, very real. I liked it very much.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So I asked you off the air if you liked Romney. Do you?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I do, personally I like him a lot.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It doesn't bother you that he's a dope, right?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: He's not a dope.</p><p/><p>IMUS: OK, he's not a good campaigner, is he?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think that remains to be seen. The election hasn't happened yet.</p><p/><p>IMUS: No, sir. Do you think that these leaked videos, these missteps that they've each made, is going to make a difference when people vote?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You don't?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I do not. I think in the end, it always is the economy. I think that's what-- we could have extenuating circumstances, the Middle East explosion, could have the impact, but almost every U.S. election is decided by the economy.</p><p/><p>How good people feel, how maybe not so good people feel and we're always willing to entertain switching horses mid stream when an incumbent is battling a tough economy, but we've really got to see the other horse.</p><p/><p>I think in 1980 when the polls were similarly tight between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. A lot of people liked Jimmy Carter, frustrated with the economy, but they were more than willing to entertain an alternative and along came Ronald Reagan to appeal to alternative.</p><p/><p>IMUS: How many people vote for the person who they like the best?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think it plays a part.</p><p/><p>IMUS: How big a part?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, I do think it helped George Bush, many polls were done on the debate between he and Al Gore and then later on between he and John Kerry. And I think most people said who won the debates?</p><p/><p>And a lot of them said, particularly in 2004, with John Kerry, who do you like more or relate to more? George Bush. I'm not saying that's always the case, but it does help if people feel you're either more approachable or likeable.</p><p/><p>And I think in 1960 from the television critics later who said that Richard Nixon was sweating and detached and John Kennedy looked relaxed and smooth. These things on some level do connect for people.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Talking with Neil Cavuto -- talking with Neil Cavuto here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. It's 5 until the hour, you know what you ought to do here at Fox?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: What's that?</p><p/><p>IMUS: An interesting experiment because my wife mentioned this to me.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: She wants to have sex with you, by the way.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Who doesn't?</p><p/><p>IMUS: I don't. Wants to have sex with you --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And go ahead.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Anyway.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Come on, Don, tell me. Go ahead, please.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, I forgot --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: At least say something, you guys.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Here is what you should do.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Like an interview by Rainman.</p><p/><p>IMUS: When is the first debate, October 1st?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think the 3rd.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's the day he hit the home run. Here is what you should do. Please don't interrupt when I'm talking with Mr. Cavuto, Warner. I'll come over there and beat on you like a rented mule. Just kidding. You should get a group of people.</p><p/><p>Frank -- You should do it. Get a group, have them listen to the audio feed and don't let them watch it and have the group just watch it on television and then poll each group to see who won. Who they think won.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: That's not a bad idea.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It is a good idea isn't it?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It's a very good idea.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Because Deirdre said to me -- don't you hate it when guys quote their wives. You know, that means they're so p-whipped.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And she's insane for putting up with you.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Absolutely. Because you get distracted who looked and --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes, yes. And history bears that out. I mean, people who, I guess, were listened in to the Nixon-Kennedy debate thought Nixon, and Bush and Al Gore. That was a little more debatable than Kerry and Bush.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Should I call Roger and --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Please do, please do. I'm not going to act on this because I actually think the idea is silly.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do you really?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes. I do.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You do?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think 90 percent of people are going to be watching and not listening.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Well, you're just, I don't know, you're just -- I don't know.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, I just, I think in 1960, it would have been a brilliant idea, but last time I checked --</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's a good idea now just to see. It's 18 until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Did you read \"Killing Lincoln?\"</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I did read it. It's a great book.</p><p/><p>IMUS: But I'll tell you what is a terrific book \"Killing Kennedy.\"</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I haven't -- I know it's out or will be out, but-- I really enjoyed \"Killing Lincoln\", the way he built it up and x number of days to live and I thought when I first opened it, we know what happened in the end.</p><p/><p>But he didn't do a great job and see what the Kennedy book, but I think he's got -- he could a series on his hands. I don't know how you handle Philmore, getting Philmore, but --</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's enormously entertaining and there's no heavy lifting, not a --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think it's a very good point. A lot of the stories, Brinkley, I love dearly and Harry Truman, 900 pages on and on and all great, but you can make this fun and engaging.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And accessible.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It's a way to do it. I didn't see the kids' version that's out but --</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's pretty good, too. It's pretty good, too, so, do you think he writes any of it.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think he does.</p><p/><p>IMUS: What's --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: -- his show.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That doesn't make any difference.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No, it doesn't, but when you say does he write his stuff? Of course, he writes his stuff.</p><p/><p>IMUS: How is that demeaning --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You say does he write the book.</p><p/><p>IMUS: As a journalist, I have a --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Excuse me? Excuse me.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's 17 until the hour here in the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Are you a sports fan?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Not at all.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I heard you guys go through the Sunday games. I guess these are football games? Terrific, no offense guns and Warner but --</p><p/><p>IMUS: That's fine, but do you ever watch sports on television?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I have the attention span of a gnat. I watch the highlights. I said, why can't the games be like the highlights?</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do you ever watch Sports Center?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Where do you get the highlights?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Passing around the news or online, but I'm not really -- I'm afraid I'm not really into it.</p><p/><p>IMUS: So, do you watch television?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I know this is going to sound elitist, but I really don't. I'm just, it's not --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Mr. Cavuto --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I watch you, of course, I mean, that's a staple. Connell and Dagen and flip over --</p><p/><p>IMUS: Mr. Cavuto is on at 4 in the afternoon on the Fox NewsChannel and 8 p.m. and do you think that --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I want to come back at you with anger, but I saw you with the oxygen tank and go lightly no need to be mean.</p><p/><p>IMUS: It's a quarter until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: This is three times in this hour with this interview, you relay the time. It's always fascinating to me why you do that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I'm doing a radio program.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I know that. I know, but -- like I say there are clocks in those cars, right?</p><p/><p>IMUS: I can stop giving the time.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: OK, more time for me.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Bernie, put a call in to Bob -- anyway do you think Obama is a socialist?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No. I think he likes big government. I think he likes more big government and espouses the view much like FDR in 1932, government the only way to get us out of the mess and a lot more people are beholden to the government as a result of that.</p><p/><p>And he's got a pretty good base of people who would vote for him as a result and I think that probably was what Mitt Romney was inelegantly getting at. But we all remember, you know, but FDR got re-elected in a landslide in 36 even though the economy still, still was pretty bad.</p><p/><p>IMUS: As ours does.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And you would think that one of the things that Romney could get some traction and I think, that you asked, I think --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Your thoughts are very valuable to me.</p><p/><p>IMUS: I think the day that Romney gets elected, the economy is better just by -- he doesn't have to do anything, do you agree with that?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, you have to do something. You're popping up in a different --</p><p/><p>IMUS: That wasn't the question.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You mean, well, it's a stupid point. Sounds like Godzilla, January 20th just by virtue of being Godzilla being in the office because it's not Barack Obama, things are better.</p><p/><p>IMUS: If it makes you feel like a bigger person, which you're --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: OK, you know, I could lose weight, you will always be evil.</p><p/><p>IMUS: To make me feel bad by calling me a list of names, but don't you think the way the markets would react --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It's always fine until --</p><p/><p>IMUS: And the financial community.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p/><p>IMUS: That the things would, people would feel better and I know he has do something, your suit dummy candidate and mine, but wouldn't have to do anything, but just get elected and it would be better. Do you think that's true?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I don't, I don't, obviously if the nation turns to the challenger to throw the incumbent out of office. It's hoping what you said. And remember, electing Ronald Reagan in a landslide didn't bring results, in fact, the recession many more years and jobs lost until we had to boom in '82.</p><p/><p>Coming out of that so things take time, I'm not subscribing to the screw that automatically things are better. They're ready to do well if we don't keep what we're doing and stop with a new guy in there. But you have to do stuff.</p><p/><p>You have to put up some initiatives that will change the direction. Ronald Reagan did, and you know, the question would be for Romney administration, if it were to happen, whether it would.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Is there a way now to know -- is there a way for you to know who will win the election?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I have no idea.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Do you have a gut sense?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I do, but I'm not going to share that with you. I will say this - -</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're really a creep.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: That's lovely. I only relate this to you. I think I told you this before. When I went to Wisconsin to cover the recall election, polls going into that weekend had dead even. I think it had it dead even and we know at that Walker won by six points.</p><p/><p>Now, I had a theory and I could be very wrong that conservative support is understated in some of the state polls, maybe with unwinding a bit it's beyond the margin of error, but I do think these states apparently Mitt Romney is going to get blown out in, I don't subscribe to that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: You're going to get to the point eventually, right?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I just told you. And I think the polls in the battle ground state understate Romney's support.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Hope you're right.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And when you say Romney's my man you always say that.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But then you disparage him.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Keeping it real.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And for every wonderful interview like Vince Gill and then you do one like you did with Frank Rich.</p><p/><p>IMUS: My job is to keep it real, right, Bernie?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Frank Rich interview, just kept it real.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Keeping it real.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: OK.</p><p/><p>IMUS: Thank you very much for --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: This is it?</p><p/><p>IMUS: You were on for 12 minutes.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: That's 12 minutes of my life. I'm never getting back.</p><p/><p>IMUS: And so does the audience.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MACEOD: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. Let's take a look at the markets. In Europe, the \"Financial Times\" is reporting that European Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p/><p>Markets there are now mixed with London down by about 5 points. Paris is up 10 and Frankfort is up about 64. Here in the U.S., we have seen green arrows across the board all morning. Dow futures are up by 56. The S&amp;P is up by about 5 and the Nasdaq is up by 13.</p><p/><p>Now that Apple's iPhone is available, we're also finding out exactly what makes the smartphone work. The repair firm fix it, got one open and chips from Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solution.</p><p/><p>The iPhone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus Logic and its gyroscope, which is used to track its orientation was made by ST Microelectronics. Keep an eye on those stocks and those are the companies that didn't participate in the iPhone to see the reaction today.</p><p/><p>The world's biggest retailer is looking to do business in India. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reports Wal-Mart hopes to open its first stores in the country within two years. That move comes after the government last week agreed to allow international supermarket chains to enter India through joint ventures.</p><p/><p>Wal-Mart says it hadn't decided yet where or how many stores it would like to have, but the company expects to continue its current partnerships with barky enterprises of India, a chain of 17 cash and carry stores.</p><p/><p>Here's a look at commodities, oil and gold are up. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.</p><p/><p>(IMUS EXTRA SEGMENTS)</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox NewsNetwork, LLC.

Now, here's Diane Macedo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone. Apple fans are on the world of lining up to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves around the world today including here in New York City where our own Robert Gray is standing by at Apple's Fifth Avenue store. Robert, it is 6:00 in the morning. What does it look like out there right now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Diane. Good morning. There are a few hundred folks out here in line behind me. You can see them and in fact, the big cube here which this store is famous for, which lead you to an underground entrance way, the store is normally a 24-7 operation. They closed it overnight. It will not open until 8 a.m. local time. And of course, that is the roll out plan across nine different nations here.</p><p>This is the widest rollout that Apple has had yet for one of their iPhones. Now, a key numbers to hit here. We've seen every iPhone new version has outsold a combined total of all the previous versions. This of course is a law of large numbers. It is going to be tough to duplicate. We'll have to wait and see. Most reviewers out there saying this phone a little bit more evolutionary than revolutionary.</p><p>And of course, there's been a lot of feedback and flak, if you will, about the new connectors out there. They are of course shrinking the connectors down to nine pins from 30. So, all the products that you have around the house, connectors et cetera, you'll going to have to go out and buy some more of those. So, Apple is expected to make a big hole out of this as well as of course some of their third party partners out there. You're going to talk a little bit all morning long.</p><p>Of course, we're expecting a faster processor on board, you got the new ear pods, the camera higher resolution, reportedly better. As the phone even now of course, some reviewers out there and analysts that I've spoken with Diane, saying that as far as the camera goes and processing speed, they're just now catching up to some of the rivals out there. But of course, as you can see, still plenty of Apple fans out here braving the early morning, though we must say pretty mild here in New York City. Back to you.</p><p>MACEDO: All right. That's Robert Gray live at the Apple store. Thanks, Robert.</p><p>GRAY: You're welcome.</p><p>MACEDO: Meanwhile, E.U. anti-trust regulators have cleared universal music group to buy British record company EMI as recorded music unit for $1.9 billion after the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record labels. Universal says, the assets to be sold amounts to 30 percent of EMI's global sales. Citigroup is selling EMI having acquired the music group when buy-out firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the investment bank.</p><p>Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., futures have been in the green across the board all morning. Dow futures are up by about 40 points. The S&amp;P is up by almost four. The NASDAQ is up by seven.</p><p>In Europe, the Financial Times reports European Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank. Markets are currently mixed. London was green earlier, now we're seeing it in the red down by almost nine points. Paris and Frankfurt still in the green.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at what's moving those markets with Josh Raymond now, chief market strategist at City Index in London. Now, Josh, the FT is reporting that Spain is moving closer to a bailout. Should investors read that as a negative or should they find some release in having some more certainty on that front?</p><p>JOSH RAYMOND, CITY INDEX CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: I think it is a positive. And it does provide some certainty. You know, the markets -- investors have been fairly convinced that more is required. There has been political maneuvering going on with Spain saying that they've got austerity measures in there. They don't require the fully -- bailout. But we already know that they're actually in talks, so we have that -- a few people of the Spanish government actually recently earlier on this week say, it will provide a level of certainty. And I think that would be reacted positively by the market. Of course, it depends on the scale which the (INAUDIBLE) will require, I mean, the ECB through monetary transactions have an unlimited scope to do so as well.</p><p>MACEDO: And Josh, Mario Monti is holding meetings in Italy with several leaders today. What do you expect to come out of them?</p><p>RAYMOND: Not much unfortunately. And we're getting used to all these meetings taking place and strong rhetoric talking about a fiscal union, stronger banking regulations, that sort of thing but nothing really comes of it. And I think investors are a little bit more wiser to that these days. Now, we already have the ECB. And the main focus for us at the moment really is the ECB and Spain. Now, we've obviously got the -- from the ECB and we're waiting for Spain to confirm or to agree that the terms towards that fully first bailout. Those are the key things that we're looking at.</p><p>MACEDO: OK. More brain storming for the many results. We'll see if it comes out that way. Thanks, Josh. That's Josh Raymond from London.</p><p>K.B. Home meanwhile is reporting a surprise profit this morning. The home builder says it made four cents a share in its third quarter. The company was expected to lose 16 cents a share but revenue came in light at $424.5 million. The estimate was for 430 million. K.B. Home says, it's order backlog at the end of August rose 18 percent from a year ago to more than 3,100 and home deliveries rose seven percent to more than 1,700.</p><p>Here's a quick look at commodities. Oil and gold are both to the upside.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Well, it's going to be a great show.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Great show. Great day in New York today.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yep.</p><p>IMUS: Last day of summer. Going to be 73 degrees. Let's do some sunbathing, baby.</p><p>So, anyway, coming up this morning, Juan Williams, FOX News, and the great Vince Gill. Now, Vince -- when I say great, I mean great. He's not going to sing. He's coming in to talk. Now, why would you book somebody like Vince Gill just to talk? Because he's worth talking to.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's it.</p><p>IMUS: There's a few of these guys, people who I would talk to. It would be him -- who are worth talking to. Dwight Yoakam.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Smart guy, Yoakam.</p><p>MCSHANE: Uh-huh!</p><p>IMUS: Crazy but good crazy. Delbert, smart guy, funny.</p><p>MCSHANE: Of course.</p><p>IMUS: Kinky.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, not many more, right?</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: Billy Ray?</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM PRODUCER: He's one of the nicest guys too, Dwight Yoakam.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, yes.</p><p>IMUS: He is, isn't he?</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, he's really nice guy.</p><p>IMUS: You know the day I got fired, he called me on my cell phone. I was on my way to meet the team. And I was in the car.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: He's a good man. He understood what the deal was. And so, you know. You can't say stuff like that, man. Don't pick on people. Just don't do it, whether you're trying to be funny or not. Come on.</p><p>Anyway, and so, and then the big dog's here, Bill Clinton.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, good.</p><p>IMUS: He's concerned about this book that Monica Lewinsky is going to do.</p><p>MCSHANE: I like that.</p><p>IMUS: About them sex positions. And then, Warner?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: You and Gunz.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, sir.</p><p>IMUS: You skunks. And Steve Mariucci, the pregame show on the NFL Network, there are two reasons to watch that. Other than that.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, good bye.</p><p>IMUS: They suck, Rich Eisen, sucks. Steve Mariucci, sucks. Deion Sanders, moron, Michael Irving moron, and that other guy, moron.</p><p>MCSHANE: Moron.</p><p>IMUS: Every one of them picked the Carolina Panthers. What happened? The New York Giants put a butt whipping on them.</p><p>WOLF: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: Thirty six-seven. Come on.</p><p>RUFINO: Pussy riot, come on!</p><p>IMUS: Start the pussy riot.</p><p>WOLF: That's right. Come on.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man! Eli got the ball, what did he do? He marched down the field and scored a touchdown. Every time he got the ball. Come on!</p><p>WOLF: Yes. And the reserves, man, those guys, the regulars better look over their shoulders. Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you and the ice cream cone on the forehead, Gunzelman --</p><p>RUFINO: Oh, wow!</p><p>WOLF: Oh, God!</p><p>IMUS: -- should have anticipated this.</p><p>(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p>I mean, this was an outrage.</p><p>WOLF: That's right.</p><p>RUFINO: Enjoy that ice cream.</p><p>IMUS: I will never listen to -- and you're right, Warner, about these pregame shows. These people don't know anything.</p><p>WOLF: No, waste of time.</p><p>IMUS: That's total waste of time.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>RUFINO: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Honeymoon is over.</p><p>MCSHANE: Welcome.</p><p>IMUS: All right. We're going to do the news now. Bernard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yo, chief.</p><p>IMUS: Or Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Any of you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Anybody.</p><p>IMUS: The Libyan attack on the embassy.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: The administration initially, the President and the Secretary of State characterized this as a direct result of this YouTube movie, right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Susan Rice all over the Sunday shows, she did a tour.</p><p>MCSHANE: U.N. ambassador. Yep.</p><p>IMUS: Now, is there any evidence -- and how are they describing it now, the administration?</p><p>MCGUIRK: That there is evidence that the guy who was released from Guantanamo Bay in 2007 was behind -- an al-Qaeda guy was behind the attack on the embassy in Libya.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: So, is the President willing to use the word terrorist and describe this as a terrorist attack?</p><p>MCSHANE: Not personally. Jay Carney used that word yesterday but the President did not when he was asked about it in the forum in Florida.</p><p>IMUS: Has he ever used the word terrorist?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Good question.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Now, so my question is this then, did they have evidence that -- did they know better that it was the result of the movie? Or of course, not so coincidently falling on September 11th. Did they not know that or did they lie about it or did they just assume -- you would think with our intelligence apparatus they would know better. But then, we've had other bunch of other screw ups. So what happened here? In other words, did they lie? Did they know? Did they not have the information? What?</p><p>MCGUIRK: They jumped to conclusions. If they didn't know, they should have said they didn't know instead of proclaiming definitively that it was a direct result of the movie.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: They should not have proclaimed that. They should have said let's wait and see. They didn't. Again, and they still harp on the movie as though -- and they're conflating two things. The movie, the terrorists used the movie perhaps as a cover to get the morons to come out and cause a riot so that they could use that as cover to go in. But in either case, they were misleading, was the administration. They obviously don't want it to look like -- they want to say GM is alive and bin Laden is dead, and that's it. They can't say that anymore. And that's why they're, you know.</p><p>IMUS: I know you can't see it, but do you like my new hat?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, that's bad. That's a bad as Johnny Cash.</p><p>MCSHANE: Look out now.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know who did this? Stuart Dunlap, Men's hat shop, Albuquerque.</p><p>MCSHANE: Nobody but him.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Did he?</p><p>IMUS: He did in San Antonio.</p><p>WOLF: That's the Rango Kidd hat.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man, that guy is -- come on. All right. Let's do the news.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right.</p><p>IMUS: You're a disgrace, Warner. Don't you be yucking it up over there. This is unbelievable. The country singer Josh Turner is downstairs. That boy is pretty good. He's on FOX and Fiends.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p>IMUS: I guess people, there's an 80-plus demographic by records, right? Here's Connell with the news. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man. Protesters are actually in the streets today in Pakistan. They won't be able to use their cell phones. Though, the government there is blocking cell service, major cities, so the phones can't be used to detonate bombs. It's a national day of protest against that movie we were talking about, the anti-Muslim film produced here in the United States. The surge in Afghanistan meantime is over according to the Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta who says in his view it worked.</p><p>The 33,000 additional troops sent to Afghanistan a couple of years ago now pulled out of the country. The latest Gallup daily tracking poll has the race for the White House a dead heat. Forty seven percent a piece.</p><p>IMUS: I'll be darned.</p><p>MCSHANE: Mitt Romney and President Obama. But Romney is still hurting in some of these key swing states. \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC numbers, Obama is up eight points in Ohio. Leading by five both in Wisconsin and Colorado.</p><p>IMUS: You know, we are at a state in this country where this is the best we can do? A suit dummy and the president?</p><p>MCSHANE: That's the choice you have.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, I know a bunch of smart guys. So, do you? I mean, we all do.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right. You mean like business leaders and that type of thing and --</p><p>IMUS: Really smart people.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Can't get them to run.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, I was going to say, it's hard to get people to run. Absolutely.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know.</p><p>MCSHANE: Be vetted and everything else.</p><p>IMUS: Twelve minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Juan Williams, Vince Gill. Neil Cavuto. That's a pretty good lineup.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, it is. Connell continues.</p><p>IMUS: We got some comments from Ann Romney here in a second but first, the campaign has turned to comments not by either Romney but by the President saying yesterday, \"Washington cannot be changed from the inside.\" Big things, he says, get done when people pressure politicians from the outside. So, Romney was all over that saying that Obama's thrown in the white flag of surrender on the economy. Now, here's Ann Romney. She was on a radio show in Iowa asking Republicans to stop attacking her husband.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY: What do you say to your fellow Republicans? Sure. Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it, get in the ring. This is hard. It's an important thing that we're doing right now, and it's an important election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. Today, the President --</p><p>IMUS: Her husband is a moron. He'll do better than this guy. Having said all that -- I mean, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. Those of you who know me know I probably don't. But I'm going to vote for him. And I'm going to tell you that the day he gets elected, the economy is better. He doesn't have to do anything.</p><p>MCSHANE: You just think confidence is going to improve?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's one of the argument he made in that video that came out. Romney will be in Nevada today. Obama campaigning in Virginia. Some American airliners frequent fliers worried after hearing about the company's intentions to lay off thousands of workers and then reduce flights.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I'm pretty loyal to them. Because I do travel and get my miles with them. I have really not had too many problems.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Had a number of flights, so they've been canceled this week, American announcing more than 1,000 employees could lose their jobs. They're going through bankruptcy reorganization.</p><p>And Fast and Furious, lawmakers analyzing this new report that's come in on the botch, ATF gun walking operation, it's a report from the inspector general from the Justice Department. They found the Attorney General Eric Holder was not aware of the operation until it came out in the media and other places. Here's California republican Congressman Darrell Issa says the report the raises an important question.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: There is clearly a question not of did he know, because he said he didn't know. The question is why in the world did key lieutenants keep it from him and of course why is that something that we should --</p><p>(SCREAMING SHUT UP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Sounds like a car alarm going off. Did the guy invented those Bernie or Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Please step away from the car. That's his --</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Please step away from the car. Please step away from your mouth.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh my God!</p><p>IMUS: Sick of hearing about this.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Enough is enough.</p><p>IMUS: Come on.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well --</p><p>IMUS: Let's just get the problems of this country solved. Bernard McGuirk is going to be a guest on O'Reilly tonight at 8 p.m. on the FOX News Channel. Bernard McGuirk and Greg Gutfeld in a segment called what the hell just happened or something.</p><p>MCSHANE: Something like that.</p><p>IMUS: And it's good and they're good. A quarter after the hour. Let's do some business news. Here with that is Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, sir. Yesterday, the Dow was up a paltry almost 19 points and the futures are higher this morning. And OK, all these ding-a-lings are lined up for the new iPhone 5. It goes on sale this morning at 8 a.m. Local Time in stores in nine countries. I'm sure it's going to have record sales. But here's what we care about even more than that, that Apple has fallen flat on its face with this new mapping software that it released. It's on this new phone. It's also in the new software, the IOS-6. It replaced Google maps, kicked Google maps off the phone, and it's a disaster. It sucks. That's how bad it is. Basically like businesses wind up in the middle of rivers.</p><p>IMUS: So, I told Dagen I used map quest. She said, that's so 90's.</p><p>MCSHANE: Map quest.</p><p>IMUS: I said, well, the place I'm going hasn't moved. They'll tell you how to get there. What the hell do I care?</p><p>MCDOWELL: You could do so much better than that. That's the issue. You could do so much better than that. It's like saying I've got like a Xerox typewriter, like, you know, IBM Selectric or something like that before I curse.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Like what? What's better?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. No, all this.</p><p>IMUS: What's the matter?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Google maps is better. Google maps is far and above better than map quest, and particularly this new Apple.</p><p>IMUS: Old weird Dave Patterson from Texas, he just updated my iPhone iOS 6 last night.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you lost your Google maps and if you want to look for the Hoover dam on the 3D imaging, on this Apple mapping software, it looks like a -- roller coaster. That's how lousy it is.</p><p>IMUS: I know where the Hoover dam is. Right outside of Las Vegas. Let's go look at it. Come on, dude.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can't do it on that Apple mapping --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, come on. Get a life.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Don't we love when some giant, the biggest company in the world screws up?</p><p>IMUS: First of all, all you ever care about is a bunch of red-neck goobers driving around in a circle and who knows where they're going to race this weekend, the NASCAR dopes. Where is the race?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, in New Hampshire actually.</p><p>IMUS: That's pretty good track, so. So, they don't need a map. I tell you what they do need.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: They need a clue. All right. Eighteen after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Have you done sports yet, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Don't wear me out but here's Warner with sports. Go ahead.</p><p>WOLF: All right, I-man. Thursday night football in Charlotte, now the Giants even with four offensive injuries beat the Panthers 36 to seven. Just like Gunzelman and myself called it. Backup running back Andre Brown playing for the injured Ahmad Bradshaw, 113 yards and 20 carries and two touchdowns.</p><p>And then reserved wide receiver Ramses Barden playing in place of a Hakeem Nicks caught nine passes for 138 yards. Eli 27 for 35, 288 yards, a touchdown, no interceptions. And Lawrence Tynes kicked five field goals.</p><p>IMUS: Wow!</p><p>WOLF: Now, here was Cam Newton who, by the way, I don't know if you saw this, after he scored a touchdown to make it cut it to 23 to seven, he went into his superman celebration. Pretty good timing for that. So, here was Newton only 16 for 30 intercepted three times and ran the ball six times for only six yards.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAM NEWTON, CAROLINA PANTHERS: Who wants to support something that puts on a performance of embarrassment. That's what that was tonight. If I was a fan of the Carolina Panthers, I would be holding my head down and ashamed of the product that was out there today.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Yes.

And President Obama sat down with this Univision people yesterday, the Spanish language TV station, and if he thought he was going to get questions like what's your favorite salsa music, or do you like J-Lo or stuff like that, he was in for a big surprise.</p><p>IMUS: Oh-oh.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The dude hit him hard, this Jorge Ramos. He was like the Spanish inquisition.</p><p>IMUS: He's a good reporter.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Very good reporter.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, he is.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, it was like the Spanish inquisition. For a little while, anyway, he asked him about changing things in government. And he gave a bad answer. And then Mitt Romney jumped on it, as Connell alluded to earlier. Here's Obama first and then Mitt Romney right afterwards.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: I've learned some lessons over the last four years. And the most important lesson I've learned is that you can't change Washington from the inside. You can only change it from the outside. That's how I got elected. And that's how the big accomplishments like health care got done.</p><p>FMR. GOV. MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The President today threw in the white flag of surrender again. He said he can't change Washington from inside. He can only change it from outside. Well, we're going to give him that chance in November. He's going outside.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: About as animated and funny as Mitt Romney will get, but it wasn't that bad. And the New York Giants, of course on a tear. Right, boss?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Who cares? Tim Tebow, he's on the cover of \"Vogue\" magazine, he's on the cover of \"The New York Post\" this morning.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Putting his physique on display there. And I'm sure that's going to rile up all the Giants this morning.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But of course, he's a devout Christian and he tells --</p><p>IMUS: Praise God.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, exactly right. He tells \"Vogue\" magazine what he looks for in a woman. And here's his quote. I've been blessed to have an amazing mom and two amazing sisters, so they set a very high standard. I'll stop right there. What I think of -- when I think of a woman, I don't think of my mom and -- God bless them. God rest them, I should say. But anyway, he goes on and that's what makes him a good guy apparently, obviously.</p><p>Obviously looks play a big part. Looks play a big part. Being attracted to someone plays a big part but there is also much more than that. To me, it is about finding someone who is sweet and kind and that has a servant's heart. It's about finding a girl who likes me for me. And not because of what I do or who I am or the name.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, tasty rat covering that servant's heart.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yep. He did add that she's got to have a booty that's high and tight.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>If it ain't tight, it ain't right.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Bu so, you know, the boy's got some feeling.</p><p>IMUS: There has got to be --</p><p>RUFINO: Can see him saying that.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, somebody else to talk about.</p><p>RUFINO: He's got to have a booty.</p><p>IMUS: He seems like a nice guy.</p><p>MCGUIRK: People can't get enough of -- the front page of \"The New York Post.\"</p><p>IMUS: OK.

Now that Apple's iPhone 5 is available, we're finding out what exactly makes the smart phone work. The repair firm I-fix got its hands on one and pried it open to find the device uses chips from Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solutions. The iPhone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus, Logic and its Gyroscope which is used to track its orientation was made by STmicroelectronics. So, keep an eye on stocks of those companies and those who didn't make the iPhone 5 to see their reaction today.</p><p>Shares of Oracle were up slightly in extended trading after first quarter results revealed while the company's traditional software business improved, hardware system sales continue to be a problem.

We've got low pressure still rotating up around the Great Lakes but it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwestern states, the Northern Plains States all the way down to the Central Mississippi valley area. And then back up towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east. Also a few showers are popping up down around Florida.</p><p>Again, southeast slightly risky in terms of showers and storms.

Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program --</p><p>RUFINO: I'm still getting him.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you're still getting him.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes -- that little phony shoe thing.</p><p>IMUS: Vince Gill is coming up this morning, talk to him about some stuff, the state of country music and the state of Vince Gill.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's it.</p><p>IMUS: And then Neil Cavuto, he's going to be in. We'll talk to him about the state of the country, the economy and all that.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, there's big Romney interview.</p><p>IMUS: Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, FOX News contributor Juan Williams. Good morning, Mr. Williams.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR (on the phone): Good morning, Mr. Imus. I was worried for a second you forgot about me. You didn't know my name? What is this? What's going on over there?</p><p>IMUS: I'm thinking about two or three different things.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, what? You're thinking about beautiful women or something. I guess that's on your mind all the time.</p><p>IMUS: Trying to find my phone.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: (LAUGHING)</p><p>IMUS: You know what I'm reading, which is terrific is O'Reilly's \"Killing Kennedy.\"</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Did you read \"Killing Lincoln\"?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I did.</p><p>IMUS: And?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I liked it. You know, he gave me a copy early on, and I gave one to my son because I liked it so much. And I told him, you know, he can be reluctant even to accept praise, but yes, I thought it was pretty good.</p><p>IMUS: All right. I wasn't a big fan of that. I didn't read it all because \"Killing Kennedy,\" you know, I was talking about it -- do you mind talking about this or no?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No. Why would I mind talking about it?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't know. The difference is between, say, Walter Isaacson, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Doug Brinkley, and those people. They tell you about, you know, in the story they tell you about the Cuban missile crisis. So, they write about Khrushchev, O'Reilly does. And he describes him as 5'3,\" about 200 pounds, got a big old mole, gap in his teeth, murdering little bastard. But if it is Doris and all those other people, you've got 43 pages about where he grew up, his sister, his brother, his parent, I mean, stuff that maybe I want to know. But here's -- do you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin of Jack Kennedy?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think he was the lone assassin if you're asking who pulled the trigger, yes, I do. If you're asking were there other people involved who may have been backing Oswald, funding Oswald, you know, did Jack Ruby have any role to play there, I'm very suspicious of that.</p><p>IMUS: Well, here's what they're trying to do in the book which doesn't annoy me, but is they're trying to set Oswald up -- he describes on page 15, does O'Reilly, Oswald as a crack shot. Well, I was in the Marine Corps at the same time Oswald was.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: I was in from `57 to `59 on a two-year reserve program. Two years active duty and then reserve. He was in from `56 to `59. So, I qualified for the rifle -- in the same program as he did. And I barely qualified as a marksman. Then, there are three categories, marksman, sharpshooter and expert. So, O'Reilly describes Oswald as a sharpshooter. But in May of 1956, he qualified, did Oswald, barely two points into being designated a sharpshooter. In other words, two fewer points and he would have been a marksman, the lowest category. And then -- pardon me?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Hang on. Hang on. But wait a minute. The idea is he was a trained shooter, Imus.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I mean, so, OK, you can get into your gradations of how skilled he was. But I think Bill's point was this guy didn't just pick up a gun and he was, you know, some schlock who was trying out. I mean, he had been trained in how to fire and he had been qualified, I think that makes some compared to me for example who's never fired a gun.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK.</p><p>IMUS: OK. But don't sell him to me as a crack shot, which he was not. Because when he tried to assassinate General Walker, he missed him. He was 40 feet from him.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I love your point.</p><p>IMUS: And then he qualified again in 1959 just before he got out. And he qualified barely with a score of 191 as a marksman, the lowest designation. Two fewer points and he would not have qualified. So my only point is yes, he could shoot a rifle better than some bozo on the street. But don't try to sell him to me as being this expert crack shot, because he wasn't. So, that's it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right. You may know too much on this count. But anyway, your point is well taken. Especially -- but I think that the larger point is to the reader that this is a guy who was trained in how to shoot.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And as you point out, not only qualified once but qualified twice is the other way to interpret the exact same events that you just said make you doubt, you know, how good -- he was.</p><p>IMUS: Only an idiot like me would get bogged down in the minutia of that. All right. About the president, about Romney. Let me see if you're guy --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Do you really want to talk about that? Doesn't sound like it?</p><p>IMUS: Well, talk about what?</p><p>WILLIAMS: American presidential politics.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, I don't mind.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I know Romney is not doing so well and I figured you're going to be depressed and upset about it.</p><p>IMUS: I don't care. My job is to monitor the freak parade. And he's in it. Anyway, now has the President and the Secretary of State and the national security advisor and these other people, Susan Rice and the rest of them, have they decided now what the attack in Libya was? They first tried to sell it that it was the result of this YouTube movie, which every fool on the planet knew that wasn't the case, particularly falling on September 11. And now when the president is reluctant to use the word \"terrorist,\" I don't know if I've ever heard him utter that word, now they're acknowledging that it was a terrorist attack. So my question for you is, were they initially lying, one? Or did they not know, two? Or, three, were they just assuming or guessing? Or, four, were they waiting until they got more information and thought they would throw up a smoke screen to try to hoodwink us?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think that there was a strong sense that this was terrorism. But again, you know, they don't have a sense of Libya and I think the intelligence background necessary to lay things out. But if you're asking about whether or not they were reluctant to call terrorism what it is, I don't think there is any question. This has been a problem throughout the administration. You know, they talk about manmade disasters instead of terrorism.</p><p>I mean, but that has to do with a mind-set that, you know, again, caution about attacking people, especially Muslims and reluctance to embrace the idea that it's terrorism because somehow that would take us back to the Bush years of the war on terror and they don't want to do that. But that has been the mind-set with this folks from the start, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Who's the National Security advisor?</p><p>WILLIAMS: At the moment.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no. In October of 1922. Yes, at the moment, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: You know, it's Keith Alexander. Isn't that right, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: That is correct.</p><p>IMUS: OK. So, neither Bernie nor I had any idea who it was.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right. Well, I couldn't call the name. You got me.</p><p>IMUS: Well, wouldn't you think we could do better than that dope empty suit Romney or your guy?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You mean as Americans?</p><p>IMUS: Somebody to run this country?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. That's what I meant, as Americans. Well, you know, what? We've got political structure. And, you know, this is who's been nominated. And gosh, you know, if you look on the republican side, they went through a lot of people to get here, and this was the decision made. Well, I tell you, you know, yesterday's comment by Ann Romney, you know, stop questioning my husband. Stop the doubts. If you think you can do better, get in the ring, I thought some level of frustration over on that side.</p><p>IMUS: Are you a Christian?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I am.</p><p>IMUS: Are you ready to deal with Jesus maybe having a wife?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, I never had any trouble with it. In fact, you know, there's all these questions about whether or not, in the last supper, that drawing, you know, if that is a woman next to him. It seems to me inevitable. I mean, all the talk about not just Mary Magdalene, but I mean, you know, people that were described as prostitutes and outcasts and the like, I think he was, you know, fully human. Let me just say that, in human form. And I just think that part of being human is your sexuality.</p><p>IMUS: I got punked by Jesus the other day.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Now this is interesting. What happened to you?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I tore my rotator cuff and then suddenly it stopped hurting. And I thought thank you, God! Jesus! And then it started hurting again.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh no.</p><p>IMUS: So I got punked by Jesus.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, you know, you think you had some good times there for a minute. I mean, thank God you got some relief.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Well, now I'm OK, so.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, well, I'm glad to hear that.</p><p>IMUS: Behave yourself, Mr. Williams. I always love having you on.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I appreciate it. I appreciate it. And I'm going to just burn Tom Donilon's name into my head again. You know what I mean, I don't know why I forgot that name.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He is the national security advisor to the President. The director of the agency is the guy named General Keith Alexander.</p><p>MCSHANE: The NSA, right.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Thanks, you guys.

Robert, describe the scene for us.</p><p>ROBERT GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well Diane, you've got several hundred people lined up outside of the Apple store, normally they're open 24 hours a day seven days a week. They closed it last night just for the event, opens at 8:00 a.m.</p><p>And Jared here is kind enough to join us and tell us why you've been in line here all night long here just waiting to get in to buy the iPhone instead of going this afternoon.</p><p>JARED, APPLE CUSTOMER: I mean, it's about being here for the opening. You know it's about -- I made a couple friends in line. It's about being like the best Apple store in the country, you know.</p><p>It's a fun experience. It's a fun event. Everybody is having a good time. The line is starting to move so we're starting to get kind of excited.</p><p>GRAY: Yes you've got about an hour to go now. You've got your Willie Wonka golden ticket here. Are you pretty happy about that? And also you have to wait until 8 a.m. Local time. You just moved here from Tucson. Are you already ribbing your friends back home that you're going to have yours first?</p><p>JARED: Yes I did. I posted it on Facebook I've been kind of poking at them. I have a few friends that are like really Apple fanatics. And it's kind of a -- its kind of a fun jest. So I'm getting them back you know.</p><p>GRAY: Is there any one particular thing about the iPhone 5 that is drawing you to it aside from the fact that it's just the newest, the latest and greatest?</p><p>JARED: I really like what they've done from the body. The aluminum - - the aluminum body looks really sleek, it's going to be really nice. And the wider screen is -- you can't go wrong.</p><p>GRAY: And what about the connector? We've heard a lot of flap about this the new connector. You're going to have to get all new devices and you know the peripherals to go with it, like alarm clock, et cetera. Is that a problem for you?</p><p>JARED: It's not a problem. I mean, you know people try to jab where they can jab. But it's going to be great. I mean, iPhone, the connector has always been proprietary. It just they're better, they're making it better. They're improving. When technology moves, you've got to move with it. And that's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GRAY: All right.</p><p>JARED: -- that's what you do.</p><p>GRAY: All right, Jared we've got to move too. Diane so yes we'll be following all day for you there. The line is starting to move. Several hundred of folks as I mentioned lined up out here to pay anywhere from $200 up for the new iPhone. Back to you.</p><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Robert Gray making friends at the Apple store. Thanks Robert.</p><p>GRAY: Sure.</p><p>MACEDO: And we're getting earnings in from Darden restaurants now, the parent company of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster is reporting a profit of 85 cents a share just beating the estimate for 84 cents. Revenue came in at $2.03 billion. And that was right in line with what we were expecting.</p><p>Now on the day of the iPhone release, Blackberry is reporting an outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Blackberry announced the issue and postings on Facebook and Twitter and says it is urgently working to fix the problem.</p><p>Checking markets this morning here in the U.S. futures are up across the board, Dow futures are up by 30, the S&amp;P is up by about two, the NASDAQ is up by five. In Europe the Financial Times is reporting European Union Authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the ECB. Markets there are mixed with London and Paris both down, Frankfurt holding on to green territory by about six points.</p><p>Let's take a closer look now at what's moving the markets with James Hughes, senior market analyst at Alpari over in London. James the Greek government officials are holding another round of negotiations with creditors in hopes of agreeing to almost 12 billion euros worth of cutbacks. How do you expect this to play out?</p><p>JAMES HUGHES, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, ALPARI: I mean, I think we expect it to play out the same way that we've seen it's done in the past. I mean there's been a lot of negativity around what (inaudible). Greece trying to renegotiate these plans and the issue we've had is that they -- that they have an initial plan, initial measures we're put in place that Greece had to -- had to hit but the goal post has been moved so many times now. There always seems to be another renegotiation of -- of austerity or cuts.</p><p>And I mean we're hopeful of course that Greece is going to agree to something. And -- but I think whether they agree or not is not the key point. It's whether they stick to it which is the key point. And that's been an issue for this for a long time now.</p><p>MACEDO: All right that's James Hughes from Alpari in London. Thanks so much James.</p><p>HUGHES: All right.</p><p>MACEDO: Universal Music Group has won approval from EU antitrust regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion after the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record labels. Universal says the assets to be sold announced that 30 percent of EMI's global sales, Citigroup is selling EMI after it acquires the Music Group when buyout firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the investment bank.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities now oil and gold are both to the upside, oil is up by about 70 cents trading around $93 dollars a barrel. Gold is up almost $6 at $1,776 an ounce.</p><p>Coming up this hour, Imus's guest will be musician Vince Gill. Now here's the I-Man on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>MCCORD: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: I don't care (inaudible) as long as I got my blessed Jesus. (inaudible)</p><p>Hey, you know, regular civilians can't tell the difference in cowboy hats, like -- like Lupica, he has no idea whether a hat is good or not.</p><p>MCSHANE: Civilians.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: What? So Rob Bartlett, who has no idea about cowboy hats, he says to me, man, that's a great-looking hat.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh God.</p><p>IMUS: And that's the key.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: If a civilian can tell a hat's great, then it's great.</p><p>RUFINO: A layman.</p><p>MCSHANE: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: And I got it yesterday from the Man's Hat shop out in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Why am I plugging them? I'm not. How many hats can they sell? I mean hello?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes hello.</p><p>IMUS: But -- well, Stuart bought it for me and (inaudible) it out to the I-Man. Come on dude.</p><p>MCSHANE: Old Stuart.</p><p>MCGUIRK: All right, he's shaking the ladies off your leg stepping out of the building.</p><p>IMUS: Well the dude can make a hat. Vince Gill is coming up we're going to talk to him.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Neil Cavuto is here. So is Bill Clinton. Bill, how are you?</p><p>BARTLETT: I'm all right, I-Man.</p><p>IMUS: Mr. President I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTLETT: It's a good looking hat.</p><p>IMUS: And Tony Robbins, how are you?</p><p>POWELL: Good morning, Imus.</p><p>IMUS: Tony's here and Dagen and Carley and Lou Rufino and Bernard McGuirk and Warner Wolf and Gunz. What a couple of dopes.</p><p>WOLF: Come on.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh God.</p><p>IMUS: We like the Carolina Panthers.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: The Giants went down there and put a butt whipping on them 36- 7, 36-7 -- I woke up.</p><p>WOLF: That's right. I told Mike we should go --</p><p>IMUS: I woke up in the fourth quarter about -- fourth quarter just started. It was 26-7. The Carolina Panthers were driving. Apparently they didn't drive anywhere.</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: The Giants have put up 10 more.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So --</p><p>WOLF: The backups were great. That was the key.</p><p>IMUS: Oh you and Gunz should have anticipated that.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, we should have.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right.</p><p>IMUS: In fairness to you, those guys on the pregame show on the NFL network, Steve Mariucci, Rich Eisen, that dope Deion Sanders, that other dope Michael Irving. And I don't know who that other guy is. Who is that guy Lou?</p><p>WOLF: Marshall Faulk.</p><p>IMUS: Marshall Faulk.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh yes Marshall Faulk.</p><p>IMUS: Now they're all fine but they're dumb. Every single of them picked the Carolina Panthers -- everyone of them.</p><p>This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING incidentally is sponsored by \"The New York Times\" best-selling author, Mitch (inaudible) new book \"The Timekeeper\" the dude has sold 30 million books. That's a lot of money.</p><p>The Bernie Briefing, by the way, which I neglected to mention last hour, is sponsored by Ramsey Fiat, Route 17, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Go to RamseyFiat.com.</p><p>So I did mention that Vince Gill is coming up. We're going to chat with him. And then Neil Cavuto I ran into Neil downstairs and I had my little bottle of oxygen with me because I couldn't breathe.</p><p>MCSHANE: I know.</p><p>IMUS: So he was like terrified. Why don't you go home? Because I'm a man, that's why I didn't go home.</p><p>Time for the news now at eight minutes after the hour and here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, good morning, I-Man.</p><p>We'll start with the campaign. President Obama pressed on some of the failures in his first term, immigration and other things at a forum in Florida hosted by the Spanish language station Univision. The President says he's learned a few things over the past four years.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You can't change Washington from the inside. You can only change it from the outside. That's how I got elected. And that's how the big accomplishments like health care got done.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: I'm going to go to Robert Gray now. Do you care?</p><p>MCSHANE: No not really. Was that you screaming by the way?</p><p>IMUS: Yes do you have something else you want to say?</p><p>RUFINO: You have to ask.</p><p>MCSHANE: Romney campaigning across Florida real quick.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The President has already thrown in the white flag of surrender.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Suit dummy.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's all I have.</p><p>IMUS: All right, from Fox Business News, here's Robert Gray. Good morning, Mr. Gray.</p><p>GRAY: Hey, I-Man. Good morning.</p><p>IMUS: Where are you?</p><p>GRAY: I'm out in front of the Apple store on Fifth Avenue, and 59th Street, it's normally a 24/7 store here I-Man. You may have gone in the middle of the night but they actually closed it.</p><p>IMUS: Oh they did?</p><p>GRAY: So that they could create. Yes they wanted to manufacture a line. And as you know from back in the day, no one manufactures lines like they do here in New York.</p><p>IMUS: Yes I've actually been in that store a couple of times.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>BARTLETT: Really.</p><p>RUFINO: I'll be darned.</p><p>MCSHANE: Robert.</p><p>RUFINO: Say it, Robert. I'll be darned.</p><p>IMUS: Do you have something to report, Robert?</p><p>GRAY: Absolutely.</p><p>Yes, we're out here. Look, there are several hundred people lined up waiting for this new iPhone 5 to go on sale. It's coming out 8 a.m. folks will be rolling in. And they could sell as many as -- as many as 10 million of these by the end of this month alone.</p><p>IMUS: Ok we'll it's a very fine report. Thank you for that important information, Robert.</p><p>RUFINO: What a loser parade.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Those idiots have been camped out there for five nights --</p><p>GRAY: Some of these guys have been out here all week.</p><p>MCSHANE: Morons.</p><p>IMUS: Big Foot.</p><p>TOM BOWMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Yes sir.</p><p>IMUS: Have you lost your mind?</p><p>BOWMAN: What are you kidding? This is a great story today.</p><p>IMUS: But --</p><p>BOWMAN: And you personalized it as always.</p><p>IMUS: Do we have a unique situation here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program?</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: We have wall-wall-commercials which is how we keep doing this, which I'm happy that we do have.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: So we don't have an inordinate amount of time for Warner to go on and on about Yogi Berra or somebody or Miller Huggins or -- and you know I like Robert Gray. But you go to Robert Gray with no information. Well, I'm standing outside the store. Here we've got a few hundred people. Ok good, great.</p><p>MCSHANE: Robert Gray all the way.</p><p>RUFINO: Miller Huggins is waiting --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: I like Robert Gray. He is a terrific reporter. He's got a nice sense of humor. But he gave us zero information. We know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGUIRK: That isn't fair.</p><p>MCSHANE: Come on he talked about how many iPhones might be sold and that kind of thing.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes why -- why would these idiots camp out and not wait five, ten days and buy it in the store days later on?</p><p>IMUS: Who knows?</p><p>MCSHANE: Exactly.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well maybe he knows.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know why they do it Robert?</p><p>GRAY: Yes I do we've talked to several of these folks I-Man and some of these guys are big tech fans. And they wanted to be a part of the experience here and the first to have it. We just talked to a guy from Tucson. He wants to have it before his buddies. He's posting it on Facebook. He's going to have the newest, latest and greatest.</p><p>MCSHANE: There you go.</p><p>GRAY: And these guys like to have the faster processor, bigger screen. Some of the other phones have already had that for six to nine months so the iPhone is playing catch-up here.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right, there you go.</p><p>IMUS: Robert Gray, the Fox Business Network. Live outside the 59th and Fifth at the Apple store.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Good report dude.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well done Robert.</p><p>IMUS: 12 minutes after the hour. Please stop calling people dude, Imus. It's 12 after the hour. Let's do a little new, more news. And here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, good morning I-Man. Well, the campaign moves to Nevada today where Mitt Romney will be campaigning, in Virginia where President Obama will be holding a rally.</p><p>IMUS: You shut up.</p><p>MCSHANE: Here are some numbers that are in, Obama leads the \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC News swing state poll. He's up eight in Iowa, five in Wisconsin and Colorado. The Gallup Daily tracking poll though, dead heat, 47 percent a piece around the country for Mitt Romney and President Obama.</p><p>There are protests today taking place in Pakistan. In fact they've -- they've named it a national day of protests there over this anti-Muslim movie that was produced here in the United States. And the government in Pakistan actually disabling cell phone service, some of their major cities are trying to prevent phones from being used in detonating bombs.</p><p>And then in Syria, President Bashar Assad talking tough, an Egyptian magazine reporting that Assad predicts the defeat of the armed opposition that foreign intervention like the one in Libya will not be repeated there, he said. This, as at least 30 are reported dead in the northern part of the country. Government airstrikes reportedly hit a gas station and caused a huge explosion in Syria.</p><p>Then the surge is over in Afghanistan. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says the 33,000 additional troops that were sent a couple of years ago to Afghanistan have now pulled out of the country. He calls it a very important milestone, says the surge accomplished its goals in Afghanistan.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Really.</p><p>MCSHANE: And one other thing for you, I-Man. The Emmys this Sunday but Kelsey Grammar not a nominee. Critics and fans of Grammar's stars show \"Boss\" have agreed that he was snubbed when these Emmy nominations were announced. He recently suggested that his conservative political leanings were the reason.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>KELSEY GRAMMER, ACTOR: I did speculate about the fact that maybe I'm a pretty well outed conservative in Hollywood and maybe there's some energy there. But you know I've since come to think that it hasn't gotten out there enough. I don't know.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: There you go. Well, Kelsey Grammer thinks he was snubbed there I-Man for the Emmys. And those are your --</p><p>MCGUIRK: No justice, no peace.</p><p>MCSHANE: -- exactly, right, your headlines this morning.</p><p>IMUS: All right, hey, Big Foot, load up Tony Robbins and Lady Gaga, ok?</p><p>BOWMAN: Yes sir.</p><p>IMUS: Let's do a business report now at 14 after the hour. And here with that, just ahead of Vince Gill and Bernie with a briefing and Warner with sports is Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p>Did you know that the new iPhone 5 goes on sale this morning at 8 a.m.? Maybe we could take a live look at the Apple store here in midtown Manhattan for the lines of people.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Don't be mean.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All those -- you know why those doofuses line up? Because they've got no woman at home and they've got to be one of the first of their friends to get the new iPhone 5.</p><p>IMUS: They either don't have a woman at home or they've got a woman at home like you.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Or the only woman at home is their mom.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, the I-Man.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what; no truer thing has ever been said.</p><p>RUFINO: I'll wait on this line for four days to get away from her.</p><p>IMUS: Let's go here.</p><p>RUFINO: Is that Jonas?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, it's going to set records.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Ok. That big race in New Hampshire, Nascar this weekend? All right, second race with the chase or whatever</p><p>MCDOWELL: I do have something though. The iPhone sells like it does because Blackberry stinks to high heaven. And Blackberry service is actually out today in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. So there is justice in this world.</p><p>IMUS: All right. A quarter after the hour. Let's do some sports. No, first let's go to Tony Robbins who has some thoughts about Lady Gaga. Good morning, Mr. Robbins.</p><p>POWELL: Good morning, Imus. Lady Gaga is having a physical crisis. She recently put on a couple of pounds. Who am I kidding? I saw her in concert with that big hat and those big glasses. I thought she was Cee Lo Green. She's gone from doing well-choreographed routines to the electric slide. Apparently it's not as taxing.</p><p>Gaga claims that she gained weight eating delicious food at her father's Italian restaurant in Manhattan. That's a relief. I'm glad she wasn't eating her dresses. A bacon muumuu has got to be like what -- 50,000 calories. Eating her clothes would certainly qualify as an unhealthy relationship with food.</p><p>Gaga lives, breathes, sleeps and eats music. She's passionate about music and obviously. I told her to combine her loves. She took my advice and started writing her sheet music on sheet cakes. Share your music with the world but share your cakes with friends. That's the out of the box statement that's made her a superstar.</p><p>Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible. Lady Gaga's goals to go from being an unknown artist to being well, the biggest thing in music. I'd say we've got that covered.</p><p>IMUS: Tony Robbins here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>All right. Let's do sports at 16 minutes after the hour. Just ahead of Vince Gill later on this morning and Neil Cavuto.</p><p>Sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers. Here with sports, best sportscaster in the country, Warner Wolf. Good morning Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Thank you very much. Good morning I-Man. Thursday night football in Charlotte. The Giants beat the Panthers, 36-7. It was the story of the backups. Running back Andre Brown playing for Ahmad Bradshaw -- 113 yards, 20 carries, 2 touchdowns; and wide receiver Ramses Barden playing in place of Hakeem Nicks, 9 receptions for 138 yards. Eli, 288 yards, 1 touchdown, no interceptions; Lawrence Tynes kicks 5 field goals.</p><p>Cam Newton trailing 23-0 in the third quarter and obviously thinking a touchdown was worth 23 points, scored on a 1-yard touchdown and then went into his superman celebration. Come on, Cam.</p><p>Baseball: Yankees beat the Jays --</p><p>IMUS: I tell Wyatt that all the time. You put up an 8 in roping, don't throw your hat.</p><p>WOLF: Right.</p><p>IMUS: Act like you've been there before.</p><p>WOLF: That's right. That's what Tom Landry said, right.</p><p>RUFINO: What an idiot.</p><p>IMUS: What a dope.</p><p>RUFINO: Oh God.</p><p>WOLF: Yanks sweep the Jays. Ichiro, a home run, a double, he's 9 for his last 12.</p><p>IMUS: That guy is great.</p><p>WOLF: Oh man. He's on fire.</p><p>IMUS: And apparently New York is -- well, come on dude.</p><p>WOLF: Well, they lead by one. Both have 13 to play.</p><p>And before a bogus announced crowd of 20,000 at City Field, the Phillies scored 8 in the first, 9 -- 7 in the 9th and beat the Mets 16-1. The Mets are only 4 in 25 at home since the all-star break.</p><p>IMUS: Wow.</p><p>WOLF: Boise state beat BYU, 7-6. BYU scored a touchdown, three and a half minutes left, went for the 2-point conversion and missed.</p><p>Wait a minute. Stop the music.</p><p>IMUS: All right.</p><p>WOLF: Finally there may be a long-awaited Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao fight.</p><p>IMUS: Wow.</p><p>WOLF: Pacquiao who, by the way, has to fight Juan Manuel Marquez for the fourth time --</p><p>IMUS: Yes, fourth time.</p><p>WOLF: -- has agreed, number one, to give Mayweather --</p><p>IMUS: Want to have more time -- they're ruining marriages .</p><p>WOLF: He's agreed to give Mayweather a 55-45 split, Mayweather getting the 55 rather than the 50-50.</p><p>Number two, Pacquiao says he will agree to Mayweather's demand that he take the Olympic-style drug test which includes the blood test.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Yes, sure.</p><p>WOLF: The only drawback is when the fight occurs Mayweather will be 36 and Pacquiao 34.</p><p>In golf, you have the top 30 golfers in the world at that FedEx Cup playoff. Tiger Woods and Justin Rose share the lead, 4 under 66.</p><p>And finally, I-Man, our old friend Jerry Jones agrees with Buccaneers coach Greg Schiano that it's ok for a team to go for the ball when the other team is kneeling down to run out the clock. Jones says the kneel- down is a wasted play, should be outlawed. And if a team doesn't run a play, they should be penalized.</p><p>IMUS: We're trying to win. When we're out there on the field, out there -- we're trying to win. And we're the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>We didn't win in Seattle, and that sucked. So I went to the (inaudible) bar. What are you going to do?</p><p>It's 20 minutes after the hour. Thank you very much, Warner. There's a briefing coming up. What's there, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: President Obama grilled by this Spanish language TV station host.</p><p>And another secret Paris Hilton tape revealed. We have the tape.</p><p>IMUS: One of the great songs Vince Gill ever wrote or recorded. It was a huge hit for the boy. It was a huge hit -- \"Pocket Full of Gold\", about a guy, he's married and goes in the bar somewhere and he takes that ring off his finger.</p><p>I do that when I go to the titty bar. I have a pocket full of gold.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo.</p><p>And General Motors is recalling more than 426,000 ChevroletPontiac and Saturn sedans in the U.S. due to a transmission problem. The recall affects vehicles from model years 2007 to 2010. The auto maker says the transmission gear position may not match the gear on the shift gear and that causes vehicles to move when drivers think they're in park. GM says it's aware of four crashes due to the problem, but no injuries reported so far.</p><p>Here's a look at futures now, we are seeing them up across the board; Dow futures up by 38, the S&amp;P is up by 3 and the Nasdaq is up about 6. Commodities are also to the upside.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Jesus had a ball and chain. Jesus had a ball and chain. You know, they found this.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: This historian of early Christianity up there at Harvard Divinity School, the girl found a scrap of march weed or whatever the hell it was papyrus -- is that what we call it?</p><p>MCSHANE: yes.</p><p>IMUS: Written in the fourth century containing the phrase that we've never seen in any piece of scripture and it's Jesus, and he said unto them, \"My wife\".</p><p>MCSHANE: Whoa.</p><p>IMUS: What up, girl?</p><p>MCSHANE: Wow.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, so that that. And man -- what's that, godfather?</p><p>BARTLETT: I need the Christ to come on over for coffee tonight.</p><p>POWELL: I wonder whose name she called out when they were making love.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, no.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: All right. 28 after the hour; we'll talk to Vince Gill in a couple of minutes.</p><p>First, this Bernie Briefing is sponsored by Ramsey Fiat, Route 17, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Go to RamseyFiat.com. Here's Bernard McGuirk. What up, B.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, President Obama, boss, candidate Barack Obama back in 2008 promised in no uncertain terms that he would pass a comprehensive immigration reform. He had a Democratic Congress for two years. In any case he's on Univision yesterday and host, Jorge Ramos, again, the Spanish inquisition. He hammered the President on this and listen to the President's answer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JORGE RAMOS, HOST, UNIVISION: A promise is a promise. And with all due respect you didn't keep that promise.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Here is what I would say Jorge, is that we've had this conversation before. There's a thinking that the President is somebody who is all powerful and can get everything done. In our branch-- in our system of government, I am the head of the executive branch. I'm not the head of the legislature. I'm not the head of the judiciary. We have to have cooperation from all these sources in order to get something done. And so, I am happy to take responsibility for the fact that we didn't get it done, but I didn't make a promise that I would get everything done 100 percent when I was elected as president.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Of course not.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, we can. No, we can't.</p><p>IMUS: Come on here.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Anyway, there's another secret tape scandal out here boss. This time -- first it was Mitt Romney. Now it's your girl, Paris Hilton.</p><p>IMUS: My girl?</p><p>MCGUIRK: everybody's girl, come on.</p><p>IMUS: Ok.</p><p>MCGUIRK: You know you love that tape, the first one she was in. Now, she was in a taxi back during fashion week here in Manhattan and this cab driver actually taped her and her gay friend -- the gay friend was telling her about a guy he know who has AIDS and has unprotected sex, this, that and the other. And she said some stuff that's getting her into a little bit of trouble.

What is she saying, Berne?</p><p>MCGUIRK: She said gay guys are the horniest people in the world. They're disgusting. Dude, most of them probably have AIDS.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: She said in the taxi that --</p><p>IMUS: That's not good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Some dude was, you know, Mohammad there was rolling on while she had the conversation.</p><p>IMUS: Just don't be hating on everybody, baby. All right.</p><p>Anything else, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, I'm done.</p><p>IMUS: It's 30 minutes past the hour.</p><p>I was talking to Kinky Friedman yesterday. Kinky refuses to use a computer. Won't text. Won't e-mail. So there's no way to stay in touch with him. I mean, you can call him. But we were talking about Dwight Yoakam's new record. So, I said, have you heard \"Waterfall\"? And Kinky said, I love it to death. It's just -- all right.</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network. And now here's Diane Macedo.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>KB Home is reporting a surprise profit after two quarters of losses as home prices recovered. The fifth largest home builder says it made 4 cents a share in its third quarter. The company was expected to lose 16 cents a share, but revenue came in a little light at $424.5 million. The estimate was for $430 million. KB Home says potential future housing revenue rose to a four year high and home deliveries climbed 7 percent from last year to more than 1,700. Shares are higher in the pre-market.</p><p>More companies, meanwhile, are rewarding their shareholders with higher quarterly dividends. McDonald's is hiking its quarterly payout by 10 percent to 77 cents a share. Texas Instruments is boosting its dividend by 24 percent to 21 cents a share. And Covidien is increasing its quarterly dividend by 16 percent to 26 cents a share.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right after we check the weather now with Fox 5 meteorologist Mike Woods.</p><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>Looks like we have some wet weather out there, but not a ton of it for the country here. We've got an area of low pressure still rotating up around the Great Lakes but it's bringing showers from the upper Midwestern states, the northern plains states, all the way down into the central Mississippi Valley area and then back up toward the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east.</p><p>Also a few showers are popping up down around Florida. Again, the southeast slightly risky in terms of showers and storms. Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms. High temp today 88 degrees. Phoenix, no rain for you. Sunny skies with the high of 103. Seattle, partly cloudy skies with a high of 63. Sacramento, California, you've got sunny skies there today with a high of 91. Still warm.</p><p>I'm Mike Woods from Fox 5 in New York.</p><p>IMUS: It's 22 minutes till the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Please welcome to the program, I don't want to embarrass him, but one of the great country singers of all time, songwriters, Vince Gill.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Gill.</p><p>GILL: How you doing, Donny?</p><p>IMUS: I'm fine. How are you?</p><p>GILL: I'm good. Good to see you.</p><p>IMUS: Fine. Fine. Nice to see you. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>GILL: You bet.</p><p>IMUS: So I was talking this morning, not to patronize you, which I wouldn't do, I said there's a few people who sing who I'd have come in just to talk. You're one of them.</p><p>GILL: Well, thanks.</p><p>IMUS: Do you like Dwight Yoakam?</p><p>GILL: I do. I always have. He's a good guy.</p><p>IMUS: A smart guy, too.</p><p>GILL: Yes. Smart as a whip.</p><p>IMUS: Crazy. Crazy.</p><p>GILL: He's a little bit crazy, but most talented people are just one tick shy of nuts.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, but good crazy.</p><p>GILL: It's a good crazy.</p><p>IMUS: Kinky Friedman, Delbert McClinton.</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And -- but like Montgomery Gentry, I love them, but -- man, they can't put two words together.</p><p>GILL: I wouldn't know.</p><p>IMUS: You know what I've learned --</p><p>GILL: It's a political year. No comment.</p><p>IMUS: Well, here's the -- I'm the worst kind of country disc jockey. Really that's what I am at heart.</p><p>GILL: Well, you're one of the last people on earth that love music.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: That's why I love coming seeing you. You know, when I got a new record or something's exciting going on, because I know you'll get it and I know you'll, you know, you'll enjoy it.</p><p>IMUS: I just got Dwight's new -- do you care if we talk about other artists?</p><p>GILL: No, I don't.</p><p>IMUS: I just got his new record. It is fabulous.</p><p>GILL: Yes, I've heard. I haven't heard it yet, but I've heard people raving about it. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>IMUS: Got a song called \"Waterfall\" that's --</p><p>GILL: I heard a little bit of that.</p><p>IMUS: That's clever, isn't it?</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So -- and -- because Dwight, he's a man who, when he went out with Sharon Stone, you know, she described him as a dirt sandwich.</p><p>GILL: About as much fun as a dirt sandwich.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, have you ever heard of the Christian rock group Striker.</p><p>GILL: Yes, I have.</p><p>IMUS: OK. This is a tedious story. Maybe it's not tedious. But when my brother, God bless him, and -- was working with the railroad as a breakman, his partner was Phil Sweet.</p><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: And Fred and Phil wrote a song called \"I Don't Want To Have To Marry You\" when they were working for the railroad.</p><p>GILL: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And they eventually got it cut. And it went to number one and all that stuff. And Phil married a woman named Janice. And he's a great guy. They live in Las Vegas. And they had two sons, Michael and Robert, and they are Striker.</p><p>GILL: Oh, I didn't know that.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: That's neat.</p><p>IMUS: And Christian rock, they are.</p><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: And then Michael spent the last -- the past two summers going out singing lead for Boston. It's a small world, isn't it?</p><p>GILL: Yes, it is. You know, ever since I married Amy, everybody thinks I know everything about Christian music, but I don't. I wish I did.</p><p>IMUS: Well, Amy Grant won a -- won the -- everybody in the country had a crush on her when she was --</p><p>GILL: Oh, yes.</p><p>IMUS: I remember all -- I remember all these disc jockeys over at NBC years ago. I met Frank Reed -- I don't know if you remember his name or not -- he used to tell me -- he said, have you heard Amy Grant? And I said, no. He said, oh, man, come on here.</p><p>So, what's new with you?</p><p>GILL: Not much. After I married Amy, I used to have to fight my way out of the bars. Now I have to fight my way out of the churches being married to her.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, you built a studio at home.</p><p>GILL: I did. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Isn't a studio now just pretty much your laptop or no?</p><p>GILL: Well, pretty much. I mean it can be. But I went a little further than that. Not as big as a commercial studio, but enough to track. And it's really fun because we all kind of gather around in a room and play music together instead of sequester each other off in a booth somewhere where you can't see each other and we're all just playing together. And it's been the greatest experience, this new record, the \"Time Jumpers\" record, that -- I started playing with this band about two and a half years ago. And they're a western swing band.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: Me being from Oklahoma, I was crazy -- I've always been crazy for Bob Wills music and that swing stuff and they would ask me to come in and occasionally sit in and fill in and, you know, if a guitar player couldn't make it, they'd call me up and sub. And little by little they grew confidence in me and said, hey, you want to be in the band. A couple guys quit. And I said, sure. It would be fun. So I talked them into making a record at the house and we decided to put it out. I said, man, we could make a record for nothing. It would be a blast. And so away we went.</p><p>IMUS: Talking with Vince Gill here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Weren't you originally in Pure Prairie League?</p><p>GILL: A long time ago. Yes, 33 years ago.</p><p>IMUS: And before that?</p><p>GILL: I played with a guy named Byron Berline. A really great fiddle player. Lived in Los Angeles. Was a session player. Played on Rolling Stones' records and Birds records and all kind of great rock records and was the go-to guy for fiddle out on the West Coast forever and ever and ever. And he had an opening and I was 18 or 19. We moved out there as a kid and started out there.</p><p>IMUS: You just played guitar for a long time, right?</p><p>GILL: Yes. Still do.</p><p>IMUS: No, I know you do. But, I mean, I guess you knew you could sing, but nobody else did or did they?</p><p>GILL: Well, a lot of times those gigs I would get would be because I could sing, too, you know, and in those days if you could find somebody that could multi-task, I guess would be a good word for it, and do a bunch of different stuff, you were a better asset to a band. And so I was always able to play a little bit of everything and could fill in whatever was needed.</p><p>IMUS: What's the state of country music in your view?</p><p>GILL: It's interesting.</p><p>IMUS: You like it or no?</p><p>GILL: I'm not crazy about it. But I'm not supposed to. I'm 55 years old and I'm supposed to like, what, you know, my era did and the era before me. I don't -- I don't dislike it, I just don't necessarily believe that it's -- it's -- the term country music fits it so much.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>GILL: But, you know, they're young kids and they're following their muse, they're do what they love and I've got no -- I've got no bitterness towards them at all.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm 72 and I be loving that \"Pontoon\" record by Little Big Town.</p><p>GILL: Oh, isn't that cool?</p><p>IMUS: That's a good record, man.</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I like Jason Aldean. Come on.</p><p>GILL: Yes, he's fun.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: You know, they're rocking, they're -- you know, they're kind of -- they're pretty -- pretty brash. They're, you know, party time and all that stuff. That's just, you know, it's not for me. It's not that I don't like it.</p><p>IMUS: Jamey Johnson, of course, he's --</p><p>GILL: Great songwriter.</p><p>IMUS: Speaking about being out where the buses don't run. So -- but he's great, isn't he?</p><p>GILL: He is.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p>GILL: He's a great throwback, you know.</p><p>IMUS: How do you really think is great?</p><p>GILL: Oh, well, I like -- I -- actually, there's a lot of people I love. I think Carrie Underwood sings her brains out.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>GILL: Yes. She's a great singer.</p><p>IMUS: I just can't take that screaming.</p><p>GILL: Well, she does -- she will sing hard, but that's -- you've got understand, that's what people are -- that's what they're learning. That's what they're singing.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: From \"Star Search\" and \"American Idol.\" All these shows. It's like grandiose and the big finish and, you know, it's --</p><p>IMUS: I listened to something the other day that -- a duet you did with her. It's good.</p><p>GILL: Oh, the \"How Great Thou Art\" thing?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: That was nice.</p><p>IMUS: Are you really religious? I mean --</p><p>GILL: To some degree, I guess. Probably not to the level of probably what the expectation is of me because I'm married to Amy.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>GILL: I feel like a novice, you know, because I haven't had a church life in my adult life. I did as a kid, but my adult life was never conducive to it, only because of my work. I was gone every weekend.</p><p>IMUS: But you believe Jesus is the Son of God?</p><p>GILL: I do.</p><p>IMUS: OK. And like Mojo Nixon says about Elvis, Elvis is everywhere. And I believe Jesus is everywhere. I mean -- I also know, though, however, not that anybody asked me, but I respect all other religions as well. I --</p><p>GILL: Me, too.</p><p>IMUS: See, I don't think there's just one way to get there.</p><p>GILL: Well, I've traveled the world enough to -- you know, it just seems -- it doesn't seem logical that other parts of the world would know this way. You know, maybe I'm wrong. I have been before.</p><p>IMUS: And now are you prepared for this new information that Jesus may have had a wife.</p><p>GILL: I heard. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: My observation was, if -- wasn't it her job then to come up with a (INAUDIBLE) -- just idiotic.</p><p>GILL: That explains the missing years.</p><p>IMUS: You know Billy Joe Shaver?</p><p>GILL: A little bit, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. I think he's one of the great songwriters ever.</p><p>GILL: I do too. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But there's somebody who is certifiably -- but a sweet man. My (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>GILL: Yes, that's my -- you know, that's really my era of the people I love were guys like him, Guy Clark, Jerry Jeff and Rodney Crowell and just those really great songwriters from the '60s and '70s, (INAUDIBLE) Van Zant and Emmy Lou was a great, great mentor to me, and teaching me what great songs were like and who great song writers were, so, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Bill Anderson, one of the great songwriters ever.</p><p>GILL: No question. Most recorded, probably, in the history of country music.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. I love him.</p><p>GILL: Even more so than Harlan or any of the others. So, I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: God, wasn't he great, Harlan Howard. Oh, my God. Please.</p><p>GILL: Yes. We were good buddies. You know, when I first moved to Nashville, we were great friends and I would sing all of his demos for him, $10 a song.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man.</p><p>GILL: There was tons of demos of Harlan's and we were great friends.</p><p>IMUS: Before he died, he sent me a CD that he cut of all of his songs.</p><p>GILL: Wow.</p><p>IMUS: That he had written. He just dubbed, you know, (INAUDIBLE). I mean, just everything that he did. And, oh, my God, what a great song.</p><p>GILL: He's a great man. You know, when I was first getting started, he pulled me aside and he said, kid, you're one hell of a guitar player. And I said, well, thanks, Harlan. And he says, and you're a pretty good songwriter, but you're one hell of a guitar player, one hell of a singer, and a pretty good song writer. I said, I get what you're saying.</p><p>IMUS: So you have a new record?</p><p>GILL: Not me, the \"Time Jumpers.\"</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>GILL: This band does. It came out last week.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe I could pay attention.</p><p>GILL: No, that's cool. I mean it's a fun record. You would really love this record if you like Bill Wills and that swing music. It's an 11 piece bad full of arguably some of the best talent that's ever graced instruments in Nashville, Tennessee. All side me. All guys that played for other people. Session players, things like that. All wanted to have fun on Monday night. So we got together and -- years ago, they did, and started playing every Monday night just for the love of it and fun of it. And we still are. We just made a record.</p><p>IMUS: I can take a little bit of Bob Wills, but it's my contention -- and I know I'm right -- that nobody likes blue grass music, including the people who play it.</p><p>GILL: I think you might get a wrestling match over that one.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, I'm sure I will.</p><p>It's great to see you.</p><p>GILL: You too.</p><p>IMUS: It's an honor to have you on the program.</p><p>GILL: Thanks.</p><p>IMUS: You're one of my favorites. You're one of everybody's favorites, so - -</p><p>GILL: Well, right back at you.</p><p>IMUS: My wife loves you and my 14-year-old kid loves you and a lot of people do.</p><p>GILL: I appreciate it.</p><p>IMUS: The great Vince Gill.</p><p>You know I played that \"Go Rest High on the Mountains\" you wrote for your brother.</p><p>GILL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And I -- and thanks for the money you sent to the ranch when Fred died. But --</p><p>GILL: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: He's been dead a year. It's still hard to talk about him. I try --</p><p>GILL: I know.</p><p>IMUS: I played your record. I tried to talk about it and --</p><p>GILL: Yes, my brother's been gone for 20 years. You know, hard to believe. But, you know, that's --</p><p>IMUS: Why do we -- what is it? Is it -- why do we -- why does people dying have that effect on us? It's part of life.</p><p>GILL: Yes. It's because you miss them.</p><p>IMUS: Is it?</p><p>GILL: Yes. I do.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, I guess that is. I mean we're not -- yes, I guess that's what it is.</p><p>All right, man, it's great to see you.</p><p>GILL: You too, buddy.</p><p>IMUS: Vince Gill.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>We have an update on that Blackberry outage. Research In Motion says service has been restored and things are back to normal. The company had reported an outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p><p>Checking the markets now. Stocks in Asia rose as the release of that new iPhone gave the telecom sector a boost. Hong Kong led the way with a 0.7 percent gain. In Europe, the Financial Times is reporting European Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank. Markets there are currently mixed. London still to the downside by about three points, but Paris is back in the green, up almost 10 points and Frankfurt's up by 51.</p><p>Here in the U.S., we've had green arrows across the board all morning. Dow futures are up by 43, the S&amp;P's up by about four, and the Nasdaq's up by seven.</p><p>So now that Apple's iPhone 5 is available, we're also finding out what exactly makes this smartphone work. The repair firmiFixit got its hands on one, pried it open and found that the device uses chips from Qualcomm, Avego Technologies and Skyworks Solutions. The phone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus Logic. And its gyroscope, which is used to track the orientation, was made by STMicroelectronics. You can keep an eye on stocks of those companies and those who didn't contribute to the iPhone 5 to see how they react today.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities now. Oil and gold are to the upside. Oil's up by about 60 cents, around $93 a barrel. Gold's up $6 at $1,776 an ounce.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: IMUS IN THE MORNING continues here in the next hour with Neil Cavuto from the Fox Business Network. He had a recent interview with Mitt Romney here. So we'll talk to -- the I-man will talk to Neil about all that's going on in the world.</p><p>And this portion of IMUS IN THE MORNING is brought to you by \"A Wanted Man\" by Lee Child, now available in hard cover and e-book from Delacorte. Now five minutes till the hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Here with -- with some thoughts on pot --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Is Brian Wilson, on the genius of the Beach Boys.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Wilson.</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Good morning, Opie.</p><p>I hear there's a movement to decriminalize marijuana, which is good, because pot never did anything criminal to anybody, just made them feel good. People say it's a gateway drug, which I guess it is. It's a gateway to a beautiful world of pretty flowers and beautiful music and little bunnies who sing pretty songs and give out candy.</p><p>But it's not like you're going to smoke a doobie and next thing you know you're mainlining smack or anything. Of course it depends on how strong your dope is. Like I just got a lid of northern lights white widow wonder woman. You don't even have to smoke it. You just hold a butt in your hand for 10 minutes and once the oil gets into your pours, you're a bottle rocket, man. I think it also might have been sprayed with PCP and Easy Off, because after I did a half a bong's worth last night, a genie appeared and told me my oven was magically cleaned.</p><p>But legalization would be good for the economy, not just for the tax they could collect on the (INAUDIBLE) itself, but for all the sales of paraphernalia. It'd create jobs making rolling papers, Zip-loc bags, Twinkies. If they had made weed legal, we could balance a budget by 4:20 the next afternoon.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: Nice.</p><p>BARTLETT: And I'll be sitting in my sandbox with my KCO keyboard writing a new song for the cute little bunny who gives out the candy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. Apple fans around the world are lining up to get their hands on the iPhone 5 which hits store shelves around the world today here in New York City.</p><p>The door should be opening sooner, and Robert Gray is standing by at Apple's fifth avenue store. Robert, what is it like out there?</p><p>ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS: Well, Diane, I don't know if you can hear the cheers, they're audible behind me.</p><p>Apple employees are outside, greeting the first of the 500 folks who have been camping out here.</p><p>And the crowd has been swelling as the sun has being rising over Manhattan this morning, waiting to get in to buy the iPhone 5.</p><p>The store behind me is not only open 24 hours, seven days a week, they did close it last night.</p><p>Not opening until 8 a.m., that is the time that each Apple store in each time zone has been opening in local time.</p><p>So, we've had folks here from Arizona, saying that they're facebooking and tweeting their friends back in Arizona.</p><p>Boasting that they're going to get their hands on the iPhone before those guys can. And you can hear the crowd starting to cheer even more there, as I said, some 500 folks here.</p><p>The new iPhone 5 -- sold out two million, pre-selling in an hour's time. It's expected to be the fastest and widest rollout yet for Apple, nine nations have the iPhone selling it.</p><p>That's the most to participate in it and what we've seen and, analysts saying that they've stocked piled as many as 10 million units, that's about $6.4 billion worth of inventory by the way.</p><p>And they're expected according to some analysts to sell as many as 10 million, Ben Stevens saying, they could sell 13 million before the end of this month.</p><p>Now, the new phone does boosts faster, processing speed, it works on the 4 GLTE network where you can get that.</p><p>It also -- it has an enhanced camera, the Siri voice command, it would give you turn-by-turn navigation, you can post to Facebook.</p><p>You can also book reservations on open table but critics point to the mapping features saying that they're incomplete, there's been some errors there, and a lot of hoopla and negative flap about the connectors.</p><p>Which have short meaning that all of those i-gadgets you have there, work with iPhones, you're going to have to go out and buy new ones, although there're some analysts who say we're moving to Bluetooth.</p><p>Anyway, it may not be a big issue, down the line it will be though immediately and Diane, we should also point out a robust secondary market for iPhones.</p><p>If you have an iPhone 4s, still under warranty, there are websites out there, vili.com is one and the CEO telling me, they've seen interest triple in the past week alone.</p><p>You'll get about 260 bucks for your old iPhone 4s, that will about cover the fees, you don't have to pay AT&amp;T to upgrade.</p><p>If you're going to buy one, you can get one, it'll cost you about 300 bucks, but that's still less than the new ones.</p><p>Which started 199 with a two-year contract. Back to you.</p><p>MACEDO: All right, that's Robert Gray outside the Apple store, thanks, Robert.</p><p>GRAY: You're welcome.</p><p>MACEDO: And as Apple focuses on the release of the iPhone 5, Research In Motion is focusing on a blackberry outage.</p><p>The company now says service has been restored and things are back to normal after reporting an earlier outage affecting users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p><p>Let's look at the markets now, here in the U.S., Futures have been in the green across the board all morning, Dow Futures are now up by about 41 points, the S&amp;P is up by almost four, the Nasdaq is up by eight.</p><p>In Europe, the financial times is reporting European Union Authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p>You can see markets there are currently mixed, and now let's take a closer look at what's moving them with European markets analyst Jan Randolph.</p><p>He's a director of Sovereign Risk at IHS Global Insight. Now Jan, according to this financial times report, Spain and these European authorities that it's talking to, are hoping to unveil this bailout plan possibly in about a week.</p><p>How do you expect investors to respond if that happens?</p><p>JAN RANDOLPH, DIRECTOR, SOVEREIGN RISK, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT: I think positively.</p><p>I think they're expecting it, I think the lower borrowing costs we've seen from Spain, in anticipation of the ECB bond buying and the bailout fund being made available.</p><p>I think it will be a bailout light though, not a fully fledged bailout though, that will be far too much money.</p><p>The trick, you can call it that, is to keep private sector on board in terms of refinancing the Spanish state and to encourage more.</p><p>I think that's the trick and I think the package will be designed for that purpose.</p><p>MACEDO: All right, we'll see if they can do that. That's Jan Randolph at IHS, thanks so much, Jan.</p><p>RANDOLPH: Thank you.</p><p>MACEDO: And Universal Music Group has won approval from EU anti-trust regulators to buy EMI's recording music unit for $1.9 billion. After the Vivendi owned company promised to sell some of EMI's most valuable record labels.</p><p>Universal says the assets to be sold amount to 30 percent of EMI's global sales. Citigroup is selling EMI after they acquired the music group when Vita firm Terra Firma defaulted on loans owed to the investment bank.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities now, oil and gold still up, oil is up by about 74 cents around $93 a gallon. Gold is up 6 bucks at 1,776 an ounce.</p><p>Coming up this hour, Imus' guest will be our own Neil Cavuto and now, here's the i-man live on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>IMUS: So big foot says to me, of all the people we've ever had on the program, two of the nicest, perhaps the nicest, Vince Gill --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: And Levon Helm. So, Vince Gill is, that man, that's an American treasure there, I'll tell you that right now.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, here's what I'm trying to understand, Bernard, Connell, anybody. Warner, anybody? Dagen? First, the administration said, regarding the attack on Libya.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: That it was all the fault of this hideous movie that was on YouTube and -- then we had people like K.T. McFarland and others on this program say, that they believed the attack was essentially nonsense.</p><p>Although it may have served as a convenient excuse, but the anniversary of 9/11 had a lot more to do with it.</p><p>And now we're being told, I guess, that no, the administration now says, well, it was a terrorist attack.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, here is my question. Did they know that -- did the President use the word terrorist, by the way?</p><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Has he ever?</p><p>MCSHANE: Has he ever used the word period?</p><p>IMUS: Yes, does he believe that there's terrorism in the world?</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, yes, he's used --</p><p>IMUS: Sure --</p><p>MCSHANE: The word certainly --</p><p>IMUS: Yes, OK, all right. Does -- so did they use the movie as a convenient excuse until they could develop all of the facts and find out what really happened? Or as opposed to saying we don't know, which would mean they lied to us.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: So, sort it out for me, start with you, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, they went out as Susan Rice, the U.N. Ambassador on Sunday, she went, did the tour and proclaimed, pretty much, no uncertain terms, that it was all about the movie.</p><p>And which seemed premature and a lot of people said as John McCain said, you know there was a spontaneous demonstration she said, and John McCain said you don't bring RPG's to a spontaneous demonstration.</p><p>And sure enough, it comes out later, Fox News now reporting that there was an al Qaeda guy who was released from Gitmo in 2007.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Who was behind the attacks. And so, it makes you wonder how stupid -- I mean, didn't they know that that would come out? They must have known, or at least should have considered that it might have come out when they put out Susan Rice to say these stupid things.</p><p>And it did come out and now they're backtracking, Jay Carney said, yes, it was an act of terror. And so, they look dead, they shot themselves in the foot --</p><p>IMUS: Well --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Once again.</p><p>IMUS: The president's conduct to foreign policy is laughable and then my guy, the suit dummy --</p><p>MCSHANE: Romney.</p><p>IMUS: His comments in the wake of it were idiotic as well. Shut up until you know something. By the way, just butt out.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, but to mislead the American people --</p><p>IMUS: Or what I said --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Because it would look bad politically, so, you can't --</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Say that the GM is alive and Bin Laden is dead sort of puts a monkey wrench into all that.</p><p>IMUS: I understand.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I mean that's sort of insulting --</p><p>IMUS: That's what I wondered, so --</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, that's what the critics are saying that, you know, they're trying to change -- oh, it's much easier for the administration to come out and say what Susan Rice said.</p><p>It's kind of interesting that she was put out there. Right, the President has been very careful on what he's personally said about this.</p><p>Even yesterday, as you said, he didn't use the word terrorism, it was Jay Carney, his spokesman, not him.</p><p>IMUS: Well, there we are. Neil Cavuto -- I mean, and these are the two guys we've got running.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, it's just -- all right, eight minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Neil Cavuto is coming up, I saw him this morning, when I walked in the building and it was before 5:30 a.m.</p><p>MCSHANE: Wow.</p><p>IMUS: And he looked cute and perky down there in the lobby and he got all exercised hysterical because I had my little oxygen tank with me because I couldn't breathe this morning so --</p><p>MCSHANE: Got to get by.</p><p>IMUS: What is it you're going to do?</p><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: What is it you're going to do? So, all that's going on, and then of course last night's football game, we're going to listen to Warner Wolf and that dope Gunz --</p><p>WOLF: Hey, come on.</p><p>IMUS: Or any of the guys on the pre-game show --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes --</p><p>IMUS: On the NFL network, which by the way is a disaster.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But Rich Eison and that dope Deion Sanders and Michael Irvin and --</p><p>MCSHANE: Marshall Faulk?</p><p>IMUS: Marshall Faulk and that dope, that fat dope -- why is the, why is the name calling necessary?</p><p>MCSHANE: Simply --</p><p>IMUS: Steve Mariucci --</p><p>MCSHANE: It's better --</p><p>IMUS: Every single one of these dopes --</p><p>MCSHANE: Right --</p><p>IMUS: Picked the tail out of Panthers across the board. And the Giants won 36 to 7.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well --</p><p>IMUS: Now what?</p><p>WOLF: I told Gunz I'm going to watch out for these reserves --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, God, you're a disgrace.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On that, no --</p><p>IMUS: What are the Yankees doing?</p><p>WOLF: Now, the Yankees lead by one with 13 to play --</p><p>IMUS: All right --</p><p>WOLF: And they all play, Orioles play losers and so do the Yanks.</p><p>IMUS: Is there any other race any place in the country?</p><p>WOLF: Well, we have a two-game lead in the White Sox and Tigers.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>WOLF: That's really it, because --</p><p>IMUS: OK --</p><p>WOLF: Now the A's are four back --</p><p>IMUS: Yes, fine, we don't need to run that --</p><p>WOLF: That's it --</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, OK.</p><p>IMUS: All right, ten minutes after the hour, let's do some news, Bill Clinton is here, going to talk about -- what are you talking about?</p><p>BARTLETT: Monica Lewinsky's new book.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man, I can't wait to read this, come on, dude.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: You know, Juan Williams is right. I'm probably making too big a deal out of O'Reilly's characterization of Lee Harvey Oswald as a sharpshooter.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know, but it just annoys me, but other than that, the book is great, \"Killing Kennedy\". All right, let's do the news, good morning Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Good morning, i-man. Well, we're keeping an eye on Pakistan this morning because there are protesters on the streets over there.</p><p>One of the things they won't be able to use their cell phones because the government blocked cell service in major cities, worried that phones might be used to detonate bombs.</p><p>And speaking of, you know that movie --</p><p>IMUS: People living in mud huts --</p><p>BARTLETT: I mean is it --</p><p>IMUS: Living in dirt and they've got cell phones.</p><p>MCGUIRK: If these people put this kind of energy into being industrious --</p><p>IMUS: Yes --</p><p>MCGUIRK: And you know, building up their -- you know, it's unbelievable. Just relax, man, go to work.</p><p>IMUS: Like a fool, I'm going to have Gunz and Warner pick the games coming up here.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK, good --</p><p>WOLF: Right.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, today is a national day of protest in Pakistan against that movie, that -- you know, you mentioned produced here in the United States.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: Listened to Ann Romney for a second, she was on a radio show in Iowa asking Republicans to stop attacking her husband.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you say to your fellow Republicans who are --</p><p>ANN ROMNEY, WIFE OF MITT ROMNEY: Stop it. This is hard, you want to try it, get in the ring.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: You want to try it, get in the ring, is what she said.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, well, I mean, I mean, I appreciate her depending her husband.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: She's a nice woman and all that, it's just --</p><p>MCSHANE: That's it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, let's wait until after November before we start with the second guessing with the critics, I mean, not you chief. But I'm talking about some of these supposed Republican allies.</p><p>IMUS: That's right. .</p><p>MCGUIRK: We're in a battle here, come on. Whose side you want?</p><p>MCSHANE: Speaking of which, the polls 47 percent apiece, dead heat in the daily tracking poll from Gallop yesterday, but Romney's problem has been in these swing state polls.</p><p>Another one out from the \"Wall Street Journal\" \"Nbc News\", it's Obama up eight points in Iowa, leading by five points both in Wisconsin and in Colorado.</p><p>Here's the question for you, who do you think had the most watched convention speech? Well, it turns out Joe Biden, the Vice-President. 43.6 million people for what it's worth, President Obama close second followed by Mitt Romney, Bill Clinton and Marco Rubio.</p><p>IMUS: Well, of course, because we thought it was going to be a car wreck.</p><p>RUFINO: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: Absolutely.</p><p>MCSHANE: Tuning in, in case --</p><p>IMUS: Thirteen after the hour, let's do some business news, and here with that is Dagen McDowell.

It's bad enough that the love ick on the blue dress was made public for a while there.</p><p>I even thought they were going to put it on display and this masonian next to Lincoln's stovepipe hat.</p><p>But now, Monica is going to reveal all my sex secrets, like my insatiable appetite for three-way sex. Which isn't what you were thinking is, is it just really?</p><p>I only know three ways of doing it, four, if count missionary, but having somebody else in the picture, that's just sick, unless the extra person is A, a woman and B, hot.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>BARTLETT: But Monica is also going to reveal my fondness for sex toys. OK, one time I used some legos to build a little garage for my weiner.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But it wasn't, you know a butt plug the size of a lava lamp.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But what really hurts is the allegation that she has to do this because she needs to make a living and can't get a job because of me, which is just not true.</p><p>She could get a job tomorrow, in a cigar store --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>BARTLETT: Or better yet, a shoe store because you know, she's real good on her knees.</p><p>IMUS: So, 19 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. From their brand new album, \"Hillbilly Jedi\", Big and Rich. That was a good record.</p><p>And my baby gone.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: You know, I never thought about it, about women's hair thinning. I thought only men got bald until I saw a bald-headed woman.

And the big dawg Bill Clinton was on with your friend Jon Stewart last night and he was boring, he was just flat-out.</p><p>He made Charlie Rose sound like Mad Dog Russo, he was so boring. But, listen to Jon Stewart do his best impersonation of Monica Lewinsky journalistically.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>JON STEWART, COMEDIAN &amp; TELEVISION HOST: Give any good speeches lately or? How was that -- how did that feel at the convention?</p><p>Could you tell that you were crushing it as you were doing it? Did you, did you feel that?</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes and no. But -- because I didn't want to talk down to people, I wanted to explain what I thought was going on.</p><p>STEWART: That's what was so stunning, I think. That's why it was such a bracing speech. The phrase you mentioned earlier about getting the facts right, and they would have -- you would attach numbers to them that were real.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I thought it was a bold choice on your part.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: I mean he's going to have to send his jackets to the cleaners after that, I mean, just figuratively, it was sort of nauseating. But --</p><p>IMUS: What? There was not any --</p><p>MCGUIRK: The way he just -- I mean, did he ask him about the memoir that's coming out? --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, no --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Memoir --</p><p>IMUS: Stewart was jerking his chain.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, he wasn't.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, he was.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I saw it. He was --</p><p>IMUS: He wasn't jerking his chain?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Not at all. He was telling him what a great speech you gave and could you put facts out there, unlike Mitt Romney --</p><p>IMUS: You're telling me Stewart wasn't kidding with that?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, not at all. That was a straight-up journalistic --</p><p>IMUS: Didn't he sound like he was kidding --</p><p>BARTLETT: I mean, I didn't see it, so, I mean, I was there?</p><p>IMUS: He didn't sound like he was kidding?</p><p>POWELL: Little tongue in cheek to me.</p><p>IMUS: That's what he sounded, like a little tongue in cheek. Really?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, absolutely not.</p><p>IMUS: Well, because you're a hater.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, because I actually watched it, I saw it. Now, let's move on here, boss, because the clock is ticking and I know you want to get Mr. Cavuto on.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And we got us a little sex scandal over at \"Good Morning America\".</p><p>IMUS: All right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: You know, locally here in New York City, you have this news anchor on \"Channel 7\", \"Wabc\" Liz Cho.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, my God, that's a home wrecker there.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, excuse me.

I'm going to read from the \"New York Post\" --</p><p>IMUS: I thought she was married.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, she was.</p><p>IMUS: Oh --</p><p>MCGUIRK: This is what the \"New York Post\" page six writes this morning. \"After we revealed yesterday that 41-year-old beauty Cho, the co-anchor of \"Wabc TV\" in New York, split with her husband and moved out of their Yonkers mansion three months ago.</p><p>She insisted through friends that they're just friends.

Well, anyway this is blooming over --</p><p>IMUS: Stuff about praising anchor, no, I don't.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And they're beating the crap out of the \"Today Show\" by the way - -</p><p>IMUS: Not good, I'm happy about that.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: That's all you got?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, I do have another piece of David Letterman clip, busting on Jay Leno and Mitt Romney, but --</p><p>IMUS: No, he's a creep --</p><p>MCGUIRK: We can save it.</p><p>IMUS: Thirty minutes after the hour, and here, Cavuto is next.</p><p>One of Neil's favorite songs.</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network. And now, here is Diane Macedo.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. General Motors is recalling more than 426,000 Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn sedans in the U.S. due to transmission problems. The recall affects vehicles model years 2007 to 2010.</p><p>The automaker says the transmission gear position may not match the gear on the shifter and that could cause the vehicle to move when drivers think they're in park. GM says it's aware of four crashes due to the problem, but no injuries reported as of now.</p><p>Meanwhile, the recall news after General Motors announced it has reached an agreement with the Canadian Autoworkers Union over a labor contract. Under the tentative four year deal, GM will add a third shift to its flex line at its Ontario facility.</p><p>The automaker had planned to shutdown that plant three-shift consolidated line next June, but will operate with at least one line until June of 2014. The CAW continues to negotiate a deal with Chrysler after it already reached one with Ford earlier in the week.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues now after we check the weather with Fox 5 meteorologist, Mike Woods.</p><p>MIKE WOODS, FOX 5 METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, everyone. Looks like we have some wet weather out there, but not a ton of it for the country here. We've got an area of low pressure still rotating around the Great Lakes, but it's bringing showers from the Upper Midwest and Central Mississippi Valley area.</p><p>And then back towards the rest of the Great Lakes over to the east and also a few showers popping up around Florida again, southeast, slightly risky in terms of showers and storms. Tampa, you'll see a few scattered storms and high temp today, 88 degrees.</p><p>And Phoenix, no rain for you, sunny skies with a high of 103 and Seattle partly cloudy skies with a high of 63. Sacramento, California, you've got sunny skies there today with a high of 91, still warm. I'm Mike Woods from Fox 5 in New York.</p><p>IMUS: All right, it's 36 minutes past the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Please welcome to the program, senior vice president, anchor manager, Fox Business News, Fox News Channel, a man who sadly calls himself the financial factor, Neil P. Cavuto. What does the P stand for?</p><p>NEIL P. CAVUTO, FOX BUSINESS: Patrick.</p><p>IMUS: Good morning, Mr. Cavuto.</p><p>CAVUTO: Good morning, Mr. Imus.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>CAVUTO: It was scary bumping into you this morning.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I had my little oxygen tank with me.</p><p>CAVUTO: You kind of looked like Hannibal Lector being driven in on a gurney and I thought, is he up to doing the show today? But here you are, encouragement to all us.</p><p>IMUS: Well, anaerobic, but I recover quickly and I don't need oxygen just to sit around and talk.</p><p>CAVUTO: I admire that.</p><p>IMUS: Happy birthday tomorrow.</p><p>CAVUTO: How did you know that?</p><p>IMUS: It's my job to know those things.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you very much.</p><p>IMUS: So, you like the Vince Gill interview?</p><p>CAVUTO: I liked it very much, I'm a big fan of his and I thought you did a very good job. A lot of people, you know, when you interview stars it's always tough. You do a fawning interview or you do a revealing one particularly like the things about your brother, how tough that is and trying to get a handle on it, very real. I liked it very much.</p><p>IMUS: So I asked you off the air if you liked Romney. Do you?</p><p>CAVUTO: I do, personally I like him a lot.</p><p>IMUS: It doesn't bother you that he's a dope, right?</p><p>CAVUTO: He's not a dope.</p><p>IMUS: OK, he's not a good campaigner, is he?</p><p>CAVUTO: I think that remains to be seen. The election hasn't happened yet.</p><p>IMUS: No, sir. Do you think that these leaked videos, these missteps that they've each made, is going to make a difference when people vote?</p><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p>IMUS: You don't?</p><p>CAVUTO: I do not. I think in the end, it always is the economy. I think that's what-- we could have extenuating circumstances, the Middle East explosion, could have the impact, but almost every U.S. election is decided by the economy.</p><p>How good people feel, how maybe not so good people feel and we're always willing to entertain switching horses mid stream when an incumbent is battling a tough economy, but we've really got to see the other horse.</p><p>I think in 1980 when the polls were similarly tight between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. A lot of people liked Jimmy Carter, frustrated with the economy, but they were more than willing to entertain an alternative and along came Ronald Reagan to appeal to alternative.</p><p>IMUS: How many people vote for the person who they like the best?</p><p>CAVUTO: I think it plays a part.</p><p>IMUS: How big a part?</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I do think it helped George Bush, many polls were done on the debate between he and Al Gore and then later on between he and John Kerry. And I think most people said who won the debates?</p><p>And a lot of them said, particularly in 2004, with John Kerry, who do you like more or relate to more? George Bush. I'm not saying that's always the case, but it does help if people feel you're either more approachable or likeable.</p><p>And I think in 1960 from the television critics later who said that Richard Nixon was sweating and detached and John Kennedy looked relaxed and smooth. These things on some level do connect for people.</p><p>IMUS: Talking with Neil Cavuto -- talking with Neil Cavuto here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. It's 5 until the hour, you know what you ought to do here at Fox?</p><p>CAVUTO: What's that?</p><p>IMUS: An interesting experiment because my wife mentioned this to me.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: She wants to have sex with you, by the way.</p><p>CAVUTO: Who doesn't?</p><p>IMUS: I don't. Wants to have sex with you --</p><p>CAVUTO: And go ahead.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway.</p><p>CAVUTO: Come on, Don, tell me. Go ahead, please.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I forgot --</p><p>CAVUTO: At least say something, you guys.</p><p>IMUS: Here is what you should do.</p><p>CAVUTO: Like an interview by Rainman.</p><p>IMUS: When is the first debate, October 1st?</p><p>CAVUTO: I think the 3rd.</p><p>IMUS: It's the day he hit the home run. Here is what you should do. Please don't interrupt when I'm talking with Mr. Cavuto, Warner. I'll come over there and beat on you like a rented mule. Just kidding. You should get a group of people.</p><p>Frank -- You should do it. Get a group, have them listen to the audio feed and don't let them watch it and have the group just watch it on television and then poll each group to see who won. Who they think won.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's not a bad idea.</p><p>IMUS: It is a good idea isn't it?</p><p>CAVUTO: It's a very good idea.</p><p>IMUS: Because Deirdre said to me -- don't you hate it when guys quote their wives. You know, that means they're so p-whipped.</p><p>CAVUTO: And she's insane for putting up with you.</p><p>IMUS: Absolutely. Because you get distracted who looked and --</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, yes. And history bears that out. I mean, people who, I guess, were listened in to the Nixon-Kennedy debate thought Nixon, and Bush and Al Gore. That was a little more debatable than Kerry and Bush.</p><p>IMUS: Should I call Roger and --</p><p>CAVUTO: Please do, please do. I'm not going to act on this because I actually think the idea is silly.</p><p>IMUS: Do you really?</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. I do.</p><p>IMUS: You do?</p><p>CAVUTO: I think 90 percent of people are going to be watching and not listening.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you're just, I don't know, you're just -- I don't know.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I just, I think in 1960, it would have been a brilliant idea, but last time I checked --</p><p>IMUS: It's a good idea now just to see. It's 18 until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Did you read \"Killing Lincoln?\"</p><p>CAVUTO: I did read it. It's a great book.</p><p>IMUS: But I'll tell you what is a terrific book \"Killing Kennedy.\"</p><p>CAVUTO: I haven't -- I know it's out or will be out, but-- I really enjoyed \"Killing Lincoln\", the way he built it up and x number of days to live and I thought when I first opened it, we know what happened in the end.</p><p>But he didn't do a great job and see what the Kennedy book, but I think he's got -- he could a series on his hands. I don't know how you handle Philmore, getting Philmore, but --</p><p>IMUS: It's enormously entertaining and there's no heavy lifting, not a --</p><p>CAVUTO: I think it's a very good point. A lot of the stories, Brinkley, I love dearly and Harry Truman, 900 pages on and on and all great, but you can make this fun and engaging.</p><p>IMUS: And accessible.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's a way to do it. I didn't see the kids' version that's out but --</p><p>IMUS: That's pretty good, too. It's pretty good, too, so, do you think he writes any of it.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think he does.</p><p>IMUS: What's --</p><p>CAVUTO: -- his show.</p><p>IMUS: That doesn't make any difference.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, it doesn't, but when you say does he write his stuff? Of course, he writes his stuff.</p><p>IMUS: How is that demeaning --</p><p>CAVUTO: You say does he write the book.</p><p>IMUS: As a journalist, I have a --</p><p>CAVUTO: Excuse me? Excuse me.</p><p>IMUS: It's 17 until the hour here in the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Are you a sports fan?</p><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p>IMUS: Not at all.</p><p>CAVUTO: I heard you guys go through the Sunday games. I guess these are football games? Terrific, no offense guns and Warner but --</p><p>IMUS: That's fine, but do you ever watch sports on television?</p><p>CAVUTO: I have the attention span of a gnat. I watch the highlights. I said, why can't the games be like the highlights?</p><p>IMUS: Do you ever watch Sports Center?</p><p>CAVUTO: No.</p><p>IMUS: Where do you get the highlights?</p><p>CAVUTO: Passing around the news or online, but I'm not really -- I'm afraid I'm not really into it.</p><p>IMUS: So, do you watch television?</p><p>CAVUTO: I know this is going to sound elitist, but I really don't. I'm just, it's not --</p><p>IMUS: Mr. Cavuto --</p><p>CAVUTO: I watch you, of course, I mean, that's a staple. Connell and Dagen and flip over --</p><p>IMUS: Mr. Cavuto is on at 4 in the afternoon on the Fox News Channel and 8 p.m. and do you think that --</p><p>CAVUTO: I want to come back at you with anger, but I saw you with the oxygen tank and go lightly no need to be mean.</p><p>IMUS: It's a quarter until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>CAVUTO: This is three times in this hour with this interview, you relay the time. It's always fascinating to me why you do that.</p><p>IMUS: I'm doing a radio program.</p><p>CAVUTO: I know that. I know, but -- like I say there are clocks in those cars, right?</p><p>IMUS: I can stop giving the time.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, more time for me.</p><p>IMUS: Bernie, put a call in to Bob -- anyway do you think Obama is a socialist?</p><p>CAVUTO: No. I think he likes big government. I think he likes more big government and espouses the view much like FDR in 1932, government the only way to get us out of the mess and a lot more people are beholden to the government as a result of that.</p><p>And he's got a pretty good base of people who would vote for him as a result and I think that probably was what Mitt Romney was inelegantly getting at. But we all remember, you know, but FDR got re-elected in a landslide in 36 even though the economy still, still was pretty bad.</p><p>IMUS: As ours does.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And you would think that one of the things that Romney could get some traction and I think, that you asked, I think --</p><p>CAVUTO: Your thoughts are very valuable to me.</p><p>IMUS: I think the day that Romney gets elected, the economy is better just by -- he doesn't have to do anything, do you agree with that?</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you have to do something. You're popping up in a different --</p><p>IMUS: That wasn't the question.</p><p>CAVUTO: You mean, well, it's a stupid point. Sounds like Godzilla, January 20th just by virtue of being Godzilla being in the office because it's not Barack Obama, things are better.</p><p>IMUS: If it makes you feel like a bigger person, which you're --</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, you know, I could lose weight, you will always be evil.</p><p>IMUS: To make me feel bad by calling me a list of names, but don't you think the way the markets would react --</p><p>CAVUTO: It's always fine until --</p><p>IMUS: And the financial community.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: That the things would, people would feel better and I know he has do something, your suit dummy candidate and mine, but wouldn't have to do anything, but just get elected and it would be better. Do you think that's true?</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't, I don't, obviously if the nation turns to the challenger to throw the incumbent out of office. It's hoping what you said. And remember, electing Ronald Reagan in a landslide didn't bring results, in fact, the recession many more years and jobs lost until we had to boom in `82.</p><p>Coming out of that so things take time, I'm not subscribing to the screw that automatically things are better. They're ready to do well if we don't keep what we're doing and stop with a new guy in there. But you have to do stuff.</p><p>You have to put up some initiatives that will change the direction. Ronald Reagan did, and you know, the question would be for Romney administration, if it were to happen, whether it would.</p><p>IMUS: Is there a way now to know -- is there a way for you to know who will win the election?</p><p>CAVUTO: I have no idea.</p><p>IMUS: Do you have a gut sense?</p><p>CAVUTO: I do, but I'm not going to share that with you. I will say this - -</p><p>IMUS: You're really a creep.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's lovely. I only relate this to you. I think I told you this before. When I went to Wisconsin to cover the recall election, polls going into that weekend had dead even. I think it had it dead even and we know at that Walker won by six points.</p><p>Now, I had a theory and I could be very wrong that conservative support is understated in some of the state polls, maybe with unwinding a bit it's beyond the margin of error, but I do think these states apparently Mitt Romney is going to get blown out in, I don't subscribe to that.</p><p>IMUS: You're going to get to the point eventually, right?</p><p>CAVUTO: I just told you. And I think the polls in the battle ground state understate Romney's support.</p><p>IMUS: Hope you're right.</p><p>CAVUTO: And when you say Romney's my man you always say that.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: But then you disparage him.</p><p>IMUS: Keeping it real.</p><p>CAVUTO: And for every wonderful interview like Vince Gill and then you do one like you did with Frank Rich.</p><p>IMUS: My job is to keep it real, right, Bernie?</p><p>CAVUTO: Frank Rich interview, just kept it real.</p><p>IMUS: Keeping it real.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Thank you very much for --</p><p>CAVUTO: This is it?</p><p>IMUS: You were on for 12 minutes.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's 12 minutes of my life. I'm never getting back.</p><p>IMUS: And so does the audience.</p><p>MACEOD: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. Let's take a look at the markets. In Europe, the \"Financial Times\" is reporting that European Union authorities are working with the Spanish government to come up with a bailout plan and unlimited bond buying by the European Central Bank.</p><p>Markets there are now mixed with London down by about 5 points. Paris is up 10 and Frankfort is up about 64. Here in the U.S., we have seen green arrows across the board all morning. Dow futures are up by 56. The S&amp;P is up by about 5 and the Nasdaq is up by 13.</p><p>Now that Apple's iPhone is available, we're also finding out exactly what makes the smartphone work. The repair firm fix it, got one open and chips from Qualcomm, Avago Technologies and Skyworks Solution.</p><p>The iPhone also includes an audio chip made by Cirrus Logic and its gyroscope, which is used to track its orientation was made by ST Microelectronics. Keep an eye on those stocks and those are the companies that didn't participate in the iPhone to see the reaction today.</p><p>The world's biggest retailer is looking to do business in India. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reports Wal-Mart hopes to open its first stores in the country within two years. That move comes after the government last week agreed to allow international supermarket chains to enter India through joint ventures.</p><p>Wal-Mart says it hadn't decided yet where or how many stores it would like to have, but the company expects to continue its current partnerships with barky enterprises of India, a chain of 17 cash and carry stores.</p><p>Here's a look at commodities, oil and gold are up.

Perhaps a different corporate visual metaphor than one encapsulating exposed scrutiny would now be a wiser design choice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple's planned movement into broad new market areas, announced on Monday, and made ever so acceptable by a gushing lineup of A-list celebrities such as Oprah and Steven Spielberg, reveals the company as yet another tech monolith aiming to be our interface point with life.</p><p>Apple's new market-expansion ventures\u00a0this week - games, television and news subscriptions and a credit card - will bring it further into the same controlling space Amazon, Facebook and Google are staking out, where consumers increasingly cede parts of their lives that had remained disparate and uncollated into a single corporate activity and data silo.</p><p>They will see more points at which consumers enter the Apple ecosystem, and more opportunities for scrutiny, analysis, and further market expansions.</p><p>All this is done in the name of access and convenience for consumers, but this masks the effects on consumer autonomy and privacy, as well as the further distancing of the producers of content from the people who consume it, making it more difficult for people or a multitude of businesses to exist independently of tech company control.</p><p>This plan to place more people and more product and service interactions inside the glass box presided over by Apple should worry us all. While some commentators noted Apple would be the privacy champion amongst its big tech rivals, that's only because Apple still manages to get away with presenting itself as tech's privacy and data collection good guy.</p><p>\u00a0On the plus side - at least so far - that data-respecting version of Apple is what we see in North America and Europe, where chief executive Tim Cook has made a point of contrasting how Apple gathers and manages user data with what rivals such as Facebook, Google and Amazon do. And the company is to be lauded on that point.</p><h>Surveillance state </h><p>No doubt this perception will be used as a major selling point for Apple's services as it rolls them out, whatever they may ultimately be, on a timeline that we still mostly don't know, because details were so thin on the ground at the big launch event. However, if you are in a market where a well-developed surveillance state maintains tight control on its population, and the state decides to link access to their market with ceding storage of user data to a state-run company, well, hey: Apple is cool with that. They did just </p><p>that last year in China</p><p>.  </p><p>This so alarmed press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders that they urged journalists who were China-based iCloud users to either change the country associated with their account (which non-Chinese residents can do) or to get off Apple and iCloud.</p><p>Apple's compliance with Chinese state demands was criticised by many human rights and privacy advocacy groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.</p><p>Apple's willingness to compromise elsewhere signals clearly that it does not draw any hard-and-fast privacy line in the sand and is a sharp reminder that its stronger privacy stance in some markets hinges on corporate whim. What Apple does today may not be what Apple does tomorrow.</p><p>\u00a0Which brings us back to the real concern here. Slowly, bit by literal bit, we are handing over elements of our lives that range from banking to entertainment, communication to household management, travel to personal health, media control to advertising - and all the sweeping, sensitive data gathering that that involves, exposing us at the most intimate level - to five companies: Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft.</p><p>As tech companies, all come under less regulation than do companies in many of the sectors they have moved into. Much of what they do, as well as how they do it, and why, remains veiled because oversight lags behind their activities and their technologies. We also fail to see how bizarre it is for, say, Apple to offer a credit card because tech company (over)reach is now normalised.</p><p>Imagine if, say, Mastercard or McDonald's mediated our online searches, the ads we see, and our household thermostats, tracked where we go each day on maps and mobiles, gathered data from our apps, machine-read our emails, and recorded what programmes we watched and music we listened to. All this is just part of some of the daily intake across the Big Five. Instead, we are directed: Look over there! Toward what Spielberg might produce for a streaming service! Or to 3D augmented reality incorporated into maps! Or to ordering pizza by talking to Alexa!</p><p>We, our governments and our regulators need to start paying more attention to the activities of the ringmasters rather than their distracting acts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3841015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRR-VHM1-DYS1-02J6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"823\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The question for Apple is: Will the slew of offerings announced this week be enough to bring new users into its ever-expanding ecosystem, and also keep current consumers, well, consuming?   On Tuesday (Sept. 15), Apple unveiled a slew of watches and services in a bid to give a tailwind to hardware sales and boost its services business.   We saw announcements tied to the Apple Watch Series 6, the Apple Watch SE, bundles tied to Apple One and the Apple Fitness+.   At a high level, the Apple event underscored the convergence of devices and a wide range of services to be consumed over those devices \u2013 centering in this case on health, music and connectivity in general (and some operating system updates).   Perhaps no surprise, in the age of the pandemic, is the health pitch. The Apple Watch can help monitor blood oxygen levels and cardio fitness. But beyond that, it is important to note that Apple seems to be positioning the watch as a standalone lure to consumers. Because now, the (two) new watches need not be connected to iPhones to do what they do.   A new feature called Family Setup can give users of new generations of watches access to phone calls and texting features via the watch \u2013 without being tethered to the phone. Call it a launching pad into the ecosystem, giving simplified hardware everyday functionality that can conceivably be used for cross-selling and upselling.   To get a sense of how Apple might be positioning the Series 6 and Apple Watch SE watches, a feature called Schooltime allows parents to restrict access to apps across the devices \u2013 which would conceivably keep kids from fiddling around while virtual Zoom classes are in session. Virtual money can be loaded onto the watch, which can be spent via Apple Pay .   We note that the Apple Pay feature may be a way to get younger users more adept at using the digital wallet service. It could use the torque. During the fourth quarter of last year, PYMNTS surveyed 1,000 U.S. consumers and found that although 81 percent of adult Americans owned smartphones, just 6 percent used Apple Pay at a physical store five years after the service debuted in 2014.   Apple Pay accounted for only about 1.1 percent of all retail and food services sales, excluding online and auto. The rise in contactless payments has undoubtedly moved the needle a bit, but Apple Pay could hardly be called world-beating. And the rise of contactless payments seems connected to card payments, not necessarily digital wallets.   In at least one other bid to boost payments, the new operating system iOS 14 offers support for App Clips via NFC, which allows iPhone users to take advantage of \u201cmini\u201d apps \u2013 and also enables Apple Pay. That means users don\u2019t have to offer card details when they make purchases, as  NFC World reported .   There was also the launch of Apple\u2019s fitness service, to be accessed through an app, and which serves up workout videos across iPhones and iPads and can be synced to the watch. It\u2019 a shot across at least part of the bow at firms like Peloton , which also offers fitness content, but the similarity and competition end there.   Peloton, of course, has its own ecosystem, tied to its bikes. And the fitness firms, in the midst of the pandemic, may have already scored some of the lowest-hanging fruit by pivoting to in-home classes.   Bundling Up   Apple One got some play yesterday, where three options offer a range of subscriptions spanning news, fitness and music. But here lies a bit of turbulence. Spotify said on Tuesday (Sept. 15) that the bundles are allegedly more evidence of abuse of dominant market position. A Spotify statement  reported by Apple Insider  contended that Apple favors its own services.   The tech giant is, of course, embroiled in a lawsuit with Epic Games over App Store competition (and is being  investigated in the EU over Apple Pay and App Store practices). Apple is pushing its bundling at a time when competition is increasing across media, music and games \u2013 and may get at least some restriction from regulators on how content is displayed and promoted across its digital conduits. It\u2019s also a way to make sure subscribers stick around, even if they don\u2019t consume everything that\u2019s offered (in bundles, \u201cstrong\u201d content can help prop up \u201cweaker\u201d offerings).   In an interview with Karen Webster, Brian Bogosian , CEO at sticky.io, an integrated eCommerce subscription management and recurring billing platform, said that Apple\u2019s continued push into subscriptions is only one example of the allure of subscription eCommerce.   For Apple, the watches, the fitness and the bundles play into a must-have strategy that favors recurring revenues over hardware hits. As we noted earlier this year, Apple said in its most recent earnings report that its services top line was up almost 15 percent year over year, and had met (ahead of schedule) its stated target (outlined back in 2016) of doubling this revenue stream by the close of 2020. Paid accounts, up 30 percent year on year, stand at 550 million.   As Bogosian noted to Webster, the bundles could give a boost to the tech behemoth\u2019s hardware business, spurring \u201cautomatic upgrades to products at a certain period of time, so they don't have to worry as much about the volatility of market acceptance around new releases of products.\u201d   Apple has demonstrated that it knows it must get its consumers into a \u201cset it and forget it,\u201d Big-Tech-as-a-Service mindset. Now comes the hard part: getting there.   Now, about those iPhones\u2026   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    LIVE PYMNTS TV OCTOBER SERIES: POWERING THE DIGITAL SHIFT \u2013 B2B PAYMENTS 2021      Banks, corporates and even regulators now recognize the imperative to modernize \u2014 not just digitize \u2014the infrastructures and workflows that move money and data between businesses domestically and cross-border.

Meanwhile, Apple is on the verge of hitting yet anothermarket milestone i.e. market value of nearly $2 trillion. The company was valued at about $350 billion when Steve Jobs died.Even though over the past decade, Apple hasn't revealed a new product as groundbreaking as the iPhone, the company still has thrived. Cook has overseen the development of devices like the iPhone X and Apple Watch, new services like Apple Music, and research on new frontiers like self-driving cars, and augmented-reality glasses. Apple's market value and Cook's growing net worth reflect the rise of the FAANG stocks. It also comes as Cook and his fellow Big Tech CEOs Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, face antitrust investigations[2] into what their critics characterize as monopolistic powers.

Cook, 59, said in 2015 that he plans to give most of his fortune away and has already gifted million of dollars worth of Apple shares. His wealth could be lower if he\u2019s made other undisclosed charitable gifts.\u201d           Meanwhile, Apple is on the verge of hitting yet another market milestone i.e. market value of nearly $2 trillion. The company was valued at about $350 billion when Steve Jobs died.       Even though over the past decade, Apple hasn\u2019t revealed a new product as groundbreaking as the iPhone, the company still has thrived. Cook has overseen the development of devices like the iPhone X and Apple Watch, new services like Apple Music, and research on new frontiers like self-driving cars, and augmented-reality glasses.    Apple\u2019s market value and Cook\u2019s growing net worth reflect the rise of the FAANG stocks. It also comes as Cook and his fellow Big Tech CEOs Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, face antitrust investigations into what their critics characterize as monopolistic powers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42806904915</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JS-N6F1-F07F-83J6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"286\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>iPhone in Canada Blog</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Sharing Reports Among Regulators</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0Y1Q0E4RjI5RkIwNDMyQTg5NjI4OUM4NzVEMEJBNkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REYyNUNDM0VFRjRGNEFCMEJEODdGMDUyQTJCOEI5NDA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001076</classCode><className>MARKET CAPITALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001631</classCode><className>STOCK INDEXES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CZTI</classCode><className>STOCK PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000971E</classCode><className>PRICE INCREASES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEFE</classCode><className>INDUSTRY SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009QD4</classCode><className>NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLX8</classCode><className>BUSINESS INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001211</classCode><className>NEW PRODUCTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;
